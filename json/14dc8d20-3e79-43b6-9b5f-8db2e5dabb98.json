Just look at it. Thick as my ankle.</p><p>Diana Highwood took her glove and worked it like a fan, chasing the flush from her throat. She was a gentlewoman, born and raised in genteel comfort, if not opulent luxury. From an early age, she\u2019d been marked as the hope of the family. Destined, her mother vowed, to catch a nobleman\u2019s eye.</p><p>But here, in the smithy with Aaron Dawes, all her delicate breeding disintegrated.</p> <p>How could she help staring? The man had wrists as thick as her ankle.</p><p>As always, he wore his sleeves rolled to the elbow, exposing forearms roped with muscle. He pumped the bellows, commanding the flames to dance.</p><p>Broad shoulders stretched his homespun shirt, and a leather apron hung low on his hips. As he removed the glowing bit of metal from the fire and placed it on his anvil, his open collar gaped.</p><p>Diana averted her gaze\u2014but not fast enough. She caught a moment\u2019s glimpse of pure, superheated virility. Sculpted chest muscles, bronzed skin, dark hair . . .</p><p>\u201cBehave yourself,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The words startled her breathless.</p><p>He knows. He knows. He\u2019s realized that refined, perfect, gently bred Miss Highwood comes to the smithy to gawp at his brute manliness. Behave yourself, indeed.</p><p>She felt ridiculous. Ashamed. Exposed.</p><p>And then\u2014suddenly\u2014relieved.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t speaking to her. He was speaking to his work.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Perspiration glistened on his brow. With a steady hand and a low, rich baritone, he finessed the broken clasp. \u201cBe good for me now.\u201d</p> <p>Diana turned her gaze downward, focusing on the floor. Neatly swept and fitted stones paved her half of the smithy, where visitors waited for their work. The ground around the forge was packed with black, smudgy cinders. And the border between the two could not have been more stark, or more meaningful.</p><p>Here was the division between customer and smith. The line between the world of a gentlewoman and a working man\u2019s domain.</p><p>\u201cThere we are,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way.\u201d</p><p>Oh, goodness. She could look away from his thick forearms and his muscled chest. But that voice.</p><p>She gave herself a brisk shake. Time to put a stop to this silliness. She was a grown woman, turning four-and-twenty this year. It was surely no sin to admire Mr. Dawes. He was an admirable man. However, she ought to concentrate on the many reasons that had nothing to do with carnality.</p><p>The Highwoods had come to this seaside village for Diana\u2019s health, but she\u2019d come to think of Spindle Cove as home. During their stay, she\u2019d learned a great deal about rural life. She knew a good village smith was indispensable. He shoed the farmers\u2019 draft horses, and he mended the oarlocks on the fishermen\u2019s boats. When neighbors were ailing, he pulled teeth and set broken bones. The nails struck on his anvil held the whole village together.</p><p>This forge was the glowing, iron heart of Spindle Cove, and Aaron Dawes was its pulse. Strong. Steady. Vital.</p><p>She watched him striking off beats with his hammer. Clang. Clang. Clang.</p> <p>Now her eyes were fused to that forearm again.</p><p>\u201cThis weather,\u201d she said, trying to change the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s been a dreadful March, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He grunted in agreement. \u201cNear a fortnight now without sun.\u201d</p><p>He plunged the heated metal into a waiting bucket. A cloud of steam rose and filled the smithy, curling the short hairs at the nape of her neck.</p><p>\u201cThat should do,\u201d he said, examining the cooled clasp of her necklace. He polished it with a scrap of cloth. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it lasts this time.\u201d</p><p>Diana gave him a nervous smile. \u201cI do seem to have bad luck with it, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the third time it\u2019s broken this year, by my count. You must think my craftsmanship is faulty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she hastened to assure him. \u201cNot at all. You do very good work, Mr. Dawes. I\u2019m just careless, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareless? You?\u201d His gaze locked with hers from across the smithy, dark and intense.</p><p>She caught him looking at her like this sometimes. In church, around the village. She didn\u2019t know what to make of her reaction, but she couldn\u2019t deny it was a thrilling sort of confusion.</p><p>He mopped his brow and neck with a damp cloth, then wiped his hands clean. \u201cIt\u2019s a curious thing, Miss Highwood. You don\u2019t strike me as the clumsy sort.\u201d</p><p>She shifted on her seat, uneasy.</p><p>\u201cAnd of all things,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d think you\u2019d be careful with this.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he threaded the tiny vial back on its chain. In the vial was a tincture of shrubby horsetail. She kept a dose with her at all times, in case of a breathing crisis.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Despite her accelerating pulse, she forced an easy smile. \u201cI should be more cautious. I will be, in the future.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her. \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look flushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Er . . .\u201d</p><p>He walked behind her and placed the chain about her neck, standing close to do the clasp. If she\u2019d been flushed already, now she was enflamed. It was as though he\u2019d soaked all the heat up from the fire, and now he gave it to her. Soothing and melting all her knotted places. Like the heated brick she took to bed when she had her courses.</p><p>Oh, Lord. The last thing she needed right now was thoughts of bed. Much less this big, solid brick of masculinity sharing it.</p><p>\u201cStill don\u2019t know how you managed to smash it like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>By slamming it in a drawer. And finishing the deed with a rock.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, either,\u201d she prevaricated. Her heart thumped wildly in her chest.</p><p>\u201cI could almost believe someone did it on purpose. I know accidents happen. But they don\u2019t usually happen the same way twice.\u201d</p><p>As he fastened the necklace, his fingertips brushed her neck.</p><p>Diana sucked in her breath. She wanted to pretend the touch was an accident. As he\u2019d said, accidents happen.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t happen the same way twice.</p><p>He caressed her neck a second time, his roughened thumb sliding down the soft skin at her nape.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t answer. She couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t think.</p><p>\u201cI wonder about it. Why you come so often. Why every metal latch and clasp and rivet you possess seems to need mending of late.\u201d His voice grew deeper, almost dreamy. \u201cI\u2019ve told myself you\u2019re just bored with this village. With this weather, there\u2019s little else to do.\u201d</p><p>He circled her, running his finger beneath that chain. Branding her with a necklace of his touch.</p><p>\u201cOther times\u201d\u2014she caught a wry note in his voice\u2014\u201cI decide you\u2019ve been sent by the devil to torment me for my sins.\u201d</p><p>He came to stand before her, holding that vial that dangled from her necklace. He pulled gently, and she swayed toward him. Just an inch.</p><p>\u201cAnd then sometimes I think maybe . . . just maybe . . . you\u2019re hoping for something to happen. Something like this.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, staring straight into the notch above his sternum. That shamelessly sensual crossroads of bone and muscle and sinew and skin.</p><p>The heat of him swamped her. She felt . . . It was so very odd, but she felt ticklish. As though every inch of her was exquisitely attuned, anticipating his touch.</p><p>Perhaps he was right.</p><p>Perhaps she had been wanting this.</p><p>He released her necklace. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>She gathered her courage and looked up at him. Outside of social calls and dinner parties, Diana had little experience with men. But if there was one thing her genteel upbringing had taught her, it was how to read an invitation.</p><p>If she gave Mr. Dawes the slightest encouragement . . .</p><p>Oh, heavens. He would kiss her. Those strong, sensual lips would be on hers, and his powerful arms would hold her tight, and there would be no taking the moment back. She would leave with a changed understanding of herself and smears of soot on her best blue frock. In the eyes of the world, she\u2019d be soiled.</p><p>Dirty.</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d The words erupted from her throat, like a geyser of panic. \u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and stepped back at once. \u201cYou should go.\u201d</p><p>She hopped down from the stool and reached for her cloak. The cloak didn\u2019t seem as eager to leave as she was. She wrestled with it, cursing the tangled laces.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure the smithy\u2019s the safest place for you, Miss Highwood.\u201d His manner was easy as he returned to the forge and pumped the bellows. \u201cLots of smoke and steam. Sparks have a tendency to fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time you have something what needs mending, just send it over with one of the rooming house maids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d She made a desperate grab for the door, pulling it open. \u201cGood day, Mr. Dawes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood day, Miss Highwood.\u201d</p><p>She made it a respectable distance down the lane before stopping to press her hand to her chest. Closing her eyes, she inhaled a deep, steady breath.</p><p>Oh, Lord. What a fool she was.</p><p>Damn. Aaron felt like an idiot.</p><p>No, no. Idiot was too kind a word. Idiots were innocent of their mistakes. Aaron knew better. He was a coarse, mutton-brained lout.</p><p>What the devil had he been thinking? He didn\u2019t know what had made him do it. Only that she\u2019d been wearing that china-blue frock with lacy edges\u2014the one that made him want to carry her into a field of wildflowers, lay her down like a picnic blanket, and feast.</p><p>Perhaps it was best this way. She wouldn\u2019t come around to tempt him again\u2014that much was certain.</p><p>Too much of the day remained, and he was too restless for leisure. Lacking an urgent project, he pulled out some thin iron stock and decided to bang out nails. A smith could never have too many nails.</p><p>Again and again, he heated the rod to a glowing yellow, braced it on his anvil, and pounded one end to a tapered point. With an ease born of years of practice, he severed the length in one blow, crushed the flat end to a blunt button, and plunged the finished nail in a waiting bucket of water.</p><p>Then he began again.</p><p>Several hours of mindless, sweaty pounding later, he had a pile of nails large enough to rebuild the village should a mammoth wave wash it all out to sea. And he still hadn\u2019t driven the feel of her skin from his mind.</p><p>So soft. So warm. Scented with dusting powder and her natural sweetness.</p><p>Damn his eyes. Damn all his senses.</p><p>Aaron banked the fire in the forge. He put all his tools away, washed at the pump, and saddled his mare for a ride into the village. He wasn\u2019t usually a hard-drinking man, but tonight he needed a pint or three.</p><p>After tethering his horse on the village green, he made his way through the familiar red-painted door of the Bull and Blossom. He hunkered down on a stool in the nearly empty tavern, stacking his fists on the bar.</p><p>\u201cBe right with you, Mr. Dawes,\u201d the serving girl sang out to him from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d he answered.</p><p>He had all night. No one was waiting for him. No one.</p><p>He lowered his head and banged his brow against the anvil of his stacked fists. Coarse. Mutton-brained. Lout.</p><p>\u201cDawes, you need a woman.\u201d</p><p>Aaron\u2019s head whipped up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Fosbury, the tavern keeper, plunked a tankard of ale on the counter. \u201cI hate to say it. Unhappy bachelors are better for my profits. But you need a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, a woman is not what I need.\u201d He took a long draught of ale.</p><p>\u201cShe came around the forge today, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Aaron lifted the tankard for another sip. \u201cWho did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Highwood.\u201d</p><p>Aaron choked on his ale.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no secret.\u201d Fosbury wiped down the counter. \u201cEver since she showed up in this village, you\u2019ve had eyes for her. Not surprising. You\u2019re a man in your prime, and she\u2019s the prettiest thing to grace Spindle Cove in some time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aaron scrubbed his face with both hands. Curse him, Fosbury had too many things right.</p><p>From the first sight of her, he\u2019d been utterly smitten. He had a weakness for finely wrought things, and by God, Diana Highwood was just so . . . perfect. In any other village, men might sit on these barstools and debate which woman deserved the honor of most comely in town. In this tavern, that debate would begin and end over a single sip of ale. Diana Highwood took the honors, without question. She had the face of an angel. Delicate and beautiful.</p><p>But though her fair looks might have caught his eye, other qualities had snared his heart.</p> <p>It had all started the night they\u2019d spent struggling to save Finn Bright\u2019s life. The youth had lost his foot in an explosion, and he\u2019d been brought to the forge for surgery. Miss Highwood wasn\u2019t a healer or a nurse, but she\u2019d insisted on staying to help. Bringing water, mopping blood, dabbing the sweat of delirium from Finn\u2019s brow.</p><p>That was the night Aaron had learned the truth of Diana Highwood. That her delicacy was only skin deep\u2014but the beauty went all the way through.</p><p>The longer she lived in this village, the more he found in her to admire. She wasn\u2019t only beautiful; she was brave as well. Then determined, intelligent, charitable. By now, she was some sort of paragon in his mind, and Aaron worried that long after she left, he\u2019d be comparing every woman he ever met to her.</p><p>And they\u2019d all fall short.</p><p>He stretched his hand, regarding it in the dim light. The pad of his thumb still burned where he\u2019d brushed a lock of hair from her neck. It felt singed, cinder-kissed. He pressed it against the cool tankard, but it still throbbed, hot and achy.</p> <p>Damn, he was hot and achy everywhere. He\u2019d let this attraction get away from him, and now she was deep under his skin. In his blood, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not for you,\u201d Fosbury said.</p><p>\u201cI know it. I know it well.\u201d And if he\u2019d been harboring any other thoughts, her frantic escape today would have driven them out of his head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the only woman in this village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too. It\u2019s just . . . so long as she\u2019s living here, I can\u2019t seem to take an interest in anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Fosbury leaned close over the counter and lowered his voice. \u201cThe answer could be right under your nose. You don\u2019t have to look far.\u201d</p> <p>The tavern keeper tilted his head in the direction of the serving girl, who\u2019d emerged from the kitchen with a rag to wipe the tables clean. She cast a friendly smile in Aaron\u2019s direction, and he returned the greeting with a nod.</p><p>When she was out of earshot, Aaron muttered, \u201cYou want me to court Pauline Simms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d make you a good wife. Hardworking, clever with sums. She\u2019s grown up well, too.\u201d Fosbury rapped the countertop with his knuckles, then drifted away. \u201cThink about it.\u201d</p><p>Under the guise of stretching his neck, Aaron had another look at the girl.</p><p>He thought about it.</p><p>Fosbury was right. Pauline Simms was the sort of woman he ought to set his sights on. She was one of his kind. Working class, the daughter of a farmer. As Fosbury said, she was quick with her hands and her wits. She\u2019d be a help to any man with a trade. Admittedly, she had a few rough edges, but nothing some care and time wouldn\u2019t smooth.</p><p>As he watched, she tipped over a decorative plate, muttering, \u201cBollocks.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. But even though they were only four years apart in age, and even though she\u2019d long grown into a woman\u2014a pretty one, at that\u2014Aaron couldn\u2019t look at Pauline Simms without seeing the gap-toothed, freckled girl who\u2019d grown up a year behind his own sister.</p> <p>That was the problem with a village this small. Every available woman felt like a sister to him. Or maybe it was his own circumstances that had permanently cast him in the big-brother role.</p><p>When his father had died ten years ago, slumped over the anvil from a heart attack, it didn\u2019t matter that Aaron was barely seventeen. He\u2019d needed to become the man of the family, and quick. He\u2019d taken over the forge, working hard to support his mother and sisters.</p><p>When Spindle Cove became a retreat for well-bred young ladies, some of the other men had groused about the village being overrun . . . but it suited Aaron fine. By then, both his sisters had married, and they and his mother had moved away. So he liked having the visiting young ladies around. He mended their locks and buckles; they purchased the silver and copper trinkets he made in his spare time. It was like having a flock of little sisters to replace the ones he so sorely missed.</p><p>Except for Diana Highwood.</p><p>He\u2019d never felt brotherly toward her.</p><p>He drained his ale. It wasn\u2019t strong enough. \u201cPauline?\u201d</p><p>She looked up from mopping a table clean. \u201cYes, Mr. Dawes? Anythin\u2019 else you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me a whiskey, will you?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>As was their habit, all the ladies residing in the Queen\u2019s Ruby rooming house gathered in the parlor after dinner. A roaring fire kept the chill at bay.</p><p>Even now, hours after leaving the forge, Diana was still out-of-sorts. The bit of needlework she\u2019d been working on wouldn\u2019t come out right, and she\u2019d lost patience with it.</p><p>She\u2019d lost patience with herself.</p><p>She\u2019d spent the better part of two years girlishly infatuated with Aaron Dawes, all the while trusting nothing could come of it. He\u2019d mended every scrap of metal she possessed\u2014sometimes two or three times\u2014showing her nothing but neighborly patience.</p><p>Until today. Today, he\u2019d shown her something much more.</p><p>And she\u2019d panicked and fled. Not even politely, but as if he were an ogre. She was certain he\u2019d been wounded by her hasty retreat.</p><p>Now she\u2019d have to avoid him for as long as she remained in the village. How unbearably awkward.</p><p>She gave up on stitching and cast a glance out the window. Through the dark and wet, she saw a familiar black mare grazing on the village green.</p><p>He must be at the tavern tonight.</p><p>\u201cThis dratted rain,\u201d her sister Charlotte moaned. \u201cIt\u2019s setting us all on edge. Two weeks now with no country walks, no gardening, no romps through the castle ruins. No amusement at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind rain.\u201d This came from Miss Bertram, a young lady new in Spindle Cove this spring. \u201cI always loved spending rainy days with Mr. Evermoore.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stifled a giggle.</p><p>Diana gave her sister a pleading look. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t make fun.</p><p>Spindle Cove was a haven for odd, unconventional, and misunderstood young ladies. But even among misfits, Miss Bertram didn\u2019t quite mix. She was hard to know\u2014mostly because she had nothing to say that didn\u2019t involve her relationship with this mysterious rogue, Mr. Evermoore.</p><p>\u201cMy parents didn\u2019t approve of Mr. Evermoore,\u201d Miss Bertram went on. Her dark eyebrows stood out like bold punctuation on an otherwise unremarkable face. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand our attachment. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, you know.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte giggled again.</p><p>Miss Bertram\u2019s dark eyebrows gathered in a wounded line. \u201cNo one understands. No one.\u201d She lifted her book before her face and turned a page with a snap.</p><p>Charlotte buried her face in her hands and convulsed with silent laughter.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Diana whispered. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t poke fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho needs to poke it? She offers it up so readily.\u201d Charlotte mimicked in a high whisper, \u201cOh, Mr. Evermoore. No one understands our love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hardly the first young woman to lose her head over an unsuitable man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about an imaginary one? I\u2019d wager anything that Mr. Evermoore is Mr. Never-Was. She just wants to impress us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to show her kindness.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte said lightly, \u201cThat\u2019s the lovely thing about being your sister, Diana. You\u2019re kind enough for us both.\u201d</p><p>Diana felt a twinge of guilt. She hadn\u2019t treated Mr. Dawes very kindly today. In her agitation, she jabbed at the fabric and pricked her finger. \u201cDrat.\u201d</p><p>She scouted her immediate surroundings for her thimble. It wasn\u2019t in her sewing basket, nor caught in the folds of her skirt. \u201cHave you seen my thimble, Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When did you have it last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon, I think. When we went to the Bull and Blossom for tea. I\u2019m sure it was in my kit, but I can\u2019t find it now.\u201d</p><p>Before they could expand their search, the door creaked open, admitting a sharp blast of icy wind. Their visitor appeared in the entry, throwing back her hood to reveal a shock of white-blond hair.</p><p>Sally Bright shook off her damp cloak and hung it on a hook. Her cheeks were pink. \u201cI brought over the post. It was dreadful late today on account of the muddy roads, and I couldn\u2019t wait for you ladies to come collect it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Diana smiled to herself. Together with her brothers, Sally kept the All Things shop, and she was the biggest gossip in the village. If she\u2019d taken the trouble to bring over the post, that must mean there was something of interest in it.</p><p>Something she couldn\u2019t steam open, read, and reseal with no one the wiser.</p><p>Sure enough, Sally held out a packet tied with string. \u201cLook. It\u2019s a lovely great package from our dear Mrs. Thorne. And it\u2019s addressed to all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething from Kate?\u201d Charlotte leaped to take the packet and wrestle with the strings. \u201cOh, how wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Kate Taylor had been the village music tutor until last summer, when she\u2019d married Corporal Thorne\u2014now Captain Thorne\u2014and moved away to follow his rising career. Though everyone in Spindle Cove was happy for them, Kate\u2019s lively spirit and melodies were sorely missed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a packet of handwritten booklets,\u201d Charlotte said, sorting the contents. \u201cAnd a letter. I suppose I should read it first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAloud, if you will,\u201d said Sally.</p><p>All the ladies gathered close.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s eyes widened as she scanned the page. \u201cShe sends us all greetings from Ambervale.\u201d</p><p>This news was met with a general murmur of excitement.</p><p>Ambervale was the estate of the eccentric Gramercy family, headed by the Marquess of Drewe. Kate was the Gramercys\u2019 cousin by some tenuous, and rather scandalous, connection. Nevertheless, they\u2019d welcomed her to the fold . . . and now into their house, which was situated just a few hours away.</p><p>\u201cI hope this means she\u2019s coming to visit,\u201d Diana said.</p><p>\u201cEven better,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cLord Drewe is inviting us to visit them. All of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ball!\u201d Mama cried. \u201cOh, I knew it. I knew Lord Drewe would want another chance at you, Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I\u2019m sure this means nothing of the sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does! Such a handsome, elegant man. The two of you made a striking couple. Everyone could see it.\u201d</p><p>Not again. When the Gramercys had been in Spindle Cove last summer, Mama had made the most embarrassing remarks to poor Lord Drewe, always angling for a match between him and Diana.</p><p>Charlotte gave them all a superior look. \u201cShall I read the letter, or would you prefer to spend the evening guessing at its contents?\u201d</p><p>Mama closed her mouth and sat quietly.</p><p>\u201cShe writes, \u2018Captain Thorne and I are guests at Ambervale for the month. Thus far, it has rained every day. I can only imagine that you are enduring the same tiresome weather in Spindle Cove. My dear cousins, Lady Harriet and Lady Lark, have concocted the enclosed scheme.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cA scheme?\u201d Mama echoed. \u201cWhat sort of invitation is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Since Lord Drewe decided dancing and cards would be poor form during Lent, the ladies devised a theatrical.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Miss Bertram perked with interest. \u201cMr. Evermoore is very fond of the theater.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlotte read on, summarizing for the group. \u201cIt\u2019s a command performance, and we are the players. On Thursday next, Lord Drewe will send his carriages to convey the Spindle Cove ladies to Ambervale. We must arrive prepared to present the enclosed play, which Lady Harriet believes will have unique devotional meaning for the season.\u201d</p><p>Diana reached for one of the booklets, reading the title aloud. \u201c \u2019Doomed by Virtue: The life and death of St. Ursula.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Mama clucked her tongue. \u201cThat Lady Harriet is very strange.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s brilliant,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cWhat other play is going to have a dozen female parts? All those handmaidens. And no one can complain that such an amusement is improper. Our cathedral is named for St. Ursula, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to be busy with costumes and such,\u201d Sally said, happy at the prospect of imminent sales. \u201cI\u2019ll open the shop early tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The mood in the room brightened as copies of the play were passed around and plans for rehearsals, costumes, and props volleyed back and forth.</p><p>Diana had to agree with her sister. Lady Harriet was brilliant. This was what they all needed\u2014a source of excitement for the coming week, and an outing to look forward to. A diversion. Perhaps it would take her mind off Mr. Dawes.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Diana must be Ursula.\u201d</p> <p>Diana startled. \u201cWhy must I be Ursula?\u201d She had been hoping for the most minor of the handmaiden roles.</p><p>Sally lifted one shoulder in an isn\u2019t-it-obvious shrug. \u201cPure. Beautiful. Saintly. That\u2019s you, Miss Highwood, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>No, Diana wanted to object. No, it isn\u2019t. You\u2019re looking at a woman who ogled a man\u2019s brawny forearms this afternoon. And ran from his kiss out of cowardice, not virtue.</p><p>For the first time since the announcement of this theatrical scheme, her mother showed genuine enthusiasm. \u201cYes, Diana must be Ursula. With Lord Drewe playing the role of her bridegroom. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Diana pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cMama, you do understand how this story ends? How Ursula achieved her sainthood? She is beheaded by Huns and dies a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Charlotte leafed through the play. \u201cBut then, so do her handmaidens. They all die virgins.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere, see? At least you\u2019ll be the leading virgin,\u201d Mama said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll have the best costume. A bridal costume. That will set Drewe\u2019s mind turning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell you, it won\u2019t.\u201d In an attempt to end the conversation, Diana renewed her search for her thimble. Where could it have gone?</p><p>With a smug harrumph, Mama propped her feet on a low stool and settled her petticoats. \u201cYou are meant to be a nobleman\u2019s wife, Diana. I have always known it. My intuition\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, but your intuition must be flawed,\u201d Diana replied, peering under a chair. \u201cYou\u2019ve been predicting my lofty match for years. During that time, no fewer than three unmarried noblemen have resided in this village. None of them expressed the slightest desire to wed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you did not encourage them! If you fancy a gentleman, you must let him know. Not in words, of course, but in the language of female subtleties.\u201d</p><p>Female subtleties? Mama possessed all the subtleties of an elephant on parade. She brazenly thrust Diana into the path of every available gentleman.</p><p>Meanwhile, the one man Diana found attractive wasn\u2019t a gentleman at all but the village blacksmith. And apparently subtleties weren\u2019t her strong point, because he\u2019d seen right through her.</p><p>Aaron Dawes could tell her thoughts weren\u2019t saintly.</p> <p>But he\u2019d wanted to kiss her anyway.</p><p>She glanced out the window again. His mare was still outside the tavern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not unfeeling, Mama. Merely careful. You know I\u2019ve had to be.\u201d</p><p>She touched a hand to the chain around her neck and the small bottle of tincture hanging there. It was her talisman. The medicine inside was meant to help her in a breathing crisis. She\u2019d suffered from asthma ever since she was a small girl.</p><p>For most young people, tantrums and tears and wild whoops of joy were all normal parts of childhood. Not so in Diana\u2019s case. Not only had she been kept inside, prevented from running and playing and stomping through the snow, but she\u2019d also been schooled to temper her feelings. No outbursts of any kind.</p><p>Emotions were too dangerous.</p><p>Charlotte settled next to her, crushing into the same chair and fondly stroking Diana\u2019s shoulder. She murmured, \u201cYou know how I hate to agree with Mama, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s entirely wrong. You should be Ursula. And flirt with Lord Drewe if you feel like it. This is your time to take the lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy time to be a martyred medieval virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour time to do whatever you please. You know what Susanna said last year about your asthma. It isn\u2019t coming back. And if you don\u2019t need to worry about dying any longer . . . don\u2019t you want to start living?\u201d</p><p>She pushed a copy of the play into Diana\u2019s hand. \u201cHere. Take whatever role you choose. Except Cordula. I want to be Cordula. She gets the most gory execution.\u201d</p><p>Diana stared at the play for a moment. Then she handed the folio back at her sister. \u201cNot now. I . . . I think I\u2019ve remembered where I left my thimble.\u201d She rose from the chair.</p><p>\u201cReally? Where?\u201d</p><p>Diana went to fetch her cloak from a peg by the door. \u201cAt the Bull and Blossom. I\u2019ll just run over to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the rain!\u201d her mother called.</p><p>Diana closed the door on her mother\u2019s objection and dashed outside.</p><p>Charlotte was right. Now that her health had mended, Diana needn\u2019t fear her own emotions any longer.</p><p>She did want to start living. And she was going to start tonight.</p><p>Aaron told himself his second drink would be the last.</p><p>And then he ordered one more.</p><p>Fosbury had already sent Pauline home for the evening, and the tavern keeper yawned as he slid the refilled tumbler across the bar.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, take your time with it.\u201d Fosbury knotted his apron at the waist. \u201cI\u2019ve some yeast dough to start for tomorrow\u2019s bread. Give a shout if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared into the kitchen, whistling as he went.</p><p>Aaron had just grown accustomed to his comfortable pocket of quiet when the creak of the door ripped it open again. He turned his head, expecting to see one of the fishermen or farmers come in for a late pint.</p><p>What he saw nearly knocked him off his stool.</p><p>Diana Highwood.</p><p>She rushed through the door, slammed it closed, then stopped dead in her paces. Staring at him.</p><p>Aaron didn\u2019t know what to say, but it seemed she was waiting to hear something. He finally settled on \u201cGood evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d</p><p>Another long, uncomfortable pause.</p><p>She looked at the empty stool beside his. \u201cMight I join you?\u201d</p><p>Bemused, he waved a hand in invitation.</p><p>She approached the bar and settled on the seat, daintily arranging her skirts.</p><p>Aaron lifted his drink, stealing glimpses at her out of the corner of his eye. He\u2019d spent a great many stolen moments admiring her, but tonight something was different.</p><p>She was different. He couldn\u2019t look at her tonight and see a paragon up on a pedestal. She was a disheveled girl sitting on a barstool. Damp from the rain, cheeks flushed, wisps of flaxen hair matted to her brow. She looked impulsive. Sensual.</p><p>More beautiful than ever.</p><p>Between her intoxicating looks and the fact that he was on his third whiskey, he was addled. He didn\u2019t know what she was doing here, but so long as she was sitting next to him, he was going to stare. He propped his elbow on the bar and drank in every detail of her rain-misted face, savoring.</p><p>Her gaze fell to his tumbler of whiskey. \u201cYou\u2019re having a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the tumbler and stared into it. \u201cIs it brandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could get the words out, she\u2019d lifted the glass to her lips and tossed back half the contents in one swallow.</p><p>\u201c . . . whiskey.\u201d</p><p>She set it down. Stared at it, wide-eyed. Coughed. \u201cOh. So it is. Goodness.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s pause, she lifted the tumbler again.</p><p>This time, he acted. He grasped her slender wrist, cutting her draught short. \u201cMiss Highwood, you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think I should. I think this is exactly what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean my asthma?\u201d She set the tumbler down, and he released her wrist. \u201cMy asthma hasn\u2019t troubled me in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it has. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here in Spindle Cove.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a breathing crisis since the one you witnessed here in this tavern. That was two summers ago. Susanna consulted with physicians in London, and she thinks I\u2019ve outgrown it. People do, she said. Apparently, I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m cured.\u201d</p><p>She was cured? Aaron was confused. This didn\u2019t make any sense. Her breathing troubles were the reason the Highwoods had moved to this village\u2014the sea air was beneficial to her lungs.</p><p>She fidgeted with the necklace he\u2019d mended just that day\u2014the one with the vial of precious tincture dangling from the chain. \u201cI don\u2019t even need it anymore. I know in my soul, I don\u2019t. I only wear it out of habit.\u201d Her blue eyes met his. \u201cAnd because you made it.\u201d</p><p>Her confession was like a punch to the jaw. It came out of nowhere and set his head spinning.</p><p>The whiskey was starting to hit her, too. He could tell from the glassy sheen in her eyes and the unsteady motions of her hands. But mostly, by the ridiculous words spouting from her lips.</p><p>He tossed a few coins on the bar and stood, putting a hand under her elbow to help her to her feet, too. \u201cCome. I\u2019ll walk you back to the rooming house.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a chance to object, tucking her arm through his in a way that he hoped wouldn\u2019t look improper to anyone who might happen to see.</p><p>\u201cYou were right today,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI\u2019m not clumsy.\u201d</p><p>No sooner had she said it than she stumbled over the doorstep.</p><p>\u201cNot usually.\u201d She giggled.</p><p>Giggled? He didn\u2019t remember ever hearing Diana Highwood giggle.</p><p>\u201cI broke the necklace on purpose, just so you\u2019d have to mend it. So I could watch you mend it.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s dishonest of me, isn\u2019t it? Why would I do that? Lie to you, lie to myself.\u201d</p><p>He herded her across the lane and onto the village green. It was muddy, but the shortest route. Getting her home as quickly as possible seemed his best strategy.</p><p>\u201cMiss Highwood, you need to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to rest. I\u2019m cured. I\u2019m perfectly well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, it\u2019s late. And wet. You need to be getting back to the rooming house before your mother and sister worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She lifted a hand to her temple. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go back to the rooming house. I want . . .\u201d Her face scrunched up, and her speech gained in rapidity what it lost in coherence. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know what I want. That\u2019s the problem. All my life, I\u2019ve been discouraged from wanting anything. I couldn\u2019t risk Minerva\u2019s love of debate, or Charlotte\u2019s exuberance, or even Mama\u2019s nerves. I had to be calm. Delicate, cool, serene Diana. That\u2019s been me, always. No wild passions. No adventurous dreams. It seemed silly to plan for the future. For all I knew, I wouldn\u2019t live to see it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like this talk of her dying. \u201cBut you said you\u2019re cured now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then tonight . . .\u201d Her voice broke as she gestured at the Queen\u2019s Ruby. \u201cTonight, my sister asked me, Don\u2019t I want to start living? And I realized I don\u2019t even know what I want from life. I know what my mother wants for me. I know what everyone else expects. But what do I truly desire?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Excellent question. Aaron waited for the answer.</p><p>Her hand pressed to her chest. \u201cDo I want to have a season in London and marry a lord? Do I want to stay here in the village and become a permanent spinster? Do I want to join a circus? I don\u2019t know, Mr. Dawes. I don\u2019t know, and it terrifies me. All those years of setting aside my emotions. My lungs are healed, but at what cost? I am a stranger to my own heart.\u201d</p><p>Raindrops spotted her face, like dew on petals. Damn, this was torture. He wanted to comfort or guard her, but he didn\u2019t know how. She wasn\u2019t his to tend.</p> <p>He pulled her under the branches of a chestnut tree. The least he could do was shield her from the rain.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing I feel absolutely certain of,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was, he vowed that she would have it.</p><p>At last she\u2019d shaken off the manacles clapped on her\u2014the restraints of illness and her mother\u2019s expectations. Good. Good for her. She deserved to have the things she desired.</p> <p>\u201cThis afternoon.\u201d She drew close. \u201cI wanted you to kiss me. I wanted it more than I can remember wanting anything in my life.\u201d</p><p>With that, she tilted her face to his.</p><p>And closed her eyes.</p><p>Aaron stared down at her, watching the white puffs of her breath as it left her lips. He could taste them. Little clouds of whiskey.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open. \u201cDidn\u2019t . . . didn\u2019t you want to kiss me, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you? We\u2019re alone. No one ever has to know.\u201d</p><p>He snorted at that last. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to keep a secret in this village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve been keeping all sorts of secrets for years. For example, sometimes I think, very hard, about how you\u2019d look without your shirt. You never would have guessed that, would you? No one would.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help his startled laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd I gaze at your hair.\u201d She lifted a hand, and her ungloved fingers caught a lock of his hair. \u201cIt gets long sometimes, all the way to your collar. And then one day, it will be short again. I always wonder who you\u2019ve been to see.\u201d</p><p>She was half drunk, more than a little overwrought . . . but her words tapped a deep well of curiosity. He\u2019d always known there was more to her than the pretty face everyone admired. He\u2019d known her to possess courage and a good heart. But now, he caught glimmers of other qualities. Sensuality. Jealousy. A sly sense of humor.</p><p>This was an entirely new Diana Highwood. A real one. And she was with him, right now, in the rain and dark.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you kiss me?\u201d she whispered, sidling close. \u201cJust the once?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, Miss Highwood, I\u2019m not interested in kissing you just the once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her face fell.</p><p>He propped one finger under her chin, tilting her face back up. \u201cIf I were to kiss you, once wouldn\u2019t be enough. I\u2019d want to kiss you many times. In lots of places.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew wide. \u201cOh. I . . . I see.\u201d</p><p>He doubted she did see. She couldn\u2019t even imagine. A few fingers of whiskey couldn\u2019t provide that much education. The carnal images in his mind could shock the silk from her stockings.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201cI know you\u2019ve been living in some sort of cage. And tonight, it seems you learned you\u2019ve been holding the key all along. You deserve a bit of rebellion, but I can\u2019t be it. I can\u2019t be the man you wake up regretting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen make the kiss good. So I won\u2019t have regrets.\u201d Smiling, she slid her arms around his neck. Her weight pitched forward.</p><p>Jesus. She could barely stay on her feet. Which, of course, meant her body was all pressed up against his. Fortunately, her woolen cloak was as thick as a horse blanket.</p><p>\u201cMiss Highwood . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Diana.\u201d She let her head fall forward, nestling into his coat.</p><p>\u201cDiana.\u201d Until he spoke the name aloud, he hadn\u2019t known how deeply he\u2019d wanted to call her that. Diana, Diana.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so strong,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAnd warm. You smell like soap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiana, I know you. We\u2019ve lived in the same small village for almost two years, and we\u2019ve come through a few trials together. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve paid attention. I won\u2019t deny I\u2019ve wanted this, but not this way. You\u2019re confused, upset, and more than a little drunk. This\u201d\u2014he put an arm about her, steadying her\u2014\u201ccan\u2019t happen tonight.\u201d</p><p>She clung to him, her face stubbornly buried in his coat. He embraced her, trying to keep out the chill. Not entirely selfless valiance on his part. He loved the feel of her in his arms.</p><p>He bent his head and murmured in her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll take you home now.\u201d</p><p>She made a whimper of protest.</p><p>\u201cNo, Diana. It has to be now. Else I\u2019ll be tempted to bring you home with me instead, and then you\u2019d be stuck. All those choices you\u2019ve glimpsed tonight would disappear. Ruined, and forced to marry a craftsman? You don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Just hugged him tight.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want that,\u201d he repeated more firmly.</p><p>Or did she?</p><p>She was silent for a few moments, which his heart stretched into hopeful lifetimes.</p><p>And then she gave her answer\u2014a soft, unmistakable snore.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>The next morning, Diana woke with all sorts of regrets. They were stabbing her straight through the eyes, those regrets. Her pounding head felt like . . .</p><p>Like a blacksmith\u2019s anvil.</p><p>She groaned, putting a hand to her eyes. She had a hazy memory of coming in through the rooming house door, waving a brief good night to her mother and sister, then stumbling up to her bed. Unfortunately, her memories of throwing herself at Aaron Dawes were all too clear.</p><p>Oh, the humiliation. What he must think of her.</p><p>She pulled the coverlet up over her head, turning to bury her face in the pillow. A mistake. She couldn\u2019t hide from the memory here. As she pressed her face to the mattress, recollections of last night\u2019s embrace assailed her. His warmth, his solid strength. His honorable treatment of her when she\u2019d cast all her good breeding in the mud at his feet.</p><p>Her head throbbed. The rest of her ached with a fierce, hopeless yearning.</p><p>\u201cDiana?\u201d Charlotte rapped on the door. \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>No. No, I\u2019m not well. I am very poorly in the head. And in the heart. Kindly go away.</p><p>\u201cThe rain\u2019s let up,\u201d Charlotte said, opening the door a crack. \u201cMama wants to pay a call at Summerfield. Will you join us?\u201d</p><p>Diana was tempted to stay abed and plead headache. She wouldn\u2019t even need to exaggerate. But if there was one thing she was proud of doing last night, it was deciding that she wouldn\u2019t be defined by \u201cdelicate health\u201d any longer.</p><p>She threw back the coverlet. \u201cI\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>She rose from bed, dressed, choked down a bit of tea and toast, and donned her sturdiest shoes. Perhaps if she walked far enough, she would leave this feeling of mortification behind.</p><p>The walk to Summerfield did loosen some of the knots in her stomach. And they all enjoyed their brief visit with Sir Lewis Finch, who told them the latest news of his granddaughter. By the time they began their walk home, the sky had lightened noticeably. Diana could almost forget the embarrassment of last night.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cHow did it go last night?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>Diana stumbled over a rock. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour thimble. Did you find it at the Bull and Blossom?\u201d</p><p>The thimble. Diana shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. It\u2019s just a thimble. Thimbles go missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut just this morning, Mrs. Nichols was missing her ink bottle, too. It\u2019s a mystery.\u201d</p><p>Diana smiled. Charlotte\u2019s imagination always led her to see more excitement than was truly there. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d Mama exclaimed, stopping in the lane. \u201cOh, this cannot be borne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe disappearance of my thimble, a tragedy? I think I can survive it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, look.\u201d Mama gestured toward the sky, where the thick blanket of clouds had parted to reveal a patch of blue\u2014and within it, the bright, cheery face of the sun. \u201cThe sun is out. Oh, this is dreadful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreadful?\u201d Charlotte laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s our first sunshine in a fortnight. It\u2019s marvelous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is dreadful. Because your sister left the rooming house with only her cloak and no proper bonnet.\u201d She hurried to Diana\u2019s side. \u201cTen minutes of this, and she will freckle. Oh, and less than a week before our invitation to Ambervale. What will Lord Drewe think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he notices\u2014which I doubt he will\u2014he will think I\u2019ve been in the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d She tugged at the hood of Diana\u2019s cloak, drawing it up as far as it would go. \u201cKeep your head down, Diana. Just look at your feet.\u201d</p><p>Diana lifted her head, letting her hood fall back. \u201cBut then how will I see where I\u2019m going? I might fall on my face. I should think Lord Drewe would take more notice of bruises than he would freckles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHead down, I say.\u201d Mama yanked the hood up again.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Diana thrust it back. \u201cMama, you\u2019re being ridiculous. This is a beautiful morning. I mean to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>She braced herself for another round of Tug-o\u2019-Hood, but Mama didn\u2019t care to play. She was distracted by the sounds of hoofbeats and carriage wheels and turned to peer down the lane.</p><p>\u201cThere is Mr. Keane with his curricle. He will save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave me? I survived years of asthma. I don\u2019t believe freckles are a terminal condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHead down,\u201d she snapped. As the curricle drew near, she lifted one arm and waved to him with her handkerchief, like a drowning sailor in need of a rope. \u201cMr. Keane! Oh, Mr. Keane, do help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t trouble him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is the vicar. He ought to do a good deed.\u201d</p><p>The curricle rolled to a halt in the lane. What with the strong sun and the harsh shadows, it was hard to peer into the covered bench seat\u2014but the driver didn\u2019t seem to be the vicar. This man was rather . . . larger.</p><p>\u201cIs there some problem?\u201d he asked in a dark, all-too-familiar baritone.</p><p>Oh no. No. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>What wretched luck. Diana took her mother\u2019s advice. She drew her hood up and stared at her boots.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Mr. Dawes,\u201d her mother said, her tone wary. \u201cWhat are you doing with Mr. Keane\u2019s curricle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Diana hissed. Good Lord, she made it sound as if he\u2019d stolen the thing.</p><p>\u201cAnd good morning to you, Mrs. Highwood,\u201d Mr. Dawes answered patiently. Out of the corner of her eye, Diana saw him tip his cap. \u201cMiss Charlotte. Miss Highwood.\u201d</p><p>She felt his gaze on her. Now it didn\u2019t matter if she stayed out of the sun. A blush this furious would surely stain her cheeks for a month.</p><p>\u201cMr. Keane asked me to mend the axle,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019m out for a short drive to test the repair before I return it. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>As she listened to her mother carry on about the tragedy of sunshine and the need to keep her daughter\u2019s complexion unmarred for Lord Drewe, Diana squirmed with shame.</p><p>\u201cSurely you can drive her back to the rooming house,\u201d Mama said. \u201cI know it\u2019s a liberty, as you are a hired man. But I daresay I can grant permission in Mr. Keane\u2019s stead. It\u2019s what he would do, as a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Mother!</p><p>In how many ways could she insult him? Mr. Dawes was not a \u201chired man.\u201d He was a skilled craftsman and artisan, and everyone in the village\u2014Mr. Keane included\u2014respected him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Diana had to look up now. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let us trouble you, Mr. Dawes. I\u2019m perfectly fine walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly fine!\u201d her mother squawked. \u201cYou\u2019ll be perfectly crisped.\u201d</p><p>She caught his gaze and tried to send an apologetic look. Forgive her. And me.</p> <p>His expression was impossible to read. \u201cI\u2019d be glad to give Miss Highwood a ride into the village. I\u2019m going there anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is very good of you,\u201d her mother said. \u201cWhen I see him, I will be sure to speak highly of your service to Mr. Keane. Perhaps there will be a shilling in it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery kind of you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Dawes alighted from the curricle, adjusted the folding hood for maximum shade, then offered his hand to help Diana. Despite the awkwardness of the situation, she took a thrill from the feel of his hand dwarfing hers and the easy strength with which he boosted her onto the seat.</p><p>When he joined her, she pressed herself all the way to the opposite side.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you back at the Queen\u2019s Ruby,\u201d Mother said. \u201cDon\u2019t fret about me walking. I will be fine. Even at my age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will be,\u201d Diana muttered.</p><p>As Mr. Dawes flicked the reins and set the curricle in motion, Diana slunk down in her corner of the seat.</p><p>She learned something new as they rattled down the lane.</p><p>Awkwardness wasn\u2019t characterized by silence. Oh, no\u2014awkwardness had a symphony all its own. The thump of an erratic heartbeat, contrasting with the steady squelch of hooves on packed mud. The roar of a thousand unspoken words piled up in one\u2019s throat, all clamoring to get loose. The sound of fence posts whooshing past\u2014each one brought them closer to the village, and each one felt like a stinging lash of rebuke. Another opportunity missed.</p><p>Frantic emotion built in her chest. She couldn\u2019t stay quiet any longer.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Dawes. Please let me apologize. For my mother just now. And for my behavior last night. And yesterday afternoon. I don\u2019t know what\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand, gently shushing her.</p><p>\u201cTruly. You must think me the most presumptuous\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing of the sort,\u201d he said, keeping his eyes on the road. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to listen for the axle. I think I heard it creak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She bit her lip, hard. Stop talking, ninny.</p><p>\u201cHave these for a moment.\u201d He passed her the reins, then bent and twisted away from her, looking over the curricle\u2019s side to observe the axle in motion.</p><p>Diana stared down at the leather braids in her hands. Then she looked at the trotting horses and the muddy road flying by beneath them.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dawes,\u201d she whispered, hoarse with fear. \u201cMr. Dawes, I\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He held up that hand again, requesting silence. \u201cJust a moment.\u201d</p><p>This couldn\u2019t wait a moment.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dawes.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and turned to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKindly take the reins,\u201d she begged. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be driving right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if we have to turn? Or slow down? Or stop?\u201d She tightened her grip. \u201cOh dear. Now they\u2019re going faster.\u201d</p><p>He eased closer to her on the seat. His arm pressed against hers. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fine. It\u2019s not a busy road, and the horses know their way.\u201d He put his hands over her wrists, shaking lightly. \u201cJust lift the reins a bit and loosen your grip. These are good horses. They\u2019re trained to a soft touch.\u201d</p><p>He helped her position the reins, sliding them between her fingers.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d she asked, sitting straight.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. You\u2019re doing well.\u201d</p><p>His low, gentle voice entranced her and gave her confidence.</p><p>He showed her the commands for right and left; how to urge the horses faster and draw them to a halt. The lesson made for welcome distraction. At least they had something to discuss other than the mortifying events of yesterday.</p><p>\u201cEvery woman should learn to drive,\u201d he said. \u201cI taught my own sisters when they were old enough. I never understood why the Spindle Cove ladies spend all those mornings shooting pistols and muskets, yet never have driving or riding lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose the shooting lessons make us feel strong. In control of ourselves and our lives.\u201d At least, that\u2019s what the ladies\u2019 weekly target practice did for Diana.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad. But there\u2019s feeling powerful, and then there\u2019s actually taking the reins. They are a great many situations a woman might do well to drive away from. Very few where it\u2019s advisable to shoot her way out.\u201d</p><p>He was right, Diana thought. Loading and shooting a pistol might give a lady a rush of exhilaration, but this was true power. The freedom to choose her own direction, and harnessing the power to take her there.</p><p>\u201cThere, now you know how to drive.\u201d He moved back to his side of the seat. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>Diana pulled on the reins, drawing the horses to a lurching halt in the middle of the empty lane. \u201cI want to stop right here and apologize to you. I know you don\u2019t wish to speak of yesterday, but I cannot be easy until I say this. You were very kind to me, and I can\u2019t . . . I heard the way my mother spoke to you just now, and I need you to know I don\u2019t think of you that way. When I came to the tavern last night, I wasn\u2019t just seeking a moment of rebellion. I . . .\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been staring at her hands all this time, but she forced herself to look up. At him.</p><p>His handsome features were a mask of confusion. Oh, she was making a hash of this.</p><p>\u201cMay I be honest with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cI think that\u2019s the best strategy. I\u2019ll just say everything I\u2019ve been keeping to myself. And when it\u2019s out, it will surely sound ridiculous. We\u2019ll have a good laugh, and that will be the end of things. Can you bear it?\u201d</p><p>His wide mouth crooked in a smile. \u201cI can bear far worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Out with it. \u201cI\u2019ve been infatuated with you for quite some time. It\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible,\u201d he echoed.</p><p>\u201cNot that you\u2019re terrible, of course. That \u2018s not what I mean. I think you\u2019re remarkable. I\u2019m the terrible one. It all started that night of Finn\u2019s accident. You were so confident and so strong. Just did what needed to be done, and no wavering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat night? Believe me, I was wavering. On the inside, I was wavering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never would have known it.\u201d She laughed a little. \u201cOf all the places to develop an infatuation. Making eyes at a man over an amputation table. It\u2019s embarrassing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly a story a woman wants to tell her grandchildren someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose it would be.\u201d</p><p>She felt lighter already. \u201cSee, I told you this would all sound ridiculous. Oh, and there\u2019s so much more. You already know that I purposely broke things just to have excuses to come by the smithy. When did you start to realize the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust recently.\u201d His mouth tugged in a self-effacing grimace. \u201cI\u2019m not too sharp.\u201d</p><p>She waved off his words. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. You\u2019re so perceptive. It\u2019s evident in your finer work. I\u2019ve spent hours poring over your jewelry pieces in the All Things shop. I\u2019ve bought five of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Five.\u201d She cringed. \u201cI told Sally I was sending them to friends as gifts. A small taste of Spindle Cove, I said. But I never meant to give any of them away. I kept them all for myself. It was so stupid of me, because once I\u2019d said they were gifts, I couldn\u2019t be seen wearing them. And if I kept them in my jewelry box, Charlotte would find them\u2014she\u2019s always going through my things without permission. So I resorted to keeping them in the chest with my trousseau. They\u2019re wrapped up in a tablecloth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have five of my pieces in your trousseau?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, only four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the other one?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head and pressed a hand to her cheek. \u201cOh, this is where it gets truly mortifying. There was one I couldn\u2019t bear to put away. But I couldn\u2019t gather the courage to wear it, either. So I took it off its chain and sewed little pockets into my frocks. Every morning, I slip it in as I\u2019m dressing, and at night, I tuck it . . .\u201d She buried her face in her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d He sounded as if he was enjoying this now.</p><p>\u201cUnder my pillow,\u201d she moaned into her hands, knowing he\u2019d laugh. \u201cAs if I\u2019m a girl of fourteen.\u201d</p><p>He did laugh, but he did it good-naturedly.</p><p>\u201cI admire all your work, but that one is my favorite. From the moment I saw it in Sally\u2019s display case, I knew I had to have it. It just . . .\u201d She\u2019d come this far. No turning back now. \u201cIt seemed made for me.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. \u201cWas it a little silver pendant with a quatrefoil design?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you had it right,\u201d he said. \u201cSo long as we\u2019re being honest. It was made with you in mind.\u201d</p><p>Her heart turned over in her chest. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do all my best work with you in mind. I never questioned why you came by the forge because I was just pleased you came. I didn\u2019t want you to stop. And that night with Finn? That\u2019s when it started for me, too.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. His dark eyes held her rapt.</p><p>\u201cI find you terribly handsome,\u201d she blurted out. Because it was the only thing left unsaid.</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI would tell you you\u2019re the kind of lovely that\u2019s unfair to roses and sunsets. But I don\u2019t think this honest conversation is working the way you hoped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not. We were meant to be laughing, but none of this seems ridiculous. In fact, it feels more serious by the moment.\u201d</p><p>To know that her attraction hadn\u2019t been one-sided\u2014that she\u2019d been right about those long, searching looks he\u2019d given her now and then . . . The vindication buoyed her spirits, and a delicious tingle ran from her scalp to her toes. But from there, she didn\u2019t know what happened next.</p><p>Evidently, he had some ideas.</p><p>He took the reins from her hands and secured them on the dash rail. Then he gathered her in his arms and drew her close.</p><p>Her heart stuttered. This was really going to happen.</p><p>She\u2019d run from his kiss the first time.</p><p>The second time, she\u2019d begged him for it.</p><p>This time, she\u2019d learned her lesson. She did nothing but remain absolutely, perfectly still.</p><p>And it worked.</p><p>His lips touched hers, imparting that unique blend of strength and tenderness she was coming to treasure. To crave.</p><p>But all too soon, he lifted his head. \u201cHave you been kissed before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to say yes or no. Which answer will make you do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to do it again.\u201d His thumb stroked her cheek. \u201cJust wanted to know how slow to take things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little faster would be fine.\u201d She\u2019d been waiting twenty-three years, after all.</p><p>His answer was a thrilling, sensual growl. \u201cAs you like.\u201d</p><p>He renewed the kiss with a series of rough presses of his mouth to hers. Warm friction teased her lips apart, and his tongue swept between them.</p><p>The invasion was startling. She felt as though the ground had gone to liquid beneath her, and now she was adrift on unfamiliar seas. Far outside the boundaries of her experience.</p><p>As if he sensed her uncertainty, his arms flexed tight, drawing her flush with his chest. Her head naturally tilted back. She was vulnerable beneath him now, and he took control, deepening the kiss. His tongue stroked hers. The grain of his whiskers rasped at the edges of her lips. Intriguing and so essentially male. She wanted to touch him, slide her fingertips down the edge of his jaw. But she lost her courage, afraid to make a mistake and bring an end to everything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wanted this to last and last.</p><p>When he did pull away, he made no effort to hide that he was affected, too. It was all there, in his eyes. The deep wellspring of mutual desire and need they\u2019d barely tapped.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dawes,\u201d she sighed. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst, you start calling me Aaron.\u201d</p><p>She tested it. \u201cAaron. What do we do?\u201d</p><p>He put space between them. \u201cI suppose this is where I should revise the speech I started last night. Remind you that you\u2019re a gentlewoman and I\u2019m a craftsman, and nothing can come of this. And tell you we should just go back to trading longing glances across the green and never speak of this again. But the thing is, I don\u2019t feel like giving that speech this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d she said, relieved. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not at all in the mood to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both sober. It\u2019s a fine, clear day. You\u2019re a grown woman, and a clever one. I believe you understand the situation. And I\u2019m going to trust that you know your own mind.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart swelled. What a lovely, lovely gift. No one else had ever done the same.</p><p>He put one hand over hers. \u201cWe have something, the two of us. I don\u2019t think we could name it quite yet, much less decide what we\u2019d do to keep it. But if you like, we can spend more time together and puzzle it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like that. Very much.\u201d</p><p>Goodness. It was settled, then. She had a proper suitor for the first time in her life\u2014and he was a blacksmith. If her mother learned of this, she would be taken with fits.</p><p>She added, \u201cBut we should probably be discreet. At least for now.\u201d</p><p>Something flashed in his eyes, and she was worried she\u2019d offended him. It wasn\u2019t that she was ashamed, of course. Just careful.</p> <p>She fingered the vial of tincture hanging around her neck. Old habits were difficult to break.</p><p>He reached to untie the reins. \u201cI\u2019d best be getting you back to the rooming house. I did promise your mother you wouldn\u2019t freckle.\u201d He gave her a wry wink. \u201cI hear there may be a shilling in it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said.</p><p>Before he could set the team in motion, she rose up on the curricle seat, turned, and forced down the collapsible cover so that sunlight splashed them both.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d She removed her cloak and settled beside him, putting her arm through his. \u201cNow we can go.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve assigned all the parts,\u201d Charlotte said, handing copies of the play to the assembled ladies in the Queen\u2019s Ruby. \u201cWe\u2019ll read through it once this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven knows, there\u2019s nothing else to do,\u201d lamented Miss Price, looking out the window at another rainy day.</p> <p>Diana looked down at her copy with URSULA labeled at the top. \u201cReally, I didn\u2019t think this was settled. Why am I playing Ursula?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte said, \u201cIt\u2019s the easiest role in the play, I promise you. The rest of us will be running about screaming and pleading for our lives, and you just stand there and look pure.\u201d</p><p>Diana lifted a brow. Pure? Would they still find her the ideal person for this role if they knew she\u2019d been kissing Mr. Dawes in the vicar\u2019s curricle yesterday?</p><p>No, not kissing Mr. Dawes. Kissing Aaron.</p><p>Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.</p><p>\u201cDiana.\u201d</p><p>She shook herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your line.\u201d</p><p>She scanned the first page and found her part, then read aloud in an even voice. \u201cOh, wreck and woe. My father hath betrothed me to the son of a heathen king. I should sooner die than be so defiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo speak up, Diana,\u201d her mother chided from across the room. \u201cNo one can hear you. Imagine Lord Drewe is standing just offstage, waiting for his cue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd put emotion into it,\u201d Charlotte added. She stood and flung one arm to the side, pressing the other wrist to her brow. \u201cOh, wreck and WOE. I should sooner DIE.\u201d</p><p>Diana sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t think I possess the dramatic talent for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps I just don\u2019t feel equal to it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ill?\u201d Mama asked sharply.</p><p>Diana paused. She\u2019d promised herself she wouldn\u2019t hide behind this excuse any longer. But she didn\u2019t want to be sitting here in the rooming house when she could be with Aaron.</p><p>Kissing Aaron. Touching Aaron. Embracing Aaron and feeling surrounded by his big, strong arms.</p><p>She had no heart to play the martyred virgin right now.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Mama wailed. \u201cOh, I knew that sun would do you an ill turn. No more rehearsal for you today. Go straight upstairs and rest. I will not have you falling ill when it\u2019s time for our outing to Ambervale. Do you have any more of that infusion from Lady Rycliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need an infusion, Mama. But perhaps I will go.\u201d She turned to Miss Bertram. \u201cWould you be so kind as to read my part for today?\u201d</p><p>Miss Bertram\u2019s eyebrows rose in alarm. \u201cOh, I . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you would make a marvelous Ursula. And you would be doing me a great favor.\u201d</p><p>The girl took the booklet from Diana\u2019s hand, smiling shyly. \u201cWell, Mr. Evermoore does love my reading voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he does.\u201d</p><p>Diana tried to soothe her conscience as she left the room. She hadn\u2019t lied. Mama had merely assumed, wrongly, that she felt ill. Just like she assumed, wrongly, that Diana would follow her instructions to go upstairs and rest.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, she gathered her cloak and slipped out the rear door.</p><p>As she neared the smithy, a giddy flutter rose in her chest. No horses or wagons in the front meant she\u2019d likely caught him alone. A sheen of perspiration rose on her brow even before she entered the steamy, spark-filled forge.</p><p>She entered to find Aaron not pounding at the anvil but hunched over a bit of fine metalwork at his worktable.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said, swaying her skirts a bit.</p><p>He looked up only briefly and gave her a curt \u201cGood morning\u201d before returning his concentration to his task. \u201cSorry you\u2019ve caught me in a busy moment. I can\u2019t leave this, or it will cool unfinished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Should I come back another time?\u201d</p><p>A furrow formed in his heavy brow. \u201cNo, don\u2019t go. Unless you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to stay.\u201d She settled on her usual stool. \u201cIf I won\u2019t be troubling you.\u201d</p><p>Now he looked up, and his dark eyes caught hers. \u201cYou could never be any kind of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Never mind the roaring forge, that look sent heat rushing through her. Oh, dear. And here she was, caught without her fan.</p><p>He returned to his labor, and she sat quiet and still. She did love watching him at his work. This was different from his display of brawn and sweat she\u2019d admired the other day. When he worked with fine metal, all that power was pushed through a narrow funnel of concentration.</p><p>The result was passion. He had an artist\u2019s passion for his creations. She touched the quatrefoil pendant in her pocket.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>He set the piece aside and wiped his brow with his shirtsleeve. He left a black smudge of soot on his temple, and she found it strangely enticing. A mark of that passion, emblazoned on his skin. It spoke of virility in a primal way.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you making?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He showed her a silver bracelet, formed of two twining vines. \u201cIt\u2019s a special order for a jeweler in Hastings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been selling your work in Hastings?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cRye and Eastbourne, too. I\u2019m hoping to expand to Brighton soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd London after that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPerhaps. But there\u2019s only one of me. There\u2019s a limit to how much I can do on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about taking on an apprentice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not working the forge that I need help with, so much as everything else. Fosbury says what I really need is a wi\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut off the word, but Diana completed it in her mind.</p><p>What I really need is a wife.</p><p>It made sense. Marriage was a partnership in any social class. Among gentry, the lady\u2019s contribution was a dowry or well-placed connections. As a craftsman, Aaron would do well to marry a woman with practical skills to help him manage his household and his business.</p><p>Skills women like Diana didn\u2019t possess.</p><p>They traded awkward glances, and they both seemed to be thinking the same thing. What were they doing here? He wasn\u2019t the kind of suitor her mother would accept, and she couldn\u2019t be the wife he needed. If marriage was impossible, they were only flirting with heartbreak and scandal.</p><p>Still, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to leave.</p><p>We have something, he\u2019d said yesterday, and he was right. Diana wasn\u2019t ready to give up on it yet.</p><p>He went back to his work, raking the fire and pumping the bellows that fueled the forge. \u201cMuch as I\u2019d like to take the day off and spend it with you, I have to finish this piece. I\u2019ve promised to deliver it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Is there any way I can help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you to offer, but I\u2019m not going to have you hauling wood and water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I helped with such things the night Finn was hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but that was an emergency. If I hadn\u2019t been so preoccupied, I never would have allowed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d tried to send me away, I wouldn\u2019t have listened.\u201d She had a tenacious streak. There had to be something she could do. \u201cHave you eaten your noon meal?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. While you finish that piece, I\u2019ll prepare a meal. Then we\u2019ll sit down to eat and have time to talk, but I won\u2019t feel I\u2019ve distracted you from your work.\u201d</p><p>He looked uncertain.</p><p>\u201cAaron, please. Let me do this. You did say you\u2019d trust that I know my own mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did.\u201d He blew out his breath and wiped his hands on a rag. \u201cVery well, then.\u201d</p><p>He turned to the hearth and scooped some red-hot embers with a tiny shovel, then handed the shovel out to her.</p><p>She moved to take it, though she wasn\u2019t sure what she was supposed to do with it next.</p><p>\u201cFor the fire,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Of course. How could anyone cook without a fire?</p><p>\u201cOne of the fishermen brought me something fresh from the catch this morning, and there\u2019s fresh butter and cream, as well. Potatoes and onions in the bin. Poke about the cabinets, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find whatever else you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do with a kiss. Will I find one of those in the cabinets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have right here.\u201d He tilted his head and gave her a brief, yet exhilarating, kiss.</p><p>She clutched the scoop of glowing coals. \u201cI\u2019ll be just fine, you\u2019ll see. Now back to work with you.\u201d</p><p>She turned and headed toward the rear door of the forge. Beyond it, a narrow yard separated the smithy from his cottage.</p><p>\u201cDiana?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her Christian name spoken in that intimate, low baritone, a thrill went through her. She nearly spilled the coals. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, you will ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course I will,\u201d she assured him. \u201cDon\u2019t look so worried. It\u2019s not as though I\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>Diana had never done this before.</p><p>Any of it.</p><p>Not light a fire, not clean a fish . . . and most certainly not cook a meal. But she was going to do all this today, and she was going to do it well.</p><p>She entered the cottage kitchen. It was a sparely furnished room, but orderly and clean. There was no denying it could do with a woman\u2019s touch\u2014the curtains hanging in the window were recently laundered, but faded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In a covered basin on the table lay, she assumed, the fish. Most likely sole or plaice, she imagined. A flat, muddy footprint of a fish that Diana would somehow need to behead. And gut. And scale and fillet and . . .</p><p>She swallowed hard.</p><p>That part could wait. She\u2019d pare the vegetables first.</p> <p>The fire, she suddenly realized. Goodness. She couldn\u2019t cook anything without a fire.</p><p>By habit, she\u2019d never strayed too near a fireplace or stove\u2014not only because her mother had insisted gentlewomen didn\u2019t dirty their hands with such tasks but also because Diana had feared that inhaling smoke or ash could trigger a breathing crisis.</p><p>Those worries were in the past now. She faced a different challenge today.</p><p>She cautiously carried the scoop of glowing coals to the kitchen hearth. A nearby box held some straws and dried moss. Crouching on the hearthstones, she heaped the tinder in the grate, then lifted the scoop and gently sifted a few embers atop it.</p><p>A fizzling curl of smoke rose up.</p> <p>And promptly died, taking all her excitement with it.</p><p>What was she doing wrong? She thought of Aaron stoking the fire in the smithy, raking and turning the coals . . . pumping the bellows.</p><p>The bellows. That was it. A fire needed air.</p><p>She scattered another few embers over the tinder, then lowered herself almost to her belly, pursed her lips, and blew. A flurry of sparks resulted. Encouraged, she inhaled slowly, then exhaled again, careful not to overtax her lungs. This time, the little sparks swelled and caught the tinder, resulting in a few lapping tongues of flame.</p><p>Diana rose to her knees and cheered\u2014quietly\u2014while brushing the dust from her hands and skirts. A small triumph, perhaps, but a promising start.</p><p>Her sense of triumph quickly dampened, however, when the tinder began to flame out and she realized she had no split logs to keep the fire going. She looked around. Nothing, to either side of the hearth. Then she recalled the well-stocked woodpile outside the smithy, under the overhang.</p> <p>After another slow, loving exhalation to nourish her small flames, she rose and dashed outside, gathering an armful of splits from the pile before hurrying back, all the while praying the fire wouldn\u2019t die in her absence.</p><p>She knelt before the hearth\u2014no more care for her skirts this time\u2014and placed the thinnest of the logs atop the burning tinder.</p><p>The flames were immediately smothered, dying in a thin plume of white, elegiac smoke.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d</p><p>She flattened herself to the hearthstones and huffed desperately, trying to rekindle the flame.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go back to Aaron and ask for more coals. He would know she\u2019d failed before she\u2019d even begun, and that she couldn\u2019t perform the most basic of household tasks. What use could she ever be to him? It wasn\u2019t as though they\u2019d talked about marriage, but she wasn\u2019t ready to foreclose the possibility.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged. \u201cPlease, please. Don\u2019t go out.\u201d</p><p>And as if some pagan god of fire heard her petition, a small flame caught a notch on the underside of the wood. The fire began to gnaw at it, dripping morsels of ash.</p> <p>Hosanna.</p><p>She fed the fire carefully, not daring to stray a pace from the hearth until she had a tall, respectable blaze.</p><p>When she felt it safe to rise, she gave the basin on the table a wary glance. She wasn\u2019t ready for that fish just yet.</p><p>Instead, she found a knife and set about paring vegetables and adding them to a kettle of salted water. She managed three potatoes, two carrots, and an onion with only one slice to her finger. She bound her wound with a strip of linen torn from her handkerchief. The onion made a useful scapegoat for her silly tears.</p><p>After hanging the kettle on a hook and swiveling it over the fire to boil, she could no longer postpone the inevitable.</p><p>Time to gut the fish.</p><p>She went to the table and lifted the cover from the basin.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d With a muted shriek, she dropped the cover. It felt back with a bang.</p><p>Oh Lord, oh Lord.</p><p>Several moments passed before she could bear to lift the cover again and peer inside. She hoped to see something different this time. But no.</p><p>There it was.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a fish.</p><p>It was an eel.</p><p>And it was still alive. Just angrily alive and now agitated, weaving slick, dark-green figure eights in its basin of murky water.</p><p>With a shudder, Diana covered it again. Then she drew out a chair and decided to sit and think for a while, about just how much she truly wanted this.</p><p>She closed her eyes and thought of Aaron\u2019s kiss. The strength of his arms around her. The heat of his body, and the tender mastery of his tongue coaxing hers. She remembered their driving lesson. The joy of racing down a country lane, as fast as the spring mud would allow, with the top of the curricle down.</p><p>Then she pictured that eel, filling the basin with its writhing, slippery will to live.</p><p>She just couldn\u2019t. Could she?</p><p>Diana opened her eyes and steeled her resolve. Some days, she decided, freedom meant the wind in your hair and the sun on your face and lips swollen with forbidden kisses.</p><p>And other days, freedom meant killing an eel.</p><p>She found the largest cleaver in the kitchen and gripped it in her right hand. With the left, she lifted the cover from the basin.</p><p>\u201cI have nothing against you,\u201d she told the eel. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re a perfectly fine creature. But Aaron and I have something. And I\u2019m not going to let anything stand . . . or slither . . . in the way of it.\u201d</p><p>And just as she reached in to grab the thing . . .</p><p>It jumped.</p><p>It jumped clear out of the basin and\u2014to Diana\u2019s gasping horror\u2014landed directly on her chest.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Once Diana disappeared into the cottage, Aaron quickly lost himself in his work. He needed to get this piece right. If the jeweler was satisfied, it would mean a tidy sum in Aaron\u2019s pocket\u2014and more commissions in the future.</p><p>He did this finer work because he enjoyed it; the profit had always been secondary. He lived simply, and village smithing gave him more than sufficient income to meet his needs. But he was thinking about the future now.</p><p>Thinking hard.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even realize how much time had passed until he looked up from the finished bracelet and saw it was midafternoon. Damn it. He\u2019d left her waiting for hours.</p><p>He banked the fire, removed his apron, put away his tools, and locked the finished bracelet in his strongbox. Then he took a few minutes to wash at the pump before going inside. Wouldn\u2019t do to go in all sweaty and covered in soot.</p><p>As he worked a soapy lather over his hands and forearms, his anticipation grew. This was like a dream come true. A day\u2019s honest work at the forge, a well-made result, and Diana Highwood waiting for him at home, ready with a warm smile and a hot meal.</p><p>He ran his hands through his dampened hair to tame it, then entered the cottage through the kitchen door.</p><p>He found the place in shambles.</p><p>The room was cold. Every dish, pot, and spoon he owned had been turned out of the cupboards, it seemed. Peelings littered the floor. The acrid stench of burned potatoes hung in the air.</p><p>And Diana sat at his table, sobbing noisily, her head buried in her stacked arms.</p><p>\u201cMy God, what\u2019s happened?\u201d He crossed to her at once and knelt at her side. \u201cWhat is it? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ruined,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s ruined?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. Your meal. My life. Our chances.\u201d She hiccupped. \u201cThe eel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe eel?\u201d He made attempts to soothe her, stroking her hair and back. \u201cWhat happened to the eel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt . . .\u201d She squeaked out a little sob. \u201cIt got away.\u201d A fresh burst of tears muffled the remainder of her reply.</p><p>\u201cIt got away?\u201d He struggled manfully to contain his laughter.</p><p>\u201cI had the knife . . . and it . . . it jumped. I didn\u2019t know they could jump. Do you know they can jump?\u201d She gestured wildly about her neck and head. \u201cOn my chest . . . in my hair . . . I couldn\u2019t . . .\u201d She coughed out an indelicate sob. \u201cI flung it off me. It landed out the window, and then it got away.\u201d</p><p>He glanced out the window she\u2019d indicated. The weather had left the ground sufficiently wet and muddy that he could imagine an eel finding its way into a wheel rut and traveling a fair distance. It wouldn\u2019t likely get far, but it could get away.</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cI\u2019d say that eel earned its pardon, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then the vegetables boiled over, and the overflowed water put out the fire, and I . . . when I went to stoke it, a cinder caught me on the cheek. I\u2019m sure it left a mark.\u201d She lowered her head to her arms again. \u201cEverything\u2019s ruined. The meal is ruined, I am ruined. I\u2019m too useless to be a working man\u2019s wife, and\u201d\u2014her shoulders quaked with another sob\u2014\u201cand now I\u2019m disfigured, so no gentleman will want me. I\u2019m going to die an old maid.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, her voice tweaked higher and higher. Until her last word was no more than a plaintive squeak.</p><p>\u201cAn old maid?\u201d he echoed. \u201cBecause of one meal that went awry? Diana, I don\u2019t know what to say. Other than to offer my congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations?\u201d</p><p>He patted her shoulder, chuckling. \u201cI grew up with a mother and two sisters, and all of them like to talk. And that is, undoubtedly, the most feminine progression of thought I\u2019ve ever heard voiced aloud. One escaped eel, make you a spinster?\u201d</p><p>She sniffled.</p><p>He pulled up a chair next to hers and reached to touch her cheek. \u201cLet me see the burn.\u201d</p><p>With reluctance, she offered her face for his view. \u201cIs it very hideous?\u201d</p><p>What a question. As if she could\u2014ever\u2014be anything less than beautiful in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d He pressed his thumb to the tiny red scorch mark on the gentle sweep of her cheekbone. \u201cThis is nothing. Barely noticeable, and it will fade in no time. I\u2019ve had countless such burns myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still exceedingly handsome. So that\u2019s some comfort.\u201d She wiped her eyes with a shredded handkerchief. \u201cYou must think me ridiculous. I am ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not ridiculous. I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? Do you worry about being an old maid, too?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI know we come from different backgrounds. But we\u2019ve more in common than you\u2019d think. I was the oldest child, too. And when my father died, I had a mother and two younger sisters to look after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when he passed away?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s very young to be the man of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was old enough to take his place at the forge, thankfully. I threw myself into the trade, because I knew it was how I could keep my family safe. Spent so much time at that anvil, when I went to bed I pounded iron in my sleep. Then one day, I was shoeing a horse and put my hand in the wrong place at the wrong time. The horse caught my thumb and bit it, hard.\u201d He lifted his hand to demonstrate. \u201cMy thumb was all black and swollen. I spent a week not knowing if the bone was crushed, too. Next to losing my father, it was the worst time of my life. I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to work. The family would starve . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything would be ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI see what you\u2019re saying. You\u2019re right, we are much the same. It\u2019s not my vanity that\u2019s pained, it\u2019s just . . . I was always raised to believe the family depended on me. That my prospects\u2014and to put it bluntly, my face\u2014were our security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when your mind leaps from a scorched cheek to permanent spinsterhood, it\u2019s understandable. But that doesn\u2019t make it reasonable. You must realize you\u2019re not responsible for your family anymore. Not since your sister married Lord Payne.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d She dried her eyes and drew in a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m sitting here weeping. I just wanted so badly for this meal to come out right.\u201d</p><p>Aaron put a roughened hand over her delicate one, touched by the implication of her words. She wanted more than just the meal to come out right. She wanted this to work between them, and so did he. But it wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s hope yet.\u201d With a fond squeeze to her hand, he stood. \u201cLet\u2019s clean this up and make something to eat.\u201d</p> <p>They worked together. While Aaron rebuilt the fire, Diana wiped the table and swept the floor\u2014and then she ducked outside for a moment to wash her face and tame her frazzled hair. She did have some vanity.</p><p>She returned to find Aaron taking eggs and hard cheese from the larder.</p><p>\u201cI hope omelette will do,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know any fancy cuisine, but I\u2019ve become quite accomplished in bachelor cooking. Once my mother and sisters moved away, it was that or starve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmelette sounds wonderful.\u201d She marveled at the way he could carry four eggs in one hand, holding them each separate with his big fingers. \u201cWhere did they move to? Your mother and sisters, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey both married sailors. One married a navy man, and she moved to Portsmouth. Mum went with her to help while he\u2019s at sea. The other lives over near Hastings. Her husband\u2019s a merchant sailor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have nieces and nephews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive so far,\u201d he said proudly. He broke the last egg and added it to the bowl. \u201cIf you want to help, you could pare some shavings of that cheese.\u201d</p><p>She gathered a board and a small knife, then set about slicing the cheese as thinly as she could. Simple as the task was, she still had a near miss with the blade. His forearms were every bit as distracting in the kitchen as they were in the forge. She was entranced, watching him whisk the eggs with a long-handled fork.</p><p>He was so good with his hands in every situation. It was hard not to imagine the wonders those hands could work on her.</p><p>She ducked her head and finished paring the cheese.</p><p>He took a skillet from a hook and cut a lump of butter into it before carrying it over to the fire.</p> <p>While he cooked the omelette, Diana sliced a loaf of bread and set the table for two. A burst of whimsy led her to gather two china candlesticks from a high shelf, dust them, and fit them with tapers.</p><p>He smiled when he saw them. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. Those don\u2019t get used often.\u201d</p><p>As they sat down to eat, she felt like she\u2019d finally done something right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering.\u201d He jabbed at his food, gathering a man-sized forkful of eggs. \u201cSo you\u2019re named Diana, for the Roman goddess of hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd virginity.\u201d Her lips quirked.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He wolfed down another bite of eggs. \u201cAnd then your next sister is Minerva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoman goddess of knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where does \u2018Charlotte \u2019come in? Shouldn\u2019t she be a goddess, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was meant to be. Those classical names were all the fashion in my mother\u2019s day, and you know my mother is always concerned with the latest fashion.\u201d She pushed the eggs around her plate. \u201cShe had the idea to name all her daughters after deities. I think Charlotte was supposed to be Venus. No, no. Vesta.\u201d</p><p>He choked on his food. \u201cEither is cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. My father\u2019s name was Charles, and they\u2019d been waiting to name a son for him. But he fell ill while my mother was pregnant the third time. I think my mother knew there wouldn\u2019t be a fourth child, or any son at all. So that\u2019s how Charlotte was named Charlotte and spared the cruelty of Vesta.\u201d</p><p>He put down his fork. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019d rather have the cruel name if it meant having her father. I shouldn\u2019t have joked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. Nearly everything my mother does is ripe for ridicule. But occasionally she does mean well.\u201d</p><p>They finished their simple meal all too quickly.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sun\u2019s come out. Just in time to disappear again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really ought to be going back to the Queen\u2019s Ruby. If I\u2019m not there when dinner\u2019s called, they\u2019ll be worried.\u201d</p><p>He walked her outside and they stood there, side by side, watching the sun sink toward the horizon. A fiery red ball, painting the clouds with vibrant shades of pink and orange.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMy father used to say, Christ might be a carpenter, but the Heavenly Father is a blacksmith. He melts the sun down every night and forges it again the next morning.\u201d</p><p>Diana smiled. \u201cWhat a lovely thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s rubbish. At least that\u2019s what I decided after he died. If a good man slumps over his anvil at the age of two-and-forty, his Creator is no kind of craftsman. I inherited his forge, not his faith.\u201d His chest rose and fell in a thoughtful sigh. \u201cBut then, every once in a while, I see something so finely made, so exquisitely wrought\u201d\u2014he turned to her\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t help but wonder. Maybe he was right.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a light touch down her cheek. \u201cOnly a divine hand could make something this lovely. Christ, you\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. Partly because she was amused by his blend of reverent wonder and shameless blasphemy. And partly because it made her uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cNot inside, not out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible cook. That I\u2019ll grant you. You can\u2019t hold your liquor, either. And you have questionable taste in men. So no, you\u2019re not perfect.\u201d His voice sank to a husky whisper, and his gaze dropped to her mouth. \u201cBut you\u2019re close. Close enough to restore a man\u2019s faith in miracles.\u201d</p><p>Her heart fluttered as he leaned in for a kiss.</p><p>\u201cDawes!\u201d The call came from around the other side of the smithy. \u201cDawes, are you here?\u201d</p><p>Diana jumped back, worried they\u2019d been seen. And then she worried she\u2019d offended Aaron with her swift recoil. Again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know which of her concerns he meant to allay.</p><p>For his part, he didn\u2019t show any unease. He walked out around the smithy and greeted the man. Evidently a horse needed shoeing.</p><p>She heard Aaron speak to him. \u201cWalk him around, and I\u2019ll be right along. Just have to fetch something from the house for Miss Highwood.\u201d</p><p>Diana patted her hands down her front. Gloves, cloak, reticule. She had everything she\u2019d come with, but she followed him anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it you needed to give me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>He lashed an arm about her waist, pressing her up against the wall and claiming her mouth in a passionate kiss. No time for preliminaries today. He took what he wanted, thrusting his tongue deep and putting his hands in places that were just this side of scandalous. The light boning of her corset pressed into her torso\u2014the one thing holding her together, while the rest of her seemed to dissolve.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she breathed a few moments later. \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t let me leave without that.\u201d</p><p>He trailed kisses toward her ear. His whiskered jaw scraped deliciously against her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m taking my work to Hastings tomorrow,\u201d he murmured. \u201cInvent some reason you need to go along. Shopping. Someone to visit. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I could do that. So long as Charlotte comes with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d After one last kiss to her lips, he pulled away. \u201cI\u2019ll come for you at the rooming house, first light.\u201d</p><p>He left her there, slumped breathless against the wall. Her head whirled, and God only knew where her knees had disappeared to.</p><p>She smiled weakly to herself. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>\u201cWhy, Mr. Dawes,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognize you, you look so smart this morning.\u201d</p><p>Aaron pulled a face of male modesty.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he look smart, Diana?\u201d</p><p>Diana smiled. \u201cMr. Dawes looks quite fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on business today,\u201d he said, tugging down the brim of his hat. \u201cBest to look the part.\u201d</p><p>He did look splendid, Diana had to agree. He was dressed in a rich brown topcoat that made her think of melted chocolate. His freshly starched neckcloth made a delicious contrast with his bronzed skin and dark hair.</p><p>That hair was still a touch too long, curling in dark waves at his collar. Staring at it made her wistful.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have Mr. Keane\u2019s curricle today\u2014just Aaron\u2019s own wagon. The seat was wide enough to fit three, and Diana took the middle. The morning was brisk, and he tucked a rug over their laps.</p><p>Hastings was almost two hours\u2019 distance away, and they passed the first hour or so in near silence. Which was not to say that no communication was happening. One side of Diana\u2019s body\u2014the side pressed against him\u2014had developed a manner of speaking all its own. They were having a whole conversation in subtle exchanges of heat and pressure and \u201caccidental\u201d brushes of arm against arm, knee against knee. Each touch electrified her. She had to ration her glances in his direction so as not to give Charlotte any idea.</p><p>The secret pleasure of their flirtation made her giddy. They weren\u2019t even halfway to their destination, and already this was her favorite outing in years.</p><p>\u201cLud, you two are silent,\u201d Charlotte finally declared. \u201cWe must talk about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019ve had this break in the rain,\u201d Diana said.</p><p>\u201cAnd not the weather!\u201d Charlotte complained. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted of everyone discussing the weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you\u2019ll be needing in town?\u201d Aaron asked. \u201cWhere can I drop you when we reach Hastings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must visit the draper\u2019s first,\u201d Charlotte answered. \u201cThat\u2019s our main errand. We need yards and yards of white for Diana\u2019s costume, and there wasn\u2019t enough in the All Things shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Highwood\u2019s wearing a costume?\u201d</p><p>Diana forgot she hadn\u2019t told him about the theatrical. Whenever they\u2019d been alone together, there had been too many other things to discuss. And too many kisses to share.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to Ambervale on Thursday,\u201d Charlotte explained. \u201cWe\u2019re presenting a theatrical. A pantomime on the life and death of Saint Ursula. I\u2019m playing Cordula, and Diana is playing the lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is she?\u201d Aaron slid her an amused look. \u201cNow that would be something to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should come,\u201d Charlotte said eagerly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s coming. Captain Thorne will be there, of course. And I just received a letter from Minerva yesterday. She and Lord Payne will be coming down from London to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might like to see them. What do you think, Miss Highwood?\u201d he asked. \u201cWould I be welcome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose. So long as you promise not to laugh.\u201d</p><p>When they reached Hastings, Aaron saw them to the draper\u2019s before taking his wagon to the mews and completing his business. Diana and Charlotte spent the next hour debating sateen versus crepe, then purchasing great spools of ribbon and gold braid to make headdresses for each of Ursula\u2019s eleven handmaidens.</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s playing Prince Meriadoc, do you think Lord Drewe will wear a codpiece?\u201d Charlotte whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat a question! I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to notice it if he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s going to notice you.\u201d Charlotte draped a length of white brocade over Diana\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll be stunning.\u201d</p><p>Uncomfortable with that line of conversation, Diana took the fabric and folded it away. She moved on to the display cases. \u201cI must find a new lorgnette for Mama. Hers has disappeared.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her sister clucked her tongue. \u201cI tell you, something strange is going on at the rooming house. I think we have a thief in the Queen\u2019s Ruby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you just enjoy believing so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my eye on Miss Bertram. She\u2019s such an odd duck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell. Mr. Evermoore must like odd ducks.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte just laughed. \u201cSpeaking of birds, I\u2019m going to have a look at the plumes.\u201d</p><p>Her sister drifted away, and Diana concentrated on the display of lorgnettes. They didn\u2019t have any that matched the style of Mama\u2019s missing one, so she was left to choose the next best. She was just about to ask the shopgirl to bring out two for comparison when a man clad in dark chocolate brown approached her and interrupted in a deep voice.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, miss.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat.</p> <p>Aaron.</p><p>She turned to him, taking his cue and playing as though they were strangers. \u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I ask your opinion, as a lady?\u201d</p><p>She looked him down, then up. \u201cI should be glad to help if I can be of service.\u201d</p><p>He drew to the side, motioning for her to follow. He paused over a case filled with beaded reticules and lace gloves and tooled ivory fans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to buy a gift for my sweetheart,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure what she\u2019d like. I thought perhaps you might be so good as to help me choose.\u201d</p> <p>A helpless smile tugged at her lips. He didn\u2019t need to buy her anything, but she couldn\u2019t deny the thought made her dizzy with joy.</p><p>Until Charlotte popped between them. \u201cMr. Dawes, you have a sweetheart? Who is it? Who?\u201d</p><p>Aaron watched as Diana\u2019s cheeks paled. She gave him a look of pure panic.</p><p>\u201cDo tell, do tell.\u201d Miss Charlotte bounced on her toes. \u201cWho is your sweetheart, Mr. Dawes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say. He didn\u2019t want to lie, but clearly Diana hadn\u2019t told her sister anything about the two of them. That struck him as a mite strange\u2014his own sisters had told one another everything about their romances. But they were closer in age than the eldest and youngest Highwoods were. And more to the point, they\u2019d never gone courting with young men from a different social class.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, don\u2019t harass him so,\u201d Diana chided. \u201cIs your business complete, Mr. Dawes?\u201d She was clearly anxious to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you. And your shopping?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNearly done.\u201d She called to the shopgirl and asked her to wrap up one of the lorgnettes.</p><p>\u201cWe have some time before we need to start back,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cI thought perhaps the three of us could take some luncheon at\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t purchased your sweetheart\u2019s gift yet,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>God, the girl was like a bulldog with a bone.</p><p>\u201cDo tell us who it is, and we\u2019ll help you choose. Is it Sally? Pauline? Oh! I know. Gertrude, the upstairs maid from Summerfield.\u201d</p><p>Aaron shook his head. \u201cNone of those.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte snapped her fingers. \u201cOne of the Willett girls. Or that miller\u2019s daughter from the next parish. What\u2019s her name again? Betsy?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDo we know her?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I\u2019m fairly certain you do.\u201d</p><p>Diana gathered her purchase from the shopgirl and thumped her sister with it. \u201cCharlotte, stop. You\u2019re embarrassing him.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassing her, too, Aaron would warrant.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be glad to take some luncheon,\u201d she went on. \u201cThank you very much for the suggestion, Mr. Dawes.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet over their meal of pigeon pie. He didn\u2019t know what to make of her reluctance to tell the truth. She wasn\u2019t ready to tell anyone, obviously. He supposed it was understandable, this soon. But would she ever be ready? That was the larger question.</p><p>Perhaps she didn\u2019t see matters going that far.</p><p>Aaron surreptitiously touched the packet buried deep in his breast pocket\u2014the small quantity of gold and gemstones he\u2019d accepted in payment from the jeweler. He\u2019d requested compensation in materials rather than coin, thinking he\u2019d make something special with it.</p><p>Like maybe a ring.</p><p>But now he was feeling like a fool. If Diana didn\u2019t even feel ready to tell her own sister about them, Aaron was getting too far ahead of himself.</p><p>He lifted his ale and regarded her over it. Like she did so often, she fidgeted with the slender chain always about her neck and the vial of tincture at the end of it.</p><p>Except . . .</p><p>He blinked and looked closer.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wearing the vial on her chain today. Instead, he saw his pendant. The quatrefoil one he\u2019d made for her. The one she\u2019d been hiding in pockets and under pillows for months. Until today.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a public confession. But it was something, that.</p><p>He drained his ale and thumped the tankard on the table. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he announced, \u201cI\u2019ve an errand on our way back to Spindle Cove. Someone I promised I\u2019d call on today.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte perked with interest. \u201cIs it your sweetheart?\u201d And close on the heels of her question, \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>He was certain Diana had kicked her under the table.</p><p>\u201cNo, Miss Charlotte, it\u2019s not my sweetheart. It\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>\u201cAaron Jacob Dawes, what are you doing?\u201d Jemma chased him around the kitchen, flogging him with a damp rag and scolding him in shouted whispers. \u201cI could have your hide, bringing such ladies around to my house with no notice.\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands in innocence. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. They\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>His sister peered through the doorway into the small sitting room, where Diana and Charlotte were sitting with Jemma\u2019s three small children and a tray of tea biscuits.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I baked this morning. That\u2019s all I can say.\u201d Jemma gave him the sharp side-eye that all the Dawes women used.</p><p>\u201cYou know why I\u2019m here.\u201d He plucked a set of shears from a drawer and handed it to her. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside and have this done.\u201d</p><p>Aaron removed his coat and cravat, then assumed his usual seat on a stump in the back garden. The air smelled damp and green. A few early daffodils were poking through the ground.</p><p>Jemma set about clipping his hair. Several moments passed in quiet, save for the snipping of scissors. Jemma was a stubborn woman\u2014always had been\u2014but insatiably curious as well. He sensed a battle going on between her desire to know and her unwillingness to ask. But if he kept silent long enough, he knew which side would win.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said finally.</p><p>He smiled at the clump of toadstools near his boot. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you doing with this Miss High-and-Mighty-Wood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not high and mighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. She\u2019s quite nice, I\u2019m sure. And beautiful as anything. I just don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s catching a ride to and from Hastings. That\u2019s what she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron. You cannot expect me to believe that. You brought her here. I\u2019m cutting your hair.\u201d</p><p>The violence of her snipping began to alarm him. He was afraid he\u2019d lose the top of an ear.</p><p>He said, \u201cStop clucking over me like a mother hen. I\u2019m a grown man. I\u2019m entitled to my privacy.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cAfter all the headaches you gave my Dennis, I think I\u2019ve earned my turn.\u201d Her voice softened as she set the scissors aside and ran her fingers through his trimmed hair. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see you hurt.\u201d</p><p>He stood, turned, and looked down at her from his full height, as if to say, You\u2019re worried about this getting hurt?</p><p>She brushed the clipped hair from his shoulder. \u201cYes, you\u2019re big. Yes, you\u2019re strong. Big and strong don\u2019t add up to invincible. I remember too well what happened with that schoolteacher.\u201d</p><p>He sighed with annoyance. \u201cThat was ages in the past. And Miss Highwood isn\u2019t anything like that.\u201d</p><p>Years ago, Aaron had taken a liking to a schoolteacher from a nearby village. They\u2019d done some courting; he\u2019d made some plans. Only to learn that she\u2019d never been interested in a future with him. She\u2019d just been hoping to make a certain bank clerk jealous\u2014and she\u2019d dropped Aaron like a hot brick the moment her ploy had worked. She was married to that clerk now. They lived in Lewes, in a house with glazed windows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Miss Highwood for nearly two years, Jemma. She\u2019s a fine person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm. Fine indeed. Too fine for you. That\u2019s a lady what could marry into a fortune. A grand house. Fine carriage. Dozens of servants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. The best way I know how.\u201d Her brown eyes held his. \u201cLet this one go, Aaron.\u201d</p><p>He thought of that pendant hanging about Diana\u2019s neck. The tears she\u2019d shed at his kitchen table because she\u2019d let his dinner escape. The sweetness of her kiss.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let her go. We have something.\u201d</p><p>Jemma huffed out her breath. \u201cWell, whatever your \u2018something\u2019 is . . . I hope you\u2019re prepared to fight for it.\u201d</p><p>I am, he thought to himself.</p><p>She crossed her arms and peeked into the house again. \u201cI\u2019ll say this for her. She\u2019s been in there counting jacks with Billy for near a quarter hour. No one would put up with that child\u2019s games unless she were related to him, or hoping to be.\u201d</p><p>Her grudging approval made him smile. It was what he\u2019d come for, after all.</p><p>\u201cBilly\u2019s a good boy. He has a good mum.\u201d He gave his sister a fond rub on the top of the head, just as he\u2019d done when she was a girl. \u201cI\u2019ll stock up your woodpile before I go.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Diana thanked her kind\u2014but notably wary\u2014hostess for the tea and biscuits and expressed a wish to have a wander in the garden.</p><p>She rounded the side of the house, only to narrowly miss a collision\u2014</p><p>With Aaron.</p><p>He had shorter hair. And three children clinging to him\u2014a giggling niece attached to either leg, and Billy hanging from his neck. She\u2019d obviously caught them in the middle of a favorite game.</p><p>Aaron froze, a helpless expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou . . .\u201d Diana cleared her throat and said in a low, solemn voice, \u201cMr. Dawes, you have a little something.\u201d She motioned discreetly toward her body, indicating the position of Billy\u2019s stranglehold on his neck. \u201cJust here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Do I really?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d He shook his whole body, as if he were a dog just come out of a lake. All three children clung tight and laughed.</p><p>\u201cDid that take care of it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>He shook again, and the children laughed harder.</p><p>\u201cHow about now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d He frowned in exaggerated concentration. \u201cPerhaps I need a good dousing in the stream.\u201d</p><p>At that, the children squealed, released him, and ran away shrieking. Diana laughed, too.</p><p>He stood tall and straightened his clothing. \u201cSorry to have taken so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Please don\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma\u2019s husband is at sea for months at a time. I try to come by every so often to keep the woodpile stocked, fix the leaks and sticking doors . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase the children around the garden,\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>His wide mouth tipped in a lazy, devastating smile. \u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>Diana could have sworn she felt her womb shiver. What an excellent husband and father he\u2019d make. Protective, affectionate, devoted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And here, so far from Spindle Cove and her ambitious mother, almost anything seemed possible.</p><p>But then he looked at the sky. \u201cWe\u2019d best be on our way home.\u201d</p><p>On the way home, Charlotte declared herself exhausted. She made a bed for herself in the back of the wagon.</p> <p>Diana sat on the driver\u2019s box beside Aaron. They talked of nothings for the first hour or so, while the sun sank lower in the sky.</p><p>Finally, Diana chanced a quick look over her shoulder at the wagon bed. \u201cI think she\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Aaron transferred the reins to one hand, then used his free arm to draw her close. He tucked her head against his shoulder. \u201cYou can rest, too, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd waste this precious time with you? Never.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cI liked your sister very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe liked you.\u201d</p> <p>Diana laughed a little. \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t. She was kind and hospitable, but terribly suspicious of me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in denial.</p><p>\u201cYes, she was. She was suspicious of me because she cares about you. And that\u2019s why I liked her.\u201d She reached up and touched his newly cropped hair. \u201cI\u2019m glad you have someone looking out for you.\u201d</p><p>His hand stroked up and down her arm.</p><p>\u201cI hope you weren\u2019t offended that I didn\u2019t tell my own sister the truth.\u201d</p><p>His hand stopped stroking. \u201cNo, I understood it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you? Perhaps you can explain it to me, then.\u201d</p><p>She felt him shrug. \u201cNo reason to have your family in a lather until you\u2019re sure about a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no rush. We\u2019re just getting to know one another.\u201d</p><p>Were they, really? Diana was so confused. This was more than a casual acquaintance. She was coming to care for him. In truth, she\u2019d begun to care for him some time ago, but every hour they spent together strengthened the attraction.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t just a well-built body, a handsome face, and a talented kisser. He was a good man, and he deserved to be with someone who could love him unreservedly. He was offering her patience, but she knew she owed it to him to make up her mind. Either accept him for the man he was, or let him find someone else.</p><p>It was as though he heard her thoughts.</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cI won\u2019t think less of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d think less of me.\u201d</p><p>He put space between them, and his voice grew stern. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to prove something about yourself, Diana. Not to me, or to your mother, or to anyone. There\u2019s no shame in honesty. And there\u2019s no romance in glossing over the realities. We could both cite several reasons to let this go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean realities such as . . . you need a wife who can cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr that you need a husband who can move in society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister might never accept me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded and said, in a perfectly serious tone, \u201cYour mother might implode.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, then laid her head on his shoulder. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s Charlotte. The effect on Charlotte is my greatest concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s not something to be brushed aside. If my own sister\u2019s future were at risk, I\u2019d be thinking long and hard about it, too.\u201d</p><p>As they crested another of Sussex\u2019s rolling hills, she wondered if she\u2019d ever meet another man who made her feel so free to be honest. And she had the awful, sinking feeling that with all their honesty, they\u2019d just talked themselves out of a future together.</p><p>\u201cAaron, I know it\u2019s unrealistic to say the differences won\u2019t matter. To say \u2018Love conquers all.\u2019 But if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shushed her.</p><p>Oh, drat. She\u2019d used the word love. She\u2019d broken the cardinal rule of female subtleties, as her mother described them. She\u2019d spoken That Word aloud, and he wasn\u2019t ready for it.</p><p>And now it truly was over.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Aaron had never been more reluctant to interrupt a lady, but in this instance, he had no choice.</p><p>He slowed the horses to a walk and explained, \u201cThere\u2019s someone in the road ahead. Stay calm, and let me do the talking.\u201d</p><p>To the side of the road, a donkey cart appeared to have lost its wheel. The driver of the cart stood in the center of the lane, wearing a patched coat and waving his hat in a plea for assistance.</p><p>\u201cDoes he need help?\u201d Diana whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe might be looking for help.\u201d Or he might be looking for trouble.</p><p>Aaron stopped a fair distance from the cart. He reached under the driver\u2019s box and retrieved the pistol he kept there. He\u2019d loaded the weapon before setting off from Hastings, and now he was glad of it. This man looked honest enough at a glance\u2014but it never hurt to be cautious.</p><p>Patched Coat jammed his hat back on his head and approached their wagon. \u201cGood afternoon, sir. My cartwheel\u2019s gone off its axle, and I can\u2019t repair it on my own. As you can see, the missus is in a delicate state.\u201d</p><p>He nodded toward the cart, and behind it Aaron could make out the shadowy form of a woman great with child.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask for a moment\u2019s assistance, sir? With the two of us, we should have it mended in a trice.\u201d</p><p>Aaron hesitated. There was a canny glint in the man\u2019s eyes and an oily quality in his smile. He didn\u2019t like this.</p><p>But Diana dug her elbow into his ribs. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant. Night will fall before long. We have to help them.\u201d</p><p>That settled matters. Aaron was obligated now. He couldn\u2019t look like a callous, unsympathetic monster in front of the woman who had, just two minutes ago, danced on the verge of professing to love him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he told the man, and he directed the horses as they pulled the wagon aside.</p><p>\u201cYou stay here,\u201d he told Diana in a firm, low voice. He put the pistol in her lap and the reins in her hands. \u201cChances are, I\u2019ll be back in two minutes. But if anything untoward happens, you drive away. If I call to you to drive, you drive away. Do you understand? If there\u2019s trouble, I can handle myself. But I can\u2019t handle myself and protect you and Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Aaron jumped down from the wagon, and his boots landed in the mud with a squelch. He rued wearing his finest coat now, having stupidly donned it just to impress Diana. The later the hour, the greater the dangers of highway travel grew. Any appearance of riches could put her at risk.</p><p>\u201cI do appreciate your help,\u201d Patched Coat said, walking him over to the disabled cart. \u201cThis will take no time at all. Big fellow like you? You can lift, and I\u2019ll replace the wheel.\u201d</p><p>Aaron ducked and took a quick peek under the cart. Though the wheel was off the axle, he saw nothing broken or damaged. In fact, the dried mud on the wheel rims suggested this cart hadn\u2019t moved in several hours.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to remove your coat,\u201d the man said. \u201cMy missus would be glad to hold it for you.\u201d</p><p>Of course she would. And she\u2019d be glad to strip the contents from every pocket while she was at it.</p><p>Aaron saw exactly what was happening now. This couple had probably been sitting by the road all afternoon, taking that cartwheel off and then flagging down passersby for assistance in \u201crepairing\u201d it. While the unsuspecting travelers performed a good deed, the \u201cmissus\u201d would relieve them of their coin.</p><p>At least these were petty swindlers, not violent highwaymen. Aaron could get out of this easily enough.</p><p>He played along to a point, dutifully lifting the cart so that Patched Coat could fit the wheel back on the axle. Just as he\u2019d probably done four times already today.</p><p>Aaron tipped his hat to Mrs. Patched Coat\u2014whose pregnant belly looked a great deal lumpier than any he\u2019d ever seen\u2014and took his leave. \u201cBest of luck to you both.\u201d</p><p>Find some other unsuspecting fool to gull.</p><p>Damn it, the bastard followed him. \u201cSay, I wonder if you could spare a blanket or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aaron stopped in his paces and wheeled on him. \u201cNot another step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, I didn\u2019t mean any\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aaron lowered his voice to a threat and loomed over the man. \u201cYou will not come one step nearer my wagon. I\u2019ve helped you with your cart. If you know what\u2019s good for you, turn around and walk back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron?\u201d Diana called from the wagon. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his eyebrows at Patched Coat. You tell me. Are you going to be sensible and turn around, slink back to your donkey cart? Or is this going to get ugly?</p><p>It got ugly. The man pulled a knife.</p><p>Aaron took a quick step back, putting himself out of reach.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fine lady you have there,\u201d the man said, gesturing with the gleaming point of his blade. \u201cI\u2019d imagine you work to keep her happy. Surely there\u2019s something in your wagon my missus would enjoy.\u201d</p><p>Without turning his gaze, Aaron lifted his voice. \u201cDiana, drive on. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m not going to leave you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive. Now.\u201d</p><p>When several seconds passed and Diana failed to obey his command, a smile spread across Patched Coat\u2019s face. He swiveled the blade back and forth, taunting. \u201cI think she likes me.\u201d</p><p>Aaron swung on instinct, wanting to knock that smile straight off the bastard\u2019s face and grind his nose into the gravel. His punch connected\u2014but so did Patched Coat\u2019s blade, slashing through the wool of Aaron\u2019s coat sleeve.</p><p>They reeled apart from each other and prepared to clash again.</p><p>On some level, Aaron registered the fact that he\u2019d been cut. But his mind took the pain and stashed it away for later. He could weather far worse\u2014and he would. He was the human equivalent of an oak tree. If this bastard wanted to bring him down with that puny blade, he\u2019d have to hack at Aaron all night long.</p><p>\u201cDiana,\u201d he said, keeping his eyes on that glittering, twisting blade. \u201cFor the last time, go.\u201d</p><p>Patched Coat began to chuckle. \u201cSee now, my missus always listens to me.\u201d He lifted his voice and called to his wife. \u201cSearch the wagon while I hold him here.\u201d</p><p>A sound stopped them all cold.</p><p>The click of a pistol being cocked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Diana\u2019s voice, as cool and calm as he\u2019d ever heard it. \u201cStep away from him,\u201d she told Patched Coat. \u201cOr I will shoot.\u201d</p><p>Aaron cringed. Damn it all. Why had she refused to drive away? This couldn\u2019t end well. If she lost her nerve, she could lose her life. And if she did shoot . . . He knew Diana. Taking a life would weigh heavy on her, even if the act was justified.</p><p>\u201cStep away from him now,\u201d she repeated, \u201cor I will shoot.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give a third warning.</p><p>Bang.</p><p>As the smoke cleared, Patched Coat let out a howl of pain, clutching his right hand in his left. The hand didn\u2019t appear to be bleeding, but the knife was gone.</p><p>Good Lord. Aaron realized what had happened. She\u2019d shot the thing clean out of his hand. And the force of the weapon ripping free must have hurt\u2014perhaps broken some of his fingers or his wrist.</p><p>Good.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d the man whimpered, doubling over and nursing his wounded hand. \u201cThat sodding bitch.\u201d</p><p>Aaron had spent a lifetime staring into red-hot flames. And in that moment, he saw shades of red he\u2019d never dreamed existed. He whipped a back-handed blow across the man\u2019s face. Then he grabbed that patched overcoat by the lapels and held the despicable knave close.</p><p>\u201cI will rip out your tongue,\u201d he growled, \u201cand feed it back to you.\u201d</p><p>He drove his knee into the blackguard\u2019s gut.</p><p>He wanted to follow with a crushing punch to the jaw. Then a kick to the ribs. He could have pummeled the bastard into the mud and left him for the carrion birds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Diana\u2019s voice called to him, dragging him back from the edge of further violence. \u201cAaron, please. Please, you\u2019re bleeding. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d</p><p>Diana knew she\u2019d look back on this half hour and wonder how she\u2019d held herself together. But what mattered now was that she did. Her body and emotions went numb. Some stronger force in her had taken over the moment she\u2019d raised that pistol. All those years of staying calm paid their dividends today. She didn\u2019t fret, didn\u2019t cry. Her breathing never faltered. She simply did what needed to be done.</p><p>She drove the horses a few miles down the road, until they reached a safe place to draw the wagon aside. If she waited any longer, they\u2019d lose all daylight.</p> <p>She helped Aaron out of his coat and ripped his sleeve apart to expose his wound. Unable to see it well, she took water from their drinking supply and washed the blood away.</p><p>A narrow, clean cut, some two inches long. Unless it festered, it wasn\u2019t a life-threatening wound\u2014the wool of his coat had served as weak armor\u2014but it was significantly more than a scratch.</p><p>\u201cIt will need to be stitched,\u201d she said dispassionately.</p><p>She washed it again, making sure no fibers from his shirt and coat were caught in the wound. Then she rummaged through the goods they\u2019d purchased at the draper\u2019s until she found a needle and strong thread.</p><p>She was halfway through her third stitch when she thought she felt a drop of rain land on her head. Looking up, she realized it wasn\u2019t rain at all but a drop of Aaron\u2019s sweat. The poor man. He was shaking, slick with cold perspiration. And here she hadn\u2019t offered him anything to help with the pain\u2014not even a scrap of leather to bite down on.</p> <p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cFinish it.\u201d</p><p>After three more stitches, she was able to tie the knot off with her teeth. She wrapped a length of white, gauzy fabric about his arm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fortunate thing we came from the draper\u2019s today and not the millinery,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>He stared down at the makeshift bandage. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This was meant for your costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind the silly play. There\u2019s plenty of surplus, anyhow. I\u2019m just glad I chose to buy needle and thread today, too.\u201d</p><p>Now that the bandaging was finished, he mopped his face and composed himself. Then asked the question she\u2019d been dreading.</p> <p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that? I told you to drive. You were supposed to drive away. Like you promised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Oh, he was angry now. His voice shook with emotion, and his hands clenched in iron grips. \u201cYou put your life at risk, and Charlotte\u2019s, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron, I just couldn\u2019t leave you. It was all my fault you stopped to help them. I couldn\u2019t simply drive away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a damned lucky thing you\u2019re such a good shot. That was a risky trick, aiming for that knife. If you\u2019d missed . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did miss.\u201d And now the emotion came. Her eyes teared up, and she began to tremble. \u201cI did miss, curse you. My hand was unsteady, and I wasn\u2019t braced for the recoil. I wasn\u2019t aiming for the stupid knife. I was aiming for him.\u201d</p><p>He touched her face. \u201cOh, love.\u201d</p><p>She made an impatient swipe at her eyes. \u201cAnd just think\u2014the other day I was debating whether I could kill an eel to keep you. Tonight, when I saw that man lunge with his knife? There was no hesitation. I would have done anything, Aaron. Anything but leave you there alone.\u201d</p> <p>He was silent for a moment. Then he seized her by the arms. His grip was tight, and his voice was all rough edges.</p><p>\u201cI need to know,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to know, right now, if you\u2019re mine. I\u2019ve been patient for years, and if need be, I can wait years more. I\u2019ll do anything in my power to win you, to keep you. But I need to know, this moment, if you\u2019ll be mine in the end.\u201d His hands moved to bracket her face, uncomfortably tight. His gaze burned into hers. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>With every wild beat, her heart thumped against his pendant.</p><p>If she was looking for answers, she didn\u2019t need to search any further than that.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed. \u201cY\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she could say it twice, his lips were on hers.</p><p>And then his hands were everywhere. He thrust them under her cloak, making contact with her shivering body. He cupped her breasts through her frock, slid his hands downward to explore her hips and thighs. The bold possession of his touch stirred her blood. There was nothing of finesse or seduction in his touch. Only claiming. Raw, primal need.</p><p>As he ran his tongue along her neck and caught her earlobe in his teeth, he swept one hand down her leg and tossed up the edge of her skirts.</p><p>She was visited again by that dizzy, arousing thought from the time before she knew anything of him. From before any of this was possible.</p><p>His wrist is as big as my ankle.</p><p>Indeed, his fingers encircled her stockinged ankle easily, and she could visualize the corded tendons of his forearm flexing as he stroked higher, higher. Up to her knee, and higher still.</p><p>Between her legs, her pulse beat as a sweet, hollow ache.</p><p>\u201cDiana,\u201d he groaned. \u201cI want to be in you. Deep in the heart of you.\u201d</p><p>This was madness. It could not happen. Not here, not now. But she wanted it, too, and the all-consuming nature of her desire was a revelation. What a joy to want. To want so fiercely, with all her being, without moderation or reserve.</p><p>She was new to this, and the sort of coarse, thrilling words he whispered did not come easily to her lips.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d At least she could manage that much. \u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand higher, over her garter and up. His touch was a brand against her bare, shivering thigh.</p><p>She clutched his neck, urging him further. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Until Charlotte moaned and stirred in the wagon bed, and they jolted apart.</p><p>Her whole body mourned the loss. Her nipples, tight and achy, strained toward him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten her.\u201d She clapped a hand to her brow.</p><p>Aaron chuckled between ragged breaths. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she slept through everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always been that way. Slept like a stone, ever since she was a baby. I\u2019ll be hard-pressed to make her believe any of this tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t try. I think you\u2019d do better to keep it between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Aaron . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to tell Charlotte about the swindler or the fight, but they wouldn\u2019t be able to hide their relationship much longer.</p><p>\u201cWait until Thursday,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to talk with Lord Payne before we make any plans. I\u2019ve had my differences with the man, and I didn\u2019t care for the way he behaved when he eloped with your sister . . . but I\u2019m determined to do better myself. He\u2019s your brother-in-law and the man of the family. I don\u2019t need his permission, but I want to speak with him about this\u2014about us\u2014and hear what he has to say. All right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his brow to hers and caressed her lips with a tender kiss. \u201cThere\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>As they kissed, her muzzy thoughts swarmed in two opposite directions, one sublime and one utterly mundane.</p><p>The sublime: She was his girl. His girl. His girl.</p><p>The mundane: Now she really had to practice that ridiculous play.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>\u201cUrsula was simply too missish to live.\u201d The next day, in the parlor of the Queen\u2019s Ruby, Charlotte flipped through the booklet and made a face. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle no one beheaded her earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the vicar,\u201d Diana replied, \u201ceven the Church now believes her story is a myth. But I still think we should show some respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow respect for my nerves,\u201d Mama interjected. \u201cCharlotte, pass me the vinaigrette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Mama. It\u2019s missing.\u201d Charlotte arched a brow at Diana, then slid a glance toward Miss Bertram. \u201cI told you there\u2019s a pattern,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMissing? Nonsense. It must be here somewhere.\u201d Mama rose and began to poke about the room.</p><p>\u201cThe play,\u201d Diana said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be helping me learn my lines.\u201d</p><p>Now that Aaron would be in attendance, she actually wanted to do well. Of course, Mama had completely misinterpreted her intentions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re finally making an effort, Diana. Lord Drewe cannot fail to be impressed.\u201d</p><p>Diana bit back an objection. These few remaining days before Thursday would be her mother\u2019s final days to believe she had an obedient, well-intentioned daughter with excellent prospects. She wasn\u2019t looking forward to the aftermath, when Mama learned the truth.</p><p>Diana opened her booklet to the first page. \u201cOh, wreck and WOE. My father hath betrothed me to the son of a pagan king. I would sooner DIE than be so defiled.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t read her part. \u201cI\u2019m finding it hard to sympathize with my role as Cordula,\u201d she complained. \u201cIf I were friends with this Ursula, I would have shaken some sense into her. I mean, really. So her parents betrothed her to a pagan prince, and she doesn\u2019t want to marry him. But instead of just saying she doesn\u2019t wish to marry him, she asks for a delay and sets sail with eleven thousand of her closest virgin friends, floating about on the ocean for three years.\u201d</p><p>Diana shrugged. \u201cIt sounds rather like a seafaring version of Spindle Cove. Perhaps they amused themselves with theatricals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t study celestial navigation, I know that much. Because after three years of drifting, she lands a scant hundred miles away on the shores of France.\u201d</p><p>Miss Bertram spoke up. \u201cMr. Evermoore and I have dreamed of taking the Grand Tour. Now that the war\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course you have.\u201d Charlotte rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGo on with Saint Ursula,\u201d Diana prompted, anxious for Miss Bertram\u2019s feelings.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best part. Where her army of virgins . . .\u201d Charlotte giggled. \u201cI mean, really. Can you imagine eleven thousand virgins, swarming en masse over the fields of Gaul? They must have been like a plague of locusts, stripping the fields bare and sucking the rivers dry as they went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s why it\u2019s a myth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So the Mythical Virgin Swarm makes it as far as Cologne before running straight into a wall of marauding Huns. Naturally, Ursula refuses to see them as husband material. But does she put up any fight? No. Just . . .\u201d</p><p>Charlotte drew her finger across her neck and made a grisly slicing sound. \u201cToo missish to live. If she did truly live at all\u2014which history, the Church, and common sense seem to suggest she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t learn from her,\u201d Diana said.</p><p>Exhausted by her fruitless search for the vinaigrette, Mama sank into the nearest chair and snapped open her fan. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Diana. The moral of the play is clear. Ursula should have married as her parents wished. I\u2019m sure they had good reasons for choosing Meriadoc. He was a prince, and probably quite wealthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. \u201d Charlotte strangled the air in a gesture of frustration. \u201cThat\u2019s not the moral at all. What Ursula ought to have done was stand up for herself. If she\u2019d had one good foot-stamping row with her parents and said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to marry your filthy heathen prince, so there,\u2019 she would have saved herself\u2014and her eleven thousand friends\u2014a great deal of trouble.\u201d</p><p>She fixed Diana with a pointed gaze.</p><p>Diana wasn\u2019t sure what her sister was getting at. But it made her uncomfortable. Had Charlotte somehow guessed at her relationship with Aaron?</p><p>\u201cYou are right, Miss Charlotte.\u201d Miss Bertram shot to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to write to my parents this instant and tell them I cannot be parted from Mr. Evermoore. No matter how they disapprove.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Miss Bertram stormed from the room, Charlotte grumbled, \u201cAt least someone is convinced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we just rehearse?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed!\u201d Mama said. \u201cDiana must learn her lines by heart. You can be assured that Lord Drewe will know his. How many scenes do you have with him, Diana? Is there a kiss?\u201d</p> <p>Diana threw down the booklet in exasperation. \u201cUrsula dies a virgin, Mother. It\u2019s the whole point of the play. There is no marriage. No kiss.\u201d</p><p>What would Mama say if she knew Diana had kissed Aaron three times now?</p><p>Charlotte was right. Diana wanted to respect Aaron\u2019s wishes about speaking with her brother-in-law first, but that didn\u2019t mean she had to keep up this farce regarding Lord Drewe.</p><p>\u201cMama, I am not going to marry Lord Drewe. He hasn\u2019t asked. He isn\u2019t likely to ask. And even if he did ask, I would refuse him.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte pumped her fists in a silent cheer.</p> <p>Her mother pressed a hand to her heart. She blinked rapidly. Diana began to wonder if she should have saved this speech until after they\u2019d located the missing vinaigrette.</p><p>When at last Mama spoke, it was quietly. \u201cI am so proud of you, Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . . you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I am proud of you, my dear. And I have felt the same in my own heart, but been reluctant to say it. As long as you\u2019ve waited to marry, there should be no compromise.\u201d</p><p>Diana was stunned speechless. If she\u2019d known it would be this easy, she would have initiated this discussion years ago.</p><p>\u201cYou are right,\u201d Mama went on. \u201cYou cannot marry the Marquess of Drewe. We must hold out for a duke.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, Lord.</p><p>Across from her, Charlotte made the throat-slicing slash and collapsed on the divan.</p><p>Since the sky\u2019s war on Spindle Cove seemed to be in a temporary cease-fire, Aaron found himself inordinately busy at the forge. Farmers were making use of the break in the rain to shoe their horses and get their hoes, harrows, and plowshares in working order.</p><p>Of course, this flurry of business would happen on precisely the few days Aaron wished to have the smithy to himself. He was finding it difficult to steal daylight to work on Diana\u2019s ring. Instead, he worked at the mold by night, lighting unprecedented numbers of candles at his kitchen table.</p><p>At last he was finished, and he managed to scrape up an hour to cast the thing. He heated the gold in a crucible and poured it into the mold. When it cooled, he held it up for inspection.</p><p>Not bad. But not good enough. He\u2019d tweak the mold and melt it down again.</p><p>As he lowered the ring, he caught a flash of golden-blond hair headed straight up his lane. At any other time, he would have been thrilled to see her, but now?</p><p>Devil. Blast. Shite.</p> <p>Hastily, he shoved the unfinished ring and all accompanying evidence aside, tossing a rag over the lot of it just as she entered the forge.</p><p>And after all that effort\u2014the golden-blond hair didn\u2019t belong to Diana at all.</p><p>\u201cMiss Charlotte,\u201d he said, wiping the sweat from his brow. \u201cThis is a surprise. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>She made herself at home, settling on a stool. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a mysterious rash of thefts at the Queen\u2019s Ruby. Diana\u2019s thimble. Mrs. Nichols\u2019s ink bottle. Mama\u2019s lorgnette, my vinaigrette, and sundry loose coins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t seem to add up to much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt adds up to a pattern,\u201d she said. \u201cA mystery. I\u2019ve appointed myself investigator, and I\u2019m making interviews. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>She took out a notebook and pencil. \u201cNow, then. Mr. Dawes, do you have any idea who might have taken the missing objects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that I do, Miss Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone brought any suspicious items to the forge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. Just one last question.\u201d She lowered her notebook. \u201cDo you mean to marry my sister?\u201d</p><p>Aaron looked up at her, startled. \u201cWhat does that have to do with missing trinkets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Miss Charlotte shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just proving my powers of deduction, that\u2019s all. I may not know who\u2019s been filching things around the rooming house\u2014yet\u2014but I know there\u2019s something between you and Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen when . . . ?\u201d God. He hoped she hadn\u2019t witnessed them on the way home from Hastings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known for more than a year! After I missed the signs when Minerva eloped, I made a commitment to observation. I\u2019ve long known she fancied you.\u201d Her head tilted. \u201cIf you do mean to propose, you will have to confront my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Aaron didn\u2019t know how to refute the idea. So he didn\u2019t. \u201cI know I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a plan of attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttack?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s bow-shaped mouth quirked. \u201cThis is my mother you\u2019re dealing with. She\u2019s a dragon. Arm yourself. Gird your loins. Gather your courage and your best steel. And yes, formulate a plan of attack.\u201d</p><p>Aaron just shook his head. He knew the matron would be surprised and displeased, to say the least, but he didn\u2019t want to see Mrs. Highwood as an enemy. He was usually good with mothers and sisters.</p><p>Miss Charlotte brought out a fan from her reticule, snapped it open, and began to work it vigorously. \u201cHere. Let\u2019s play a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you ladies enjoy your theatricals, but I don\u2019t count acting among my talents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to act. You\u2019re you. And I\u2019m my mother.\u201d She adopted a high, screeching tone. \u201cMy Diana, marry a blacksmith? Of all the horrid, unthinkable notions. She will marry a lord. If not a duke! She is the beauty of the family, as everyone knows.\u201d</p><p>Aaron sighed under his breath. He tried to exercise patience with the matriarch of the Highwood family, knowing most of her excesses were born out of a desire for her daughters\u2019 well-being. But he heartily disliked the way she compared the Highwood sisters against each other.</p><p>\u201cMiss Charlotte, you are a very pretty girl. Well on the way to becoming a beauty in your own right.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cI wasn\u2019t fishing for compliments. I\u2019m pretty enough, but Diana is the beauty of the family. Just like Minerva\u2019s the brains of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled proudly. \u201cThe spirit, of course. Now come along.\u201d She fluttered the fan. \u201cArgue back.\u201d</p><p>Aaron wiped his hands on a rag and sat down across from her. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing of it, Miss Charlotte. If your sister married me, it would affect your whole family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally. Diana will live here, and Min and I should always have a reason to visit Spindle Cove. That will make all three of us happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I mean. Your own prospects. You\u2019re going to have your season in London soon. And I suspect you want that excitement, even if it didn\u2019t suit your sisters. If Miss Diana marries this far beneath her station\u201d\u2014he quelled Charlotte\u2019s objection with a hand gesture\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s bound to be gossip. Fewer invitations, fewer suitors . . .\u201d</p><p>He could tell his words were sinking in. She shifted uncomfortably on her stool.</p><p>\u201cListen, Mr. Dawes. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve understood. I\u2019m meant to be my mother in this scene we\u2019re playing, and you\u2019re stealing all her lines.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019ve realized something. If there\u2019s a member of the Highwood family I must approach for permission, it\u2019s not your mother. It\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>She sat tall. \u201cWell. Don\u2019t I feel important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are important. I know Diana wouldn\u2019t like to see you hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to see Diana hurt, either, Mr. Dawes. And yet I\u2019ve watched her hurting ever since I could remember. I\u2019ve held her hand through horrid, endless minutes when she struggled to simply breathe. While I would run and climb and play, she was always kept indoors. I was young then, but I\u2019ve grown up now. I won\u2019t have her penned up for another two years just so I can dance and make merry in Town.\u201d Her gaze lifted to his. \u201cI want, very much, to see my sister happy. If it\u2019s my blessing you need, you have it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cVery well, then. But you may regret this when the London bucks come chasing after you and your brother-in-law threatens them with a red-hot poker.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would. Ask my own sisters.\u201d He rubbed his face. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. I haven\u2019t properly proposed.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte hopped down from the stool and reached for her cloak. \u201cThat\u2019s one answer you needn\u2019t worry about.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>On Thursday, Aaron took his time getting ready.</p><p>After a thorough dousing at the pump, he shaved as close as he could manage. Tonight had to be perfect. He thought of the women making ready at the Queen\u2019s Ruby. All the ladies flitting and hurrying about in their underthings, trading ribbons and hairpins.</p><p>Diana, rolling a pale silk stocking up her leg.</p><p>That mental picture earned him a nick beneath his jaw. He examined the red line in the tiny looking glass and swore. So much for perfect.</p><p>He donned a new starched shirt, holding the collar as wide as possible so as not to spot the thing with blood. As he wrestled with his cuffs, he tried not to remind himself that a proper gentleman would have a valet to help him with these things. Last came his cleaned and mended brown coat\u2014still the best he had, even after the roadside brawl.</p><p>Good thing he didn\u2019t possess a full-length mirror, or it surely would have reflected a picture of discouragement.</p><p>What sort of miracle was he trying to work, anyhow? She knew him. It wasn\u2019t as though he could fool her into thinking he was something loftier than a village blacksmith.</p><p>He started out the door and was halfway through saddling his horse when he stopped short.</p><p>In his agitation, he\u2019d nearly forgotten the ring. Of all the things to forget. It was the one item he had to recommend him, after all.</p><p>He opened the small lockbox in his bedchamber and pulled it out, letting it glitter on the palm of his hand. He\u2019d used gold\u2014it suited her golden hair, and it was the finest. The band was adorned with leaves, with a small center ruby set amid diamond petals. Even if she wouldn\u2019t marry him, he wanted her to have this. It was the best of him, and the best he knew how to offer.</p><p>His guts were in knots. This was absurd.</p><p>He was who he was. She would have him, or she wouldn\u2019t. After tonight, he\u2019d know.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dawes!\u201d The voice came from the smithy. \u201cMr. Dawes!\u201d</p><p>Aaron slipped the ring in his breast pocket before walking out and around to the front. He found Cora Maidstone, the daughter of one of the local farmers. From the state of her flushed cheeks and muddied hem, he surmised she\u2019d run all the way here.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my father,\u201d she said, breathless. \u201cOur mare\u2019s been tetchy lately, and she rolled him. Broke his leg. Bad.\u201d</p><p>Aaron passed a hand over his face. The Maidstone family, like so many of the farming families, lived year to year. This was planting season, and his sons weren\u2019t old enough yet to take on the plowing. If that leg didn\u2019t heal properly\u2014or didn\u2019t heal at all\u2014the whole family could starve.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s hurting something fierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Give me a moment.\u201d</p><p>He strode back into his cottage, shrugged out of his coat, and slung it on a hook. He gathered an apron and the kit of laudanum, bandages, and such that Lady Rycliff had given him to keep on hand for bonesettings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Last, he put that gold and ruby ring back into the lockbox and shut it tight. There\u2019d be no theatricals or parties for him today. He had work to do, and there was no way around it.</p><p>He was who he was.</p><p>As for whether Diana would have him\u2014he could only pray she\u2019d give him another chance to ask.</p> <p>Several fatiguing, bloody hours later, Aaron rode through the village on his way back. It was out of his way, but something wouldn\u2019t let him go home until he passed by the cheerful fa\u00e7ade of the Queen\u2019s Ruby, with its begonia-stuffed window boxes and green shutters.</p><p>He stared up at the window he knew to be hers. Dark, like all the others. Ambervale was a few hours\u2019 distance, and it would likely be almost dawn before the ladies returned home. Aaron hated to imagine what Diana would think of him, promising to attend and then failing to appear. He should have thought to send word at least, but there hadn\u2019t been time.</p><p>Well, there was nothing for it but to apologize tomorrow.</p><p>He nudged his horse and turned down the lane that led home. As he neared the cottage, he saw a weak light burning from within. Strange. In his hurry, he must have neglected to extinguish his lamp before leaving.</p><p>He took his time putting up the horse, making sure the mare had water, feed, and a good brushing down. Then Aaron had a glance at himself and grimaced. The fresh new shirt he\u2019d worn for the occasion was spattered with blood. He gave a grim chuckle, thinking of how he\u2019d been so careful not to mar it with the smallest drop from his shaving accident.</p> <p>Right there by the pump, he yanked the shirt loose of his waistband, pulled it over his head, and cast it into a bucket of water to soak. No use bringing the thing inside. Then he doused his own head, torso, and hands, washing away all the evidence of that evening\u2019s miserable, bloody work. Finally, he stood erect, pushed the water from his face and hair, and went into the cottage.</p><p>She was there. Sitting at his table, head rested on her stacked arms.</p><p>\u201cDiana?\u201d</p><p>She woke with a start, her eyes wide and unfocused until they settled on him. \u201cAaron. You\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. And you\u2019re here. What about Ambervale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told everyone I had a miserable headache and begged Miss Bertram to read my part. I didn\u2019t go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe heard from one of the inn\u2019s girls about Mr. Maidstone\u2019s accident. And I knew you\u2019d be called to help. How is he?\u201d</p><p>Aaron sighed and rubbed his jaw. \u201cHe\u2019ll live. His leg\u2019s set as best I could manage. It was a bad break, and it will take months to heal. But if he gives it time, it should heal cleanly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing your face is a relief. I worried what you\u2019d think when I didn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to come help you, but I decided I\u2019d only be in the way. But I knew you\u2019d be famished once it was over. And perhaps needing some company, too.\u201d She averted her gaze, and her eyelashes fluttered.</p><p>It suddenly occurred to him that he was standing before her shirtless. And that she\u2019d noticed. Her wide-eyed, sleepy gaze wandered over every damp contour of his arms and chest. But she sat between him and the bedchamber, where all his other clothing hung. Improper as it was for her to see him half dressed, he couldn\u2019t clothe himself without drawing imprudently near . . . so he simply did nothing at all.</p><p>Well, he did clear his throat.</p> <p>Her gaze snapped up to his face.</p><p>She pushed to her feet. \u201cI brought over some dinner.\u201d As she indicated the covered dishes on the table, her mouth pulled to the side in a self-deprecating smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t cook it myself. It\u2019s just odds and ends from the Queen\u2019s Ruby kitchen.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say\u2014the fact that she\u2019d known, that she\u2019d given up the evening\u2019s amusement to be with him. Her thoughtfulness wasn\u2019t any sort of surprise, but still . . . His heart insisted it meant so much more.</p><p>And she was so damned beautiful. Whatever gown or costume she\u2019d been meant to wear for the theatrical, it had been hung away again. She wore one of her simplest, everyday frocks. But her hair was still put up in careful coils and ringlets, like an artifact of the revelry she\u2019d forfeited tonight.</p><p>He drew close and caught a lock of that lovely golden hair, wrapping it around his finger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you missed the outing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cI mean, it couldn\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it could. You needn\u2019t have stayed home. I know you were looking forward to seeing your sister and your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was mostly looking forward to you.\u201d</p><p>He skimmed a touch down her cheek, overwhelmed\u2014and at a loss to imagine what he\u2019d ever done to deserve those words. To deserve this woman.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Perhaps I should get some plates and\u2014\u201c</p><p>He pulled her into a kiss.</p><p>He was hungry, yes. Hungry for her. His soul was starved for just this.</p><p>He\u2019d been returning to this house, to this very room, every night of his life. But this was the first time in a long time it felt like truly coming home.</p><p>She was soft and welcoming. She smelled so damned good.</p><p>He cinched an arm tight about her slender waist, trapping her arms against his bare chest. Her fingertips explored, stroked, caressed. And then slowly slid upward, until she wreathed her arms about his neck and held him tight.</p><p>They kissed and touched. He put a hand to her breast, kneading and shaping. She sighed, arching into his caress. Begging for more. He pulled her up against him, insinuating one thigh between her legs. She rewarded him with a husky moan and a deep, demanding kiss.</p><p>It was night. They were alone, and no one was going to interrupt them. In the other room, a bed beckoned. He was already half undressed. It didn\u2019t take a fortune-teller to see where this was going.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want this . . .\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even complete the sentence. Want this, he silently pleaded. Want this\u2014want me, want this life we could share\u2014as much as I want you.</p><p>\u201cI want this,\u201d she whispered. Her hips rolled against the firm slope of his thigh, sending streaks of raw lust through him. \u201cAaron, I . . . I want it so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a question I meant to ask you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her blue eyes tipped up, meeting his gaze directly. \u201cI came here to say yes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even make a reply.</p><p>Because there was nothing left to say. If she wanted him, he was hers. Tonight, tomorrow, always.</p><p>He swept her off her feet and into his arms. Her little shriek of laughter delighted him. He\u2019d been wanting to do that since the first.</p><p>As he laid her down, he wished he had a better bed. A plusher mattress on a hardwood frame. Softer linens and quilts. But none of these misgivings were enough to dampen his lust. Not in the least. As he slid a hand under her skirts, his cock felt like a rod of steel in his trousers. He hadn\u2019t known this pitch of erotic desperation since he was a youth of sixteen.</p><p>Nevertheless, he resolved to take things slowly. He knew her pleasure must come first, or it wasn\u2019t likely to happen at all.</p><p>As he fumbled with the hooks down the back of her frock, nerves swarmed him like agitated bees. He hoped to God he could make this good for her. He\u2019d never bedded a virgin. Hell, he hadn\u2019t been with any woman in quite some time.</p><p>He\u2019d spent his youth working too hard to chase after girls. Eventually, a friendly widow in the next village had taken him in hand\u2014and taken him in plenty of other ways, teaching him the lay of the female landscape. They\u2019d had an easy friendship, but he\u2019d broken it off when he\u2019d started courting the schoolteacher. And after the schoolteacher had dropped him, he\u2019d wasted a few evenings carousing in town to soothe his wounded pride.</p><p>And that was the sum of it.</p><p>Here he was, a virile, red-blooded man of seven-and-twenty, and he could count his lovers on one hand. His hand, of course, being the most familiar lover of all.</p><p>Diana\u2019s hands were a welcome improvement. They were soft. So soft, and so wonderfully curious. As he tugged down the bodice of her frock, she skimmed inquisitive touches up his arms, across his shoulders, down the planes of his chest. Awakening his every nerve and whipping his heartbeat to a gallop.</p><p>He removed her frock and carefully laid it aside, leaving her clad in a sweet, simple chemise and stockings. Silk stockings, from the feel of them. He ran a hand up her calf, imagining the feel of her legs locked around his waist. Just the thought made him groan with anticipated pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYou like them?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey\u2019re my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t change when you decided to stay home.\u201d He touched the edge of her ribbon garter, but he didn\u2019t untie it.</p><p>She gave him a kittenish smile. \u201cOh, I did change. I put these on for you.\u201d</p><p>Lust streaked through him, nearly cleaving him in half. Neither of them were even naked yet, and he was already primed to spill.</p><p>\u201cGod, I love you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the eloquent confession she deserved. But something in him had to erupt, and words seemed the safest quantity.</p><p>She laughed and kissed him. As their tongues danced, he sent his fingers to undo the tiny buttons queued down the front of her shift. There were hundreds, it seemed.</p><p>At last he\u2019d loosened enough of those buttons to draw the edges apart and slide his hand inside.</p><p>Sweet heaven.</p><p>He was a smith. He worked with hard, solid, unforgiving materials all day long. But this . . . Ah, this was softness.</p><p>Nothing could compare to the sensation of her breast filling his hand. Nothing. He stroked, lifted, kneaded, teased. He couldn\u2019t get enough of touching her.</p><p>He dropped his head, trailing kisses down her neck and breastbone, wrenching the edges of her shift aside until the rest of the buttons popped free. He paused just long enough to register the color of her nipple\u2014a pale, tawny pink\u2014before taking it in his mouth.</p><p>She gasped and sighed. Her fingers wove tight in his hair.</p><p>With one hand, he raised the hem of her shift, taking time to savor the glide of silk before seeking the delicate folds of her sex. She parted her thighs with an eager innocence, but from there progress slowed.</p><p>She was so small, so tight. Just working a single finger into her sheath took ages. And as men went, Aaron knew he was on the larger side. His past lovers had been glad of it. But in this situation . . .</p><p>Gathering all of his patience, he stroked that single finger in and out, all the while suckling her breasts and rubbing the heel of his palm against her pearl. Her erotic, breathy moans encouraged him, as did the increasing heat.</p><p>But when he tried to add a second finger, she tensed all over.</p><p>He withdrew his touch at once, cursing his rough workman\u2019s hands. He drew her shift down, covering her to the knees.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to fear this. And I can\u2019t bear to cause you any pain.\u201d The words were hell to get out, but he knew he must. \u201cPerhaps we should wait.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes glistened with emotion. Her kiss-swollen lips parted, spilling the most un-Diana-Highwood words he\u2019d ever heard her speak.</p><p>\u201cLike the devil we should.\u201d</p><p>Diana savored his blank look of surprise.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t accustomed to such language from her. She wasn\u2019t accustomed to using such language. But on this point, propriety could go hang. She wouldn\u2019t leave any room for ambiguity.</p><p>This needed to happen. Tonight.</p><p>She struggled up on her elbow, turning onto her side so that they faced one another on the bed. \u201cAaron, I was attracted to you from our first acquaintance. Infatuated with you not long after. But I fell in love with you because you put the reins in my hands. You trusted me to know my own mind, and you gave me the courage to follow my heart. That\u2019s the reason I\u2019m here tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stroked her arm. \u201cIf you tell me you\u2019re certain . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain. All my life I\u2019ve kept a safe distance from my own emotions. No longer. If fear is part of this, then I want to feel fear. Pain, as well. And joy and anxiousness and need and pleasure and . . . and everything, all at once. I want to experience all of it, and I want it with you.\u201d</p><p>A finality settled on his features. \u201cThen you\u2019ll have it.\u201d</p> <p>Yes. Feeling triumphant, Diana relaxed back onto the bed, stretching her limbs in a sinuous plea for his touch.</p><p>He caressed her with his eyes first, sweeping a determined gaze over her body.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand pleasure?\u201d His hand eased between her thighs, cupping her sex through her shift. \u201cThis will go much easier if you reach climax first.\u201d</p><p>He asked her the question so baldly. Even hopefully. She answered with the truth. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His voice was a low, dark thrum. \u201cGood.\u201d</p> <p>She arched her back, pushing into his touch.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShow me what pleases you.\u201d</p><p>Her boldness faltered. There was admission, and then there was demonstration. But she pressed her eyes closed, gathered her courage, and reached down to cover his hand with her own. She didn\u2019t guide him under her shift but pressed his fingers to her flesh through the muslin, working the smooth, strong friction in just the right place.</p><p>Once he\u2019d established a rhythm, she relaxed her grip and melted against the mattress. He kissed her breasts, her ears, her neck. His skillful touch and talented mouth were arousing sensations different from any she\u2019d ever experienced. This wasn\u2019t a moment\u2019s gratification in the bathing tub. This was an ocean. A vast sea of pleasure, swirling around her, lifting and tossing her in ways she couldn\u2019t control.</p><p>The only course was surrender.</p><p>Her breath grew ragged, and she writhed, uneasy, on the bed. He fitted his mouth over her nipple and drew hard, teasing the tip with wicked lashings of his tongue. The joy was so acute. A delicious urgency bloomed and spread through her whole body. She dug her heel into the mattress, rolling her hips to meet his touch.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered, abandoning one nipple just long enough to catch the other. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>He removed his hand from between her legs. She whimpered at the deprivation, until he moved to cover her with the full length of his body. He still wore his trousers, but the sheer heat and weight of him were sensual gifts. The hair on his chest teased her sensitized nipples. His hips nudged her thighs wide, and then the smooth, thick column of his trapped erection settled snug in her cleft.</p><p>Yes. This. The firm, perfect pressure was just what she\u2019d needed. He moved against her in a slow, tantalizing rhythm, and she rode his motions.</p><p>\u201cAaron.\u201d She clutched at his shoulders and neck, holding on for her life as the pleasure tugged her in ten different directions.</p><p>And then it all came together in one brilliant, shattering wave of joy.</p><p>No sooner had her climax ebbed than he was backing away, yanking at the buttons on his trousers and cursing his boots as he stripped to his skin. He pushed her shift to the waist, gazing boldly on her most intimate places. But before she could think to squirm or shy from him, he\u2019d settled atop her again.</p><p>His thighs were hard against hers, and covered with hair, much like his chest. The smooth, broad crown of his manhood prodded at her core.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know that I can wait much longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve both waited long enough.\u201d</p><p>His hips flexed, and he pushed forward.</p><p>Inside her.</p><p>She buried her face in his neck, determined not to cry out.</p><p>He cursed. \u201cIt will be better next time. I promise.\u201d</p><p>It hurt. It hurt fiercely\u2014so much that only the tang of blood made her aware that she\u2019d bitten her lip.</p><p>It will be better next time, she consoled herself as a series of slow, persistent thrusts took him deeper. Brought them closer. It will be better next time.</p><p>But once she\u2019d reconciled herself to the promise of Next time. . .</p><p>This time started to feel rather good.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t climax again. That wasn\u2019t even a question. But the sublime feeling of being needed, desired, loved with such vigor and passion . . . this was a new, intoxicating pleasure all its own. She held him tight, loving the feel of his flexing, straining muscles as he buried his length deep at the heart of her, then strove to go deeper still.</p><p>His motions quickened, grew less elegant and controlled. Her breathing was labored in a way that would have alarmed her in her youth.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>He kept his weight balanced on his elbows, and she curled her neck to kiss him on the chest, the neck . . . anywhere she could reach. She ran her tongue along his collarbone, feeling brazen and seductive.</p><p>With a strangled groan, he slid one hand to her backside, holding her tight for a final barrage of thrusts. His face twisted into a mask of torturous pleasure.</p><p>At last, he slumped atop her, growling and shuddering with the force of completion. Filling her deep.</p><p>He remained inside her, slowly softening as his labored breath caressed her neck.</p><p>He was quiet and still for a long, long time. Because they\u2019d earned this, too\u2014this refuge in each other. In all her life, she\u2019d never felt so perfectly loved and safe.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know,\u201d he finally whispered into her hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve wanted this.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, seeking his kiss. \u201cI think I have some idea.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Diana slept late the next morning. She assumed everyone in the Queen\u2019s Ruby would.</p><p>She\u2019d been back safe in her own bed for less than an hour before the carriages had rattled into the village center. The girls had come tromping up the stairs, giggling and whispering to one another. It would seem they\u2019d managed to have their fun without Diana\u2019s help. She was glad of it. Part of her had been tempted to come out of her room and ask for all the details. She wanted to hear all the news of Kate and Minerva.</p><p>But she\u2019d decided there would be time enough for those questions in the morning. Her night with Aaron had left her blissfully sapped of strength, and she was supposed to be ill.</p><p>So when Charlotte had opened her door a crack and whispered a cautious \u201cDiana?\u201dshe hadn\u2019t answered but pretended to be asleep. And then she\u2019d fallen asleep in truth.</p><p>She slept hard. Her body had earned it.</p><p>When she woke, she could hear the sounds of breakfast. Her chamber was situated directly above the dining room, and she knew well that distant murmur of porcelain and cutlery, delivered on air scented of buttered toast.</p><p>She rose, washed, and dressed in her favorite frock, then clattered down the stairs.</p><p>No, not clattered.</p><p>She floated down the stairs.</p><p>She was in love. She was getting married. She would have a sweet little cottage in this village she\u2019d come to think of as home, and she and Aaron would build a life and a family together. It might not be the future her mother had planned, but it was more happiness than Diana had ever dreamed she\u2019d grasp.</p><p>And by the end of today, everyone would know the truth.</p><p>In the corridor, she slowed, intrigued by the sounds coming from the dining room.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming,\u201d someone whispered.</p><p>A roar of shushing ensued. There was a rattle of panicked flatware.</p><p>Then Diana turned the corner and entered the dining room, and everyone fell completely, eerily silent.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>One of the girls set down her spoon. \u201cSee, I told you she\u2019d know nothing about it. It couldn\u2019t have been her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Fanny.\u201d Miss Price cleared her throat and looked Diana over. \u201cYou look quite well this morning, Miss Highwood. One would never know you were ill last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Diana spoke slowly, not liking the suspicious tone in Miss Price\u2019s voice. \u201cI am feeling much improved.\u201d</p><p>All of the ladies regarded her warily, even as they sent speaking glances to each other.</p><p>Diana\u2019s heart began to pound.</p><p>Oh, Lord. They knew. They all knew. Someone had noticed her sneaking out to see Aaron. Or sneaking back in afterward.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it of her,\u201d one girl whispered.</p><p>\u201cBut it couldn\u2019t have been anyone else,\u201d another replied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably a compulsion. I\u2019ve heard of it happening with some girls. They know it\u2019s wrong, but they can\u2019t help themselves.\u201d</p><p>A compulsion?</p><p>No, no, no. Diana wasn\u2019t suffering any compulsion. She was in love. She was floating. That\u2019s what she\u2019d wanted everyone to see today. Not sordidness.</p><p>Instead, they all looked at her sideways and whispered behind their hands.</p><p>This was ruination, she realized. Her twenty-three years of delicate refinement didn\u2019t matter anymore. Everyone stared at her with revulsion and fear in their eyes. As though her pretty blue frock had been soiled with soot\u2014and if they came too close, it might stain them, too.</p><p>She felt truly ill now. What would they think of her? What would this mean for Charlotte?</p><p>One thing was certain\u2014their image of the perfect Miss Highwood was now irretrievably shattered.</p><p>Miss Price elbowed her neighbor. \u201cDo it. Someone has to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m the landlady. It should be me.\u201d Dear old Mrs. Nichols rose from her seat and clasped her hands together in an attitude of prayer. \u201cDiana, dear,\u201d she began gently. \u201cDid you have anything to tell us? Anything at all, about last night?\u201d</p><p>The rain was back. With a vengeance.</p><p>Aaron didn\u2019t know what to do with himself. All the Queen\u2019s Ruby ladies would surely be sleeping in today, Diana included. He couldn\u2019t go call on her until late afternoon, and there wasn\u2019t much sense braving this downpour to go anywhere else. He\u2019d looked in on Mr. Maidstone early that morning, after walking Diana back to the rooming house.</p><p>He decided to start on a wrought-iron gate for the front garden. He\u2019d long been planning to replace the humble wooden one. He\u2019d just never found the time.</p><p>Today, he had all the time he wished.</p><p>He built a roaring fire in the forge and took out a length of squared stock. To make spiraling balusters for the gate, he needed to heat the iron to a glowing yellow, crank furiously to secure it in a table vise, grasp the end of the rod with tongs, then twist the metal in as many rotations as he could manage before it cooled.</p><p>Then repeat the whole business again. And again.</p><p>It was hard, sweaty work\u2014and just the distraction he needed today.</p><p>He\u2019d been at it for an hour or two when he saw a figure hurrying up the lane. Who would come out in this weather? He hoped it wasn\u2019t the Maidstone girl again, come to tell him her father had taken a turn for the worse.</p><p>But when the door burst open, in came Diana.</p><p>She removed her cloak and hung it on a peg near the door, then played stork by standing on one foot, then the other, tugging off the canvas gaiters covering her shoes.</p><p>Aaron merely stood and stared, letting his rod of twisted iron go cool in the vise. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out in this weather. You\u2019ll catch cold.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps he should have greeted her with Good day, or What a pleasant surprise, or Did I tell you last night that I love you to the depths of my soul? But he couldn\u2019t be bothered with pleasantries now. She\u2019d pledged herself to him, always. He wanted \u201calways\u201d to be a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cI just needed to see you. To talk to you. It couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d She hurried toward him.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said.</p><p>She stopped, taken aback.</p><p>He cursed his thoughtlessness again. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to bark at you. But have a care for your hem and slippers.\u201d</p><p>He nodded at the ground.</p><p>She\u2019d crossed from the paved half of the smithy and trod straight onto the cinders, dragging her damp flounce through the packed soot. That sort of soil was near impossible to clean. Anyone who saw it would know where she\u2019d been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m cold. I want to be nearer the fire. And you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen put your hands on my shoulders.\u201d When she complied, he slid a forearm under her hips and lifted, boosting her to sit on the anvil. He kept his hand clenched and out of the way, to keep from mussing her frock.</p><p>But once he had here there, sitting sweetly on his anvil . . .</p> <p>By God, he wanted to muss her all over.</p><p>Five minutes ago, he would have sworn there was no sight on earth more enticing than Miss Diana Highwood in her china-blue frock.</p><p>But he was wrong.</p><p>There was a sight more enticing. It was Miss Diana Highwood in her china-blue frock, damp with rain.</p><p>The cloak had protected her from the worst of it, but enough of the weather had seeped through that her bodice might as well have been a coat of paint. Her nipples were hard and perfectly outlined.</p> <p>Her legs dangled above the cinder floor. He caught a glimpse of her white-clad ankles. No silk stockings today, just sensible wool. He still found them arousing as hell.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you.\u201d He wiped his brow with his sleeve, then showed her his blackened hands. \u201cSit here by the forge. I\u2019ll go wash up, find a fresh shirt, build a fire in the cottage. Then I can warm you properly.\u201d</p><p>She reached for him. \u201cNo, stay. Stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, he studied her, trying to decide whether her shivering was due to the damp weather or a fragile emotional state. Either way, he didn\u2019t like feeling unable to help her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t warm her with his hands. But hands weren\u2019t the only parts he had.</p> <p>\u201cYour fingers must be freezing,\u201d he said, glancing down at her balled fists.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>She wore those knitted handwarmers that seemed popular with all the ladies this spring. Fingerless gloves, he\u2019d heard them called. In weather like this, \u201cfingerless\u201d struck him as tantamount to \u201cuseless,\u201d but he didn\u2019t pretend to understand ladies\u2019 fashions.</p><p>He untied his leather apron and cast it aside. Then he jerked his homespun shirt free of his waistband and lifted it in invitation. \u201cPut them here.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her chilled hands flat to his torso. Their coolness gave him a jolt.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re like a furnace.\u201d</p><p>Love, you have no idea.</p><p>To be sure, her hands were cold. But her cold fingertips had less chance of dampening his lust than ten snowflakes falling on a bonfire.</p> <p>His whole body was aflame with desire for her. Had been since long before she\u2019d burst through the door. All he\u2019d been able to think of since last night was her naked body under his. Her sweet touch against his bared skin.</p><p>Bending his head, he kissed the pink back to her lips, then her cheeks. He nuzzled the frosty snub of her nose. Licked a stray raindrop from her brow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting started.\u201d He pressed a kiss to her neck. \u201cBut you had something to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He trailed kisses lower. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers slid around his rib cage, spreading over the planes of his back, drawing him close. Instinctively, he moved to reciprocate and embrace her, too\u2014but he remembered himself just in time to keep from smearing her frock with soot. Instead, he let his hands drop, and he gripped either end of the anvil.</p><p>Her neckline thwarted him. When damp, the muslin had no give. So he dropped his head lower, nuzzling her breasts through her bodice.</p><p>She sighed and moved against him, seeking more contact.</p><p>He knew she wanted more. Needed more. And he knew how to give it to her, too. He just wasn\u2019t sure she was ready to receive it.</p><p>No way to find out but to try.</p><p>He sank to his knees, ducked his head, and burrowed under her skirts.</p><p>She went completely still. Not a muscle moved, but he could hear her breathing. Her breath came from a low place, deep in her belly. Husky and yearning.</p><p>She didn\u2019t tell him to stop.</p><p>He nibbled his way up the stocking-clad slope of her calf and knee, nosing his way through the tunnel of petticoats. When he reached her ribbon garter, he knew paradise was close. He laid his tongue to the bare silk of her inner thigh, then swept boldly upward. As he moved higher, his broad shoulders pushed her legs apart.</p><p>Her thigh gave a sweet quiver against his mouth.</p><p>He found her center, nestled close, and parted her with his tongue.</p><p>She sucked in her breath.</p><p>He paused, giving her time to adjust or object if she wished\u2014and he drew a deep inhalation of his own. He breathed the scents of spring rain, and muslin pressed with a hot iron, and her intoxicating feminine essence. So pure, so sensual. It made him wild.</p><p>He lapped at her, thirsty for more.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before she surrendered to the pleasure, relaxing into his kiss. He explored gently, tenderly, learning what pleased her and what didn\u2019t. He would have loved to bring her to climax this way. But when she tugged at his shoulders in a silent plea for him to rise, he couldn\u2019t find any strength to object.</p><p>With his teeth, he dragged her skirts to her waist, and he wedged his hips between her spread legs, grinding his buckskin-trapped erection against her aroused flesh.</p><p>This was so good.</p><p>And so wrong.</p><p>A flicker of doubt chased down his spine. It was the middle of the day. Pouring rain outside, yes, but someone could come in at any moment. Someone from the rooming house might be looking for her.</p><p>Were they really going to do this?</p><p>Her slender legs locked around his waist. The heel of her slipper dug into his flank\u2014like a spur, prodding his inner beast.</p><p>Oh, yes. They were going to do this.</p><p>He tightened his grip on the pointed ends of the anvil, bracketing her hips. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take it from here.\u201d</p><p>She reached between them and worked the closures of his trousers, slipping each button free with small, sure fingers. Then those same fingers reached inside and found his straining cock, drawing him out and guiding him to her core.</p><p>She was wet and ready. A low groan eased from his chest as he slid deep.</p><p>Sweet . . . holy . . . damn.</p><p>How many nights had he taken himself in hand and imagined just this scene? Perfect, refined, delicate Diana Highwood propped on his anvil, milk-white thighs spread wide. Panting for him. Her back arched in pleasure, her breasts overflowing her bodice as he took her, pounding a forged-iron erection into her willing heat, again and again and again. She\u2019d always been his favorite erotic fantasy.</p><p>But the reality? The reality surpassed his every imagining.</p><p>He could never have pictured it like this. The sounds of rain sheeting down, battering the smithy roof. The small, private clouds of their mingled breath. The scent of laundered muslin mingling with raw, animal lust. And God, the feel of her. Her velvet heat hugging his cock. So tight. The sweet vise of her legs locked over his hips. The delicious bite of her fingernails on his neck.</p><p>I want this, too, her body told him. I want this, I want you. I want more, more, more.</p><p>With a low growl, he tightened his grip on the anvil and redoubled his pace. He would give her more. He would give her everything.</p><p>\u201cAaron.\u201d Her hands fisted in the fabric of his shirt. \u201cAaron, wait.\u201d</p><p>He froze, breath heaving in his chest. Damn. She\u2019d come to her senses, realized she was a gentlewoman being crudely tupped on the anvil in a village smithy. Bloody hell. He was a rutting bastard.</p><p>Maybe he could apologize. Make it up to her by carrying her to the cottage and his bed.</p><p>Or maybe she\u2019d just leave. Forever.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d He didn\u2019t know what to say or do. He just hoped she didn\u2019t weep.</p><p>She looked up at him with sultry, heavy-lidded eyes. \u201cTouch me,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cGet me dirty. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Sweet . . . holy . . . damn.</p><p>Outside of muttering his way through Sunday service, Aaron had not voiced a conscious prayer in more than ten years. He supposed it wouldn\u2019t help his chances in the hereafter if he returned to the fold with Saints preserve me from premature ejaculation. No matter how sincerely uttered.</p><p>Instead, he gritted his teeth and slowed his thrusts to a languid roll. She held fast to his neck but relaxed her arms, so that she hung pendulous beneath him, affording them both the space to watch.</p><p>She looked on, wide-eyed and breathless, as he slid one hand to cup her breast. Her body arched into his touch. His thumb made a dark, rude streak over the pale muslin. Marking her.</p><p>She gave a sharp cry of pleasure, and her intimate muscles clenched around him.</p><p>Tight.</p><p>That cry she gave . . . it was a cry of relief, born of keen anticipation. As if his rude, gritty touch was what she\u2019d been waiting for all this time.</p><p>Touch me. Get me dirty. I don\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d He blinked away a trickling bead of sweat. \u201cYou\u2019ve been wanting this, too.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and blushed. Her lashes fluttered coyly. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Aaron chuckled low, dragging his caress from one breast to the other. Of course she wouldn\u2019t admit it so easily. That would spoil the fun for them both.</p><p>But he knew the truth now. She\u2019d pictured this. Dreamed of this. Perhaps even sent her hand beneath the coverlet and touched herself while imagining just exactly this.</p><p>Damn, he loved her.</p><p>And he was going to make this good.</p><p>He made his voice low and smug as he thumbed her hardened nipple. Smearing soot in a lewd circle. \u201cDon\u2019t play innocent, Miss Highwood. You\u2019ve been wanting this. A hard, sweaty pounding from the village smith. These strong, dirty hands all over your body. You\u2019ve been wanting it, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>He withdrew halfway, then slid deep. \u201cHaven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>As he moved in and out, her head bobbed in a subtle nod.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d He thrust hard.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A thrill of triumph buzzed through his whole body\u2014then settled, tense and eager, in the base of his spine.</p><p>\u201cShow me, love. Show me how bad you wanted it.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him deeply, hungrily, catching his tongue and suckling it hard. As they kissed, she made soft, needy whimpers in the back of her throat.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMark me as yours. I want everyone to see.\u201d</p><p>Her words shredded his restraint, but he fought the urge to pump hard and fast, remaining faithful to the slow, steady grind that made her writhe and moan.</p><p>Made her tense and grip tight.</p><p>And then at long, merciful last\u2014made her shudder and keen in sweet release.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>When she\u2019d recovered from her crisis, he gathered her tight in his arms. Then he stood, lifting her off the anvil entirely and settling her weight against his chest.</p><p>\u201cHold tight,\u201d he grunted. \u201cHold tight to me.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, lashing her arms around his neck and legs about his waist.</p><p>She wanted a tupping from a coarse, common brute? That\u2019s what she\u2019d get. Ten years at this forge had changed him, raised him from a youth to a man. He\u2019d learned patience, attention to detail, restraint\u2014everything he needed to be slow and steady for her pleasure.</p><p>But it had also made him strong as an ox. And now it was his turn.</p><p>Bracing his feet shoulder-width apart, he tensed his thighs until they were solid as tree trunks. He used every bit of the hard-earned strength in his arms and shoulders, sliding her up and down his length. Using her shamelessly, clutching her bottom with his sooty hands and working her hard.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a feat he could have kept up all night, but that didn\u2019t matter. His lust had reached such a desperate pitch that a minute or two was all it would take.</p><p>If that.</p><p>He wanted to keep his eyes open. This was his dream, his fantasy come to life. She was in his arms, all lacy and perfect and dirty and wet. He meant to watch her, keep his gaze on her flushed, glistening cleavage as he came. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But when the pleasure ripped through him, his eyes squeezed shut of their own accord. The fierce jolts of ecstasy sent him someplace dark, and then someplace bright . . .</p><p>And then somewhere utterly blank.</p><p>Her sweet embrace brought him back. That, and the relentless drumming of the rain.</p> <p>Somehow he managed to carry her to the table and set her down on the planked surface. He pulled up his trousers and slumped next to her, weak all over.</p><p>No more work was getting done on that gate today.</p><p>\u201cOh, Aaron. I\u2019m in such trouble.\u201d</p><p>Shaking off the postcoital lethargy, he turned and met her gaze. \u201cIf you don\u2019t . . . I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she jumped to assure him. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that way. I have no regrets about today. Or last night. None at all.\u201d</p> <p>He exhaled with relief. \u201cWhatever the problem, I\u2019ll mend it. That\u2019s what I do. I mend things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t as simple as a broken latch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, whatever it takes, I will mend it. If you don\u2019t know it by now . . .\u201d He drew a sooty line down her cheek. \u201cDiana, I love you more than my life.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cThat\u2019s just it. My life\u2019s at stake. I may be charged with a felony.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Diana waited, breathless, for his reaction.</p> <p>After long, tense moments, he finally gave her one.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>She only wished this were a laughing matter. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m under quite serious suspicion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>She sat tall on the table, letting her legs dangle over the edge. \u201cWhen I came down from my chamber this morning, all the ladies were in the dining room. They were whispering about me among themselves. I thought they must have found out about us, about last night. But that wasn\u2019t it. Mrs. Nichols accused me of something entirely different. They think I\u2019ve been stealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStealing?\u201d He frowned, all amusement gone from his eyes. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a rash of small things gone missing from the rooming house.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cCharlotte told me about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe did? When?\u201d</p><p>He waved off the question. \u201cNot important now. Go on.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, she tugged at her soiled bodice, pulling it straight. \u201cLast night, while all the ladies were gone to Ambervale, several more items disappeared. This time, some were valuable. Miss Price is missing a gold brooch, and a guinea was stolen from Mrs. Nichols\u2019s own desk. And since I was the only lady who stayed home . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been the only one there. What about the maids?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cOnly Matilda was there, and she slept in the same room as Mrs. Nichols. If she\u2019d stirred, the landlady would have noticed. In their eyes, I\u2019m the only one who could have taken the things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never stolen in my life. It\u2019s clear no one wants to believe it was me, but it seems the only logical explanation. They think I\u2019ve developed a compulsion of some kind. Some sort of illness that drives me to steal.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled heavily and wove her hands into a tight lattice of interlaced fingers. \u201cMiss Price has requested a magistrate. I have no choice but to tell them the truth. I\u2019ll tell them it couldn\u2019t have been me, because I was here with you, all night long.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flared. \u201cWhat? Diana, you can\u2019t tell them that.\u201d</p><p>The vehemence of his reply took her by surprise. He pushed off the table and went to the forge, raking the coals of the dying fire and feeding it new splits of wood.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have a choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And if you tell them, you will be ruined. In truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter to be a ruined woman than a suspected thief. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t agree, nor give any response at all.</p><p>\u201cThat missing brooch is gold, Aaron. It\u2019s worth a great deal. Thieves are hanged for stealing less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to hang you. You\u2019re not a thief. The items will turn up, or someone else will confess. They have no evidence, only suspicion.\u201d He approached her and put his hands on her shoulders. Their weight settled, heavy as a yoke. \u201cWhy tell everyone about last night and invite uncharitable gossip?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cPerhaps I don\u2019t care about the gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen try a little harder.\u201d Diana was frustrated now. Hadn\u2019t he promised to trust that she knew her own mind?</p><p>She tried to explain. \u201cWhen I came downstairs this morning and saw them all staring at me, I thought we were found out. For a moment, I was stricken by sheer terror. I was certain I\u2019d be ruined. But then something changed. Once I\u2019d resigned myself to the inevitability . . . I felt strangely free. Unashamed, excited. Aaron, I want people to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t. Not like this.\u201d He released her and began pacing the smithy.</p><p>She watched him, perplexed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Aren\u2019t we planning to marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but I wanted to wed you in a respectable fashion. If they hear about this, people will think we only married because I seduced you and you had no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is about your pride,\u201d she said. \u201cYour reputation, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s both, Diana. But yes, I have a reputation, too. People respect me in this village. This is my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it will be my home, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen think this through. What if word gets around London that you were defiled by a local craftsman? Good families might stop sending their young ladies to Spindle Cove. The whole village would suffer, and it would be my fault. I might not be able to support you then.\u201d</p><p>This probably wasn\u2019t the time to remind him that her dowry, while modest by aristocratic standards, could keep them comfortable for decades. He would only receive it as another insult.</p><p>\u201cAaron, I don\u2019t know what to say. Except that perhaps you should have thought about all this before you carried me to your bed last night.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his mouth. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking last night. Obviously.\u201d</p><p>Diana struggled to not take offense. She tried, very hard, to interpret his words in the kindest possible light.</p><p>When she\u2019d come to his cottage last night, she\u2019d done so with forethought and a full knowledge of the risks. However, he\u2019d been taken by surprise to find her there. And he\u2019d been in a vulnerable state, after a long day spent grappling with mortality and fatigue. Perhaps if he\u2019d had time to think it all through, he would have sent her home and not made love to her.</p><p>But even so . . . How could he regret it now? What they\u2019d shared had been so wonderful. At least, it had been wonderful for her. She felt ready to be with him, marry him, pledge her life to him.</p><p>Maybe he didn\u2019t feel as ready as she did.</p><p>\u201cAaron, I understand if you\u2019re afraid. I\u2019m frightened, too. We knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy to announce our plans, even under the best of circumstances. But I don\u2019t see a way around telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wait. In a day or two, this theft business is sure to be resolved. Then I\u2019ll propose to you properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if this theft business isn\u2019t resolved? If I\u2019m asked to explain myself, I\u2019m stuck. My choices are between \u2018suspected thief\u2019 and \u2018known fornicator.\u2019 No matter what, I\u2019m never going to be \u2018Perfect Miss Highwood\u2019 again. And it may seem strange, but I\u2019m happy about that. I\u2019m ready to just be me.\u201d She looked him in the eye. \u201cSo there\u2019s the question, I suppose. Do you love me? Or just some precious, perfect idea of me?\u201d</p><p>His fingers tamed a stray lock of her hair. \u201cOf course I love you. Perfect or not, I think the world of you, Diana. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t bear for our friends and neighbors to think something less.\u201d He swept a gesture down her soiled frock. \u201cI don\u2019t want them believing you\u2019re this kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>She flung her arms wide. \u201cApparently, I am this kind of girl. And you didn\u2019t seem to mind ten minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different. You know it\u2019s different. There\u2019s what happens between the two of us, and then there\u2019s parading it for public view. We know how we feel, but to anyone else . . .\u201d He cringed at his dark handprint sprawled lewdly over her breast. \u201cYou look like a lightskirt who\u2019s entertained a gang of colliers.\u201d</p><p>She recoiled, stung. \u201cAnd yet I didn\u2019t feel truly dirty until just this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you mean. You want a lightskirt in your bed at night, and by day you want a perfect virgin.\u201d She pressed a hand to her heart. \u201cBut I need a man who knows me. Who wants me. And who isn\u2019t afraid or ashamed for the world to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now I\u2019m ashamed?\u201d His gesture was impatient. \u201cDiana, our night together wouldn\u2019t be such a scandal if anyone\u2014your friends, family, neighbors\u2014suspected that you care for me. But they haven\u2019t seen the slightest evidence of that. Have they?\u201d</p><p>The edge of accusation in his voice cut her deeply. He was right, she supposed. If she had been more forthright about her feelings for Aaron, the truth of last night wouldn\u2019t come as such a surprise. For that matter, she wouldn\u2019t have needed to lie about a headache in the first place.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I\u2019m not a woman who bares her feelings easily.\u201d Out of habit, she reached for the vial hanging about her neck. It wasn\u2019t there. Her fingers closed on air, and she felt bereft with nothing to cling to. \u201cI\u2019ve always been reserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReserved,\u201d he echoed. \u201cUntil this past week, you barely acknowledged me when we crossed paths in the lane. I\u2019ve never taken offense. But now you call me ashamed? You know that\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>All Diana knew was that she had to leave.</p><p>With shaking fingers, she put her clothing to rights as best she could and headed for the door. If he would abandon her to face false accusations of thievery before admitting to his own true actions, there seemed nothing more to discuss. She was on her own.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go away angry,\u201d he said, his tone gentler than before. \u201cWe\u2019ll reside in this village for the rest of our lives, God willing. In a week, any absurd accusations of theft will be forgotten. But if you tell everyone about last night, the gossip will linger for years. I just want to be careful, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful. I have a great deal of practice being careful. Don\u2019t worry, Aaron.\u201d She whirled her cloak about her shoulders and secured it tight in front. \u201cI\u2019ll make it home with these stains unseen. No one needs to know about us. Ever.\u201d</p><p>She slammed the door, and Aaron\u2019s ribs rattled with the force of the crash.</p><p>Damn. He hadn\u2019t handled that well.</p><p>With two sisters in his care, Aaron had been on the receiving end of some feminine fury in his life. But Diana\u2019s was a first-rate exit. One that begged, Chase after me. Grovel and plead and promise to give me anything I ask, everything I need.</p><p>He had every intention of doing just that.</p><p>Curse it, he never should have made that remark about lightskirts. He\u2019d sounded disgusted by her, when in reality he was only disgusted with himself.</p><p>This entire situation was his fault. He never should have allowed her to stay last night. If another man had treated Diana\u2014or any woman, for that matter\u2014this way, Aaron would have raised hell. And the entire village knew it. He was the resident big brother. He protected the female contingent of Spindle Cove. But he\u2019d failed to look out for the woman he loved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He would go to her. Just as soon as he could manage it. First he needed to bathe, change, shave. He\u2019d put on his best coat, gather up a spring flower or two. He supposed he hadn\u2019t the time to learn any poetry\u2014but he would bring the ring.</p><p>This was their first proper argument, and Aaron didn\u2019t dare skimp on the reconciliation. When he did chase after her to fall at her feet and make promises . . . there could be no half measures.</p><p>He had to do this with his whole heart\u2014even if it meant risking all.</p> <p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>By the time Diana arrived back in the village center, her hem and slippers were dredged in mud, and the rain had made a proper mop of her hair. With her cloak wrapped tight about her torso, no one could have guessed at the smudges on her frock beneath.</p><p>Her swollen eyes and red, sniffling nose could easily be explained away\u2014just products of the damp weather.</p><p>She sighed. As always, her delicate health made such a convenient excuse. No one ever had to know if she didn\u2019t wish them to.</p><p>As it turned out, she didn\u2019t need excuses just yet. Other concerns had occupied the Queen\u2019s Ruby residents. As the rooming house came into view, Diana saw all the young ladies milling about the front stoop, huddled under the overhang like a clutch of monks in hooded cloaks.</p> <p>\u201cOh, there she is.\u201d Charlotte ran to Diana\u2019s side. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went for a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this?\u201d Her sister tilted her face to the rain, then slid Diana a suspicious look.</p><p>\u201cNever mind me. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just about to go over to the Bull and Blossom, all of us.\u201d Charlotte threaded her arm through Diana\u2019s. \u201cMiss Price has insisted they clear the place out and search the rooms. She\u2019s in a tizzy about that brooch. Says it was an heirloom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re searching the rooms?\u201d</p> <p>Mama joined them. Billowing along in her massive black cloak, she looked like a vengeful raven.</p><p>\u201cThis is an outrage,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cAfter two years of living in this rooming house, we are made to endure such suspicion? I gave them leave to search your chamber, Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere didn\u2019t seem any reason not to. You have nothing to hide. Once that horrid Miss Price is satisfied of the fact, we can put all this absurdity behind us.\u201d She made a noise of disgust. \u201cAnd all this for that ugly, outmoded brooch. She ought to thank the soul who relieved her of it.\u201d</p><p>While Mrs. Nichols and Matilda made a search of the rooming house, all the ladies made the trudge across the village green to the Bull and Blossom, where they settled at every available table. Mama ordered hot tea. Diana wished she dared ask Mr. Fosbury to doctor hers with whiskey. She despised the way all the ladies were staring at her.</p><p>She made herself small in her chair and wrapped her cloak tight about her body, praying this would all be over soon.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time we left Spindle Cove,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Her mother seized her arm with excitement. \u201cOh, Diana. If that is the happy result of this debacle, then I wish you\u2019d been accused of thievery a year ago. We can go to Town at once. Minerva and Lord Payne will welcome us with open arms.\u201d</p> <p>Diana doubted that \u201copen arms\u201d bit, but she didn\u2019t suppose they would be turned away.</p><p>\u201cAt last you can start moving in the best circles. Where you belong. We will make the acquaintance of so many fine gentlemen. Men of wealth and culture and excellent manners.\u201d</p><p>Diana wanted to weep. She didn\u2019t want men of wealth and culture. She wanted Aaron, with his small, homely cottage and his dedication to his craft. Ironically, after all Diana\u2019s fears about her mother and society\u2019s disapproval, he wasn\u2019t willing to brave a little gossip for her.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Charlotte declared, standing and addressing the unspoken accusation in the room. \u201cThe thief wasn\u2019t Diana. I know it wasn\u2019t.\u201d She turned a keen gaze on Miss Bertram, who sat huddled in her cloak in the corner of the room. \u201cYou\u2019re very quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Miss Bertram said, shifting evasively. \u201cI was at Ambervale last night, with everyone else. Everyone except Miss Highwood.\u201d</p><p>The silence fractured into a flurry of whispered suppositions.</p><p>Mr. Fosbury, bless him, played peacemaker. He emerged from the kitchen, bearing a tray of teacakes to pass around. \u201cNow, now. I\u2019m sure this is all a misunderstanding. No one who knows Miss Highwood could believe this of her.\u201d</p><p>Miss Price clucked her tongue. \u201cNo one who\u2019s lived with her for the past week could deny she\u2019s been acting strangely. Disappearing at mealtime, keeping to herself.\u201d She confronted Diana directly. \u201cYou told everyone you were ill last night. But then you seemed right as roses this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Diana said. \u201cYes, I lied about being ill last night.\u201d</p><p>This was it. She was going to tell the truth. Even if she had to give up her dreams of being a blacksmith\u2019s wife, she refused to surrender her hard-won sense of freedom.</p><p>Another of the girls looked perplexed. \u201cWhy would you do that, Miss Highwood? Weren\u2019t you looking forward to visiting Ambervale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should think the reason is obvious,\u201d Miss Price declared. \u201cShe stayed behind so she could make free with our possessions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Diana pulled her spine straight. \u201cI feigned illness for the same reason I\u2019ve been feigning ill health for years now. Habit. And fear.\u201d She turned to her mother, steeling her resolve. \u201cMy asthma hasn\u2019t bothered me in years, Mama. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m cured. But I\u2019ve clung to the appearance of delicate health because . . . because it\u2019s easier to claim a false malady than endure the real headache of arguing with you.\u201d</p><p>A hush fell over the room. She could feel everyone staring at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mama. I should have been honest and told you I didn\u2019t wish to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you not wish to go?\u201d her mother cried. \u201cYou had the lead in the theatrical. And I know we agreed on Lord Drewe\u2019s unsuitability, but Lord Payne was attending as well. One of them might have invited a highly placed friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about Lord Drewe,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cNor his friends. I don\u2019t want the same things you want, Mama. Marrying me off to a duke is your dream, not mine.\u201d</p><p>Pursing her mouth in displeasure, Mama flicked open her fan. \u201cI think you are ill. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve never heard you speak in such a fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suggest you get used to it.\u201d Diana rose and confronted the room of shocked faces. \u201cI am guilty of falsehood. It was wrong of me to lie. Not only wrong but cowardly as well. I am sorry for it. But I swear to you, I did not steal. They won\u2019t find anything in my room.\u201d</p><p>Matilda came bursting through the door, closely followed by Mrs. Nichols. \u201cWe found something in Miss Highwood\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Charlotte cried. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it my brooch?\u201d asked Miss Price.</p><p>\u201cNot the brooch,\u201d Mrs. Nichols said, giving Diana an apologetic look. \u201cBut we did find these.\u201d</p><p>The old woman unrolled a linen handkerchief to reveal a collection of shiny metallic objects.</p><p>Oh, no. They were Aaron\u2019s pieces. The ones she\u2019d kept hidden at the bottom of her trousseau.</p><p>Diana went dizzy. She sat down again. \u201cI didn\u2019t steal those. You can ask Sally Bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me what?\u201d Sally asked, having just popped through the door. She flashed a cheeky smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think I\u2019d miss a scene like this, do you?\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. Now the whole village was assembled to witness Diana\u2019s humiliation. All the ladies of the Queen\u2019s Ruby, Mr. Fosbury and his serving girl, assorted tavern patrons, and now Sally Bright\u2014who would share the tale with the few remaining people in the parish who\u2019d missed it.</p><p>\u201cThose pieces Mrs. Nichols is holding. I purchased them from the All Things shop, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Sally said, peering at the handful of silver. \u201cLast year, I think. You told me they were going to be Christmas gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why were they buried at the bottom of her trunk?\u201d Matilda asked. \u201cAll secret-like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plain to see what\u2019s been going on,\u201d Miss Price said. \u201cThe pressure of being the perfect daughter has worn on Miss Highwood, and she\u2019s developed this compulsion to collect shiny things. At first she bought them, but now she\u2019s resorted to stealing. I want to call for a magistrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she doesn\u2019t have your brooch,\u201d Charlotte argued.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she? She probably hid it elsewhere.\u201d Miss Price ticked off the \u201cevidence\u201d on her fingers. \u201cShe lied about being ill. She was the only one with a chance to steal it. She disappeared again this morning, and now we find this cache of trinkets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are not trinkets,\u201d Diana argued. \u201cThey\u2019re art. They\u2019re precious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecious?\u201d Miss Price turned to Mrs. Nichols and raised her eyebrows in a way that said, See what I mean?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s another explanation,\u201d Mrs. Nichols said. \u201cMiss Highwood, if you were at the rooming house last night, did you hear anyone come in or go out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Diana said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>A ripple of murmurs passed through the tavern.</p><p>Mama snorted. \u201cOf course you were there. Charlotte looked in on you when we returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. I was awake. I\u2019d just come back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom where?\u201d Miss Price asked.</p><p>Diana buried her face in her hands and rubbed her temples. This was madness. Even if she told the truth, she wasn\u2019t sure anyone would believe her. She was about to publicly ruin herself and lose Aaron forever.</p><p>\u201cShe was with me.\u201d</p><p>Her head and heart lifted at the sound of that familiar baritone.</p><p>Aaron.</p><p>He stood silhouetted in the door. His hair was damp, plastered to his brow. His boots were caked with mud. He wore the same chocolate-brown coat she\u2019d stitched together minutes after stitching his arm.</p><p>And no man had ever looked so handsome.</p><p>\u201cShe was with me,\u201d he repeated, walking into the tavern. \u201cAll night long.\u201d</p><p>Diana wanted to cheer. Charlotte actually did cheer, albeit quietly.</p><p>\u201cBut of course!\u201d Mama exclaimed with evident relief. \u201cThis explains everything.\u201d</p><p>What? Diana hadn\u2019t been expecting her mother to take this so well.</p><p>She looked around the tavern. Everyone seemed to be taking this well.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Mrs. Nichols, catching on to the conclusion that was seemingly obvious to all but Diana. \u201cWe all know about Mr. Maidstone\u2019s accident yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the tavern nodded and murmured in agreement.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dawes was called away to set a bone. Miss Diana must have heard the news. She was helping nurse an injured man, just like she helped with Finn\u2019s surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so like my daughter,\u201d Mama crowed. \u201cAlways kind to the less fortunate.\u201d</p><p>Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake.</p><p>This was ridiculous. Diana couldn\u2019t ruin herself when she tried.</p><p>She caught Aaron\u2019s gaze. She knew they were sharing the same thought. They could let the mistaken assumption stand. Everything could be settled without any scandal at all.</p><p>But I don\u2019t want to hide it, she told him with her eyes.</p><p>He nodded in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>Her heart beat faster. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Mother. I went to Mr. Dawes\u2019s cottage after he was finished tending to Mr. Maidstone. I . . . I spent the night there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mother laughed, incredulous. \u201cWell, whyever would you do that?\u201d</p><p>Diana smacked a palm to her forehead. Did she have to draw every conclusion with pen and ink? \u201cWe were making love!\u201d</p><p>Now the tavern went stone silent.</p> <p>Mama snorted. \u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t believe that. I\u2019d sooner believe you were a thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, Mrs. Highwood,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cWhether you believe it or not. And I\u2019m here to ask Miss Highwood to marry me.\u201d</p><p>From his breast pocket he removed a ring and laid it on the table. A gold band shaped like two entwined vines, with golden leaves bracketing a ruby-and-diamond bloom.</p><p>She pressed a hand to her heart. Oh, it was lovely. His best work yet. How he must have slaved over the design.</p><p>\u201cMiss Highwood.\u201d Aaron cleared his throat and moved as though he would kneel. \u201cDiana, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d Mama cried.</p><p>Aaron froze in an awkward half crouch.</p><p>\u201cHow can you expect me to allow this?\u201d Mama glared at him. \u201cHow dare you impugn my Diana\u2019s honor in this fashion! Grasping, awful man. Of course you\u2019d leap at the opportunity to rescue her from these silly thieving suspicions, hoping she\u2019ll marry you in gratitude. It\u2019s not as though a man like you would have a chance at her otherwise. But I tell you, your scheme won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a scheme,\u201d Diana said. \u201cAnd he has more than \u2018a chance\u2019 with me, Mama. I love Aaron. And I am going to marry him.\u201d</p><p>Diana reached for the ring he\u2019d laid on the table.</p><p>Her mother smacked her hand away. Smacked it, as though Diana were a three-year-old child.</p> <p>Diana simmered with anger. She was not a child. She was all grown up, and her mother was about to learn the truth of it.</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d she said coolly, \u201clisten to me closely. I am in love with Mr. Dawes. I have been for some time. I collected his pieces from the All Things shop because I admired him. We shared our first kiss in the vicar\u2019s curricle. He introduced me to his sister on our excursion to Hastings. I tried to kill an eel for him. I shot at a robber who threatened him. And last night . . . ?\u201d She lifted her voice. \u201cWe. Were. Making. Love. In a bed. All night long. It was hot and sweaty and glorious. I left scratches on his back. He has a freckle just to the right of his navel. And if you don\u2019t believe all that . . .\u201d</p><p>She ripped her cloak open and threw it aside, exposing Aaron\u2019s black, sooty handprint on her breast. \u201cHere. See for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Several moments passed, during which the only sound was the mad thump of her heartbeat in her ears.</p><p>Then someone shrieked.</p><p>Strange. Diana had expected a measure of shock at her revelations, but that seemed a bit extreme, shrieking.</p><p>Now another girl screamed.</p><p>And another. \u201cIt\u2019s a rat!\u201d</p> <p>A rat?</p><p>Oh, God. It was a rat. A long-tailed, bewhiskered rat, big as a bread loaf, with a pink, twitching nose. The creature scampered onto the table\u2014and absconded with the ring.</p><p>Her ring.</p><p>Aaron cursed and lunged to get it back.</p><p>\u201cMr. Evermoore!\u201d Miss Bertram leaped to her feet. \u201cMr. Evermoore, no! You come back here right now.\u201d</p><p>In an instant, the tavern was in upheaval. Some of the ladies jumped on chairs and tables. Others reached for any makeshift truncheon close at hand. Pots, pans, stray copies of Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom.</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Charlotte cried in vindication. \u201cI knew all along the thief had to be Miss Bertram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was her,\u201d Diana said. \u201cI mean, obviously it was her . . . her pet. She must have left the rat behind last night while everyone went to Ambervale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little bastard\u2019s over here,\u201d Mr. Fosbury shouted. \u201cIn the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>There was a crash of glass. Followed by an explosion of flour.</p><p>Mama crumpled into the nearest chair, her eyes rolling back in a dead faint. Just as well.</p><p>\u201cOh, please don\u2019t kill him!\u201d Miss Bertram sobbed. \u201cHe can\u2019t help taking things. But he\u2019s so intelligent. You don\u2019t understand. Oh, Mr. Evermoore.\u201d</p><p>Diana cringed at her sister. \u201c \u2018No one understands our attachment.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that what she always said?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte shuddered. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it, either. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>The two of them laughed uneasily.</p><p>Of all the potential scandals that could have lessened Diana\u2019s sordid revelation . . . this one would serve. Yes, she\u2019d given her heart and her virtue to the local blacksmith. At least she wasn\u2019t in love with a rat.</p><p>\u201cFound it.\u201d Aaron\u2019s dark head popped up from the other side of the bar. He called to her. \u201cI found the ring.\u201d</p><p>Diana pushed through the crowd to meet him at the bar. But she couldn\u2019t bear to remain separated from him, so she scrambled atop the counter on hands and knees.</p><p>He did the same.</p><p>They sat together, cross-legged atop the lacquered surface, while the wild rat hunt proceeded all around them.</p><p>Aaron huffed his breath, blowing a bit of flour off the jeweled setting. He shined the band with his sleeve. \u201cI\u2019d make a speech, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She laughed and flicked a glance at the ongoing melee. \u201cJust put it on, and quick.\u201d</p><p>She offered her hand. He slid the ring on her finger.</p><p>\u201cOh, Aaron.\u201d Emotion frayed her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as beautiful as you.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek in one of his strong workman\u2019s hands and tilted her face to his.</p><p>And when he kissed her, the world went away.</p><p>\u201cWh- . . . Oh, where am I? Oh, my nerves.\u201d</p><p>Diana winced, suddenly conscious of their surroundings. Her mother had revived just in time to see them embracing atop the bar counter, coated in flour and mud and soot, and locked in a deep, passionate kiss.</p><p>\u201cWonderful news, Mama.\u201d Diana held up her left hand and waggled her ring finger. \u201cI\u2019m finally engaged.\u201d</p><p>Her mother blinked at the ring. Blinked at Aaron.</p><p>And promptly fainted once again.</p><p>A few weeks later</p><p>\u201cAre you very sure, my dear? It\u2019s not too late to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Diana shook her head.</p><p>From the vestibule, she stood on tiptoe and peered down the long aisle of St. Ursula\u2019s, festooned with bunting and posies of daffodils. All their family, friends, and neighbors sat crowding the pews in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cMama, the wedding will begin any moment. And it can\u2019t start soon enough for me. I\u2019m not going to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to ask.\u201d Her mother twisted a lace handkerchief in her hand. \u201cI know you girls think me a silly, overwrought creature who thinks of nothing but marrying you to rich gentlemen. But it\u2019s only because I love you so.\u201d</p><p>Diana softened. \u201cI know, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we lost your father, I was anxious every moment. How would we live? Where would we go? How could I provide the best for you?\u201d She dabbed at her eyes. \u201cI only wanted to spare you girls the same nervousness.\u201d</p><p>Diana\u2019s heart twisted in her chest. \u201cI understand. I do, and I love you for it. Please be happy for me today. I promise, you will never need to worry for me again. With Aaron, I will be loved and safe and protected. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that is all I can ask.\u201d Mama noisily blew her nose into the handkerchief. \u201cOh, but I had such dreams for you. My intuition insisted that one day a handsome duke would roll into this village in a splendid carriage, ready to choose his bride. But I suppose it\u2019s not likely to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not,\u201d Diana said. \u201cAnd even if it did, I would still marry Aaron.\u201d</p><p>Mama grasped her hand and squeezed it fondly. \u201cMr. Dawes may not be a gentleman, but your ring is nicer than Minerva\u2019s. There is that.\u201d</p><p>Diana smiled. Some things never changed.</p><p>\u201cAre we ready?\u201d Colin Sandhurst, Lord Payne, appeared in the vestibule, looking as handsomely attired as always and quite ready to have this done.</p><p>He offered an arm to Mama and walked her down the aisle. Charlotte followed, fizzing with joy for her role as bridesmaid\u2014or at least, for the new frock it occasioned.</p><p>Diana brought up the end of the procession.</p><p>As she walked down the grand, carpeted aisle, moving ever closer to the handsome, broad-shouldered figure at the front of the church, she saw their whole future painted for them in rich, stained-glass hues. They would marry here. They would make Christmas and Easter memories here. They would christen their children here.</p><p>If her arithmetic was correct, they could be doing that christening part in a little less than nine months. She hadn\u2019t given Aaron any idea\u2014it was too early yet to be sure. But she thought he might have formed his own suspicions.</p><p>As the organist played the last verse of the hymn, he drifted close. His strong arm brushed hers, and a shiver of delight passed through her. Strangely enough, she couldn\u2019t gather the courage to look up at his face. Her whole heart would be in her eyes, she knew. And though her heart would be forever his by the end of this ceremony, she wanted to guard it just a few moments more.</p><p>\u201cYou are radiant,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd you look like a woman with a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little wedding present for you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I have a present for us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He leaned and spoke in her ear. \u201cI hired a cook.\u201d</p><p>She had to clap her hand over her mouth to keep from laughing aloud. Oh, she loved him so.</p><p>\u201cWho gives this woman to be married to this man?\u201d The vicar looked to Lord Payne, who was standing in the first row.</p><p>Luckily, her brother-in-law remained enough of a scoundrel to be easily corrupted. As she\u2019d asked of him, he remained silent.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Diana looked up at Aaron and smiled. \u201cI give myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
