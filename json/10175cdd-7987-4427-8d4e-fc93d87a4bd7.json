A bright stab of pain told him he\u2019d made a grave mistake. He quickly shut his eye again and put a hand over it, groaning.</p><p>Something had gone horribly wrong.</p><p>He needed a shave. He needed a bath. He might need to be sick. Attempts to summon any recollection of the previous evening resulted in another sharp slice of agony.</p> <p>He tried to ignore the throb in his temples and focused on the tufted, plush surface under his back. It wasn\u2019t his bed. Perhaps not even a bed at all. Was it just a trick of his nausea, or was the damned thing moving?</p><p>\u201cGriff.\u201d The voice came to him through a thick, murky haze. It was muffled, but unmistakably female.</p><p>God\u2019s knees, Halford. The next time you decide to bed a woman after a months-long drought, at least stay sober enough to remember it afterward.</p><p>He cursed his stupidity. The epic duration of his celibacy was no doubt the reason he\u2019d been tempted by . . . whoever she was. He had no idea of her name or her face. Just a vague impression of a feminine presence nearby. He inhaled and smelled perfume of an indeterminate, expensive sort.</p><p>Damn. He\u2019d need jewels to get out of this, no doubt.</p> <p>Something dull and pointed jabbed his side. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><p>Did he know that voice? Keeping one hand clapped over his eyes, he fumbled about with the other hand. He caught a handful of heavy silk skirt and skimmed his touch downward until his fingers closed around a stocking-clad ankle. Sighing a little in apology, he rubbed his thumb up and down.</p><p>A squawk of feminine outrage assailed his ears. An unyielding object cracked him over the head, but hard. Now to the pounding and throbbing in his skull, he could add ringing.</p><p>\u201cGriffin Eliot York. Really.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell.</p><p>Forget the headache and piercing sunlight, he bolted upright\u2014bashing his head again, this time on the low ceiling. Blinking, he confirmed the unthinkable truth. He wasn\u2019t in his bedchamber\u2014or any bedchamber\u2014but in the coach. And the woman seated across from him was all too familiar, with the double strand of rubies at her throat and her elegant sweep of silver hair.</p> <p>They stared at one another in mutual horror.</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d</p><p>She smacked him again with her collapsed parasol. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake, I\u2019m awake.\u201d When she readied another blow, he held up his hands in surrender. \u201cGood God. I may never sleep again.\u201d</p><p>Though the air in the coach was oven-warm, he shuddered. Now he most definitely needed a bath.</p><p>He peered out the window and saw nothing but vast expanses of rolling green, dappled with cloud-shaped shadows. The coach\u2019s truncated shadow indicated midday.</p><p>\u201cWhere the devil are we? And why?\u201d</p><p>He tried to piece together memories of the previous evening. This was hardly the first time he\u2019d woken in unfamiliar surroundings, head ringing and stomach achurn . . . but it was the first time in a good long while. He thought he\u2019d put this sort of debauchery behind him. So what had happened?</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t imbibed more than his usual amount of wine at dinner. By the fish course, however, he seemed to recall the china\u2019s acanthus pattern undulating. Swimming before his eyes.</p><p>After that, he recalled . . . nothing.</p><p>Damn. He\u2019d been drugged.</p><p>Kidnapped.</p><p>He snapped to alert, bracing his boots on the carriage floorboards.</p><p>Whoever his captors were, he must assume they were armed. He was without a blade, without a gun\u2014but he had eager fists, honed reflexes, and a rapidly clearing head. On his own, he would have given himself even chances. But the bastards had taken his mother, too.</p><p>\u201cDo not be alarmed,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t dream of it. Bad for the complexion.\u201d She touched the double strand of rubies at her throat.</p><p>Those rubies. They gave him pause.</p><p>What shoddy excuse for a kidnapper used the family coach and left the captive wearing several thousand pounds\u2019 worth of jewels?</p><p>Devil take it.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d His mother raised her eyebrows, all innocence.</p><p>\u201cYou did this. You put something in my wine at dinner and stuffed me in the carriage.\u201d He pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cMy God. I can\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>She looked out the window and shrugged. Or rather, she gave the duchess version of a shrug\u2014a motion that didn\u2019t involve anything so common or gauche as the flexing of shoulder muscles, but merely a subtle tilt of the head. \u201cYou\u2019d never have come if I asked.\u201d</p><p>Incredible.</p><p>Griff closed his eyes. Times like these, he supposed he ought to remind himself that a man only had one mother, and his mother only had one son, and she\u2019d carried him in her womb and toiled in labor and so on and so forth. But he did not wish to think about her womb right now\u2014not when he was still trying, desperately, to forget that she possessed ankles.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSussex.\u201d</p><p>Sussex. One of the few counties in England where he didn\u2019t claim any property. \u201cAnd what is the purpose of this urgent errand?\u201d</p><p>A faint smile curved her lips. \u201cWe\u2019re going to meet your future bride.\u201d</p><p>He stared at his mother. Many moments passed before he could manage coherent speech.</p><p>\u201cYou are a scheming, fiendish woman with entirely too much time at leisure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are the eighth Duke of Halford,\u201d she returned. \u201cI know that doesn\u2019t mean much to you. The disgraces at Oxford, the gambling, the years of aimless debauchery . . . You seem determined to be nothing more than an unfortunate blot on the distinguished Halford legacy. At the very least, start on the next generation while I still have time to mold it. You have a responsibility to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo continue the line.\u201d He closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told. Again and again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be five-and-thirty this year, Griffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Which makes me much too old to be called \u2018Griffy.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cMore to the point, I am fifty-eight. I need grandchildren before my decline. It\u2019s not right for two generations of the family to be drooling at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour decline?\u201d He laughed. \u201cTell me, Mother, how can I hasten that happy process? Other than offering a firm push.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrow arched in amusement. \u201cJust try it.\u201d</p><p>Griff sighed. His mother was . . . his mother. There was no other woman in England like her, and the rest of the world had better pray God had broken the mold. Like the jewels she delighted in wearing, Judith York was a formidable blend of exterior polish and inner fire.</p><p>For most of the year, they led entirely separate lives. They only resided in the same house for these few months of the London season. Apparently, even that was too much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been patient,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019m desperate. You must marry, and it must be soon. I\u2019ve tried to find the most accomplished young beauties in England to tempt you. And I did, but you ignored them. I finally realized the answer is not quality. It\u2019s quantity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuantity? Are you taking me to some free-love utopian commune where men are permitted as many wives as they please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being hopeful.\u201d</p><p>Her lip curled in a delicate scowl. \u201cYou\u2019re terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I work hard at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve often lamented. If only you applied the same effort toward . . . anything else.\u201d</p><p>Griff closed his eyes. If there was any conversation more tired and repetitive than the \u201cWhen will you ever marry?\u201d debate, it was the \u201cYou\u2019re a grave disappointment\u201d harangue. Only in this family would it be considered \u201cdisappointing\u201d to successfully oversee a vast fortune, six estates, several hundred employees, and thousands of tenants. Impressive, by most standards. But in the Halford line? Not quite enough. Unless a man was reforming Parliament or discovering a new trade route to Patagonia, he just didn\u2019t measure up.</p><p>He glanced out the window again. They seemed to be entering a sort of village. He slid open the glass pane and discovered he could smell the sea. A salted-blue freshness mingled with the greener scents of countryside.</p><p>\u201cIt is a prettyish sort of place,\u201d his mother said. \u201cVery tidy and quiet. I can understand why it\u2019s so popular with the young ladies.\u201d</p><p>The coach rolled to a halt in the center of the village, near a wide, pleasant green that ringed a grand medieval church. He peered out the window, gazing in all directions. The place was far too small to be Brighton or . . .</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d A vile suspicion formed in his mind.</p><p>Surely she hadn\u2019t . . .</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>The liveried footman opened the coach door. \u201cGood day, your graces. We\u2019ve reached Spindle Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bollocks.\u201d</p><p>When the fancy coach came trundling down the lane, Pauline scarcely gave it a glance. Many a fine carriage had come down that same road, bringing one visitor or another to the village. A holiday in Spindle Cove was said to cure any gently bred lady\u2019s crisis of confidence.</p><p>But Pauline wasn\u2019t a gently bred lady, and her trials were more practical in nature. Such as the fact that she\u2019d just stumbled into a murky puddle, splashing her hem with mud.</p><p>And that her sister was near tears for the second time that morning.</p><p>\u201cThe list,\u201d Daniela said. \u201cIt\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>Drat. Pauline knew they didn\u2019t have time to go back to the farm. She was due at the tavern in minutes. This was Saturday\u2014the day of the Spindle Cove ladies\u2019 weekly salon, and the Bull and Blossom\u2019s busiest day of the week. Mr. Fosbury was a fair-minded employer, but he docked wages for tardiness. And Father noticed.</p><p>Frantic, Daniela fished in her pocket. Her eyes welled with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s not here. It\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I remember it.\u201d Shaking the muddy droplets from her skirts, Pauline ticked the items off in her memory. \u201cDried currants, worsted thread, a bit of sponge. Oh, and powdered alum. Mother needs it for pickling.\u201d</p><p>When they entered the Brights\u2019 All Things shop, they found it packed to bursting. While the visiting ladies met for their weekly salon, the villagers purchased their dry goods. Villagers like Mrs. Whittlecombe, a cobwebby old widow who only left her decrepit farmhouse once a week to stock up on comfits and \u201cmedicinal\u201d wine. The woman gave them a disdainful sniff as Pauline and Daniela wedged their way into the shop.</p><p>Pauline could just make out two flashes of white-blond hair on the other side of the counter. Sally Bright was busy with customers three deep, and her younger brother Rufus ran back and forth from the storeroom.</p><p>Fortunately, the Simms sisters had been friends with the Bright family since as far back as any of them could remember. They needn\u2019t wait to be helped.</p><p>\u201cPut the eggs away,\u201d Pauline told her sister. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch the sponge and thread from the storeroom. You get the currants and alum. Two measures of currants, one of alum.\u201d</p><p>Daniela carefully set the basket of brown speckled eggs on the counter and went to a row of bins. Her lips moved as she scanned for the one labeled CURRANTS. Then she frowned with concentration as she sifted the contents into a rolled cone of brown paper.</p><p>Once she\u2019d seen her sister settle to the task, Pauline gathered the needed items from the back. When she returned, Daniela was waiting with goods in hand.</p><p>\u201cToo much alum,\u201d Pauline said, inspecting. \u201cIt was meant to be just one measure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said in a calm voice. \u201cEasily mended. Just put the extra back.\u201d</p><p>She hoped her sister didn\u2019t notice the sneering expression on old Mrs. Whittlecombe\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I can continue to give this shop my custom,\u201d the old woman said. \u201cAllowing half-wits behind the counter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sally Bright gave the woman a flippant smile. \u201cJust tell me when we can stop stocking your laudanum, Mrs. Whittlecombe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a health tonic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Sally said dryly.</p> <p>Pauline went to the ledger to record their purchases. She secretly loved this part. She flipped through the pages slowly, taking her time to peruse Sally\u2019s notes and tabulations.</p><p>Someday she\u2019d have her own shop, keep her own ledgers. It was a dream she hadn\u2019t shared with anyone\u2014not even her closest friend. Just a promise she recited to herself, when the hours of farm and serving work lay heavy on her shoulders.</p><p>Someday.</p><p>She found the correct page. After the credit they earned from bringing in eggs, they only owed sixpence for the rest of their shopping. Good.</p><p>Bang.</p> <p>She whipped her head up, startled.</p><p>\u201cGood gracious, child! What on earth are you doing?\u201d Mrs. Whittlecombe slapped the counter again.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I\u2019m p-puttin\u2019 back the alum,\u201d Daniela stammered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not \u2018da aw-wum,\u2019 \u201d the old woman repeated, mocking Daniela\u2019s thick speech. \u201cThat\u2019s the sugar.\u201d</p><p>Oh, bollocks. Pauline winced. She knew she should have done it herself. But she\u2019d wanted so fiercely for Daniela to show that wretched old bat she could do it.</p><p>Now the wretched old bat cackled in triumph.</p> <p>Confused, Daniela smiled and tried to laugh along.</p><p>Pauline\u2019s heart broke for her sister. They were only a year apart in age, but so many more in understanding. Of all the things that came a bit more difficult for Daniela than other people\u2014pronouncing words that ended in consonants, subtracting from numbers greater than ten\u2014cruelty seemed the hardest concept for her to grasp. A mercy, in Amos Simms\u2019s family.</p><p>\u201cNot the clayed sugar,\u201d Rufus Bright moaned.</p><p>Sally boxed him across the ear.</p><p>\u201cI just scraped it from the cone,\u201d he apologized, rubbing the side of his head. \u201cBin was almost full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s entirely useless now,\u201d said Mrs. Whittlecombe smugly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay for the sugar,\u201d Pauline said. She felt instantly nauseous, as if she\u2019d swallowed five pounds of the stuff raw. Fine white sugar came dear.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Sally said in a low voice. \u201cWe\u2019re practically sisters. We should be real sisters, if my brother Errol had any sense in his head.\u201d</p> <p>Pauline shook her head. She\u2019d ceased pining for Errol Bright when they parted ways years ago. She certainly didn\u2019t want to be indebted to him now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay for it,\u201d she insisted. \u201cIt was my mistake. I should have done it myself, but I was in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>And now she would certainly be late for her post at the Bull and Blossom. This day only grew worse and worse.</p><p>Sally looked pained, caught between the need to turn a profit and the desire to help a friend.</p><p>In the corner, Daniela had finally realized the consequences of her error. \u201cI can put it back,\u201d she said, scooping from the sugar barrel and dumping it into the alum, muddling both quantities with her flowing tears. \u201cI can put it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, dear.\u201d Pauline went to her side and gently removed the tin scoop from her sister\u2019s hand. \u201cGo on,\u201d she told Sally firmly. \u201cI think I have some credit in the ledger.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t just think she had credit. She knew she did. Several pages beyond the Simms family account, there was a page labeled simply PAULINE\u2014and it showed precisely two pounds, four shillings, and eight pence of credit accrued. For the past few years, she\u2019d saved and scrimped every penny she could, trusting Sally\u2019s ledger with the safekeeping. It was the closest thing to a bank account a serving girl like her could have.</p><p>Almost a year, she\u2019d been saving. Saving for something better, for her and Daniela both. Saving for someday.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d she said.</p><p>With a few strokes of Sally\u2019s quill, the money was almost entirely gone. Eleven shillings, eight pence left.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t charge for the alum,\u201d Sally murmured.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Small comfort, but it was something. \u201cRufus, would you kindly walk my sister home? I\u2019m due at the tavern, and she\u2019s upset.\u201d</p><p>Rufus, apparently ashamed of his earlier behavior, offered his arm. \u201c \u2019Course I will. Come along, Danny. I\u2019ll drive you in the cart.\u201d</p><p>When Daniela resisted, Pauline hugged her and whispered, \u201cYou go home, and tonight I\u2019ll bring your penny.\u201d</p><p>The promise brightened Daniela\u2019s face. It was her daily task to gather the eggs, count and candle them, and prepare them to sell. In return, Pauline gave her a penny a week.</p><p>Every Saturday evening she watched Daniela carefully add the coin to an old, battered tea tin. She would shake the tin and grin, satisfied with the rattling sound. It was a ritual that pleased them both. The next morning the same treasured penny went into the church offering\u2014every Sunday, without fail.</p><p>\u201cGo on, then.\u201d She sent her sister off with a smile she didn\u2019t quite feel.</p><p>Once Rufus and Daniela had left, Mrs. Whittlecombe crowed with satisfaction. \u201cThat\u2019ll be a lesson for you, bringing a simpleton around the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo easy, Mrs. Whittlecombe,\u201d a bystander said. \u201cYou know they mean well.\u201d</p><p>Pauline flinched inwardly. Not that phrase. She\u2019d heard it countless times over the course of her life. Always in that same pitying tone, usually accompanied by a clucking tongue: Can\u2019t be hard on those Simms girls . . . you know they mean well.</p><p>In other words, no one expected them to do a cursed thing right. How could they? Two unwanted daughters in a family with no sons. One simple-minded, the other lacking in every feminine grace.</p><p>Just once, Pauline wanted to be known not for meaning well, but for doing well.</p><p>That day wouldn\u2019t be today. Not only had everything gone wrong, but as she regarded Mrs. Whittlecombe, Pauline couldn\u2019t muster any good intentions. Anger bloomed in her chest like a predatory vine, all sharp needles and grasping tendrils.</p><p>The old woman placed two bottles of tonic in her netted bag. They clinked together in a way that only increased Pauline\u2019s anger. \u201cNext time, keep the fool thing at home.\u201d</p><p>Her hands balled into tight fists at her side. Of course she wouldn\u2019t lash out at an old woman the way she\u2019d once fought the teasing boys at school, but the motion was instinctive. \u201cDaniela is not a thing. She is a person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a half-wit. She doesn\u2019t belong out of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made a mistake. Just like all people make mistakes.\u201d Pauline reached for the bin of ruined white sugar. It was hers now, wasn\u2019t it? She\u2019d paid for the contents. \u201cFor example, everyone knows I\u2019m incurably clumsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPauline,\u201d Sally warned. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Too late. With an angry heave, she launched the bin\u2019s contents into the air.</p><p>The room exploded in a blizzard of white, and Mrs. Whittlecombe was at the storm\u2019s dead center, sputtering and cursing through a cloud of powder. When the flurries cleared, she looked like Lot\u2019s wife, only turned to a pillar of sugar rather than salt.</p><p>The sense of divine retribution that settled on Pauline . . . it was almost worth all that hard-earned money.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>She tossed the empty bin to the floor. \u201cOh, dear. How stupid of me.\u201d</p><p>Griff regarded his mother and that smug smile curving her lips. This time she\u2019d gone too far. This wasn\u2019t mere meddling. It was diabolical.</p><p>Not Spinster Cove.</p><p>He\u2019d never visited the place, but he knew it well by reputation. This seaside hamlet was where old maids went to embroider and consumptives went to dry.</p><p>Accepting the footman\u2019s hand, the duchess alighted from the coach. \u201cI understand this place is just bursting with well-bred, unmarried young ladies.\u201d</p><p>She motioned toward a lodging house. A sign dangling above the entrance announced it as THE QUEEN\u2019S RUBY.</p><p>Griff blinked at the green shutters and cheery window boxes stuffed with geraniums. He\u2019d rather bathe in water teeming with sharks.</p><p>He turned and walked in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked, following.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d He nodded at a tavern across the square. By squinting at the sign hung over the red-painted door, he discerned it was called the Bull and Blossom. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a pint of ale and something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>He gestured expansively. \u201cMake yourself comfortable. Take a suite at the rooming house. Enjoy the healthful sea breezes. I\u2019ll send the coach for you in a few weeks.\u201d He added under his breath, \u201cOr years.\u201d</p><p>The footman followed a respectful pace behind, holding the open parasol to shade the duchess.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to select a bride, and you\u2019re going to do it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand what sort of young ladies are sent to this village? The unmarriageable ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. It\u2019s perfect. None of them will turn you down.\u201d</p><p>Her words drew Griff to a sharp halt. He swiveled to face her. \u201cTurn me down?\u201d</p><p>For the obvious reasons, he avoided discussing his affaires with her. But the reason he\u2019d been celibate lo these many months had nothing to do with women turning him down. There were many women\u2014beautiful, sophisticated, sensual women\u2014who\u2019d gladly welcome him to their beds this very evening. He was tempted to tell her so, but a man couldn\u2019t say such things to his own mother.</p><p>She seemed to interpret his silence easily enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not speaking of carnality. I\u2019m speaking of your desirability as a husband. Your reputation leaves a great deal to be desired.\u201d She brushed some dust from his sleeve. \u201cThen there\u2019s the aging problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018aging\u2019 problem?\u201d He was thirty-four. By his estimation, his cock had a good three decades of working order ahead, at least.</p><p>\u201cTo be sure, you\u2019re good-looking enough. But there are handsomer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re my mother?\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked on. \u201cThe fact is, most ladies of the ton have given you up as a marriage prospect. A village of desperate spinsters is precisely what we need. You must admit, this worked nicely for that scampish friend of yours, Lord Payne.\u201d</p><p>God\u2019s knees. So that\u2019s what was behind this. Curse that rogue Colin Sandhurst and his bespectacled, bookish bride. Last year, his old gambling friend had been sequestered in this seaside village without funds, and he\u2019d broken free by eloping with a bluestocking. The pair had even stopped at Winterset Grange, Griff\u2019s country retreat, on their way to Scotland.</p><p>But their situations were completely different. Griff wasn\u2019t desperate for funds in any way. Neither was he desperate for companionship.</p><p>Marriage simply wasn\u2019t in the cards for him.</p><p>His mother fixed him with a look. \u201cWere you waiting to fall in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple question. Have you delayed marriage all these years because you\u2019re waiting to fall in love?\u201d</p><p>A simple question, she called it. The answers were anything but.</p><p>He could have taken her into the tavern, ordered a few large glasses of wine, and taken an hour or two to explain everything. That he wouldn\u2019t be marrying this season, or any season. Her only son would not be merely a blot on the distinguished Halford line, but the very end of it, forever, and the family legacy she held so dear was destined for obscurity. Her hopes of grandchildren would come to naught.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. Not even today, when she was at her most infuriating. Better to remain a dissolute-yet-redeemable rascal in her eyes than be the son who calmly, irrevocably, broke his mother\u2019s heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he told her honestly. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting to fall in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s convenient. We can settle this in one morning. Never mind finding the most polished young beauty in England. You choose a girl\u2014any girl\u2014and I\u2019ll polish her myself. Who could better prepare the future Duchess of Halford than the current Duchess of Halford?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached the tavern entrance. His mother stared pointedly at the door latch. The footman jumped to open it.</p> <p>\u201cOh, look,\u201d she said upon entering. \u201cWhat luck. Here they are.\u201d</p><p>Griff looked. The scene was even ghastlier than he could have imagined.</p><p>This tavern didn\u2019t seem to be a \u201ctavern\u201d at all, but more of a tea shop. Young ladies crowded the establishment, all of them hunched over tables and frowning in concentration. They appeared to be engaged in one of those absurd handicrafts that passed for female \u201caccomplishment\u201d these days. Quilling paper, it looked like. They weren\u2019t even using fresh parchment\u2014just ripping pages straight from books to fashion their queer little trivets and tea trays.</p><p>He peered at the nearest stack of volumes. Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom for Young Ladies, each one read. Appalling.</p><p>This was everything he\u2019d been avoiding for years. A roomful of unmarried, uninspiring young women, from which the common wisdom would argue he should find a suitable bride.</p> <p>At the nudging of a friend, one young woman rose from her chair and curtsied. \u201cMay we help you, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grace.\u201d</p><p>The young woman\u2019s brow creased. \u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the Duchess of Halford. You would properly address me as \u2018your grace.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I see.\u201d As her nudging friend smothered a nervous giggle, the fair-haired young woman began again. \u201cMay we help you, your grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stand tall, girl. So my son can see you.\u201d She turned her head, surveying the rest of the room. \u201cAll of you, on your feet. Best posture.\u201d</p> <p>Pain forked through Griff\u2019s skull as chair legs screeched against floorboards. One by one the young ladies obediently rose to their feet.</p><p>He noted a few pockmarks. One case of crooked teeth. They were none of them hideous, just\u2014fragile in some cases. Others were unfashionably browned from the sun.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the duchess said, striding into the center of the room. \u201cJewels in the rough. In some cases, very rough. But they are all from good family, so with a bit of polish . . .\u201d She turned to him. \u201cTake your choice, Halford. Select any girl who strikes your fancy. I will make her into a duchess.\u201d</p><p>Every jaw in the room dropped.</p><p>Every jaw, that was, except Griff\u2019s.</p><p>He massaged his throbbing temples and began preparing a little speech in his mind. Ladies, I beg you. Pay this raving madwoman no attention. She\u2019s entered her decline.</p><p>But then, he thought\u2014a quick exit was too kind to her. Surely the only proper punishment was the opposite: to do precisely as his mother asked.</p><p>He said, \u201cYou claim you can make any one of these girls into a suitable duchess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who will be the judge of your success?\u201d</p><p>She lifted a brow. \u201cSociety, of course. Choose your young lady, and she\u2019ll be the toast of London by season\u2019s end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe toast of London, you say?\u201d He gave a doubtful laugh.</p><p>He scanned the tavern for a second time, planning to declare mad, instantaneous love for the most shrinking, awkward, homely chit available\u2014and then watch his mother sputter and flail in response.</p><p>However, from the amused glances the young ladies exchanged, Griff could sense that there was more courage and wit in the room than his first impression might have indicated. These young women were no fools. And though they each had their flaws and imperfections\u2014who didn\u2019t?\u2014none were unsuitable to a shocking, insurmountable degree.</p><p>Damn. He\u2019d looked forward to teaching his overstepping mother a lesson. As matters stood, he supposed he\u2019d be better served to just mutter a few apologies, drag the duchess back to the carriage, and drop her at Bedlam on the way home.</p><p>And then, with a creak of hinges and a slam of the rear door\u2014</p><p>His salvation arrived.</p><p>She came stumbling through the back entrance of the tavern, red-faced and breathless. Her boots and hem were spattered with alarming amounts of mud, and a strange white powder clung to her everywhere else.</p><p>A serving girl\u2019s apron hung loose around her neck. As she gathered the tapes and knotted them behind her back, the cinch of laces revealed a slender, almost boyish figure. Less of a shapely hourglass, more of a sturdy hitching post.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ten past, Pauline.\u201d The male voice boomed from the kitchen.</p><p>She called back, \u201cBeggin\u2019 pardon, Mr. Fosbury. I\u2019ll not be tardy again.\u201d</p><p>Her diction and accent were not merely uneducated and rural\u2014they were odd. When she turned, Griff could make out the reason why. She had a hairpin clenched in her teeth like a cheroot, and she mumbled her words around it.</p><p>The tardy serving girl clutched another hairpin in her hand, and when her eyes\u2014leaf-green, bright with intelligence\u2014met Griff\u2019s, she froze in the act of jamming that pin through the tangle of hair piled atop her head.</p><p>God, that hair. He\u2019d heard ladies describe their coiffures as \u201cknots\u201d or \u201cbuns.\u201d This could only be called a \u201cnest.\u201d He was certain he glimpsed a few blades of straw and grass in there.</p><p>Clearly, she\u2019d been hoping to enter unnoticed. Instead, she was suddenly the center of attention. That mysterious white powder that clung to her . . . it caught the light, shooting off tiny sparks.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>As the breathless young woman alternated glances between Griff, his mother, and the amused ladies filling the rest of the room, her unfinished coiffure disintegrated. Locks of unpinned hair tumbled to her shoulders, surrendering to gravity or indignity, or both.</p><p>This would be where the average serving girl would duck her head, flee the room, and await her employer\u2019s wrath. No doubt there\u2019d be sniffling or sobbing involved.</p><p>But not this serving girl, apparently. This one had just enough pride to trump etiquette and good sense.</p><p>With a defiant toss of her head to distribute her brandy-colored locks, she turned and spat the last hairpin aside.</p><p>\u201cBollocks,\u201d he heard her mutter.</p><p>Suddenly, Griff found himself battling a grin. She was perfect. Coarse, uneducated, utterly graceless. A touch too pretty. A plainer girl would have better suited his purpose. But fair looks notwithstanding, she\u2019d do.</p><p>\u201cHer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take her.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Another girl\u2019s prince has arrived.</p><p>That was Pauline\u2019s first thought, when she stumbled in and spied the finely dressed man silhouetted in the door.</p><p>She watched it happen every few months in this village. These young ladies sought refuge in Spindle Cove for the oddest of reasons. Their harp-playing lacked grace, perhaps, or the color of their eyes was unfashionable at Court this season. And then\u2014to the utter astonishment of everyone except Pauline\u2014some handsome earl or viscount or officer came along and married them.</p><p>None of them spared so much as a glance for the serving girl.</p><p>So which lady was this one after? Whoever she was, she\u2019d be set for life. Everything about the man\u2019s appearance\u2014from ivory buttons to fitted leather gloves\u2014blared his wealth in trumpet notes. And if his garments screamed \u201criches,\u201d everything beneath them spoke of power. It would be easy for a gentleman to go soft and paunchy, but he hadn\u2019t. The close cut of his dark green topcoat revealed broad shoulders and defined muscles in his upper arms.</p><p>His face was strong, too. Boldly sloped nose, squared jaw, and a wide, confident mouth. There was nothing pretty about his features, but when taken together, they had an undeniable masculine appeal.</p><p>In short, he was no trial to look at. But even if he weren\u2019t\u2014Pauline couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the man.</p><p>Because he wasn\u2019t taking his eyes off her.</p><p>And the way he looked at her\u2014like she was the answer to every question he\u2019d never thought to ask\u2014had her heart beating faster than a trapped hare\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t choose her,\u201d an older woman replied, clearly testy. \u201cThat\u2019s the serving girl.\u201d</p><p>Pauline spared the lady a brief glance, sizing her up as a silver-haired woman who was small of stature and long on self-importance. She had a rail-straight spine. She\u2019d need it, to hold up that unholy ransom in jewels.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a girl,\u201d the man replied evenly, still looking at Pauline. \u201cShe\u2019s a girl, and she\u2019s in the room. You said I might choose any girl in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t in the room when I said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the room now. And once I saw her, I had eyes for no one else. She\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Perfect?</p><p>Pauline looked to the window, expecting a pig to fly through it. A pig strumming a lyre and speaking Welsh, perhaps.</p><p>The gentleman moved toward her, navigating the room with ease. As he approached, each heavy, rhythmic footfall made her acutely aware of her wild, sugar-dusted hair and mud-spattered hem. She took comfort from the signs of his own flawed humanity. On closer view, he was unshaven, and his eyes were rimmed with red\u2014from lack of sleep or too much drink, or both.</p><p>Pauline inhaled slowly. His clothing carried the fading whiff of some masculine, musky cologne. The scent curled inside her, warming her in low, secret places.</p><p>\u201cTell me your name,\u201d he said.</p><p>He spoke in a voice that was low and rich and . . . magnetic, apparently. She could feel every person in the room sway in his direction, to better make out his words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Pauline, sir. Pauline Simms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you married or betrothed?\u201d</p><p>She bit back a startled laugh. \u201cNo, sir. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cI am Griffin Eliot York, the eighth Duke of Halford.\u201d</p><p>A duke?</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cActually, Simms, what you\u2019re meant to say is, \u2018your grace.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She dropped her gaze to the floorboards and made an off-balance curtsy. \u201cYour grace.\u201d</p><p>Waving off her belated attempts at deference, he went on. \u201cMy mother has grown impatient with my unmarried state. She enjoined me to take my choice of any woman in this room, with the promise that she could make that woman into a duchess. I\u2019ve chosen you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. You\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. Again, that word. Pauline\u2019s mind couldn\u2019t handle all this at once. She had to break the information into small morsels.</p><p>This robustly handsome, self-possessed, wonderful-smelling man was the eighth Duke of Halford.</p><p>Out of all the ladies in this room, he was choosing her, the serving girl.</p><p>To be his future duchess.</p><p>You\u2019re perfect.</p><p>Chills raced from the nape of her neck to the soles of her feet, leaving her breathless. Either the whole world had turned on its ear, or after twenty-three years of never being good enough . . . in the eyes of one man\u2014in the eyes of this duke\u2014she was perfect.</p><p>The duchess cast a cool gaze on her son. \u201cUnnatural child. You live to thwart me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d he replied calmly. \u201cI\u2019m doing precisely as you asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am serious. I\u2019ve chosen a girl. Here she is.\u201d The duke made a sweeping gesture from Pauline\u2019s tangled hair to her muddy shoes, painting her with humiliation. \u201cGo on, then. Make her a duchess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ah. She understood everything now. She was perfect in his eyes. Perfectly dreadful. Perfectly graceless. Perfectly wrong to be a duchess, and by making her an example, the duke meant to teach his interfering mother a lesson.</p><p>How clever of him. How obnoxious and insufferable, to boot.</p><p>It\u2019s your own fault, Pauline. For that one, mad instant, you were a fool.</p><p>She didn\u2019t find him so handsome anymore. But he still smelled wonderful, drat him.</p> <p>There was a pause, which no one in the room dared interrupt. It was as though they were spectators to a championship match of some sort, and the duke had just scored a critical point.</p><p>Every head swiveled to face the duchess, waiting for her move.</p><p>She had no intention of forfeiting. \u201cWell, then. We\u2019ll go to the girl\u2019s parents.\u201d</p><p>Brazen strategy, thought Pauline. Two points to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love nothing more.\u201d Halford pulled his coat straight. \u201cBut I must be returning to Town at once, and I\u2019m certain Simms can\u2019t leave her post.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCertainly I can,\u201d Pauline said.</p><p>Both the duke and his mother turned to her, clearly irritated that she\u2019d dared interrupt. Never mind that she was subject of their argument.</p><p>\u201cI can leave my post anytime.\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cI don\u2019t need a post at all, do I? Not if I\u2019m to be a duchess.\u201d</p><p>The duke gave her a blank look. Obviously, he hadn\u2019t expected this reaction. She was probably supposed to stammer and protest and run blushing into the kitchen.</p><p>Unlucky for him. He\u2019d picked the wrong girl.</p><p>Of course, she knew he\u2019d meant to pick the \u201cwrong girl,\u201d but he\u2019d picked the wrong \u201cwrong girl.\u201d Pauline enjoyed a good laugh as much as the next person, but already she\u2019d lost too much today. She couldn\u2019t part with her last tattered remnant of pride.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Fosbury,\u201d she called in the direction of the kitchen, untying her apron strings. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving now. I don\u2019t expect I\u2019ll be coming back today. I\u2019m taking this duke \u2019round to the cottage so he can ask for my hand in marriage.\u201d</p><p>That brought Fosbury out from the kitchens, looking perplexed as he wiped his floury hands on an apron.</p><p>Pauline gave him a reassuring wink. Then she turned to the duchess, smiling wide. \u201cShall we, your grace?\u201d She made a show of giggling. \u201cOh, pardon. Did you want I should call you \u2018Mother\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Ripples of hushed laughter moved through the room. The look of aristocratic discomfort on the duchess\u2019s face was immensely satisfying.</p><p>Whatever stubborn, unfeeling game this duke and his mother were playing, they were gaining a third player in Pauline.</p><p>What\u2019s more, Pauline was going to win.</p><p>Turning her gaze to the duke, she gave him a bold, unashamed inspection. No chore there. The man truly was a fine specimen of masculinity, from broad shoulders to sculpted thighs. If he could ogle her, why couldn\u2019t she look right back?</p><p>\u201cCor.\u201d She unleashed her broadest country accent as she tipped her head to admire the lower curve of his tight, aristocratic arse. \u201cI\u2019ll have great fun with you on the wedding night.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes flared, swift enough to make her insides wince. Could teasing a duke amount to a hanging offense? He certainly possessed the power and means to make her regret it.</p><p>But when all the Spindle Cove ladies broke into open, boisterous laughter, Pauline knew it would be fine. She wasn\u2019t one of the Spindle Cove set. She was a servant, not a well-bred lady on holiday. But they would stand by her, just the same.</p><p>Miss Charlotte Highwood rose and spoke in her defense. \u201cYour graces, we are honored by your visit, but I don\u2019t think we could part with Pauline today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we find ourselves in conflict,\u201d the duke said. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t intend to part with her at all.\u201d</p><p>The dark resolve in his words sent odd sensations shooting through Pauline. He meant to continue this farce? Stubbornness must run in this duke\u2019s family the way green eyes ran in hers.</p><p>The duchess tilted her head toward the door. \u201cWell, then. The coach is waiting.\u201d</p><p>And that was how Pauline Simms, tavern serving girl and farmer\u2019s daughter, found herself bringing a duke and his mother home for tea.</p><p>Well, and why the deuce not?</p><p>If these Quality meant to embarrass her in front of all Spindle Cove, it was only fitting they should sacrifice some pride of their own. She couldn\u2019t wait to see the duchess\u2019s face when they pulled up before her family\u2019s humble cottage. It might do them good to see how common folk lived\u2014to sit on rough-hewn wooden stools and drink from chipped crockery. She and Sally Bright would be laughing over this story for the rest of their lives.</p><p>After giving directions to the driver, Pauline joined them inside the coach. She slid a hand over the calfskin seat, marveling. She\u2019d never touched an actual calf this soft.</p><p>She was certain no one of her station had ever been a passenger inside this conveyance, and judging by the grim sets of their jaws, she would guess neither the duke nor the duchess were pleased to have a sugar-dusted serving girl and her muddy shoes joining them now.</p><p>Which only made Pauline more resolved\u2014she was going to wring this experience for every last drop of amusement.</p><p>For the entirety of the ten-minute drive to her farm cottage, she reveled in inappropriate behavior. She bounced on the seat, testing the springs. She played with the window latch, sliding the glass pane up and down a dozen times.</p><p>\u201cWhat does your father do, Miss Simms?\u201d the duchess asked.</p><p>Other than shout, curse, rage, threaten? \u201cHe farms, your grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tenant farmer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he owns our land. Some thirty acres.\u201d</p><p>Of course, thirty acres would be nothing to a true landed gentleman, much less a duke. Halford probably owned a thousand times it.</p><p>As the carriage left town, they passed by the Willetts\u2019 fields. Mr. Willett\u2019s oldest boy was out working in the hops. Pauline put down the window for the thirteenth time, stuck her arm out and waved gaily.</p><p>She put her thumb and forefinger in her mouth and whistled loud. \u201cGerry!\u201d she called. \u201cGerald Willett, look! It\u2019s me, Pauline! I\u2019m going to be a duchess, Ger!\u201d</p><p>When she settled back inside the carriage, she caught the duke and his mother exchanging a look. She propped one elbow on the windowsill, covered her mouth with her palm and laughed.</p><p>As they neared the cottage, Pauline rapped on the carriage roof to signal the driver. When the coach had rolled to a stop, she reached for the door latch.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d With the crook of her parasol handle, the duchess snagged her by the wrist. \u201cWe have people for that.\u201d</p><p>Pauline froze, taken aback. She was one of the people for that. Or had the old lady forgotten?</p><p>The duke knocked the parasol aside. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Mother. She\u2019s not a wayward lamb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou chose her. You told me to make her a duchess. Her lessons start now.\u201d</p><p>Pauline shrugged. If the woman insisted, she would wait and allow the liveried footman to open the door, lower the step, and assist her down with white-gloved hands.</p><p>As the duchess alighted, followed by her son, Pauline dipped in a deep, exaggerated curtsy. \u201cWelcome to our humble home, your graces.\u201d</p><p>She opened the gate and led them through the fenced poultry yard. The gander was after them immediately, honking and ruffling his wings. No one could tell Major he didn\u2019t outclass a duke. The duchess tried a freezing look, but quickly resorted to wielding her parasol in defense.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do, Major.\u201d Pauline clapped her hands. Then she ushered her guests inside. \u201cThis way, your graces. Don\u2019t be bashful. Our home is yours. We\u2019re all family now.\u201d</p><p>The door lintel was low and the duke was tall. He would have to duck to avoid bashing his head. He paused at the threshold. For a moment Pauline thought he\u2019d simply turn around, return to the carriage, and drive off to London.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. He bent at the waist and passed through the doorway in a single, fluid motion.</p><p>She had to smile at that. The arrogant duke, literally stooping to enter her family\u2019s cottage.</p><p>Once inside, the two visitors swept a look around the small, sparsely furnished abode. It wasn\u2019t difficult to take in the whole dwelling at a glance. The house was only some dozen paces wide. A stone hearth, a few cupboards, table and chairs. Faded print curtains fluttered in the two front windows. To the side, an open doorway led to the only bedroom. A ladder climbed to the sleeping loft she and Daniela shared.</p><p>The rear doorway led to the exterior area where they did all the washing. Soft splashes indicated someone was washing up after the noon meal.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d she sang out, \u201clook who I brought home from the Bull and Blossom. The ninth Duke of Halstone and his mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalford,\u201d the duchess corrected. \u201cMy son is the eighth Duke of Halford. He\u2019s also the Marquess of Westmore, the Earl of Ridingham, Viscount Newthorpe, and Lord Hartford-on-Trent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Suppose I should learn it all proper, shouldn\u2019t I? I mean, seeing as how it\u2019ll be my name, too.\u201d She grinned broadly at the duke. \u201cFancy that.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked a fraction. Whether in irritation or amusement, she didn\u2019t dare to guess.</p><p>\u201cWill you sit?\u201d she asked the duchess.</p><p>\u201cI will not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need the privy,\u201d she informed them in a confidential tone, \u201cyou go through that door, back around the woodpile, and left at the pigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPauline?\u201d Mother came through the back door, wiping her hands on a towel.</p><p>\u201cMother, there you are. Has Father gone back to the fields?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Amos Simms, darkening the same doorway her mother had just traversed. \u201cNo, he \u2019asn\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>She found herself holding her breath as her father peered at the duke, then the duchess.</p><p>Lastly, he turned a menacing glare on Pauline.</p><p>A sharp tingle of warning volleyed between her shoulder blades. She would pay for this later, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this, then?\u201d her father demanded.</p><p>Pauline swept an arm toward her guests. \u201cFather, may I present His Grace, the eighth Duke of Halford, and his mother. As for what they\u2019re doing here . . .\u201d She turned to the duke. \u201cI should let his grace explain it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, excellent. The girl wanted him to explain it.</p><p>Griff exhaled, running a hand through his hair. There was no satisfactory explanation he could offer. He had no bloody idea what he was doing in this hovel.</p><p>Something sharp jabbed him in the kidney, nudging him forward. That damned parasol again.</p><p>Oh, yes. He recalled it now. There was a reason he was here, and the Reason Herself needed a sharp lesson in minding her own affairs.</p><p>He snatched the parasol from his mother\u2019s grip and presented it to the farmwife. \u201cPlease accept this gift as thanks for your hospitality.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Simms was a small woman with stooped shoulders. She looked as faded and wrung out as the dish towel in her red-knuckled hands. The woman stared at the furled parasol, seemingly dumbfounded by its tooled ivory handle.</p><p>\u201cI insist.\u201d He pressed it toward her.</p><p>She took it, reluctantly. \u201cThat\u2019s v-very kind, your grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever enter a house empty-handed. My mother taught me that.\u201d He shot the duchess a look. \u201cMother, sit down.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d With his boot, he hooked a rough wooden bench and pulled it out from the table. Its legs scratched across the straw-strewn dirt floor. \u201cSit here. You are a guest in this house.\u201d</p><p>She sat, arranging her voluminous skirts about her. But she didn\u2019t try to look pleased about it.</p><p>For the next minute or so, Griff learned how it felt to be a menagerie exhibit, as the collected Simms family stood about, gawking at them in silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMrs. Simms,\u201d he finally said, \u201cperhaps you\u2019d be so kind as to offer us some refreshment. I would have a word with your husband.\u201d</p><p>With evident relief at her dismissal, Mrs. Simms drew her daughter into the kitchen. Griff pulled a cane-backed chair away from the table and sat.</p><p>As Simms settled on the other chair, the burly farmer narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat can I do for you, yer grace?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Simms grunted. \u201cI knew it. What\u2019s the girl done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something she\u2019s done. It\u2019s what my mother would like her to do.\u201d</p><p>Simms cut a shrewd glance toward the duchess. \u201cIs her grace needing a scullery maid, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My mother would like a daughter-in-law. She thinks I need a wife. And she claims she can make your girl\u201d\u2014he waved in the direction of the kitchen\u2014\u201cinto a duchess.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment the farmer was silent. Then his face split in a gap-toothed grin. He chuckled, in a low, greasy way.</p><p>\u201cPauline,\u201d he said. \u201cA duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you won\u2019t be offended, Mr. Simms, if I admit doubts as to the likelihood of her success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA duchess.\u201d The farmer shook his head and continued chuckling.</p><p>The boorish, sinister tone of his laughter had Griff shifting his weight on the chair. To be sure, it was an absurd idea. But even so, shouldn\u2019t a man defend his own daughter?</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cHere\u2019s my offer. A man only has one mother, and I\u2019ve decided to indulge mine. What say I take your daughter to London? There, my mother might have her best crack at transforming her from a serving girl into a lady sufficiently polished and cultured to be a duke\u2019s bride.\u201d</p> <p>Simms laughed again.</p><p>\u201cOf course, in the much more likely event that this enterprise fails, we will return your daughter to you. At the least, she\u2019ll come home with a few new gowns and some exposure to the finer things in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy girl don\u2019t need new gowns. Nor any of your finer things.\u201d</p><p>Just then the girl in question returned to set the table. The dish she placed before Griff was possibly the ugliest teacup he\u2019d ever seen\u2014a cheaply painted bit of china no doubt birthed in some cut-rate factory and passed down through several owners. But before releasing the saucer, she gave it a brisk quarter turn, so that the pathetic, limp flower on the cup would face him and the saucer\u2019s chip was on the hidden side.</p><p>The meaning in the gesture wasn\u2019t lost on Griff. She was a proud one, no question. Also smart-mouthed and bold enough to bait a duke and his dragon of a mother. None of those traits were desirable qualities in a serving girl, much less in a bride.</p><p>But they were qualities Griff appreciated in general, and he was beginning to admire this Pauline Simms. Just a bit, and just for herself. During her few minutes in the kitchen, she\u2019d tied back her hair. Her figure remained unremarkable, but now he could see she was more than a little pretty. High cheekbones, gentle nose, eyes tipped at the corners like a cat\u2019s. Quite fetching, really, in a rustic, country way. All the farmhands must be mad for her.</p><p>You\u2019ve sworn off women, a voice inside him nagged.</p><p>Well, that oath needed some amendment. He\u2019d sworn off involvement with women, perhaps. That didn\u2019t mean he was going to poke out his eyes. A bit of casual appreciation never hurt anyone\u2014and he suspected it might do this particular woman some good.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re set on her, we can talk.\u201d Simms scratched his jaw. \u201cBut I can\u2019t let her go easy.\u201d</p><p>Good, Griff thought. No right-thinking father should let a bright, pretty daughter go easily.</p><p>The farmer lifted his voice. \u201cCome \u2019ere, Paul.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed. As she moved toward them, her mouth was a tight line.</p><p>\u201cLook at these \u2019ands of hers,\u201d Simms said, taking his daughter by the wrist and extending her hand and forearm for Griff\u2019s inspection.</p><p>Her fingers were slender and graceful, but her palm showed the calluses and scars of menial labor\u2014labor more strenuous than serving pots of tea to spinsters. No doubt she helped with the farm work, too.</p><p>Simms shook his daughter\u2019s wrist, and her hand flopped up and down. \u201cNo one else has hands this small. Nor an arm this thin.\u201d He made a circle of his thumb and forefinger, easily ringing Pauline\u2019s slender wrist. \u201cI\u2019ve a mare about to foal. Ain\u2019t no one else on this farm what can reach up inside and grab the foreleg, if need be.\u201d</p><p>The farmer slid the ring of his thumb and forefinger from Pauline\u2019s wrist all the way to her elbow, visually demonstrating just what equine depths his slender-armed daughter would be called to explore.</p><p>Griff\u2019s missed breakfast now seemed like a blessing.</p><p>\u201cJes\u2019 look at that,\u201d Simms said. \u201cShe can reach all the way to the womb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather.\u201d Pauline snatched her arm away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s worth something, right there,\u201d her father said. \u201cCan\u2019t let her go without compensation. In advance.\u201d</p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p>Mr. Simms was a farmer. A poor farmer, yes\u2014but not a destitute one. He owned thirty acres. His cottage was humble, but sound. No one was starving under this roof. A strange nobleman entered his home, and he offered, for all intents and purposes, to sell his daughter?</p><p>What of the girl\u2019s safety? What of her reputation? Griff wasn\u2019t the sort of nobleman to buy himself a virgin for despoiling, but Mr. Simms couldn\u2019t know that. This was the point where any decent father\u2014hell, any sort of real man\u2014would at least demand assurances. If not tell Griff to take his feudal offer and go straight to the devil.</p><p>But Mr. Simms didn\u2019t. Which told Griff he was a shoddy excuse for a father and no kind of man at all. The farmer wasn\u2019t the least bit concerned about his daughter\u2019s health or reputation. No, he just wanted to be compensated in advance. For his extra trouble when the mare foaled.</p><p>\u201cThis is truly your only objection?\u201d he asked pointedly, giving the farmer a chance to redeem himself.</p><p>Mr. Simms frowned. \u201cNot the only objection.\u201d</p><p>Well, thank God.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the wages she brings home,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ll need those in advance, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer wages.\u201d</p><p>Griff had the sudden urge to hit something. Something wearing a coarse homespun shirt, dirt-caked boots, and a greedy sneer. That was it. His mother would need to learn her lesson in some other way, at some other time. He needed to leave. This interview either ended now or it ended badly.</p><p>Drawing on some generations-old reserve of ducal composure, he rose to his feet. \u201cPerhaps this was an ill-considered plan. The chances of your daughter succeeding in London society are minuscule, and the risks to her are too great.\u201d He made his way toward the cottage door, pausing only to catch his mother by the elbow and pull her to her feet. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, my mother and I will be on our\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d the farmer called.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let her go for five pounds.\u201d</p><p>Griff could only stare at him. \u201cGood God, man. Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>He cracked his neck. \u201cAll right, then. You can have her for four pounds, eight. But not a penny less.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell. Griff passed a hand over his face. Now he looked as though he was haggling for the girl, determined to ruin her life for the lowest possible price.</p><p>\u201cWhat an excellent bargain.\u201d Irony dripped from his mother\u2019s words. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could find a more economical choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re happy with yourself,\u201d Griff said.</p><p>The duchess arched a brow, deflecting all censure back at him. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>No. He wasn\u2019t. He felt like a first-rate ass. He\u2019d thought himself so damned clever, picking the serving girl out of the spinster crowd. And now he\u2019d invaded her home and forced her to watch while her own father placed a price of four pounds, eight shillings on her health and happiness.</p><p>Even for him, this was low.</p><p>Miss Simms emerged again, moving toward the table with teapot in hand. Their gazes locked, and her eyes taught him some bold, nameless shade of green. Deep in some unexplored virgin forest, there was a vine of that color, just waiting to be discovered. And there was something essential in this girl\u2019s nature that was far, far better than this place.</p><p>Just then, Griff observed a telling sequence of events.</p><p>A clatter rose from the rear of the house.</p><p>With a quiet curse, Pauline Simms stumbled. Hot tea sloshed on the cottage\u2019s dirt floor.</p><p>\u201cPaul, I told you\u2014\u201d The farmer\u2019s hand went up in threat.</p><p>And standing four full paces away, Pauline\u2014the girl who would hold her own against a duke\u2014flinched.</p><p>He\u2019d seen enough.</p><p>\u201cMother, go ahead to the coach.\u201d He quelled her objection with a small gesture, then turned to the girl. \u201cMiss Simms, a word outside. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Pauline followed him out the front door and around to the side of the house. The south side, where there were no windows for the family to peer at them. Neither could the duchess view this corner from the carriage. It was just the two of them, alone with a late-blossoming apple tree and the ridiculousness of it all.</p><p>She hoped they might have a good laugh and part ways. There would be evening chores to be done before long, and she\u2019d had enough of dukes for one day.</p><p>Apparently, he\u2019d reached a breaking point, too. He stalked the yard in long strides. Back, then forth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve reached a decision.\u201d He plucked a dead, dangling branch from the apple tree and tapped it on the fence rail. \u201cSimms, you\u2019re coming with me to London. This very afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Her breath left her. \u201cBut . . . but why? For what purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuchess training, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t truly mean to marry me.\u201d</p><p>He came to a decisive halt. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t mean to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Well. She was glad they had that settled.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s set a few things straight at the outset,\u201d he said. \u201cI might wear fine clothes and possess a splendid carriage, and I\u2019ve rolled into your life on something that might resemble a whirlwind. Perhaps even a romantic one, to the untutored eye. But this isn\u2019t a fairy tale, and anyone who knows me could tell you . . . I am no prince.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cWith all due apologies, your grace, I hadn\u2019t formed any opinions to the contrary. I stopped believing in fairy tales long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo practical for such things, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to work hard for the things I want in life.\u201d Sadly, she was still wearing a full year\u2019s hard work spattered in her hair and frock.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Because what I\u2019m offering you is employment. I mean to hire you as a sort of companion to my mother. Come to London, submit to her \u2018duchess training,\u2019 and prove a comprehensive catastrophe. Should require little effort on your part.\u201d</p><p>Pauline\u2019s jaw worked but no words came out.</p><p>\u201cIn exchange for your labors, I will give you one thousand pounds.\u201d He leveled his apple-branch switch at the cottage. \u201cAnd you will never depend on that man again.\u201d</p><p>One thousand pounds.</p><p>\u201cYour grace, I . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t even know what to say\u2014whether to call his proposal insufferable, or nonsensical, or a dream come true.</p><p>Impossible. That was the best word.</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He moved closer. The sun caught amber flecks in his dark brown eyes. \u201cYou can. And you will. I will make it so.\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze to the cottage, frustrated with his commanding demeanor and his stubbornly enticing scent. He smelled so wretchedly trustworthy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about your clothes and your things,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave it all. You\u2019ll have new.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour grace . . .\u201d</p><p>He tapped the branch against his booted calf. \u201cDon\u2019t play at reluctance. What can possibly be keeping you here? A post serving tea to spinsters? Farm labor, and sleeping space in a drafty loft? A brutish father who would eagerly sell you for five pounds?\u201d</p><p>She set her teeth. \u201cFive pounds is no paltry sum to folk like us.\u201d</p> <p>And even if it weren\u2019t a vast amount, it was five pounds more than \u201ccompletely worthless,\u201d which was how her father set a woman\u2019s value most days.</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d he said, \u201cfive pounds is considerably less than a thousand. Even a farm girl with no schooling can do that arithmetic.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Amazing. Just when she thought he\u2019d exhausted the ways to insult or demean her, he proved her wrong.</p><p>He said, \u201cMy mother has too much time at leisure. She needs a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to take shopping and drill in diction. I need her diverted from matchmaking. It\u2019s a simple solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple? You mean to bring me to your home . . . buy me all new things . . . pay me a thousand pounds. All that, just to cure your mother of meddling?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged in confirmation.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call that simple, your grace. Much easier to just tell her you don\u2019t wish to marry. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI think you enjoy being difficult. Which makes you the ideal candidate for this post.\u201d</p><p>Pauline was divided on how to receive that statement. For once, she was someone\u2019s ideal. Unfortunately, she was his ideal thorn in the side.</p><p>Nevertheless, his offer tempted in a perverse way. For once in her life she wouldn\u2019t be failing at success. She\u2019d be succeeding at failure. No more would she hear, \u201cBut she means well\u201d\u2014the duke didn\u2019t want her to mean well at all.</p><p>\u201cNone of this matters,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI can\u2019t leave Spindle Cove.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m offering you a lifetime of financial security. All I\u2019m asking in return is a few weeks of impertinence. Think of it as your chance to write the practical girl\u2019s fairy tale. Come away to London in my fancy carriage. Have some fine new gowns. Don\u2019t change a whit. Don\u2019t fall in love with me. At the end of it, we part ways. And you live wealthily ever after.\u201d He looked to the carriage. \u201cJust say yes, Simms. We need to be going.\u201d</p><p>What would it take to convince him? She raised her voice, enunciating each word as best an uneducated farm girl could. \u201cI . Can\u2019t. Go.\u201d</p><p>He matched her volume. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>The world was suddenly very quiet. The duke went absolutely still. She could have thought him a statue if not for the stray apple blossom decorating his shoulder and the breeze stirring his dark, wavy hair. Somewhere above them a songbird chirped and whistled for a mate.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head and stared at her with fresh concentration. She tried not to blush or fidget as his slow, measured paces brought them toe-to-toe. So close, she could see the individual grains of whiskers dotting his jaw. They were lighter than his hair\u2014almost ginger, in this light.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about you.\u201d His ungloved hand went to her hair, teasing it gently. A little shower of crystals fell to the ground. \u201cSomething . . . all over you.\u201d</p> <p>Good heavens. He was touching her\u2014without leave, or any logical reason. And it should have been shocking\u2014but the most surprising part was how natural it felt. So simple and unforced, as though he did this every day.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t mind it, Pauline thought. Being touched like this, every day. As though there were something precious and fragile beneath the grit of her life, just waiting to be uncovered.</p><p>He dusted more fine white powder from her shoulder. \u201cWhat is this? You\u2019re just coated with it.\u201d</p><p>Her answer came out as a whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s sugar.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his thumb to his mouth, absently tasting. His lips twisted in unpleasant surprise.</p><p>\u201cSugar mixed with alum,\u201d she amended.</p><p>\u201cOddly fitting.\u201d He reached for her again, this time leading with the backs of his fingers.</p><p>She felt herself leaning forward, seeking his touch.</p><p>\u201cPauline?\u201d a familiar voice interrupted. \u201cPauline, who\u2019s that man?\u201d</p><p>She jumped back and turned to spy Daniela peeking out from the west side of the cottage. After a moment of internal debate, Pauline waved her sister forward. There was no easier way to explain her refusal than to let him see for himself.</p><p>\u201cYour grace, may I present my sister, Daniela. Daniela, our guest is a duke. That means you must curtsy and call him \u2018your grace.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Daniela curtsied. \u201cGood day, your grace.\u201d</p><p>The words came out thick and nearly unintelligible, the way they always did when Daniela was nervous. Her tongue wasn\u2019t so nimble with strangers.</p><p>\u201cThe duke was just leaving.\u201d</p><p>Daniela curtsied again. \u201cGoodbye, your grace.\u201d</p><p>Pauline watched him with keen eyes, waiting. People of his rank sent their simple folk to asylums or paid someone to tend them in the attic\u2014anything to hide them from view. Still, he would be able to tell. Everyone could always tell within a minute of meeting Daniela.</p><p>The familiar anger welled within her, fast and defensive\u2014a response learned from years of deflecting insults and slights. Her hand reflexively made a fist.</p><p>He probably wouldn\u2019t resort to name-calling. Idiot, numskull, half-wit, dummy, simpleton. Those words would be beneath a duke, wouldn\u2019t they?</p><p>But he would have some reaction. They always did. Even well-meaning people found some way to give offense, treating Daniela like a puppy or an infant, instead of like a full-grown woman.</p><p>Most likely the duke would curl his lip in disgust. Or turn his gaze and pretend she didn\u2019t exist. Perhaps he would sneer or shudder, and that would give Pauline just the surge of anger she needed to send him away.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t do any of those things.</p><p>He spoke in a completely unaffected, matter-of-fact tone. \u201cMiss Daniela. A pleasure.\u201d</p><p>And as Pauline watched, the duke\u2014God above, a bloody duke\u2014lifted her sister\u2019s hand to his lips. And kissed it.</p><p>Lord help her, for the briefest of instants, Pauline tumbled headlong in love with the man. Never mind his promise of a thousand pounds. He could have had her soul for a shilling.</p><p>She briefly closed her eyes, rooting deep in her heart for all those reasons to dislike him. The most petty, stupid one came to her lips. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kiss my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He glanced at the appendage in question. \u201cI know where it\u2019s been.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed as she recalled her father\u2019s \u201cdemonstration\u201d in the cottage.</p><p>\u201cShe is the source of your reluctance, I take it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Pauline nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t leave her. And she can\u2019t leave home.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s quiet consideration, he addressed her sister. \u201cMiss Daniela, I want to take your sister to London.\u201d</p><p>Daniela paled. Her chin began to quiver. The tears were already starting.</p><p>\u201cI will bring her back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have my word. And a duke never breaks his word.\u201d</p><p>Pauline raised a brow, skeptical.</p><p>He shrugged, conceding the improbable truth of the statement. \u201cWell, this particular duke won\u2019t break this particular word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her sister hugged her so tightly, Pauline reeled on her feet. \u201cDon\u2019t go. I don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p><p>Her heartstrings stretched until they ached. They\u2019d never been apart. Not for even one night. What the duke might describe to her as temporary, Daniela would experience as endless. She\u2019d spend every moment of their separation feeling miserable, abandoned. But at the end of it . . .</p><p>One thousand pounds.</p><p>They could do anything with a thousand pounds. Escaping their father would only be the beginning. She and Daniela might have a cottage of their own. They could raise chickens and geese, hire a man now and then for the heavy labor. With prudence, the interest alone would be enough to keep them fed and safe.</p><p>And she could open her shop.</p><p>Her shop. So silly, how she\u2019d come to think of it that way. She might as well have named it Pauline\u2019s Unicorn Emporium, as likely as it was to come to pass. It had always been just a dream for someday. But with one thousand pounds, that someday could be quite soon.</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s knees.\u201d The duke\u2019s voice intruded on her thoughts. \u201cNot you again.\u201d</p><p>Major, the old cantankerous gander, had found them once more, and he wasted no time in making the duke feel unwelcome. The bird stretched his neck to its greatest length, puffing his breast in a warlike pose. Then he lowered his beak and made a strike at the duke\u2019s boot.</p><p>With a crisp thwack, Halford deflected the goose with a flick of the apple bough. He jabbed the blunt end into the goose\u2019s breast, holding the enraged bird at branch\u2019s distance. \u201cThis bird is possessed by the spirit of a dyspeptic Cossack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like you,\u201d Pauline said. \u201cHe\u2019s very intelligent.\u201d</p><p>With a short flight, Major managed to squawk free, and then they were starting all over again. Dueling, duke versus gander.</p><p>Halford stood light on his feet, one leg forward and one back, wielding the switch like a foil. \u201cWinged menace. I\u2019ll have your liver.\u201d</p><p>Major cast some aspersions of his own. They were unintelligible to human ears, but no less vehement.</p><p>At her side, Daniela ceased to cry and began to giggle.</p><p>The tightness in Pauline\u2019s chest eased. \u201cDaniela,\u201d she said. \u201cTake Major to the poultry yard for me. Then come back.\u201d</p><p>Her sister spread her arms and shooed the gander toward the rear of the house. Once she was safely out of earshot, Pauline crossed her arms and faced the duke.</p><p>\u201cIf I agree to this . . .\u201d She willed her voice not to shake. \u201cIf I go with you, will you return me home in one week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week?\u201d He tossed the stick aside. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll agree. It must be a week. We have a ritual of sorts on Saturdays, Daniela and I. She can understand this. If I promise to be back by next Saturday, she\u2019ll know I\u2019m not leaving forever.\u201d When he hesitated, she went on, \u201cI assure you, I can prove catastrophic within one week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d He paused in thought. \u201cA week, then. But we leave at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I bid my sister farewell.\u201d</p><p>She turned and looked over her shoulder. Daniela was already on her way back from the henhouse.</p><p>\u201cI need a penny,\u201d Pauline said. \u201cQuickly, give me a penny.\u201d</p><p>He fished in his pocket and produced a coin, then dropped it in her outstretched hand.</p><p>She peered at it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a penny. It\u2019s a sovereign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything smaller.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cDukes and their problems. I\u2019ll be along in a moment.\u201d</p><p>Pauline drew her sister aside. She pulled her spine straight. The only way to keep Daniela from dissolving was to hold herself together. There could be no cracks in her resolve. She must be strong enough for them both, as always.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your egg money for this week.\u201d She opened Daniela\u2019s hand and put the coin in it, closing her fingers over the sovereign before she could notice the color wasn\u2019t right. \u201cI want you to go upstairs and put it in the tea tin straightaway. Tomorrow, it goes in the collection at church.\u201d</p><p>Daniela nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with the duke now,\u201d Pauline told her. \u201cTo London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But only for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go. Don\u2019t go.\u201d The tears streamed down Daniela\u2019s reddened cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Don\u2019t cry so, I beg you. I can\u2019t bear it.</p><p>Pauline very nearly gave in. To distract herself, she thought of the golden coin squeezed in her sister\u2019s hand. She imagined a thousand of them, stacked in neat rows. Ten by ten by ten by ten . . .</p><p>If only she could explain to Daniela what this would mean for them, and how it would better their lives in all the years to come. But her sister wouldn\u2019t want to hear more talk of change. She needed routine, comfort. Familiar tasks to see her through the week.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back next Saturday to give you your egg money. I swear it. But you must earn that penny. While I\u2019m gone, you must work hard. You cannot laze abed crying, do you hear? Collect the eggs every day. Help mother with the cooking and the house. When the week\u2019s gone, I\u2019ll be home. I\u2019ll be sitting with you in church next Sunday.\u201d She framed Daniela\u2019s round face in her hands. \u201cAnd I will never leave you again.\u201d</p><p>She hugged her sobbing sister tight and kissed her cheek. \u201cGo inside now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>There was no good to come of prolonging it. Parting wouldn\u2019t get any easier. Pauline released her sister, turned, and walked away. Daniela\u2019s sobs followed her as she went through the gate and entered the lane, where the duke\u2019s fine carriage waited.</p><p>\u201cPauline?\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice, calling from the front step.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home in a week, Mum.\u201d She didn\u2019t dare look back.</p><p>When she moved to enter the coach, her step faltered. The duke extended a hand. His hand was ungloved, and when his strong fingers closed over hers, a tremor passed through her.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d he asked. His other hand went to the small of her back, steadying her.</p><p>Pauline drew a deep breath. His strong touch made her want to melt against him, seeking comfort. She pushed the temptation away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIf you need more time to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you go to her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>No. No, that would make everything worse.</p><p>It was useless to explain. What did it matter if he thought her unfeeling and callous, anyhow? She wasn\u2019t after his approval. She was doing this for his money.</p><p>\u201cMy sister always cries, but she\u2019s stronger than you\u2019d think.\u201d She released his hand and mounted the stairs on her own power. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>It took a great deal to impress Griff. Many an afternoon in Court, he\u2019d looked on as officers and dignitaries were awarded ribbons, crosses, knighthoods, and more for service to the Crown. Some likely deserved their honors; many didn\u2019t. The pomp and ceremony had him jaded by this point, and God knew he wasn\u2019t prone to heroics himself. But he liked to think he could still recognize bravery when he saw it.</p><p>He had the feeling he\u2019d witnessed a true act of courage just now. The girl had steel in her. He\u2019d felt it, beneath his palm.</p><p>A good thing, too. Because if she was going to spend the next several days with the Duchess of Halford, Pauline Simms was going to need it.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a week,\u201d he told his mother, settling into the coach.</p><p>\u201cA week?\u201d Twin spots of color rose on her cheeks, matching the rubies at her throat.</p><p>\u201cA week. Simms\u2019s family can\u2019t spare her any longer than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t possibly accomplish this in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf our Divine Creator could make the heavens, earth, and all its creatures in six days, I should think you can manage one duchess.\u201d</p><p>She huffed with indignation. \u201cYou know very well I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Hold that thought.\u201d Griff sent a hand into his breast pocket, searching. When he came up empty, he muttered a mild curse and fumbled in his waistcoat pockets, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you looking for?\u201d his mother asked.</p><p>\u201cA pencil and a scrap of paper. You were about to say you\u2019re not God, or something to that effect. I mean to have the exact quote, date, and time recorded. An engraved commemorative plaque will hang in every room of Halford House.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned to a tight line.</p><p>\u201cYou claimed you could make any woman the toast of London. If you can manage that with Simms in one week, I\u2019ll marry her.\u201d He leveled a single finger at her. \u201cBut if this enterprise of yours fails, you will never harangue me on the subject of marriage again. Not this season. Not this decade. Not this lifetime.\u201d</p><p>She glowered at him in silence.</p><p>Griff smiled, knowing he had her right where he wanted her.</p><p>He leaned back, propped one boot on his knee, and stretched his arm across the back of the seat. \u201cIf the conditions are unacceptable to you, I can turn this coach around right now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t object. He didn\u2019t turn the coach around.</p><p>They forged straight on, and Griff pretended to doze through a lengthy lecture on the vaunted family history. It was a litany of heroes, lawmakers, explorers, scholars . . . All the way from his far-flung ancestors in the Crusades to his father, the great, late diplomat.</p><p>Just as the duchess\u2019s tale was winding toward the debauched disappointment that was Griff, they paused to change horses and take dinner near Tonbridge.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d his mother informed her new charge as they alighted from the carriage, \u201cis one of the finest coaching inns in England. Their private dining rooms are peerless.\u201d</p><p>Miss Simms made comical shapes with her lips as they entered the establishment. \u201cI should think the Bull and Blossom is the superior place, for my money. More welcoming, and that\u2019s certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA duchess does not look for an inn that is welcoming,\u201d his mother opined. \u201cA duchess is welcome anywhere, anytime. She relies on the establishment to keep everyone else out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d As they were shown into the dining room, Miss Simms turned to the stony footman. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>The footman pulled out a chair, staring forward at the wall.</p><p>She gave the blank-faced servant an amused look and waved her hand before his eyes. \u201cHullo. Anyone home?\u201d</p><p>The footman remained still as a wooden nutcracker, until she gave up and sat down.</p><p>Griff took his own seat and summoned the waiter with a look, ordering an assortment of dishes. He was famished.</p><p>\u201cCor,\u201d Miss Simms sighed, putting her elbows on the table and propping her chin on one hand. \u201cI\u2019m famished.\u201d</p><p>The duchess rapped the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d the young woman asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst, remove your elbows from the table.\u201d</p><p>Miss Simms obeyed, lifting her elbows exactly one inch above the surface of the table.</p><p>\u201cSecond, mind your tongue. A lady never refers to the state of her internal organs in mixed company. And you will strike that word from your vocabulary at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the word to which I refer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d Dramatically thoughtful, Miss Simms put a fingertip to her lips and cast a glance at the ceiling. \u201cWas it \u2018famished\u2019? Or \u2018I\u2019m\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m confused,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t recall saying anything else. I\u2019m just a simple country girl. Overwhelmed by the splendor of this inhospitable establishment. How am I to know what word it is I shouldn\u2019t say if your grace will not enlighten me?\u201d</p><p>A pause stretched, as they all waited to see whether his mother could be provoked into repeating such a common slang as \u201ccor.\u201d</p><p>Griff reclined in his chair, happy to wait her out. This was the most enjoyment he could recall at a family dinner.</p><p>His mother had been needing someone to manage. She certainly couldn\u2019t browbeat him\u2014no matter what measures she\u2019d resorted to yesternight\u2014and the servants at Halford House were too well-trained and stoic. He\u2019d been flirting with the idea of getting her a mischievous terrier, but this was better by far. Miss Simms wouldn\u2019t leave any puddles on the carpet.</p><p>Perhaps after this week was over, he\u2019d hire his mother another impertinent companion.</p><p>But next time he\u2019d find one who wasn\u2019t so pretty.</p><p>The girl sparkled. Sparkled, deuce her. Griff couldn\u2019t help staring. Hours of coach travel hadn\u2019t dislodged those sugar crystals dusting her form, and his eye couldn\u2019t stop searching them out. They were like grains of brilliant sand strewn in her hair, clinging to her skin. Even tangled in her eyelashes.</p><p>Worst of all, one tiny crystal had lodged itself just at the corner of her mouth. His awareness of it had long passed distracting and verged on maddening. Surely, he thought, at some point during dinner she would catch it with her tongue and sweep it away.</p><p>If not, he\u2019d be tempted to lean forward and tend to the cursed thing himself.</p><p>\u201cMiss Simms,\u201d his mother said, \u201cif you think you can trick me into repeating your vulgarities, you will be disappointed. Suffice it to say, slang, blasphemy, and cursing have no place in a lady\u2019s vocabulary. Much less a duchess\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I see. So your grace never curses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWords like cor . . . bollocks . . . damn . . . devil . . . blast . . . bloody hell . . .\u201d She pronounced the words with relish, warming to her task. \u201cThey don\u2019t cross a duchess\u2019s lips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Miss Simms\u2019s fair brow creased in thought. \u201cWhat if a duchess steps on a tack? What if a gust of wind steals a duchess\u2019s best powdered wig? Not even then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even when an impertinent farm girl provokes a duchess to a simmering rage,\u201d she replied evenly. \u201cA duchess might contemplate all manner of cutting remarks and frustrated oaths. But even in the face of extreme annoyance, she stifles any such ejaculations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy,\u201d Miss Simms said, wide-eyed. \u201cI do hope dukes aren\u2019t held to the same standard. Can\u2019t be healthy for a man, always stifling his ejaculations.\u201d</p><p>Griff promptly broke the prohibition against elbows on the table, smothering a burst of laughter with his palm and disguising it as a coughing fit. The violence of it caught him by surprise. He couldn\u2019t recall the last time he\u2019d laughed from so deep in his chest that his ribs ached. For that matter, he couldn\u2019t recall the last time he\u2019d been tempted to lean across the table and catch a lush, clever mouth in a kiss.</p><p>For several months he\u2019d been stifling . . . everything.</p><p>\u201cLet it out, your grace. You\u2019ll feel better.\u201d She looked to him with false concern and a coy, conspiratorial smile.</p><p>Oh, he liked this girl. He liked her a great deal.</p><p>And that worried him intensely.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Drat. So close. She\u2019d almost had him laughing just then.</p><p>The duke had hired Pauline to provoke his mother, but somewhere in the past few minutes, Pauline had grown far more interested in provoking the duke.</p><p>For all his devil-may-care posturing, it would seem the devil did care about something. In the hours since they\u2019d left Spindle Cove, a strange cloud of melancholy had gathered about him. She wanted to dispel it. Not out of charity, precisely\u2014but because his brooding made her so acutely aware of her own sadness.</p><p>She was already sick with missing home.</p><p>She wondered if Daniela had stopped crying yet. Would she be able to sleep alone in the loft? Perhaps their mother would climb up to soothe her after Father had fallen asleep, bringing a dish of blancmange.</p><p>Pauline would tell herself that was the case. More comforting that way. When she returned home independently wealthy, her sister would have a great bowlful of blancmange, every single night.</p><p>Speaking of food . . . On the table before her, the inn\u2019s servers spread a veritable banquet. Her stomach rumbled. She\u2019d scarcely eaten all day, and she\u2019d never been served a meal like this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMiss Simms,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cTell me what dishes you see on the table.\u201d</p><p>Pauline eyed her suspiciously, wondering what sort of test the older lady had in mind. The meal set before them was composed of a great many dishes, but none were exotic. She could name them all, easily.</p><p>\u201cHam,\u201d she answered. \u201cBeef and Yorkshire pudding. Roasted chicken. Peas, boiled potatoes, and some sort of soup\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The duchess rapped the table. \u201cWrong. All of it, wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it?\u201d Pauline blinked at the unquestionably ham-shaped object on the platter before her. If it wasn\u2019t a ham, what on earth could it be?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ham, Miss Simms.\u201d The duchess weighed heavily on the H. \u201cHam, not \u2019am. Yorkshire pudding, not \u2018puddin\u2019.\u2019 Boiled potatoes, not \u2018biled.\u2019 And we eat roasted fowl, not vulgar chicken. After dinner, I\u2019ll give you some elocution exercises. Very useful in limbering the lips and tongue.\u201d</p><p>Well, that sounded . . . perfectly dreadful. For now, Pauline was far more interested in using her lips and tongue to eat. She reached for the carving knife embedded in the ham and used it to draw the platter toward her plate.</p><p>Rap, rap.</p> <p>The duchess again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it I\u2019ve done now?\u201d Pauline asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your actions,\u201d the duchess replied, sending a glance toward the ham. \u201cA duchess does not serve herself, Miss Simms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Pauline turned to the server. \u201cYou, there. Would you mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rap, rap.</p><p>The older woman cut her a look. \u201cA duchess does not ask to be served, either.\u201d</p> <p>Pauline regarded her empty plate with despair. \u201cThen how, pray tell, does a duchess eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObserve me.\u201d</p><p>Pauline raised her head and watched.</p><p>\u201cAre you regarding me very closely?\u201d the duchess said.</p><p>\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall only do this the once. A duchess need never repeat herself, you understand.\u201d</p><p>By this point Pauline was sure there was more steam between her ears than beneath the domed cover of the soup tureen. The duchess was like a walking, talking copy of Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom for Young Ladies. Pauline began to understand just what the Spindle Cove ladies were escaping when they came for holidays by the sea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m watching,\u201d she said tightly.</p> <p>The duchess slid one eye\u2014or at least, it seemed that way\u2014to the waiting footman. Then she tilted her head by a nearly imperceptible degree, nodding once in the direction of the food.</p><p>The servants leapt forward and began serving food onto their plates.</p><p>\u201cPraise be,\u201d Pauline muttered.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Simms,\u201d the duke replied, reaching for the carving knife. \u201cI believe we will let that sentiment serve as table grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe servants bring the vegetables, soup, fish, and all other dishes,\u201d the duchess explained. \u201cThe gentlemen at the table carve the meats.\u201d</p><p>As if in demonstration, the duke placed a thick, rosy slice of ham on Pauline\u2019s plate.</p><p>\u201cGiven your former employment,\u201d the duchess said, \u201cI should think you would know all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEtiquette is never strictly enforced in Spindle Cove,\u201d Pauline said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only ladies at the tables, anyhow. If they waited on a gentleman to serve them, they\u2019d starve away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see we have a great deal of work ahead. What about your accomplishments? Do you sing, Miss Simms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay any instrument?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you any languages? Can you draw, sketch, paint, embroider, or produce any evidence of a ladylike finishing whatsoever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, your grace. I\u2019m perfectly wrong for the position of duchess.\u201d She threw Halford a cheeky half smile.</p><p>But instead of smiling back, he gave her a look of cool displeasure. She didn\u2019t understand that look. It rattled her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Simms,\u201d the duchess went on, \u201cthere is no magical combination of qualities that will make for a successful duchess. Beauty is useful, but not essential. Wit is desirable as well. Mind that I said wit, not cleverness. Cleverness is like rouge\u2014liberal application makes a woman look common and desperate. Wit is knowing how to apply it.\u201d</p><p>The duke reclined in his chair. He seemed to have abandoned his own meal in favor of fixing Pauline with that intense stare.</p><p>She gathered an obscenely large forkful of potatoes and stuffed it into her mouth. She couldn\u2019t fathom the reason for his sudden broodiness. Wasn\u2019t this precisely what he\u2019d hired her to do? He wanted her to be ill-mannered, didn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cLastly,\u201d the duchess continued, \u201cthe most important quality any Duchess of Halford needs is this: phlegm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhlegm?\u201d Pauline echoed, choking down her food. \u201cIt\u2019s forbidden to speak of hunger at the dinner table, but it\u2019s fine to talk about phlegm?\u201d She poked at a bit of ham. \u201cIf it\u2019s phlegm you want, I can give you that. I learned how to spit with the farm boys. The trick is to start far back in your throat and\u2014\u201d</p><p>The duchess halted, just as she was about to spoon some asparagus soup into her mouth. She looked at the rich green broth, then set down her spoon.</p><p>\u201cNot that kind of phlegm, Miss Simms. I refer to self-assurance. Unflappability. Aplomb. The ability to remain calm, no matter what occurs. Never underestimate the power of phlegm.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so she meant the way she and the duke had stared one another down that afternoon in the Bull and Blossom\u2014neither of them willing to show a hint of weakness. The way they inspected the entirety of the farm cottage in a glance, sweeping a gaze around the rooms without even turning their heads.</p><p>The duchess cut her beef with delicate sawing motions. \u201cPhlegm will be our greatest challenge, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right on that score.\u201d</p><p>Whenever someone hurt Daniela\u2014or anyone she loved\u2014that thorny vine of rage blossomed in her chest. She didn\u2019t suppose she\u2019d ever be able to suppress the response, nor did she wish to try.</p><p>\u201cWhat good is rank and wealth,\u201d she asked, \u201cif you can\u2019t even own your emotions? Aren\u2019t the Quality permitted to feel anything?\u201d</p><p>The duchess replied, \u201cOh, we are permitted to feel. But we must never appear to be ruled by our feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. It would be unbearably common to sit at this table and just openly discuss our emotions about, say, love and marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much more refined to kidnap one\u2019s son, then instigate a week-long farce with a serving girl. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>She thought surely the duke would smile at that, but no. His gaze was now burning into her skin, like sunlight concentrated through a lens.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I care for any phlegm.\u201d She took another bite and purposely spoke around it. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the last time, Miss Simms, this isn\u2019t a dish on the table to be taken or refused. If you\u2019re going to learn to be a duchess, phlegm is a requirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suppose we\u2019ll see who buckles first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never buckle. A duchess has people to do the buckling for her.\u201d</p><p>Pauline shook her head. This week would be a challenge\u2014but an amusing one, at least. The duchess did possess a sense of humor. However, the older woman underestimated Pauline, if she thought she could cow her.</p><p>Oh, she knew the Halford pride was strong. In the carriage, she\u2019d listened to the family provenance. At length. No doubt a duchess born to generations of wealth, married into an even longer line of nobility, would believe herself to be indomitable. But Pauline had earned her stubbornness, fighting hard for it at every turn. On the other side of this week lay the prospect of a new, independent life. She wouldn\u2019t be swayed from that goal. Not even by a duchess.</p><p>Come hell or high society, she would earn that one thousand pounds.</p><p>Eventually they all settled down to the business of eating. The servants removed the savory dishes from the table and replaced them with a variety of fruits and cheeses. Grapes, plums, nectarines. Pauline spied a dish of sherry trifle that had her mouth watering\u2014layers of raspberries, sponge, whipped cream, all visible through the glass dish.</p><p>And then, to this overwhelming abundance of sweets, the footman set before her one more: a molded sculpture of blancmange.</p><p>The breath left her body, leaving only a keen, sharp ache.</p><p>Oh, Danny.</p><p>The wave of homesickness swamped her with such violent force, she couldn\u2019t bear it. Not a moment longer. She pushed back from the table and fled the room, dashing into the stairwell.</p><p>This was a mistake. She had to leave. She had to go home. How many miles had they traveled? Fifteen? Twenty? She had a full belly, and the weather was fine. If she started now, she could walk home by dawn.</p><p>\u201cSimms?\u201d The duke\u2019s voice echoed down the narrow stairwell, arresting her on the landing. \u201cAre you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, hastily dabbing at her eyes before she turned to him. \u201cNo, I\u2019m well. I\u2019m sorry for leaving the table so abruptly.\u201d</p><p>Slow footfalls carried him down the stairs. \u201cDon\u2019t be. It was the cap on a sterling display of poor etiquette. Well done, you. But my mother was concerned for your health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, truly. It was just the blancmange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blancmange?\u201d He frowned. \u201cI find it revolting myself, but the stuff almost never drives me to tears.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s my sister\u2019s favorite. I\u2019ve been missing her all day, of course. But when that blancmange appeared before me, it all just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHit you,\u201d he finished for her, coming to join her on the landing. \u201cAll at once. Like a landslide.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cExactly so. For a moment, it was like the air went to mud. I couldn\u2019t even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the sensation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Perhaps he did, she thought, surveying the fine lines at the corners of his eyes, and the weariness that pooled like shadows beneath. She could believe he was intimately acquainted with this lonely, desolate feeling\u2014perhaps even more so than she.</p><p>\u201cGive a moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will pass.\u201d</p><p>The stairwell was suddenly very warm, and very small. The walls seemed to push them closer together. She was aware of his looming size, his male heat. His powerful good looks. And that rich, lingering hint of his musky cologne.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should go back,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWait. You have something\u201d\u2014he touched a fingertip to the corner of his own mouth\u2014\u201cjust here. A stray bit of sugar, I think.\u201d</p><p>She cringed. How embarrassing.</p><p>She extended her tongue and ran it slowly from one corner of her mouth to the other, then back again. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She raised her hand to dab at her cheek.</p><p>\u201cStop. Just let me.\u201d He reached one hand forward, bracing the side of his palm against her cheek and brushing the corner of her mouth with his thumb.</p><p>Mercy. She was the farthest from home she\u2019d ever been in her life, adrift in a vast, lonely sea of emotion. And his touch against her bare skin, so warm and assured . . . It was like someone throwing her a rope.</p><p>A connection.</p><p>He skimmed a light touch under her bottom lip. \u201cYou,\u201d he said softly, \u201chave quite the mouth on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told. It\u2019s my worst fault, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d agree.\u201d</p><p>She forced a cheerful tone. \u201cI do have many faults to choose from. Impertinence, stubbornness, pride. I curse too much, and I\u2019m terribly clumsy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d His touch stilled, and he tilted her face to his. \u201cThis week, all those faults make you perfect.\u201d</p><p>He would go and say something wonderful.</p><p>She tried to smile. It didn\u2019t quite work. Her emotions were chaotic, swinging back and forth between caution and thrill, and a mad voice inside her kept foolishly insisting that she needed to keep her lips very, very still . . .</p> <p>Because this man was about to kiss them.</p><p>Pauline had been kissed a time or two. She knew how a man\u2019s face changed as he was preparing to do it. The small lines around his mouth disappeared, and his head made a subtle tip to one side. His eyelids grew heavy, lowering just enough to reveal a dark fringe of lashes.</p><p>His gaze focused intently on her mouth.</p><p>He leaned close.</p><p>Her insides trembled. This was the moment where she needed to . . . do something. Close her eyes, if she wished to be kissed. Take a swift step back, if she didn\u2019t.</p> <p>She shouldn\u2019t want it. She hated to think what impropriety rakish dukes might expect of serving girls, and she didn\u2019t want to give the wrong impression. But it had been a very long time since she\u2019d been kissed. And even longer since she\u2019d heard any words so kind as the ones he\u2019d just spoken.</p><p>In the end, she compromised by remaining perfectly, breathlessly still.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t kiss her.</p><p>He withdrew his touch and brushed past her, continuing down the stairs with a clatter of footfalls. \u201cSimms, give my mother my regards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m riding ahead to London,\u201d he called up to her. \u201cTonight.\u201d</p> <p>Griff managed to procure a young gelding from the inn\u2019s stables. The horse was nothing to pace his favored bay warmbloods at home, but the beast looked strong and impatient\u2014ready for some hard riding over open country. He\u2019d do.</p><p>The moon was rising bright and round in the sky, ready to light his journey. Griff swung into the saddle, ignoring the thinness of the borrowed tack and the inconvenient tightness of his topcoat across his shoulders. These wouldn\u2019t be the most pleasant miles he\u2019d ever covered on horseback, but comfort wasn\u2019t his priority tonight.</p><p>He had to get away.</p><p>That had been a very close thing, just now in the stairwell. A very close, warm, sweet, enticing, vulnerable thing.</p><p>Her lips had been so soft. A ripe berry-pink. Still glistening, where she\u2019d searched them with her tongue. Quivering with emotion. He could have kissed them.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to, more than he\u2019d wanted his next breath.</p><p>Sweet heaven.</p><p>Bloody hell.</p> <p>He\u2019d thought he was done with this. For months now he\u2019d ignored invitations and innuendos from women all over Town. A mud-spattered, sugar-dusted, smart-mouthed serving girl in drab linsey-woolsey could not prove his complete undoing.</p><p>As he nudged the horse into a canter, he realized he hadn\u2019t laid out a very good strategy for living the rest of his life as the New, Not-Truly-Improved, Just-Vastly-Less-Interesting Griffin Eliot York. For the past several months he\u2019d been too absorbed by other emotions to feel any sensual deprivation. Any mild stirrings of unrest were quelled by routine physical exercise or the occasional halfhearted frig.</p><p>In retrospect, it seemed ridiculous to believe he\u2014he!\u2014could remain celibate for the remainder of his years. He should have known it would be coming: that day when his neglected cock did perk with interest, rise up and wave in a jaunty, \u201cHo, there\u2014remember me?\u201d</p><p>As his luck would have it, that day was today.</p><p>There was something about Pauline Simms that had him fascinated. She was so defiantly proud of her common origins, yet so hungry for approval.</p><p>This was a business arrangement, he reminded himself. He\u2019d hired the girl to bedevil his mother, not to bewitch him. Her cleverness and lively, cat-tipped eyes should not be temptations. They were a desirable set of skills she brought to her post. Similar to the way one sought out a stonemason with brawn and foresight and steady hands.</p><p>The thought of employees helped him turn his mind toward mundane tasks. He\u2019d need to warn the house staff that the duchess would be bringing a guest. Fortunately, his housekeeper, Mrs. Thomas, was scarily efficient. A few words, and everything would be readied in advance of Miss Simms\u2019s arrival: room, maid, meals, bath.</p><p>God, yes. The girl needed a bath.</p><p>A proper bath. Not just a quick dousing to rinse away that glittering sweetness. A bath hot enough to soak those calluses from her hands and curl the short hairs at her temples. With a fresh cake of scented soap for scrubbing, and thick, downy towels to wrap her sleek, glistening limbs.</p><p>The image that came to his mind was so vivid, so lushly detailed in every texture of skin and soap and slickness . . . He had to pull the horse to a halt in the center of the road and recover himself.</p><p>The hard drumming of hoofbeats had ceased, but his ribs pounded with the furious thunder of his pulse.</p><p>Why her? Why now?</p><p>But as was the case with all the whys and wherefores he\u2019d addressed to the darkness in recent months, no answers came back. Only one thing was clear. This just wouldn\u2019t do. Perhaps he could outride temptation tonight, but by the morrow, temptation would be living under his roof.</p><p>There was only one thing for it. He must pay a visit on his way back to Town.</p><p>He adjusted his position in the saddle, leaning over the gelding\u2019s neck to urge the beast faster. Midway on his journey through Kent, he turned his horse off the main road and instead took a winding, familiar spur.</p><p>He approached the village in the first gray whisper of morning\u2014a tight cluster of cottages, wreathed in fog. A dew-glittered meadow offered some bluebells and primrose for the picking. Griff turned the horse out to graze and stretched his legs, gathering what twiggy wildflowers he could find. They weren\u2019t much, but it seemed poor form to show up empty-handed.</p><p>As dawn broke over the green horizon, he realized he was stalling. Stupid, to be anxious.</p><p>He walked past the white-steepled church, to the walled area behind it. The rusted churchyard gate swung inward with a whine of hinges, and he walked to the third row of monuments. He found the simply marked grave.</p><p>He remained there several minutes, silent and unmoving, before crouching to place his meager bouquet before the limestone cross.</p><p>When he tried to stand, he couldn\u2019t. Grief seized him with a savage, crippling pain. Like an auger drilling straight on his heart. It hollowed him out, left a round, aching hole\u2014one he knew would never be filled.</p><p>This is what comes of indulging your desires.</p><p>After long minutes he could breathe again. Before he rose to leave, he kissed his fingertips, then laid them to the cool, grainy stone.</p><p>There. Temptation conquered.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cMiss Simms,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cYour nose will wear a hole in that windowpane. Duchesses do not gawk.\u201d</p><p>Pauline sat back on the carriage seat, chastened.</p><p>After traveling all night, they\u2019d reached the bustling environs of London by early afternoon. It then took them three more hours to navigate the busy bridges and streets, making their way to Halford House. Her nose had been glued to the coach window for all of it, as she stared wide-eyed at the urban scenery. So much glass. So much brick. So much soot.</p><p>And so very many people.</p><p>Eventually the coach turned into an area of finer homes, many of them fronting wide green squares with immaculately trimmed hedges. They must be nearing the duke\u2019s house.</p><p>Pauline had been in fine houses before. Well, one fine house at least\u2014Summerfield, the home of Sir Lewis Finch. Sir Lewis\u2019s housekeeper sometimes hired extra help to clean house at Christmas or Easter. Summerfield was a grand manor, sprawling over several wings and filled with curiosities of every stripe. Every dusty old bit of bric-a-brac was priceless\u2014at least, hired girls were expected to handle them like treasures.</p><p>By the time the coach rolled to a halt before Halford House, Pauline had convinced herself it would be well within the range of her experience.</p><p>She was wrong.</p><p>Nothing in life, dreams, or fairy tales had prepared her for this. And how she would keep from gawking, she had no idea.</p><p>To begin with, the house was massive. Four stories high, and wide enough that one would have to stand all the way at the opposite end of the square to regard it in its entirety. Close as she was when she alighted from the coach, Pauline had to tip her head nearly all the way back. She felt her jaw hanging agape.</p><p>And then, as the sun was just sliding beneath the city\u2019s uneven horizon, it lingered one last moment to splash brilliance across the square. The amber rays landed directly on Halford House, like a coronation. Every glass pane flashed like a diamond facet, and the white granite fa\u00e7ade looked dipped in gold.</p><p>She was stunned.</p><p>Then the door opened. And she was stunned some more.</p><p>She followed the duchess through a gauntlet of eight liveried footmen. Once they crossed the threshold, there were more servants lined up in the entrance hall. Cook, housekeeper, housemaids, scullery maids, lady\u2019s maid.</p><p>The interior was accordingly impressive. Paintings on every available swatch of wall, ornate clocks chiming in welcome. Sumptuous upholstery in any place a person could possibly think to sit. It was really too much to take in with her eyes, but she didn\u2019t need to. She could feel this house\u2019s elegance in the soles of her feet. The wooden floors were expertly sanded and polished, and the carpets . . . oh, the carpets had pile so thick and plush, they made her insteps sigh with gratitude.</p><p>Pauline was introduced to the housekeeper, Mrs. Thomas\u2014a woman who, in any other circumstance, would have been handing her a bucket and brush, sending her to scrub a floor somewhere.</p><p>Today, she welcomed Pauline as a guest. She even curtsied. \u201cLet me show you to your room, Miss Simms.\u201d</p><p>As she followed the housekeeper, Pauline wished she could leave a trail of bread crumbs. She\u2019d never find her way back on her own.</p><p>Straight from the entrance, up the steps. Right at the top, and round the bend to the second, narrower flight of stairs. Then left down the wainscoted corridor\u2014the one with walls papered with a green toile pattern\u2014or was it blue? This would have been easier in full daylight.</p><p>She counted the doors as they passed. One, two, three . . .</p><p>By the time the housekeeper stopped before the fourth door, it was all a blur.</p><p>The room was dark, and she was happy for it to remain that way.</p><p>Pauline numbly accepted assistance in stripping down to her shift, bathing the travel dust from her body, and climbing into the softest, warmest bed she\u2019d ever laid upon. As her eyes closed and her legs stretched to the toasty depths of the bedsheets, she had the vague thought that someone had been here with coals in a bed warmer only moments before she\u2019d entered the room.</p><p>Such excellent service. And for the first time in her life she was on the receiving end of it. It would have been folly to try to make it seem real, so she gratefully fell into dreams.</p><p>For several hours she knew nothing more.</p><p>She woke to darkness. And found she could not return to sleep.</p><p>She ought to have still been exhausted. She was exhausted, in truth. Her joints ached from the long hours in the coach, well-sprung as it was. Her mind was taxed to its limits from stretching to grasp so many unbelievable notions.</p><p>But she just couldn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>She was in a duke\u2019s house. Surely a duke didn\u2019t even call it a house, did he? House was too humble, too common a word. He called it a \u201cresidence.\u201d In the country, an \u201cestate.\u201d Whatsit Manor, or Summat Castle.</p><p>She drew aside a corner of the heavy tapestry bed hangings and peered into the darkened room. Fortunately, it was nearing full moon, and the milky glow seeping in from the glazed windows (three of them! in one room!) gave her enough light to see the room she\u2019d been too fatigued to explore earlier.</p><p>She could make out so far as the foot of the bed, to the upholstered bench at the foot of the bed, to the plush embroidered carpet, its oriental reds and brassy golds now soothed by night. The lotus pattern stretched for miles, it seemed. If she strained and blinked, she could see the edge of the dressing table and catch the glint of a full-length, gilt-framed mirror hanging on the wall. The looking glass was supported by sculpted marble cherubs. Mischievous cherubs. Evidently, they never slept. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pauline gave a short, muted chirp of a whistle. It echoed back to her from the coffered ceiling. Goodness, the room was a cavern.</p><p>This one bedchamber could swallow her family\u2019s cottage whole.</p><p>And this was a guest room. Not even their best, she\u2019d imagine. What must the other chambers be like?</p> <p>On a side table, she spied a tea service, left over from when she\u2019d arrived. Pauline supposed she should have rung to have it removed, but now she was glad she hadn\u2019t. A sip of cold tea with lemon might soothe her nerves.</p><p>She tugged the counterpane free and wrapped it about her shoulders before sliding from the bed.</p><p>\u201cOof!\u201d</p><p>It was a long way down. She landed with a thud, tangling in the counterpane and tumbling to the floor.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t hurt. Even this carpet was softer than her mattress at home.</p> <p>Ruefully, she blinked at the little staircase toward the foot of the bed. She\u2019d forgotten climbing the thing earlier that evening. Imagine, a staircase just for getting into bed. The duke\u2019s own bed must be so piled with feather beds, he probably needed six or eight steps. He probably lay drowning in satin bedsheets and downy pillows, cloaked in a nightshirt of regal purple velvet. The idea made her laugh.</p><p>A picture bloomed in her mind, crisp as daylight and all too real. The Duke of Halford, masculine limbs ranging across a wide bed. No toffish velvet. No flight of stairs. No swallowing maw of feather beds. Just rumpled dark hair, biceps flexed around a pillow, and soft white linen, luminous in the moonlight, tangled about his hips. Or maybe lower, just hugging the curve of a tight, muscled arse.</p><p>She tried to shove the image away. No luck.</p><p>That sealed it. Cold tea or no, now she\u2019d never be able to sleep.</p><p>She picked herself up off the floor, gathered the counterpane tight about her shoulders as a wrap, and ventured out into the corridor.</p><p>It was darker here. Pauline stood still for a moment, trying to recall the housekeeper\u2019s sequence of turns. She\u2019d tried to pay attention, but she\u2019d been so overwhelmed and tired. Not to mention awed by the rows of ancient portraits, in some places stacked three high. All those scores of illustrious ancestors.</p> <p>The girls back home would say this place was surely crawling with ghosts.</p><p>Somewhere above her, timber creaked. A cool draft swirled over her neck. Pauline swallowed hard.</p><p>Left. She was sure they\u2019d come from the left.</p><p>She made her way slowly in that direction, keeping one hand out to trail her fingers along the wall. Every dozen steps, her fingertips skipped from wallpaper to the beveled wooden surface of a door. One, two, three . . . She counted six before pausing. She ought to have reached the stairway by now.</p><p>A sudden flare of light stopped her in her paces. Stopped her heart as well. Which ghostly Duke of Halford Past was that? Ducking, she raised her hand against the blinding flame and squinted through splayed fingers.</p><p>\u201cSimms?\u201d</p><p>She found the eighth\u2014and only living\u2014Duke of Halford, haunting his own house.</p><p>He held a lamp in one hand. With the other he yanked a door closed. She heard the scrape of a key in the lock.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he demanded, pocketing the key.</p><p>His angry tone surprised her. \u201cGood evening to you, too, your grace. My journey to London was fine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He was having none of it. \u201cWhy are you snooping around my private rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize they were your private rooms. I wasn\u2019t snooping. I took a wrong turning, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ll go back the other way.\u201d She turned to leave.</p><p>He caught her by the arm, swiveling her back to face him.</p><p>\u201cDid my mother put you up to this?\u201d</p><p>Pauline didn\u2019t even know how to answer. Put her up to what? Sleeplessness? Wrong turnings in a vast, darkened house?</p><p>\u201cAre you looking to pilfer something? Answer me with one word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She drew up her spine.</p><p>\u201cThen explain yourself. You\u2019re out of bed when you should be sleeping, in a corridor you have no reason to visit.\u201d He held the lamp high and examined her. \u201cAnd you have a guilty look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have an arrogant, wrong-headed look on yours.\u201d</p><p>That was a bit of a lie. The lamplight bleached the stark planes of his face and splashed weary shadows under his eyes. The rich brown of his irises was overwhelmed by cold, empty black. He didn\u2019t look especially arrogant, not right now.</p><p>Whatever he\u2019d been doing in that locked room, it was private. She\u2019d interrupted him in an unguarded moment. And because a big, strong man like him couldn\u2019t possibly admit to having an unguarded moment, he was going to make her twist and squirm.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cDukes and their problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate your impertinence, Simms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s bollocks.\u201d</p><p>He drew her closer, and her heart began to race. Her bare foot grazed his. The shock of it traveled all through her.</p><p>\u201cMy impertinence is the reason I\u2019m here, remember? It\u2019s why you chose me from a room of well-bred ladies. Because I\u2019m perfectly wrong. Everything you\u2019d never want in a woman.\u201d</p><p>He raked a gaze down her body. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>The hard bob of his Adam\u2019s apple caught her gaze, dragged it downward. Her attention settled in the dark, chiseled notch at the base of his throat.</p><p>Her lungs chose that moment to go out on labor strike. She held her breath so long, she went a bit dizzy.</p><p>\u201cSend me home tomorrow, if you like. But you\u2019ll find nothing\u2019s vanished with me. I wasn\u2019t stealing. Even if I were considering it\u2014and I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019d know better than to try it my first night here. I\u2019ve met your housekeeper. I\u2019ve no doubt she keeps a list of every last drawer pull in every last closet and takes inventory on the regular. If I meant to steal, I\u2019d wait for the last moment. So if you won\u2019t give me credit for honesty, at least give me credit for cleverness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you credit for nothing until I hear the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you the truth.\u201d She pulled the counterpane tight about her shoulders. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I thought I\u2019d go down to the libr\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the library,\u201d he finished for her. Sarcasm dried his words to brittle husks. \u201cReally, that\u2019s what you mean to tell me. You were looking for the library.\u201d</p><p>Why did he sound so incredulous?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. But at this point all she wanted was to return to her bedchamber without further interrogation. Her sleeplessness would surely be cured. This man was exhausting.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d His grip tightened on her arm as he led her down the corridor. \u201cIf it\u2019s the library you\u2019re searching out, I\u2019ll take you there myself.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t working how Griff had planned. He thought he\u2019d girded himself against temptation.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t counted on temptation herself materializing in a darkened corridor just outside his rooms, well after the hour of midnight. Her hair unbound yet again. Cloaked in her bedclothes, like a woman freshly tumbled. Skulking around his private chambers and looking even more fetching by lamplight than she had in afternoon sun.</p><p>Surely it was a trick of the shadows. Her eyelashes could not measure the length of his thumbnail. It was an impossibility.</p><p>Perhaps they grew longer with every lie she told.</p><p>Really. The library.</p><p>Of all the trite, clich\u00e9d excuses to pull out of her ear.</p><p>He marched her counterpane-swaddled self down the corridor, then down the staircase and around a bend. When they reached the correct set of doors, he flung them both open wide for effect.</p><p>\u201cThere you are. The library.\u201d He handed her the lamp.</p><p>Blinking, she moved forward into the room, using the light to lead the way.</p><p>\u201cHave your choice of books,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>She stood in the center of the room, turning slowly. Awestruck, no doubt. Even he would admit it was an impressive collection. As it ought to be, having been amassed over a dozen generations. The room was two stories high and hexagonal in shape, due to some fit of whimsy on the fifth duke\u2019s part. He\u2019d been an amateur architect, in addition to a naturalist and several other lofty things. One side of the hexagon served as the entryway, but bookshelves covered each of the other five, from floor to soaring ceiling.</p><p>\u201cGo on, then,\u201d he prodded.</p><p>\u201cAm I truly allowed to touch them?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBut of course. Someone ought to.\u201d</p><p>Still, she stood huddled in that twisted counterpane, face tilted to the rafters. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of books are your preference?\u201d he asked, not bothering to hide the smugness in his tone. \u201cAre you a great reader of philosophy? History? The sciences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like verses mostly. But I make no claims of being a great reader at all, your grace.\u201d</p><p>So. She admitted it that easily.</p><p>He crossed his arms. \u201cYet you claimed to be looking for the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I wanted to see the books, not read them. I hoped to have a look through the collection. Perhaps make a list.\u201d</p><p>At last she ventured forward and ran her finger down the spine of a slender leather volume. She didn\u2019t even take it from the shelf, just touched it\u2014gingerly, as though it might disappear into mist.</p><p>\u201cHow are they organized, do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I suspect it\u2019s loosely by subject. My grandfather invented some system of classification and made a catalogue, but I\u2019ve never troubled to understand it. I don\u2019t use the library often.\u201d</p><p>She raised the lamp and turned to him, blinking in disbelief. \u201cYou mean you live in this house, with all these books\u201d\u2014she waved the lamp in an arc\u2014\u201cand you never read them?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged with nonchalance, belying the sore spot she\u2019d poked. \u201cI am an embarrassment to my forebears. I know this well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do books cost, anyhow?\u201d</p><p>He gave up on drawing connections between these questions of hers. The hour was too damned late. \u201cThat would depend on many factors, I suppose. The nature of the book, the quality of the binding. Novels might be had for a crown or two, whereas a nine-volume set on the history of Rome . . .\u201d</p><p>She waved off his answer. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I want histories of Rome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Romans weren\u2019t as boring as you\u2019d think.\u201d History lectures were one of the few parts of his schooling he\u2019d enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so. But I doubt even the most bookish of Spindle Cove ladies will want to read nine volumes about it on holiday.\u201d</p><p>Griff watched as she nimbly climbed the rolling book stair, lamp in hand. She hung the lamp on a hook created for just that purpose and tilted her head to peruse the titles of the shelved books. Her hair fell to one side in a shimmering cascade, like poured brandy. She had a lovely neck\u2014a smooth, graceful ivory slope.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to take books back to Spindle Cove?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAs many as I can. You see, that\u2019s how I mean to spend my thousand pounds\u2014or part of it, anyway. I\u2019m going to . . . Well, never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, never mind? You\u2019re going to spend your money on books and then . . . ?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll laugh. And if you laugh, I\u2019ll hate you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t laugh.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a dubious look.</p><p>\u201cVery well, I might laugh. But you\u2019ll only hate me for a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to take books home and open a circulating library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA circulating library,\u201d he repeated\u2014without laughing . . . noticeably.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll rent out books to ladies visiting on holiday. And since I\u2019ve little experience with libraries myself, I hoped to glean some ideas from yours. Do you believe me now, that I was out of bed with honest purpose\u2014not with snooping or thievery in mind?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He did believe her. A lending library for spinsters? Not even a champion liar could weave such a preposterous tale from nothing.</p><p>\u201cVery well. I apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cI misjudged you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou apologize?\u201d She looked at him, shocked. \u201cThose aren\u2019t words I expected to hear from your lips.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve misjudged me.\u201d His faults might be legion, but no one could say he didn\u2019t admit them openly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She folded her bottom lip and sipped on it. \u201cWell, then. While we\u2019re talking . . . perhaps you could suggest a book. What do you read, your grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t read much of anything besides estate correspondence. Never seem to find the time.\u201d</p><p>In demonstration, he lifted a newspaper from a side table and cast it aside. He felt a small twinge of guilt. Each morning, Higgs went to the trouble of ironing the thing, page by page. Griff seldom gave it a glance.</p><p>Instead, he moved to the room\u2019s large desk and lit a pair of candles. There was a broken clock there he\u2019d been meaning to tinker with\u2014one of the Viennese curiosities his father had collected. Really, he should have been a tradesman\u2019s son. He always felt more comfortable, more capable, when his hands were occupied.</p> <p>Her questions followed him. \u201cBut if you did have time to read, what would you choose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlays,\u201d he answered. For no particular reason, other than to have the question gone.</p><p>\u201cOh, plays. Those would be good for the library. The Spindle Cove ladies are fond of staging theatricals.\u201d Clutching the counterpane about her shoulders with one hand, she used the other to pull the rolling ladder toward another bank of shelves. \u201cDo you go often to the theater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did in the past, then.\u201d Genuine interest warmed her voice. \u201cWhy did you stop? How long has it been?\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened on a screw he\u2019d been loosening. No one questioned him about this. Not even his mother. He felt the unexpectedness of it first, like a cold splash of water to the face. But once the initial affront wore off, he was left feeling oddly relieved. Almost grateful.</p> <p>Griff\u2019s peers, associates, friends from the club . . . they must have noticed his retreat from society this past year. But if they wondered at the reasons and speculated amongst themselves, not a one of them had directly asked him why. Whether they lacked the courage or the interest, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Pauline Simms had the courage. And the interest, it seemed. Her innocent question warmed a place inside him that had long gone cold.</p><p>For a moment he was tempted to answer.</p><p>But then he dismissed the idea. There was no way for a man of his wealth and rank to relate his personal trials to a serving girl without sounding completely insufferable. Miss Simms had been raised in poverty, with a simple-minded sister to protect and a violent father she couldn\u2019t escape. Despite it all, she retained her pride and a sharp sense of humor. Was this girl supposed to pity him for missing the Theatre Royal\u2019s spring season, when she\u2019d never attended the theater for even one night?</p><p>She would chide him for his whinging, and justly so. He could hear it now: Dukes and their problems.</p><p>He worked another tiny screw free of the clock\u2019s back facing. \u201cI don\u2019t see that it should be any of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of my concern,\u201d she finished for him. \u201cI know. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s not my business, but I couldn\u2019t help asking. It\u2019s the oddest thing, your grace. Even amid all the ancient, moldering volumes in this library . . . I find you the most unreadable book in the room. Just when I think I understand you, you confound me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimms, I\u2019m a man. I\u2019m not that complex.\u201d</p> <p>He set aside the clockwork, intending to call an end to this literary interlude and send her upstairs to her chamber. But when he looked up, he saw her.</p><p>All of her.</p><p>And his voice ceased to function.</p><p>She stood perched on the second highest rung of the ladder. The counterpane had slipped to a downy cloud on the floor, and she floated above it\u2014just a wisp of woman, wreathed in the thinnest, most fragile linen shift he\u2019d ever seen. The thing had been worn and washed and mended so many times, it was like a lace of cobwebs rather than proper fabric. And when she swung her body in front of the shining oil lamp?</p><p>The shift was utterly transparent.</p><p>He could see everything. She didn\u2019t have a boyish figure at all. No, she was all woman. Her small, apple-round breasts were capped with dark nipples. Her belly was sleek. When she perched on the ladder, stretching on tiptoe for another book, the curve of her silhouette called to him like a familiar melody. Arched foot, slender calf, sweetly flared thigh . . . and a rounded, graspable bottom.</p><p>True, hers wasn\u2019t a Rubenesque, buxom figure. No artists would paint her lolling about in white sheets. There was something wild and elemental about her. They\u2019d be inspired to depict a dancing nymph or chasing dryad. Hers was a body that would always show to its best advantage in motion.</p><p>And bare.</p><p>Brilliant. Now his imagination rioted with thoughts of her naked and moving.</p><p>She turned on the ladder, facing him.</p><p>Eyes, he told himself. Stay focused on the eyes. She had lovely eyes, with that startling leaf-green hue and her impossibly long eyelashes. He needn\u2019t let his gaze wander anywhere else.</p><p>Not to her spritely breasts.</p><p>Nor the enticing, dark triangle nestled between her thighs.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>He was a man, as he\u2019d told her. Not that complex. The reaction in his groin was pure, simple, and about four extra inches of straightforward. Surely she didn\u2019t realize how she appeared. She couldn\u2019t realize, or she\u2019d jump down from that ladder at once and cover herself.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the novels?\u201d she asked, matter-of-factly propping her elbow on the ladder\u2019s nearest rung.</p><p>An insidious thought occurred to him. If she didn\u2019t realize why he was staring, he could safely stare as long as he liked. He could drink in every bit of her, store up enough glimpses to fuel his fantasies for months.</p><p>\u201cI think the novels are there,\u201d he answered brusquely.</p><p>He motioned to the wall in question. Then he positioned the dismantled clock like a shield, blocking her from his view. Behind it, he briefly rolled his eyes heavenward. Someone up there had better be adding a hash mark to his \u201cGood Deeds\u201d tally. Perhaps now his lifetime total came to five or six.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any favorites to recommend?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sighed with gruff impatience. He wished she would cease being so blasted friendly when he was striving to stop mentally undressing her. In his mind\u2019s eye she was two buttons from complete ruination.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t read many novels, either,\u201d she said. \u201cThe few I\u2019ve tried were like forests to me\u2014I got lost. I prefer verses, when I can find them. Little posies of pretty words, easy to grasp and keep with you. There was a woman in Spindle Cove one summer who fancied herself a poetess. Her own poems were horrid, but I liked the books she left lying about. I committed my favorites to memory, so I could share them with my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd which ones were your favorites?\u201d he asked, happy to let her speak so she\u2019d cease asking questions.</p><p>She was silent for a moment. \u201cI like this one. \u2018The maiden caught me in the wild, where I was dancing merrily. She put me into her cabinet and locked me up with a golden key.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Griff had the panel almost freed now, but his fingers slowed.</p><p>She went on, her voice gaining a dreamy, velvet texture. \u201c \u2018The cabinet was formed of gold, and pearl and crystal shining bright. And within, it opens into a world, and a little lovely moony night. Another England there I saw. Another London with its Tower. Another Thames and other hills. And another pleasant Surrey bower.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He stared at the gutted clock before him. It didn\u2019t seem to be a clock anymore, but a cabinet. One with a secret window onto a little lovely moony night. A different London, a different England. An entirely different world.</p><p>He was enchanted, just a little.</p><p>\u201cThe story goes all wrong from there,\u201d she said regretfully, \u201cbut I loved that bit. A cabinet of gold and pearl and crystal, with a little secret world inside. It\u2019s something beautiful to picture when I\u2019m washing up glassware at the tavern. Or, you know, when I\u2019m elbow-deep in a mare.\u201d</p><p>He looked up from the clock a fraction. Just enough to receive the mischievous, fetching smile she cast his way.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked. \u201cCould it ever work?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>No, you bewitching creature. It could never, ever work.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the circulating library, I assume.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI have it all planned out, you see. There\u2019s an empty shop front on the village square where the old apothecary used to be. It\u2019s all shelves already, with a sturdy counter. Only needs a bit of sunlight and wood polish. Lace curtains maybe, and a chair or two for those who\u2019d like to sit.\u201d Her mouth pulled to the side. \u201cBut the prettiness is all for naught, if it isn\u2019t a sound business idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want my opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re paying me a thousand pounds, I\u2019d think you wouldn\u2019t want to see it squandered.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou can\u2019t know how many thousands I\u2019ve squandered on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me your honest judgment. Please.\u201d</p><p>He squinted, easing a bit of clockwork loose. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m the wrong person to ask. No doubt the spinsters will queue up for your verses and novels. The only books I ever went looking for were the naughty ones.\u201d</p><p>She clutched the ladder rung. \u201cOh, your grace. You\u2019re brilliant.\u201d</p><p>Griff sat back in his chair, amazed. Never in his life had anyone said that to him. Not outside of a bed, anyway. \u201cWhat\u2019s so brilliant about me, precisely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lending library full of naughty books. That\u2019s exactly what I need. I mean, not every book would necessarily be scandalous. But a good many of them should be. At home, the ladies can acquire all the boring, proper books they like, can\u2019t they? They come to Spindle Cove to break the rules.\u201d</p><p>Griff had a memory of the young ladies in that tavern, merrily ripping pages from an etiquette book to make tea trays. Yes, he could imagine torrid novels and radical pamphlets would do a brisk business in such a place.</p><p>And in making the inadvertent suggestion, he\u2019d now be responsible for debauching-by-proxy an entire village of spinsters. This surely represented some sort of zenith or nadir of his life. He wasn\u2019t sure which.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the naughty ones?\u201d She tilted her head back, peering into the farthest upper recesses of the room. \u201cI suppose they\u2019d be on a high shelf. Or did you have a locked cabinet somewhere?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIf I did possess a secret section of my library that consists entirely of books inappropriate for young ladies, you could hardly expect me to direct you to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019m no lady. Not that innocent, either.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t say that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very late, Simms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery early, more like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuffice it to say, it\u2019s very dark. And you\u2019re very unclothed, and we\u2019re much too alone.\u201d For the two of them to begin a perusal of erotic literature atop it . . . ? That fragile shift of hers wouldn\u2019t survive the hour. \u201cI\u2019ve no noble impulses, remember?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed. \u201cAt least help me make a list?\u201d</p><p>He drummed his fingers on the desk. \u201cMoll Flanders, Fanny Hill, The Monk, a good translation of L\u2019\u00c9cole des Filles. Those are a start.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to write them down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to. I have a good memory.\u201d</p><p>She leaned heavily to one side as she scanned the shelf, seeming to float above him. Griff was nearly reduced to panting by the nubile shadow of her silhouette and the swirled-brandy fall of her hair. Yes, he\u2019d perused his share of naughty books. None of them had affected him like this. He was hard as the mahogany desktop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAha. Here\u2019s one I\u2019ll take to bed with me.\u201d She plucked a book from the shelf. \u201cMethods of Accounting and Bookkeeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that should put you right to sleep.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good idea. Keep excellent written records, even if you do have a good memory. Don\u2019t accept credit. If you lend, always require a deposit. Few can match the aristocracy when it comes to shirking financial obligations.\u201d</p><p>She sent him a wary glance. \u201cYou don\u2019t shirk your debts, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLast I heard, I\u2019m the fourth-richest man in England. I never have a need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good.\u201d She clutched the bookkeeping tutorial to her chest and bent her head, inhaling deep. When she noticed his stare, she looked sheepish. \u201cI like the way books smell. Is that odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A little.\u201d</p><p>But he found it oddly endearing, too. This had gone beyond a midnight chat in the library and progressed to something bordering on flirtation. Perhaps even a strange sort of friendship\u2014on his side, edged with fierce, carnal attraction.</p><p>Whatever it was between them . . . it ended here, and it ended now.</p> <p>He set aside the dismantled clockwork and rose from his chair, trusting the shadows to hide his arousal. \u201cUpstairs with you, Simms. It\u2019s late, and I\u2019m sure my mother has a full schedule of exercises in futile ambition planned for the morrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m prepared to be a catastrophe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>She extinguished the lamp and descended two risers of the ladder. \u201cJust to prove it, I shan\u2019t even curtsy when I leave this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent start. If you wanted to be truly shocking, you could start calling me Griff.\u201d</p><p>She looked to him. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p> <p>He winced. A miscalculation on his part. He\u2019d suggested it as a stroke of impropriety, but her flattered expression reminded him\u2014familiarity of that sort could prove dangerous.</p><p>Speaking of danger . . .</p><p>\u201cTake care,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe last rung is rather\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gasped and faltered. \u201cOh, bollocks.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Time slowed. A fraction of a second showed Griff just how the accident would occur. Her toes would miss the last rung. She\u2019d drop the book. She would make a desperate swipe with her hand, perhaps graze the ladder rail with her fingertips\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t be a proper grasp. Her momentum would carry her forward.</p><p>And then she would fall to the ground, face first.</p><p>Granted, the fall was a matter of only a few feet, and she\u2019d no doubt survive it whole and unharmed. But by the time his mind had reached the end of the scenario, his body was already in motion.</p> <p>Putting one hand to the sofa back, he vaulted the thing in one swift motion. That obstacle cleared, he hurdled a leather ottoman in a single leap. Flinging his arms wide, he came to a skidding halt directly in front of the ladder.</p><p>Just in time to break her fall.</p><p>She fell heavy against his chest. He caught her in his arms.</p><p>And then\u2014even when all was safe\u2014he couldn\u2019t seem to put her down.</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d she breathed, looking at the room he\u2019d just traversed. \u201cThat was quite an athletic feat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing.\u201d</p><p>The only manly reply, naturally. In truth, he suspected he\u2019d pulled a muscle somewhere between vaulting the sofa and playing Jack Be Nimble with the ottoman . . . but he\u2019d worry about the pain later. Other sensations demanded his attention now.</p><p>Good God. Just seeing her form had been a delight, but it was a pale shadow compared to the thrill of feeling her. Her nipples were every bit as assertive as her personality, jabbing at him through the frail, tissue-thin fabric of her night rail. They demanded his notice. More than mere notice\u2014they wanted respect.</p><p>Hell, he would have offered them worship.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like nothing.\u201d Her arms laced about his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re breathless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d She gave him a smile so shyly sweet, it seemed to belong to some other girl. \u201cYour reflexes are most impressive.\u201d</p><p>What a gift of a remark. Here was where he would normally reply with a suggestive, You have no idea, or Years of practice, sweeting. But he couldn\u2019t quite muster the tired rakish innuendo. An absurd idea visited him\u2014that his entire misspent life of sport and leisure, whiling away the days fencing or boxing when he might have been building a legacy, had prepared him for this one moment.</p><p>For this one girl, who needed him to break her fall.</p><p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t watch you get hurt,\u201d he said, not understanding it.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t have noble impulses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me.\u201d He stared into her eyes and spoke the words without lewdness or irony. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>If he possessed a single grain of decency, he would have set her down long moments ago. Wicked as it made him, he loved the way she was clinging to his neck. As though the world around them were a vast, frozen waste and sharing the heat of his body was her only chance to survive. It was so easy to believe, for this moment, that she needed him. Needed his touch, his mouth, his heated breath. His bared, feverish skin all over hers.</p><p>Amazing, what acrobatic contortions the lusting male mind could achieve. He\u2019d almost convinced himself that kissing her lush, sweet lips was the noble thing to do.</p><p>Almost. But not quite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put you down now,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>And then she pressed her lips to his.</p><p>Praise and curses be heaped. The girl kissed him.</p><p>The kiss crashed over him in a turbulent wave. His senses opened like floodgates. Her lips were so soft. They tasted ripe as berries. She smelled of linen dried in the sun. Her skin was a lush blur of creamy pink in his stunned, still-wide-open eyes.</p><p>Even when the kiss ended, the sweet shock of it resounded in his every nerve. Primal urges echoed back.</p><p>More. Again. Now.</p><p>Lust was his old, familiar acquaintance. The rapid beat of his pulse, the taste of her on his tongue, the sudden tightening in his groin . . . he knew all these sensations quite well.</p><p>But there was something else in this storm of feeling. A deep, steady thrum in the region of his heart.</p><p>Her, it whispered. I\u2019ll take her.</p><p>That part was new. And terrifying.</p><p>He abruptly set her on her feet. Then he turned away, rubbing his mouth. \u201cWhat the devil was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would expect your grace to have more experience on the subject . . . but I thought it was a kiss.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It was . . . it was good.\u201d</p><p>He swung to face her. \u201cYou call that good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not good. Fortunate, more like.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny there\u2019s been a certain tension building between us. I thought the kiss might help.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her in disbelief. \u201cHelp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now it\u2019s done, you see.\u201d She turned away with a self-conscious shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s over. And obviously it wasn\u2019t anything special. We won\u2019t have to worry about an attraction.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t anything special? Not worry about an attraction?</p><p>Remarkable, how this girl could slash at his pride. Perhaps he should hand her a letter opener and invite her to complete the evisceration.</p><p>She reached to retrieve the book she\u2019d dropped and gathered it close to her chest, preparing to leave. \u201cGood night, your grace.\u201d</p><p>Let it go, he told himself. Let her go.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t judge on that kiss.\u201d He took a step forward\u2014blustering on past logic and common sense, tripping straight into pigheaded foolishness.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. That wasn\u2019t a proper kiss. It was a mere collision of lips. If I kissed you and meant it, you\u2019d have cause to worry, Simms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would?\u201d</p><p>He approached her slowly, made his voice low and cool. \u201cYou would. A true kiss would stir you in your deepest places. It would keep you lying awake in your bed all night long. Restless, and beset by . . .\u201d He paused, grasping for the female equivalent of an aching cockstand. \u201c . . . flutterings.\u201d</p><p>Her brow lifted in amusement, and a sly dimple formed in her cheek. \u201cFlutterings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he pronounced in a definitive tone. \u201cFlutterings.\u201d</p><p>She smothered a laugh.</p><p>Good Lord. This wasn\u2019t happening. He could not be having this conversation. Flutterings? Stupid, asinine word, but he was committed now. He couldn\u2019t back down. He was the duke in this room, he reminded himself. And she was just a serving girl. It was time they both remembered it.</p><p>Except she wasn\u2019t just a serving girl. She was a serving girl with aspirations, keen business sense, shockingly good taste in poetry . . . and slight, enticing curves his hands ached to explore.</p><p>She was delectable. Ripe as berries.</p><p>Her, the whisper came again.</p><p>Leave off, he told it.</p><p>\u201cFlutterings,\u201d she mused aloud.</p><p>He nodded. He didn\u2019t even mind that she was mocking him. He wanted her to say that word again and again, because each repetition came with an erotic flash of her tongue. It stoked a wildness in him.</p><p>She pushed her bottom lip forward, considering. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever suffered flutterings, your grace. Perhaps they\u2019re unique to ladies of the higher classes. I don\u2019t possess that sort of delicate feminine nature.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand to the back of her head, plunging his fingers through the raw silk of her hair. \u201cNow that\u2019s bollocks.\u201d</p><p>And then he pulled her into a kiss.</p><p>Ah. So these were flutterings.</p><p>And this, Pauline gathered, was his idea of a proper kiss. An embrace with heat and purpose, and one that remained entirely in his command. He controlled the angle of her neck and the closeness of their bodies\u2014and the slow, maddening rhythm of his tongue, sweeping between her lips again and again.</p><p>He kissed her forcefully, relentlessly, as though he were meting out some punishment she deserved. Twenty lashings with a strong, wicked tongue. Little could he suppose it was exactly what she wanted. What she craved, with every bone and sinew in her small, slender frame.</p><p>Yes. Thank you. May I have another.</p><p>Those few moments after she\u2019d kissed him had been among the most miserable of her life. He\u2019d acted so horrified and disturbed. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d been thinking to try it. Only that she was so grateful to him for opening this vast, invaluable library to her, a common serving girl. For listening to her most secret dreams without mocking them\u2014and what\u2019s more, perfecting them by giving her that brilliant, naughty idea.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t know how much it meant.</p><p>And then he\u2019d performed that dashing, heroic maneuver to break her fall.</p><p>When she saw him up close, a flash in his eyes gave her the strangest notion. That this was scarcely the first night he\u2019d spent haunting the corridors, staying up much too late and far too alone. That he wasn\u2019t nearly so put out by the interruption as he would have her believe.</p><p>That he might need a kiss\u2014and a little rescuing, too.</p><p>Of course he\u2019d walk a bed of nails barefoot rather than admit such a thing. She ought to have guessed how he\u2019d react. All men had their pride, and dukes worst of all. \u201cAdmitting weaknesses\u201d must rank with \u201ctickle fights\u201d and \u201cslug hunting\u201d in his list of least-favored activities.</p><p>So he\u2019d struck back at her with this. A kiss that was controlled, masterful, possessive. And Pauline couldn\u2019t say she minded in the least.</p><p>He held her to him so tightly, twisting one hand in the linen of her shift and making a snarl of her hair with the other. Later, she\u2019d be brushing it until her arm ached, but it would be worth every last stroke. The sensations racing over her scalp danced on that delicious edge between pleasure and pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His chest was a solid wall of heat, inflaming her and bringing her nipples to tight, needy peaks. Nothing separated their bodies but a few tissue-thin layers of linen, but still she couldn\u2019t get close enough. She rubbed against him, hoping to soothe the ache. Pleasure arced straight to her core.</p><p>When she stretched her arms around his back, he growled in encouragement. The deep, vibrating sound traveled through her body and settled as a seductive hum between her thighs. She nestled closer still.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he murmured against her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>It was. The way they fit together felt so, so right.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t kissing her any longer. They were kissing each other. Taking pleasure. Giving comfort. Learning one another\u2019s taste.</p><p>His mouth gentled over hers, and his movements grew languid, playful. Their tongues partnered in a slow, sensual dance. She gripped the skin-warmed linen of his shirt, letting it glide between her fingertips. So supple, with so much strength beneath. A wild, feral curiosity seized her. She wanted to know everything about him. Was his body bronzed to match his face, or pale like carved marble? Did he have hair on his chest, or was it smooth?</p><p>What powered that fierce, drumming beat of his heart?</p><p>She told herself to stop the inquiries there, struggling to tether her imagination before it ventured further downward.</p> <p>Apparently, he had no such concern.</p><p>He swept a bold, exploratory touch down her spine. A pleasant shiver chased his caress, skipping over her vertebrae. When he reached her bottom, his hand found a curve she didn\u2019t know she had, and he claimed it with a possessive squeeze. She savored his moan of satisfaction.</p><p>How wonderful. She was used to thinking of her body as all points and angles, but he made her feel soft.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt like this, not in all her life. So wanted, so desired. So needed, and by a man who shouldn\u2019t need anything.</p><p>When he finally broke the kiss, he left her lips swollen and aching. The corner of her mouth was rasped raw by his whiskers, and she touched her tongue to it, coaxing the hurt. She\u2019d be feeling this kiss for hours.</p><p>Possibly years.</p> <p>He released a ragged sigh. \u201cSimms. That was badly done of me.\u201d</p><p>Pauline laughed a little. \u201cIf that was badly done, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d survive your best effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It was badly done of me as your employer. I shouldn\u2019t like you to think I make a habit of chasing the help.\u201d He turned aside, scrubbing a hand through his dark hair. \u201cWhen I want companionship, I have no difficulty finding it. I never need to s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSink to this?\u201d Stung, she reached for the discarded counterpane. \u201cIf your aim is to let me down gently, you\u2019re failing.\u201d</p><p>Why did men have to ruin everything? The answer was simple, she supposed\u2014because foolish women gave them the chance.</p><p>\u201cListen. I\u2019m just trying to say it won\u2019t happen again. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for kissing me? Or sorry it won\u2019t happen again?\u201d</p><p>He approached and tucked the counterpane tight about her shoulders. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p> <p>In the flickering candlelight, his face took on that same haunted, lonely look. If he truly had no difficulty finding companionship\u2014and after that kiss, she could believe he didn\u2019t\u2014why wasn\u2019t he off pleasuring his mistress, or entertaining a widow, or debauching a virgin tonight?</p><p>For a man with no desire to marry, he wasn\u2019t exactly reveling in his freedom.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a kiss.\u201d She gathered a lit candle from the desk. \u201cWhat\u2019s a little kiss or two? Nothing.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and looked at her. \u201cDid you hear yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said nothing. Not nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I said nothing. Nothing.\u201d She gasped. \u201cCor. I did say it. Nothing.\u201d She tested more words. \u201cKissing. Embracing. Fluttering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just\u201d\u2014the duke held up a hand\u2014\u201cstop the exercise there.\u201d</p><p>Pauline clapped a hand over her mouth and laughed into it. \u201cOh, no. This can only be your fault. Your mother did say it was all in limbering the tongue.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a dark look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your grace. No matter how you pronounce it, it truly was nothing. Just a kiss.\u201d</p><p>Liar, her heartbeat pounded. It was so much more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been kissed before,\u201d she continued.</p><p>Liar, liar. You\u2019ve never been kissed like that.</p><p>\u201cI know not to make too much of it. This is hardly cause for alarm,\u201d she finished.</p><p>Liar, liar, hair afire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWe both have our goals. You have your naughty bookshop to open, and I have my ribald life story to continue, unfettered by matchmaking. The only way this week can go wrong is if it ends with us engaged to marry, and God knows that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>He drew the doors shut, then turned to her. Their gazes caught in the warm, golden space above the candle flame.</p><p>Pauline forced a laugh. It came out high and wild and ridiculous, and she wished she could blame it on someone else. \u201cOh, heavens. Don\u2019t flatter yourself, Griff. The kiss wasn\u2019t that good.\u201d</p><p>And then she hurried up the stairs, trying to outrun that pounding accusation in her chest.</p><p>Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>By mid-morning the next day, Pauline was amassing quite the mental list of things duchesses didn\u2019t do.</p><p>Duchesses didn\u2019t curse, spit, serve themselves at the table, buckle in any sense of the word, or speak of their internal organs in mixed company.</p><p>But on a happy note, duchesses did not have chores. They didn\u2019t draw water, or feed the hens, or turn out the cow, or chase a loose piglet all through the yard. Duchesses didn\u2019t make their own breakfast, or anyone else\u2019s. That part was lovely.</p><p>And when the Duchess of Halford swept into her bedchamber, Pauline added one more item to her list:</p><p>Duchesses did not knock.</p><p>She startled and thrust the bookkeeping manual under the pillow before rising from the bed. She didn\u2019t want to explain how that book had come to be in her possession. Even if she\u2019d spent the past hour or two reliving the scene in her memory.</p><p>Oh, that kiss.</p><p>Her lips still tingled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re awake,\u201d the duchess said, \u201ceven at this early hour.\u201d</p><p>This early hour?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly eleven o\u2019clock in the morning. I\u2019ve been awake for ages.\u201d Never in her life had Pauline slept later than six. She turned her head and gazed out the window. \u201cHalf the day\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re used to country hours. We operate on a different schedule in Town. The time for morning calls begins at noon. Luncheon might be taken at three. The evening is just getting under way at nine o\u2019clock, and midnight suppers are de rigueur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Pauline woke with the dawn every day, without fail. Mornings would be her time for reading. Perhaps she could steal a visit or two to the library, once she finished the bookkeeping text.</p><p>\u201cMy son seldom rises before noon,\u201d the duchess sighed. \u201cBut that\u2019s why we\u2019re getting an early start. We\u2019ve a great deal of work before us.\u201d</p><p>Pauline scanned the room. \u201cI would have dressed, but I didn\u2019t see my frock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d The duchess waved a hand. \u201cWe burned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou burned it? That was my best for everyday.\u201d As opposed to the two other frocks she owned, one of which was strictly for church.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be your best ever again. From now on, you wear better. Later we\u2019ll visit the shops, but I\u2019ve had my modiste send over some samples for today. I\u2019ll ring for Fleur, and we\u2019ll have you dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolly good, your grace.\u201d</p><p>Pauline\u2019s spirits sank straight to the carpet. Two minutes into her undressing last night she\u2019d realized she didn\u2019t get along with Fleur. Or more to the point, Fleur didn\u2019t get along with Pauline.</p><p>The lady\u2019s maid had golden hair and cornflower-blue eyes, and she floated into the room like a snowflake. Perfect, pale, and cold.</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Fleur said. It was a very French sound, and it didn\u2019t sound complimentary to Pauline\u2019s hair, face, attire, or character.</p><p>The Halford driver and footmen had been present in Spindle Cove for everything, and Pauline knew how quickly gossip passed from one servant to the next. By now they all must know she was a mere country farm girl, not worthy of a lady\u2019s maid\u2019s attention. Surely the servants would resent her and the extra work she was causing them.</p><p>Fleur unpacked a set of tissue-lined boxes, drawing out a series of undergarments and three nearly identical frocks.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all white,\u201d Pauline said.</p><p>\u201cOf course they\u2019re white,\u201d the duchess replied.</p><p>Never in her life had Pauline worn a white frock. Perhaps not even at her own christening. White was the color for ladies, because only ladies could keep a white gown clean. If she had ever been so foolish as to make herself a light-colored frock at home, it would have been gray within three washings. Excepting aprons and stockings, everything she owned was either brown or dark blue.</p><p>Not any longer.</p><p>First she was cloaked in a snow-white chemise, then corseted within an inch of her life. The duchess selected the simplest of the frocks\u2014a high-waisted morning dress in layers of sheer muslin\u2014and Fleur lifted it over Pauline\u2019s head. The pale fabric descended like a cloud, wreathing her in airy prettiness. She stared down at her arms, so tanned and freckled when placed against the pristine muslin.</p><p>The duchess scrubbed her with an appraising look. \u201cAt least it fits in the shoulders. It\u2019s fortunate you\u2019re willowy.\u201d</p><p>Willowy? That struck Pauline as a generous way of describing her figure. Even willows had curves.</p><p>After fussing with the frock\u2019s loose waistline for a few moments, Fleur took a length of jade-green satin and slid it about Pauline\u2019s middle, cinching it tight and tying a bow in back.</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d This time, Fleur sounded satisfied.</p><p>\u201cYes, much better,\u201d the duchess agreed. \u201cNow what can be done with her hair?\u201d</p><p>Not much, appeared to be Fleur\u2019s opinion.</p><p>Once Pauline\u2019s hair was coiffed and pinned in a simple, upswept knot, she was left staring at a most unfamiliar reflection in the vanity mirror. Not a hair out of place, not a speck on her frock\u2019s scalloped lace overlay.</p><p>The duchess dismissed Fleur with a few words in French, then addressed Pauline\u2019s reflection in the mirror. \u201cI am going to do something I never do. I am going to talk to you about my son.\u201d</p><p>Pauline\u2019s mouth opened. But even if she\u2019d decided what to say, the duchess\u2019s look forbade her to say anything.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. But I can\u2019t speak to my peers about such things, and I\u2019d never confide in the servants. I\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end with Griffy, and I\u2019ve no one else to tell.\u201d</p><p>Griffy?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s changed since last autumn. I noticed it the day I arrived in Town. My son was always a rascal as a young boy. Then he grew into a dissolute young man, always playing cards with his friends or hosting bacchanalian parties at that Winterset Grange. And there\u2019ve been so many women.\u201d</p><p>No doubt, Pauline thought. Did last night make her one of them?</p><p>\u201cBut this past year, everything changed. He didn\u2019t even open the Grange last winter. He stayed in Town. For what purpose, I can\u2019t imagine. He never goes out to the clubs, shows no interest in friends or society. And then there\u2019s the locked room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA locked room, you say?\u201d</p><p>She tried not to betray her heightened interest. With all that had happened in the library afterward, she\u2019d almost forgotten surprising him in the corridor last night. He\u2019d certainly behaved like a man with something to hide. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He also kissed like a man who craved warmth and comfort.

He doesn\u2019t even allow the maids to dust it. It\u2019s . . . it\u2019s perverse. Who knows what he\u2019s keeping in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do hope it\u2019s not a collection of severed heads. Perhaps he\u2019s been trawling the countryside for impertinent serving girls, and I\u2019ll be number eleven.\u201d</p> <p>The duchess harrumphed. \u201cYou\u2019re not number eleven. You\u2019re going to be his first\u2014and only\u2014bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m a commoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Halford legacy is sufficiently robust to withstand my son\u2019s debauchery. It can even survive a commoner as duchess. But it will end\u2014forever\u2014if there is no male heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely the duke has decades yet to produce a son. You can\u2019t honestly believe he\u2019ll marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must. I can\u2019t wait decades. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d The duchess halted. \u201cI\u2019d hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to this. Now I see I have no choice.\u201d</p> <p>The older woman thrust one hand into her pocket and drew it back out, clutching something small and fuzzy.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she declared. \u201cJust look at it.\u201d</p><p>Pauline looked at it. A knitted object, of indeterminate purpose, made from light yellow wool. Part of it looked like a cap, and part of it looked like a glove, and none if it looked well made.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s appalling! That\u2019s what it is. I don\u2019t even know how it happens. I haven\u2019t done needlework since I was a girl of fourteen. Even then it was crewel work and embroidery. Never knitting. But every night, for the past several months, I sit down for the evening, intending to read or write letters, and three hours later there\u2019s a lumpy, misshapen thing in my lap.\u201d</p><p>Pauline stifled a giggle.</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead, laugh. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d The duchess picked up the knitted mess and turned it over in her hands. \u201cIs it a cap for a two-headed snake? A mitten for a three-fingered arthritic? Even I don\u2019t know, and I made the thing. The shame. I can\u2019t let the servants see them, of course. I have to stash them in a hatbox and smuggle them out to the Foundling Hospital on Tuesdays.\u201d</p><p>Pauline laughed aloud at that.</p><p>\u201cA lifetime of elegance, poise, and jewels, and now I\u2019ve come to this.\u201d She lifted the distorted mitten and shook it at Pauline. \u201cThis! It\u2019s absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should consult a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a powder or a tonic, Miss Simms.\u201d The duchess sank into a chair and pressed the snarl of yarn to her chest. Her voice softened. \u201cI need grandchildren. Little pudgy, wriggling babies to absorb all this affection unraveling inside me. I\u2019m desperate for them, and I don\u2019t know what will become of me otherwise. Some morning, Fleur will come in to wake me and find I\u2019ve been asphyxiated by a yards-long muffler. How gauche.\u201d</p><p>Pauline took the knitting from the duchess\u2019s hands and examined it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t half bad, in places. I could teach you to make a proper cuff, if you like.\u201d</p><p>The duchess grabbed it from her and stuffed it back in her pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll take knitting lessons from you later. This week, you\u2019re taking duchess lessons from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, your grace, you don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t even\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Pauline shut her mouth. It had been on the tip of her tongue to say, I don\u2019t even want to marry him.</p><p>But something stopped her from saying it aloud. An impulse to spare the duchess\u2019s feelings, she decided. No mother would like to hear her son disparaged, and it would be impossible to explain why a serving girl would turn down the chance to marry a duke.</p><p>Explanations weren\u2019t necessary, anyhow. The duke in question was never going to propose.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s paying me,\u201d she blurted out. She just couldn\u2019t let the poor woman get her hopes up. Halford hadn\u2019t sworn her to secrecy, after all. \u201cHe\u2019s paying me to be a catastrophe. To thwart your every attempt at polish.\u201d</p><p>The duchess gave a delicate harrumph. \u201cThat\u2019s what he told you because that\u2019s what he\u2019s telling himself. He can\u2019t bring himself to admit that he\u2019s fascinated with you. You\u2019re a proud one as well. If I accused you of being infatuated with him already, you\u2019d deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I do deny it. Because it isn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke the words, Pauline\u2019s heart pounded in her chest.</p><p>Liar, liar, liar.</p><p>She was infatuated. Stupidly, impossibly infatuated with every little thing about the duke. No, not the duke\u2014the man. The way he\u2019d listened to her with true interest. The way he\u2019d broken her fall, kissed her with such passion. The delicious, addictive way he smelled. Just that morning she\u2019d harbored fantasies of stealing his discarded shirt from the laundry so she could stash it under her pillow.</p><p>Oh, ye gods! This was terrible. She even had flutterings.</p><p>Fleur reentered the room bearing a velvet-lined tray, which she placed on the vanity table.</p><p>Pauline gasped. The tray was covered in jewels of every type and color, sparkling in every conceivable setting\u2014necklaces, bracelets, earrings, rings. But they did not come in every size. No, each gemstone was uniformly, alarmingly huge.</p><p>\u201cThat will be all,\u201d the duchess said, dismissing Fleur once again.</p><p>She turned her attention to the tray of jewels. \u201cNot pearls, not today,\u201d she muttered, pushing aside a strand of perfectly matched iridescent orbs. \u201cTopaz would be all wrong. It will be a few years yet before you can carry off diamonds or rubies.\u201d</p><p>Diamonds and rubies? The deluded woman kept speaking as if all these jewels would one day be hers. Pauline didn\u2019t know how to convince the duchess of the truth.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me, your grace?\u201d she asked in a loud whisper. \u201cGri\u2014I mean, the duke\u2014is paying me to fail. He just wants to teach you a lesson, so he\u2019ll never be subject to your matchmaking again.\u201d</p><p>The older woman\u2019s hands settled on Pauline\u2019s shoulders. Their gazes met in the mirror. \u201cHow much did he promise you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>The duchess seemed unimpressed. She placed her hands on either side of Pauline\u2019s face and pulled upward, elongating her spine until she sat ramrod straight.</p><p>\u201cThere. When your posture is correct, you have a marvelous neck for jewels.\u201d She tilted Pauline\u2019s head this way and that. \u201cNever let anyone tell you to wear emeralds, simply because your eyes are green. It\u2019s what people with no imagination say. On color alone, your eyes are a closer match to peridot. But peridot always strikes me as lamentably bourgeois.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t often have people advising me on jewels, your grace,\u201d Pauline said, her voice muffled by the duchess\u2019s hands bracketing her cheeks. \u201cThis would be the very first time.\u201d</p><p>The duchess released her, turned, and lifted a necklace of light purple stones and gold filigree from the velvet-lined tray. As she draped the jewels about Pauline\u2019s neck, she said, \u201cThis is your stone. Amethyst. Rare, regal, yet sweet enough for a younger woman.\u201d</p><p>As the jewels found the dips and hollows of her collarbone, Pauline stared into the looking glass, amazed. The duchess was right\u2014the amethysts\u2019 color did look well on her. The violet shade set off the golden tones in her hair and put a wash of pink on her cheeks.</p><p>Then again, perhaps the flush was born of excitement. She could scarcely believe such a thing was touching her bare skin.</p><p>\u201cSo my son has offered you a thousand pounds,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cThis necklace alone is worth ten times that.\u201d</p><p>Holy . . . Ten. Thousand. Pounds. Ten times a thousand pounds. A numeral one with four aughts after it. Hanging around her neck.</p><p>Fear gripped her with sudden, irrational force. She was terrified to move or breathe. If she even dared tilt her head to one side, perhaps the chain would break and the entire priceless business would slide into a floorboard crack\u2014never to be seen again.</p><p>The duchess said, \u201cKeep your eyes on the greater prize, my girl.\u201d</p><p>Pauline could do nothing but stare at the silver-haired woman in the looking glass. Odd. She hadn\u2019t pegged the duchess for a madwoman.</p><p>\u201cYour grace, it simply won\u2019t work.\u201d She waved at her own reflection. \u201cI\u2019m not what he\u2019d want. Much less what he\u2019d need. He\u2019s the eighth Duke of Halford, and I\u2019m a serving girl. Perfectly wrong. Just listen to me. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not I who needs a look at you.\u201d The duchess removed the amethyst necklace and replaced it in the tray, then motioned for Pauline to stand. \u201cCome along. We\u2019re going to have an experiment.\u201d</p><p>Bemused, Pauline rose from the chair and followed. They went downstairs to the main floor, and the duchess guided her into a large, open salon. As they entered the room, she looked to Pauline and put a finger to her lips for quiet.</p><p>The carpets had been rolled back to the edges of the room, and Pauline quickly learned why. The room wasn\u2019t a salon right now, but some sort of gymnasium.</p><p>In the center of the floor, the duke and a masked opponent squared off against one another. Each man was clad in thigh-hugging buff breeches, a quilted waistcoat, and an open white shirt. Each man held a slender, shining sword.</p><p>Neither noticed them enter the room.</p><p>\u201cEn garde,\u201d the masked man said.</p><p>Steel clanged in response.</p><p>Pauline looked on as the two swordsmen traded feints and thrusts. She was speechless in admiration.</p><p>While his opponent wore a mesh helmet to protect his face, the duke\u2019s features were fully visible. She could make out every furrow of concentration and drop of sweat on his brow. The exertion had matted his hair to his skull in dark, curling locks, and his open shirt clung to his torso. His musculature was revealed by the damp white linen, giving him the look of a marble carving come to life. Arms, shoulders, calves, arse\u2014he was beautifully formed, everywhere.</p><p>The masked opponent sent a quick thrust toward the duke\u2019s torso, but the duke deflected it with a sharp flick of his own blade before going on attack. His lunges and thrusts had the grace of a dance, coupled with deadly force.</p><p>As the two battled on, the walls echoed with the exciting sounds of steel whooshing through the air and blades clanging against each other\u2014and most thrilling of all, two athletic men grunting with the force of their exertion. The whole space hummed with virile energy.</p><p>If Pauline had been suffering flutterings since their kiss, this scene ratcheted those sensations to something even more profound. Stirrings? Quakings? She didn\u2019t want to name them.</p><p>In the center of the room, the men locked swords. The shining edge was just inches from Halford\u2019s face, and unlike his opponent, he wore no contraption of metal floss to guard it. A flick of the blade and he could be scarred or blinded.</p><p>Take care, she wanted to shout.</p><p>The duchess put a hand on Pauline\u2019s arm, restraining her.</p><p>Finally, with a primal growl, the two broke apart\u2014each man recoiling several paces backward.</p><p>As he swiped at the perspiration on his brow, the duke turned his head in the ladies\u2019 direction, briefly.</p><p>Briefly was all it took.</p><p>He saw her.</p><p>Even from across the room, Pauline felt it the moment his gaze locked with hers. The heated intensity made her skin tingle.</p><p>Halford must have felt more than a tingle. While he stood frozen in place, his opponent\u2019s blade nicked his upper arm. A line of red blood quickly soaked through his shirt.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Pauline clapped both hands over her mouth, horrified.</p><p>For her part, the duchess made a satisfied noise. \u201cI call that a success.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Griff growled in pain, dropping his sword and pressing his free hand over the wound. \u201cDamn it, Del.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot my fault. Why\u2019d you stop defending?\u201d His friend pushed back his protective mask and looked about the room. When his gaze found Miss Simms, he smiled broadly. \u201cHullo. I see for myself now.\u201d</p><p>Hullo, indeed.</p><p>Pauline curtsied, and Griff gave her a brisk nod.</p> <p>He shouldn\u2019t have been so surprised. It was just that he hadn\u2019t seen her since the library last night, where they\u2019d spent that time talking. Then embracing. Then kissing like lovers who\u2019d been imprisoned in separate cells for ten years and were headed for the gallows at dawn.</p><p>Good God. Good God.</p><p>Today, he\u2019d resolved to find her and have a brief, businesslike chat to set matters straight, assure them both it wouldn\u2019t happen again\u2014but the talk wasn\u2019t supposed to happen like this. They were meant to be alone, but only to a safe degree. When he was too exhausted from hours of vigorous fencing to even contemplate lust, and when she was . . . not looking like that.</p><p>Are you all right? she mouthed.</p><p>No. No, he wasn\u2019t all right. He was devastated.</p> <p>Yesterday she\u2019d turned his head with impropriety and all those sparkling sugar crystals. Now she didn\u2019t sparkle any longer. She wore a frock of white so sheer and pure, the sun-burnished warmth of her skin shone through.</p><p>She glowed.</p><p>He\u2019d always loved this: a woman\u2019s elemental effect on him, as a man. He used to live for these moments of raw, instinctual attraction. When a source of celestial-grade femininity wandered into the room, and his internal compass recalibrated. It was a sublime shift from internal chaos to single-minded determination. The difference between Ye gods, what next? and . . .</p><p>Her. I\u2019ll take her.</p><p>Damn. He wanted her. He had from the first. He understood it now, that some deadened part of him was kindling back to life.</p><p>But this was the worst possible time, and she was the least possible woman, and whatever effect she had on him, Griff knew he must make absolutely sure that no one in the room\u2014not his mother, not his friend, not Pauline Simms\u2014had any clue.</p> <p>Well, aside from the bleeding.</p><p>Turning away, he used the edge of his sword to shear a strip of linen from his shirt and used it to bind his wound.</p><p>\u201cYour grace.\u201d Del stretched one leg forward and made a deep, courtly bow to the duchess.</p><p>\u201cLord Delacre.\u201d His mother inclined her head.</p><p>\u201cWill you do me the honor of introducing your lovely friend?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t start, Griff silently warned. Not with her.</p><p>He and Del had a long history of locking horns over conquests. In their most callow, youthful years they\u2019d even made a sport of it, with wagers and a complex system of points. Griff had long outgrown such things, but there was no telling, where Delacre was concerned. He might still be keeping a tally somewhere.</p><p>\u201cThis is my guest,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cMiss Simms, of Sussex.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, Miss Simms of Sussex. It\u2019s a true pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Lord Delacre, of wherever I\u2019m least wanted.\u201d He lifted Pauline\u2019s hand and kissed it.</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow at Griff, and it was as though he could hear her teasing, You didn\u2019t kiss my hand.</p><p>But I saved you from falling on your face, he retorted with a quirked brow of his own.</p><p>For a moment they began to share a smile. And then it was though they both remembered the kisses that had followed said rescue\u2014not to mention the implied intimacy of conversing in eyebrow quirks while other people looked on.</p><p>Her throat flushed. Griff looked away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be worried about him, Miss Simms,\u201d said Delacre. \u201cWe\u2019re expert swordsmen, the two of us. Best in London. We have to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re the two greatest rakes.\u201d Del winked at her. \u201cA reputation for expert swordsmanship is the best defense against being called out in a duel. No man, no matter how enraged, would put the choice of weapon in our hands.\u201d He set his practice blade aside. \u201cHave you been long in London, Miss Simms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly since yesterday, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The duchess put in, \u201cMiss Simms\u2019s parents have been unable to expose her to society, so I\u2019ve offered to give the girl some polish here in Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudging by the slice in Halford\u2019s arm, I\u2019d say you\u2019re off to a promising start,\u201d Delacre said. In a lowered voice, he told the duchess, \u201cI know what you\u2019re up to. And as one blood-sworn to defend him against all marriage traps, I ought to object. But for once, your grace, I think we may be allies. There\u2019s no denying he\u2019s been a monk all season. Only less amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Griff said curtly.</p><p>Del ignored him, still addressing the duchess in confidential tones. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re not entirely aligned. You\u2019re his mother. You want to see him married. As his friend, my goal is different. I\u2019d settle for getting him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDel.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014out,\u201d Delacre finished, clapping a hand to his breast in innocence. \u201cGetting him out. Of the house. What did you think I meant to say? You have a filthy mind, Halford. Positively diseased.\u201d</p><p>Annoyed, Griff swung his sword in idle threat, testing his wounded arm. With friends like these . . .</p><p>\u201cThis is excellent.\u201d Delacre clapped his hands. \u201cMiss Simms needs an introduction to Town. Halford\u2019s been needing to use his\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDel.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014legs.\u201d Delacre raised his hands in innocence. \u201cObviously, we all need to attend the Beaufetheringstone crush this evening.\u201d</p><p>His mother sighed. \u201cI will speak these words just once in my lifetime, I\u2019m sure. Delacre, you make an excellent suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible suggestion,\u201d Griff muttered.</p><p>\u201cUntil this evening, then.\u201d Delacre gathered his things and sketched a quick bow. \u201cI must be going. I like to wear out at least three welcomes before teatime. Otherwise, the day feels wasted.\u201d From the doorway, he leveled a finger at Griff. \u201cYou can thank me for this later.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I will gut you for this later.</p><p>\u201cBut I just arrived in Town,\u201d Pauline said. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to wear.\u201d</p><p>The duchess raised a brow. \u201cGirl, you have so little faith in me.\u201d</p><p>Griff knew better. He put nothing past his mother when she had a goal in mind. But even if she managed to make Miss Simms look the part of a young lady, she couldn\u2019t remedy the girl\u2019s accent, education, woeful etiquette, and utter lack of genteel accomplishment. Not in a single day\u2019s time.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t worried.</p><p>Much.</p><p>A few hours later Pauline understood why the duke might price a week\u2019s maternal diversion at one thousand pounds and still think it a good value. The duchess could spend that sum in one afternoon, twice.</p><p>They visited the modiste first\u2014an aging, turbaned woman who appeared better suited to fortune-telling than mantua-making. She surveyed Pauline with dramatic, kohl-rimmed eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, your grace,\u201d the woman said, in a tone of despair. \u201cWhat is this you\u2019ve brought me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs a week\u2019s full wardrobe,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cAltered samples will do for today, but we need better for tomorrow. Morning, walking, and evening dress. A ball gown by Friday night. And she must look ravishing beyond compare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRavishing? This?\u201d The modiste clucked her tongue. \u201cYou ask too much.\u201d</p><p>The duchess lifted a brow and fixed the woman with a severe look. \u201cI\u2019m not asking.\u201d</p><p>The room froze over with an icy, tense silence.</p><p>Finally, the modiste clapped her hands, and a bevy of assistants rushed forward.</p><p>Pauline played scarecrow for hours, standing with her arms spread to either side while flitting seamstresses circled her. They measured every bit of her with tapes, from wrists to ankles, and draped her with lengths of shimmering fabric.</p><p>Once the seamstresses were finished pricking her with pins, it was on to the linen draper\u2019s, where Pauline learned just how many shades pink came in: scores. The duchess pored over bolt after bolt of satin in shades of blush, rose, berry, and one unpleasant, flaming shade she could only describe as \u201crash.\u201d The duchess had several fabrics cut and sent to the modiste.</p><p>Then it was on to the haberdasher\u2019s. And the milliner\u2019s. Then the glover\u2019s. By the time she\u2019d tried on a dozen pairs of toe-pinching slippers, Pauline came to a realization.</p><p>Achieving the look of pampered elegance required a ridiculous amount of work.</p><p>While the duchess was directing the footmen in their efforts to secure fourteen parcels and hatboxes atop the coach, Pauline\u2019s attention strayed to a shop next door.</p><p>A happy flutter rose in her chest.</p><p>It was a bookshop.</p><p>She peered through the lattice of diamond-shaped windowpanes, greedily drinking in every detail and committing it to memory. In the window, someone had made a display of geographical titles\u2014the travel memoirs of wealthy gentlemen, mostly. In the center lay an atlas, open to a tinted map of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>She noted the careful manner in which the unbound volumes were arranged on shelves. The titles were impossible to make out from this distance. Were they sorted alphabetically by title or by author? Or grouped by subject, perhaps? Maybe they were organized by some other method entirely.</p><p>Pauline cast a glance at the duchess. She was still wholly occupied with the parcels.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she told the footman. \u201cThat one must go on top. I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s the largest. It mustn\u2019t be crushed.\u201d</p><p>A pair of ladies emerged from the bookshop, turning to walk down the street in the other direction. Pauline peered through the window again. She saw no other customers within. After scribbling a few lines in a ledger, the shopkeeper disappeared into a back storeroom.</p><p>Her curiosity got the better of her common sense. While the duchess saw to the parcels, Pauline opened the door of the bookshop and ducked inside. She would only be a moment.</p><p>Oh, but she could have lingered for weeks.</p><p>The most glorious smell met her as she entered the establishment. Ink and paste and leather and crisp new parchment\u2014all tinged with just the right amount of mustiness. It was the perfect blend of familiar and new, like the spice-laced comfort of walking into Mr. Fosbury\u2019s kitchen at Christmastime.</p><p>Beyond the display she could spy the shopkeeper\u2019s counter, with a slate of titles neatly labeled NEW PRINTINGS. Samples of various leather bindings were laid out for customers making a purchase\u2014black, green, red, dark blue, and a scrap of light fawn-hued calfskin as impractical as it was lovely.</p><p>She walked to a shelf and let her touch linger on the spine of a book. A poetry volume.</p><p>Pauline didn\u2019t have much in common with the ladies who visited Spindle Cove. But she shared their love of the printed word. It seemed any young woman at odds with her place in life\u2014be she a genteel lady or a serving girl\u2014might find a happier home within the pages of a book.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>The shopkeeper came out from the storeroom. When his sharp gaze fell on Pauline, she snatched her hand away from the poetry volume, cradling her fingers in her other hand as if they\u2019d been burnt.</p><p>The man eyed her with suspicion. \u201cWhat do you want, girl? If you\u2019re selling pies or oranges, come \u2019round the back way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I . . . I\u2019m not sellin\u2019 anythin\u2019.\u201d The broadness of her accent pained her own ears. Never mind the new frock\u2014she was instantly given away. \u201cAnything,\u201d she repeated, making certain to attach the G sound this time. \u201cI only wanted a look at the books.\u201d</p><p>The shopkeeper snorted. \u201cIf you\u2019re wanting horrid novels, you can find them down in Leadenhall. I don\u2019t permit girls to stand about gawping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m companion to the Duchess of Halford. She\u2019s waiting for me just outside.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, truly.\u201d The man laughed. \u201cI suppose the Queen of Sheba had other plans today. Now out, before I chase you off with the broom. This isn\u2019t the place for you.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move. His words threw her back to an old, hurtful memory. A book ripped from her white-knuckled hands. Pain splitting her head, from one ear to the other. Harsh words adding insult to the ringing in her ears.</p><p>That\u2019s not for you, girl.</p> <p>She wanted to retaliate, stand up to the shopkeeper\u2014but how? She had nothing. No coin to spend. No cultured accent or knowledge to prove his assumptions wrong.</p><p>She was visited by a powerful, childish temptation to throw a book at the man, but that would be less dramatic than sugar\u2014not to mention, unkind to the book.</p><p>So she simply turned and left, cheeks hot and fingers shaking.</p><p>Someday, she promised herself, I will own my own shop filled with lovely books. And it will be a home to me, and to Daniela, and to anyone else who needs it. No one will ever be turned away.</p><p>Outside, the Halford coach now resembled a four-layer cake, with boxes and parcels tied to every available surface.</p> <p>The duchess waved at her from inside the carriage. \u201cCome along, then.\u201d</p><p>Pauline obeyed. She\u2019d learned one thing from her quick survey inside the bookshop. She\u2019d seen prices scribbled on the slates, and now she knew for certain . . .</p><p>One thousand pounds could purchase a great many books.</p><p>It was time to set aside all thoughts of kisses, flutterings, and haunted dukes. She\u2019d been hired for one purpose\u2014to be a disaster\u2014and she simply couldn\u2019t fail.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Four petticoats.</p> <p>Pauline had never dreamed that one woman could wear four petticoats. All at once, no less.</p><p>As she stared at her reflection in the mirror, she decided it would be more truthful to say the petticoats were wearing her. Her ivory silk skirts flared so dramatically, she didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d fit through the doorway. She\u2019d consider herself lucky if she survived the evening without plowing down any dogs or small children.</p><p>God help her if she needed to relieve herself.</p><p>As Fleur placed the final touches on her hair, Pauline stared wistfully at a cup of tea. It was going to be a long, thirsty evening.</p><p>\u201cListen to me closely,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal at stake tonight.\u201d</p><p>Pauline nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to win society\u2019s admiration, everyone must see you. No hiding in the corners or ducking behind the potted palms.\u201d</p><p>Note: Make bosom friends with potted palms.</p> <p>\u201cBut though it\u2019s imperative to be seen, it\u2019s less important to be heard. Talk with the ladies, but not too much. That goes double for the gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>Which part? The talking, or the not too much?</p><p>\u201cTonight, you\u2019ll appear before the cream of London society. Let them see you as a lovely young lady with a certain freshness about her. A translucent petal, veiled in mystery. Someone they\u2019re dying to claim they\u2019ve met, but don\u2019t truly know at all. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. Clear as pitch.</p><p>In the corridor, her progress was slow. She wasn\u2019t accustomed to walking in such heavy skirts, nor in heeled slippers. Her gait resembled that of a wobbly foal. Perhaps a wobbly foal drunk on cider mash.</p><p>As they approached the staircase, her slipper heel snagged on the fringe of the carpet, nearly sending her sprawling. Pauline caught herself on a side table and endured several seconds of sheer agony as a porcelain shepherdess wavered back and forth on her base, deciding whether or not to fall.</p><p>\u201cMiss Simms.\u201d Several paces ahead, the duchess whirled about to face her. \u201cHave you forgotten how to walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know how to walk.\u201d She growled at the smiling shepherdess. \u201cJust not dressed in all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, stand tall.\u201d</p><p>Pauline obeyed, even though she felt like kicking off the nefarious shoes and shrinking back to her bedchamber.</p><p>\u201cStop thinking about your feet. Imagine there\u2019s a string attached to your navel,\u201d the duchess advised. \u201cNow let it pull you forward.\u201d</p><p>Amazing.</p><p>Simple as it sounded, the duchess\u2019s suggestion worked. When Pauline concentrated on her center, all the other parts fell into place. Her feet moved one in front of the other, and her shoulders just naturally pulled back. She felt taller, more assured. Floating.</p><p>As they neared the grand staircase, she felt an anxious twist in her belly. Her mind\u2019s eye supplied a vision\u2014the silliest of fancies, no doubt\u2014that the duke would be standing at the bottom of the stairs, waiting for them.</p><p>Waiting for her.</p><p>Oh, she hoped he would be there. She hoped he\u2019d look up and see her\u2014and then watch, enraptured, as she smoothly descended every last one of the two dozen steps like a silken mist. When she reached the bottom of the stairs, he\u2019d take her hand and kiss it with those strong, passionate lips.</p><p>And he\u2019d whisper just one hushed, reverent word:</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>It was a ridiculous fantasy. Completely absurd. And she wanted it to happen so desperately, she could scarcely breathe. After that encounter with the shopkeeper earlier, she could have used a fresh supply of confidence.</p><p>She reached the top of the staircase.</p><p>The duke wasn\u2019t there at all. So he didn\u2019t watch her stumbling down the two dozen stairs, and when she finally made her unceremonious landing, there were no kisses or compliments to be had.</p><p>They\u2019d been waiting, stuffed into the coach\u2014giant skirts and all\u2014for a solid ten minutes before he finally joined them.</p><p>\u201cReally, Griff,\u201d the duchess said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t apologize. \u201cI had a letter to finish.\u201d</p><p>He cast a quick glance at Pauline, then looked away.</p><p>So much for her fantasies of enrapturing him with her radiant beauty. In the darkness of the carriage, with her hair pulled back so severely and all these petticoats wadded about her, she probably looked like a barn mouse who\u2019d drowned in a dish of meringue.</p><p>Two minutes after departing from Halford House, the carriage rolled to a halt again.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d the duchess said.</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Pauline asked. \u201cWe might have walked.\u201d</p><p>The duchess only gave her a look, but Pauline didn\u2019t need it translated. Duchesses do not walk.</p><p>When they alighted from the carriage, they joined a small crowd of fashionable people spilling out the front door of the grand house.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d she whispered to the duke, trying to see around the horde of well-dressed people. \u201cWhy are we standing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a crush. We\u2019re all waiting to enter the ballroom and be introduced by the majordomo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to announce me by name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the duke replied.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . I\u2019ve been serving ladies in Spindle Cove for the past several years. They all know my name. What if any of them are here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimms is a common name. Sussex is a large place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have eyes as well as ears. What if someone recognizes me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the truth would be out, the game would be up, and we\u2019d all have a jolly laugh at my mother\u2019s expense.\u201d He straightened his coat. \u201cBut truly, as you are tonight? No one will recognize you.\u201d</p><p>He sized her up with a leisurely, possessive sweep of dark eyes. And for the first time all evening, Pauline had an unhurried, well-lit look at him.</p><p>Good heavens.</p><p>They were well into the third day of their acquaintance. Could this truly be the first time she\u2019d seen him freshly bathed, shaven, and properly dressed?</p><p>Apparently so. And one wouldn\u2019t think basic grooming could add so much to his masculine allure, but it did. It did. His black tailcoat and bone-colored breeches fit him like skin, hugging every contour of his broad shoulders and muscled thighs. The little touches of elegance\u2014his smooth-shaven jaw, tamed hair, and exquisite sculpture of a cravat\u2014only served as contrast to the raw strength ranging beneath the refinement.</p><p>He looked better than ever. And he smelled . . . oh, he smelled like an arousing, fevered dream. As he drew closer, she breathed him in. That intoxicating musky cologne\u2014his valet must use it when pressing his shirts\u2014mingled with the scents of soap and clean male skin.</p><p>Most affecting of all was the glint of hunger in his gaze as he looked her over. As though he were a beast sizing up his prey. Judging the softest joint into which to sink his teeth.</p><p>Had he eaten anything today? she suddenly\u2014absurdly\u2014wondered. But she stopped herself from asking aloud. It seemed a very caretaking thing to inquire, and she wasn\u2019t here to care for him. No matter how tempting it was.</p><p>Remember that, Pauline.</p><p>\u201cHow is your arm?\u201d she took the chance to whisper. She couldn\u2019t help caring that little bit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were bleeding. I saw it.\u201d</p><p>He dismissed her words with a brisk wave of his hand. \u201cNever mind my arm, Simms. We need to talk about your breasts.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks went hot as coals. She looked around to make sure no one had overheard.</p><p>\u201cThey seem to have swollen to twice their proper size.\u201d He appraised them frankly. \u201cI should call for a doctor. That can\u2019t be healthy.\u201d</p><p>Pauline\u2019s face suffused with heat. \u201cYou know very well it\u2019s only a corset. I\u2019m in perfect health.\u201d</p><p>Except for these pesky flutterings all through her chest. And the sudden trouble breathing in his presence.</p><p>He clucked his tongue. \u201cYour conduct had better be deplorable.\u201d</p><p>No difficulty there.</p><p>When they at last entered the fine house, a waiting footman offered glasses of ratafia from a tray. Pauline revised her resolution not to imbibe any liquids this evening. She accepted one and downed a hasty swallow.</p><p>That hasty swallow kicked her in the ribs. Someone had liberally seasoned the punch with brandy.</p><p>\u201cCor,\u201d she sputtered, choking on the strong aftertaste.</p><p>The room hushed. All through the entrance hall fashionably dressed people turned to stare.</p><p>\u201cCorinthian,\u201d the duchess filled in, craning her neck to stare at the ceiling above. \u201cI do believe you\u2019re right, Miss Simms. These columns are Corinthian.\u201d</p><p>Conversation slowly returned to normal, but Pauline didn\u2019t think anyone was fooled.</p><p>A well-dressed lady in middle years approached, flanked by two younger copies of herself. Daughters, obviously. All three women eyed the duke with rapacious interest before settling their keen gazes on Pauline.</p><p>\u201cYour graces,\u201d the matron said. \u201cSuch a delight to see you this evening. Pray tell, who is your charming new friend?\u201d</p><p>The duchess answered. \u201cMiss Simms, this is Lady Eugenia Haughfell and her daughters.\u201d</p><p>Pauline curtsied. \u201cDelighted, Lady Haughfell. Misses Haughfell.\u201d</p><p>Just those few words, and she was given away. The two fashionable daughters tittered with laughter behind their fans. If they would laugh to her face, she could only imagine what they\u2019d say when her back was turned.</p><p>\u201cWherever did you come from, Miss Simms?\u201d their mother asked.</p><p>\u201cSussex, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who are your people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father owns land,\u201d the duchess cut in. \u201cHer parents have been unable to send her to Town, so I\u2019ve invited her for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your grace.\u201d Lady Haughfell twisted her lips at Pauline. \u201cYou do have such a heart for charity.\u201d</p><p>She and her daughters drifted away on a wave of giggles, leaving Pauline to feel awash in their scorn.</p><p>\u201cHaughfell, girl,\u201d the duchess chided, pulling her aside. \u201cTheir family name is Haughfell.\u201d</p><p>Pauline wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cringing, she searched the woman out in the crowd. Judging by her ladyship\u2019s curled lip and the haughty stare she sent in her direction, Pauline wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d misspoken. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d the duke said. \u201cTo my ear it sounded more like Lady Offal. Either way, it was apt. The whole family is vile, and it\u2019s high time someone said it to their faces.\u201d He took the ratafia from Pauline\u2019s hand and downed it in a single swallow. \u201cDo you know, I just might enjoy this evening.\u201d</p><p>His evident pleasure at her missteps didn\u2019t sit as well with her as it should. Pauline tried to ignore the stab to her pride. Satisfying her employer was a good thing. This was what she\u2019d signed on for\u2014a practical girl\u2019s fairy tale. No magical transformation. No sweeping romance. Just hard work, a job well done, and the shop of her dreams in reward.</p><p>So why did she keep hoping for something more?</p> <p>Perhaps the ratafia was already muddling her brain.</p><p>Her discomfort only increased as they moved forward and she caught a glimpse of the elegant ballroom. The ceiling was supported by a great many columns\u2014vast pillars of white, soaring high overhead. She\u2019d never seen so many candles burning in one place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready for this,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re not,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He offered his arm, and she threaded her gloved hand through the crook of his elbow.</p> <p>The majordomo announced their party from the head of the stair. \u201cHis Grace, the Duke of Halford. Her Grace, the Duchess of Halford. Miss Simms, of Sussex.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the crowded ballroom turned their way. Pauline felt countless curious eyes on her as they descended the short flight of stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d she murmured through a tight smile.</p><p>\u201cWe make a casual circuit of the room,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we part ways for the rest of the evening. You\u2019ll stay with my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>As they completed their circle of the ballroom, she briefly closed her eyes and thought of lining those apothecary shelves with lovely new books. Sharing dishes of blancmange with Daniela. Counting the duke\u2019s one thousand pounds.</p><p>In her distraction, she failed to note a streak of melted wax on the floor. Her foot slid straight out from under her.</p><p>Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.</p><p>The duke\u2019s arm snapped tight, drawing her close and steadying her on her feet. She could tell he\u2019d made the motion without even thinking. Those quick reflexes again.</p><p>She recovered herself and they drew to a stop near the punch bowl. The duchess drifted away, striking up a conversation with a woman wearing a turban festooned with ostrich plumes. She motioned for Pauline to follow her.</p><p>\u201cYour grace,\u201d she whispered to Griff. \u201cYou really must release my arm now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be noble now, of all times. Yes, it\u2019s terrifying to face all these strangers. I\u2019m sure the rest of the evening will be a study in humiliation. But it\u2019s what I signed on for this week. Let me to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI . . . can\u2019t.\u201d He demonstrated, pulling away from her just a few inches until a taut cord of tension drew him back. \u201cMy button is caught.\u201d</p><p>Pauline tried moving away from him but encountered the same resistance. Keeping one eye on the curious crowd, she slanted a look at the place where his sleeve met her side.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>The gown had been altered so hastily, the seamstresses must have missed a gap in the seam. When he\u2019d steadied her just now, his cuff button snagged a loose thread. It was thoroughly tangled. No telling how many times it had twisted around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get loose,\u201d he said smoothly, putting a punch cup in her free hand and filling it, just to give them both something to do. \u201cNever fear. I\u2019ve made a career of avoiding entanglements with women.\u201d</p><p>He tried again, grasping his sleeve with his free hand and giving it a firm yank. He didn\u2019t manage to free himself, but Pauline sensed the treacherous pop of a stitch giving way. Her punch sloshed from the silver cup back into the bowl.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She clutched his arm, holding it still. \u201cYou\u2019ll rip the whole seam. My gown will fall apart.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her then, and gave her an intense, thoughtful look.</p><p>No. He wouldn\u2019t actually do it.</p><p>Pauline glanced around the ballroom. She and the duke had been standing here in quiet, linked-arm conversation for a solid minute now, and people were noticing. Everyone was watching them\u2014especially the ladies. Some looked envious, as though they wished to be the woman on Griff\u2019s arm. Yet more of them wore possessive expressions\u2014as though they\u2019d once been the woman in his bed.</p><p>No matter which group they belonged to, she was certain of one thing. They\u2019d love nothing more than to see her brought low.</p><p>She knew humiliation was the aim of the evening, but that would be . . .</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I rip a woman\u2019s clothes off, I almost always prefer to do it in private.\u201d He tilted his head toward a set of doors across the ballroom. \u201cWe\u2019ll make for the gardens and sort this out.\u201d</p><p>Arm linked tight with Pauline\u2019s, he began leading her back across the room they\u2019d just traversed. However, this time they couldn\u2019t make their way unimpeded. Other guests kept slowing their progress, drawing the duke aside for a word of greeting or two.</p><p>Or three or four or five.</p><p>Pauline limited herself to monosyllabic answers and polite, shy smiles, not wanting to prolong conversation. What was most maddening, the less she spoke or interacted, the more favorably the ladies and gentlemen seemed to respond.</p><p>\u201cYou really must cease that,\u201d Griff said, drawing her away from a nattering pair of sisters.</p><p>\u201cCease what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing demure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to be brief,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cYes, but that\u2019s where you\u2019ve gone wrong. There\u2019s nothing like silence to ingratiate yourself with self-important people. It leaves them so much space to discuss themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalford!\u201d A ruddy-faced gentleman appeared out of nowhere, stopping them in their tracks.</p><p>Good heavens. How was it possible they\u2019d made so little progress? Those doors to the garden were still some twenty yards away.</p><p>The man pumped Griff\u2019s free arm vigorously. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you for ages, old devil. Rumor had it you\u2019d finally succumbed to the pox.\u201d He shot a toothy smile in Pauline\u2019s direction. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Simms, of Sussex. She\u2019s in Town as my mother\u2019s guest. Miss Simms, this is Mr. Frederick Martin.\u201d</p><p>The gentleman bowed and gave Griff a conspiratorial wink. \u201cRather possessive of her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s new in London. Just getting her feet.\u201d</p><p>In the corner, the small orchestra struck up the first strains of a waltz.</p><p>\u201cSurely you\u2019ll allow me to steal her for one dance.\u201d Martin extended a white-gloved hand and bowed over it. \u201cMiss Simms, may I have the pleasure?\u201d</p><p>Panic jumped in Pauline\u2019s chest. \u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalford won\u2019t mind. When it comes to the ladies, he\u2019s always generous.\u201d</p><p>Pauline wasn\u2019t sure what the man meant by that remark, but she was certain she didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dancing with you.\u201d The duke gave a heavy sigh. He sounded as though even he couldn\u2019t believe the words he was about to speak. \u201cShe\u2019s promised this dance to me.\u201d</p><p>With that, he pulled her away from Mr. Frederick Martin and led her onto the dance floor.</p><p>Pauline tried not to let fear show on her face. \u201cWhat? Wait. I don\u2019t even know how to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust follow my lead. It\u2019s the only way to make a quick escape.\u201d</p><p>They waltzed their way around the ballroom. Because of the way his sleeve was caught on her gown, Griff had to hold his arm jutting out like a chicken wing. Without his hand on her back, he couldn\u2019t lead her properly. Pauline was left to chase him across the dance floor in tiny, tiptoeing steps.</p><p>At last they reached the doors to the garden.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that waltz before,\u201d an elderly matron remarked.</p><p>\u201cA Hungarian variation, madam.\u201d He held open the door for Pauline. \u201cAll the rage in Vienna.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop giggling as they stumbled into the garden. \u201cThat was resourceful. I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow give me my freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cGet me loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act as though this is my fault. It\u2019s your button. And it only snagged because you were too protective. If you\u2019d allowed me to stumble a bit, we could have been on our way home by now.\u201d</p><p>She reached between them with her free arm, but quickly realized the situation could only be adequately inspected if her fingers were bare.</p><p>She thrust her hand out to him. \u201cMy glove. Help me off with it.\u201d</p><p>He loosed the ribbon garter at her elbow first, then set to work on the dozen tiny buttons stretching from her elbow to her wrist. It had taken ten minutes of struggling with fingers and teeth to close them earlier that evening.</p><p>He had them undone in ten seconds.</p><p>She lifted a brow. \u201cSomething tells me you\u2019ve done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA time or two.\u201d</p><p>Or a thousand, she supposed.</p><p>He took her wrist, lifted her hand to his mouth, and caught the middle finger of her glove with his teeth. Then he slowly pulled.</p><p>The motion was wickedly sensual. Entrancing, even. When her hand slid free, she had no idea what to do with it.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes.\u201d She felt between them, exploring the place where his button met her bodice seam. It seemed hopelessly twisted, by touch. Her attempts to make a visual inspection were thwarted\u2014her artificially inflated bosom kept getting in the way.</p><p>\u201cI could see it better if not for this ridiculous corset,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at removing those, too.\u201d</p><p>Pauline threw him a chastening look but he didn\u2019t catch it. He was too busy glazing her breasts with his heated stare.</p><p>\u201cAhem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m a man. We get distracted.\u201d</p><p>She flushed, pleased despite all her attempts not to be. Men might be distractible by nature, but they were hardly ever distracted by her.</p><p>\u201cFortunately,\u201d she said, \u201cI still have a few powers of concentration left. You should remove your coat. Then you\u2019d have both hands free. And if we still can\u2019t work the button loose, I can wait here while you go in search of scissors or a blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were clever.\u201d</p><p>He tried shrugging his free arm out of his coat but made little progress. It was so tightly fitted, and his arms weren\u2019t lean.</p><p>\u201cI need my valet for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me play valet. I am a servant, after all.\u201d</p><p>He extended his wrist to her. \u201cHold the cuff.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, and they began their second absurd dance of the evening: The duke flailing his arm while she attempted to hold the sleeve steady\u2014and make sure that his other cuff didn\u2019t rip free and destroy her bodice. Every time he tugged on his sleeve, he just pulled Pauline forward. They ended up pivoting in a tight, useless circle. If their first waltz was a Hungarian variation, this one must hail from the moon.</p><p>He growled. \u201cI should see about switching to a substandard tailor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if I tried to work it loose this way.\u201d</p><p>Turning to face him as best she could, she slid her hand under his lapel, skimming over the silk front of his waistcoat and the firm wall of muscle beneath. Her heart stuttered when she brushed something that felt distressingly nipplelike\u2014but she proceeded undaunted, working her hand up to his shoulder in an attempt to cleave the garment from his body.</p><p>\u201cLift your arm a bit.\u201d</p><p>He flinched, as if ticklish.</p><p>\u201cBe still. I\u2019m good at this, remember?\u201d By twisting her arm and wriggling her fingers, she managed to ease her fingers higher. \u201cNo one can reach as high as I can.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood God, Simms. My arm is not a foal to be birthed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost there.\u201d She slid her fingers over the crest of his shoulder and partway along his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cSimms.\u201d</p> <p>She looked up. They were standing mere inches apart. His lips were very, very close to hers.</p><p>Her fingers involuntarily flexed, digging into his biceps. He winced.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sucked in her breath, apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019d forgotten your wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my arm, Simms. It\u2019s everything. We\u2019re alone in the garden while a ball goes on. I can\u2019t stop staring at your breasts, and your hand is . . . violating my topcoat. It is time to face hard truths. As attempts at avoiding entanglement go, this one isn\u2019t working. At all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . but it could be worse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what made her say it. The words just came from her lips. \u201cYou could be kissing me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cKissing you,\u201d Griff echoed. He tried to make it sound as though the words were some outlandish sentiment spoken in a foreign, unfamiliar tongue\u2014and not the exact same thought he\u2019d been harboring.</p><p>She was so close and so warm. They were entangled, and her deft, impertinent hands were all over him\u2014reminding him just how long it had been since he\u2019d been touched, stroked, fussed over. Given a damn about.</p><p>The hell of it was, none of her attentions were soothing in the least. Only provoking, arousing. Inflaming the hurt not only in his slashed arm, but in those raw, hollowed-out chambers of his heart.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he told her. \u201cKissing is the one thing that would undoubtedly make this moment worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord.\u201d She leaned forward until her brow met his chest. Then she lifted her head slightly. Then let it fall forward again. After a few more repetitions, he understood the meaning behind this strange gesture.</p><p>His chest was the brick wall, and she was bashing her head against it.</p><p>Thunk. Thunk. Thunk.</p><p>\u201cThis is terrible,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI can\u2019t fail at this, too. I just can\u2019t. My life before this was bad enough. What kind of hapless, hopeless person fails at failing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not following you.\u201d</p><p>She snuffled a little, using his pocket square to wipe her nose\u2014without actually easing it from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cAt home,\u201d she said, \u201cmy sister and I, we\u2019re always those Simms girls who mean well. They say that because we can\u2019t do anything right.\u201d</p> <p>Her breasts were now pressed against his chest, soft and springy. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other. Didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no stranger to humiliation,\u201d she went on. \u201cThe day you came into the Bull and Blossom, I\u2019d been having the worst morning of my life. Everything went wrong. And I agreed to come to London with you because this was my chance. Surely, I thought, social disaster is the one thing I can do right. I\u2019m expert at it.\u201d Her voice tweaked. \u201cBut just look at this. I can\u2019t even succeed at failure.\u201d</p><p>She wriggled the hand trapped deep in his sleeve. Those breasts trapped against his chest now shimmied in a little dance.</p><p>He took a deep breath. He had to take control of this situation, fast\u2014or he would lose his grip entirely. \u201cListen, Simms. Let\u2019s just remain calm.\u201d</p><p>He sent a mental message downward: That goes for you, too.</p><p>\u201cFirst, extricate your hand from my sleeve.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, and he suffered all the same torture in reverse as her fingers dragged and wrestled over his shoulder, then his chest. But once it was done, he could step back, put some distance between them. They were only tangled in one place.</p><p>He nodded toward a nearby bench. \u201cNow sit. Give me a moment, and I\u2019ll have this sorted.\u201d</p><p>He worked his own gloves free, then set about exploring the connection between his sleeve and her side. He found the place where his button had snagged. By now the cursed thing had twisted several times. He turned it this way and that, looking for the slack, resisting the urge to rush. Haste would only make it worse. This was a task that required patience.</p><p>Patience, and extreme fortitude.</p><p>God, what she did to him. Her brandy-colored hair made him yearn for a drink. He breathed deeply instead. A mistake. She smelled of French-milled soap and dusting powder and crisp, new linen. Now he wanted, quite desperately, to taste her bare skin. To run his tongue down that delicate slope of her neck, all the way to the graceful curve of her shoulder.</p><p>Then lower . . .</p><p>Lower, lower, lower.</p><p>\u201cI had a dozen ways to be a disaster this evening,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019d thought them all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating far more than is ladylike, to start. Gentlemen despise indulgence in a lady.\u201d</p><p>This was news to Griff. \u201cWe do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d She gave him an incredulous look. \u201cSecondly, I was going to express far too many opinions. A lady never airs her opinions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be one of my mother\u2019s lessons. That woman never formed an opinion she didn\u2019t share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t learn it from your mother. I read it in a book.\u201d Her voice took on an affected tone. \u201c \u2018Save for unsightly mustaches, there are few things gentlemen find less appealing in a lady than a political opinion.\u2019 Well, I couldn\u2019t grow any whiskers. But I\u2019m prepared to make six outrageous statements about the Corn Laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Corn Laws?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it improper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re greatly overestimating a man\u2019s ability to heed conversation about the Corn Laws while confronted with a sight like this.\u201d</p><p>He let his gaze dip to her bosom, where it had been wanting to stray all night. Two soft, pale mounds pressed to the border of her neckline. Like twin pillows. His attention bounced back and forth between them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said in a playful whisper. \u201cI can\u2019t stop looking at them either. This corset is a feat of engineering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s sorcery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about the illusion part. Here.\u201d She took his hand and brought it to her breast.</p><p>Griff froze, lust rocketing through him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s cotton batting in the corset,\u201d she said. \u201cCan\u2019t you feel it?\u201d</p><p>She kept her hand over his, molding his fingers around the ample swell of fabric and the soft flesh beneath.</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cYes. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>He could also feel her. Warm and supple and enticing.</p><p>\u201cSee? It\u2019s not real. So there\u2019s another strike against me.\u201d She adopted that strange tone of voice again. \u201cA young lady who employs artifice to catch a gentleman\u2019s eye will never secure his admiration.\u201d</p><p>With profound reluctance, he let his hand slip from her breast. \u201cBelieve me. Right now, I only wish you could decrease my admiration. My admiration is currently rather . . . large.\u201d</p><p>She looked him in the eye and blurted out, \u201cI\u2019m not a virgin.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Just like that, he went fully erect, with a swiftness that rivaled swordplay. Upon reflection, he wasn\u2019t sure he could have drawn an actual blade that quickly. Were he wearing a metal codpiece, his cock would have met it with an audible clang.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t help,\u201d he told her. \u201cWhat makes you think that will help? I\u2019m not a virgin, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing. I was hoping to hear something like, \u2018I have a creeping skin disease.\u2019 Or, \u2018I hoot like a barn owl when I reach orgasm.\u2019 Those would be deterrents. I\u2019m not sure the second is strong enough, actually. Curiosity might win out over trepidation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut noblemen don\u2019t want a woman who\u2019s lost her virtue. Mrs. Worthington was very clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this rabidly ill-informed person you keep quoting? Mrs. Who-ington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wrote an etiquette book. Haven\u2019t you heard of it? Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom for Young Ladies. That book is how I know exactly what a proper young lady should\u2014and shouldn\u2019t\u2014do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid my mother give you that?\u201d The title sounded vaguely familiar, but he didn\u2019t think such a book could be from his library.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I\u2019ve been reading it for years. There are copies of it all over Spindle Cove. Miss Finch\u2014she\u2019s Lady Rycliff now\u2014wanted to remove every copy from circulation. There are hundreds of them in the village, just heaped everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Griff frowned, remembering that first afternoon in the village. \u201cRight. I remember it now. They had stacks of them. And they were ripping them apart to make tea trays.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThey try to find uses for them. It used to be powder cartridges for the militia, but since the war\u2019s over, they\u2019ve moved on to tea trays.\u201d</p><p>The logic in this eluded Griff, but he didn\u2019t want to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow,\u201d she went on, \u201ca few years ago I took a copy home from the tavern. I knew they wouldn\u2019t miss it, and I\u2019d never had a proper book of my own before. I wanted to see what it was that had the ladies so angry. A good half of the book is twaddle, I\u2019ll grant them. But the rest is just practical advice. Recipes for orange flower water. How to write invitations to parties and sew your own silk gloves. Suggestions for polite dinner conversation. Reading that book was like peering through a window onto a different world, until . . .\u201d She dropped her gaze. \u201c . . . until my father slammed it shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe found the book. I caught him staring at it. He can\u2019t read much, you know. But still, he stared at that title for the longest time. He didn\u2019t have to read the words to understand what it meant. It meant I wanted something more.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up, she plucked a low-hanging leaf and twirled it between her fingertips. \u201cAll my life, he\u2019d made it no secret that he was disappointed in me. He\u2019d wanted a boy to help with the farm, and he never hid the fact that he viewed me as useless. But when he found that book . . . For the first time, he was seeing it went both ways. That I might not be happy with the life he\u2019d given me. Oh, it made him so angry.\u201d</p><p>Griff was becoming rather furious himself. Not with her. Never her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe picked up that book in one hand.\u201d She held the leaf in her fingertips and regarded it. \u201cSaid, \u2018That\u2019s not for you, girl.\u2019 And then he struck me with it, right across the face.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll kill him.</p><p>The intent roared to life in Griff\u2019s chest before his mind could even conceive the words. He was harboring elaborate fantasies of finding a horse and a blade, then haring down to Sussex to have a very short exchange with Amos Simms. One that began with \u201cYou rat-faced bastard\u201d and ended with blood.</p><p>He was calculating just how long it would take, and how much daylight he\u2019d have when he arrived. Whether he\u2019d permit the man to beg for mercy, or skip straight to\u2014</p><p>\u201cI was nineteen years old,\u201d she said.</p><p>He closed his eyes and breathed deep, forcing himself to abandon his thoughts of the far-off villain who deserved to be run through. He should concentrate on the woman who needed him, here and now.</p><p>\u201cNineteen,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAlready a woman grown. I helped with the farm and earned wages for the family. And he struck me across the face like a child, just for wanting to improve myself. To learn.\u201d She let the leaf twirl to the ground. \u201cThen he threw the book in the fire.\u201d</p><p>Griff cursed, sliding closer on the bench. He\u2019d given up on disentangling his button for the moment. He didn\u2019t give a damn about the people inside, what they might think or conclude. For now, his only goal in this garden\u2014in this life, perhaps\u2014was to guard her. And to make her feel safe, which he suspected would be the more difficult task. Too many people had failed her that way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter.\u201d Her chin lifted bravely. \u201cI got another copy. And that time, I hid it somewhere else. When that book disappeared, I got another. Over and over again, until I found the way to outsmart him for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>A little smile curved her lips. \u201cI learnt it by heart. Page by page, cover to cover. I committed the entire thing to memory. He couldn\u2019t beat that out of me, now could he?\u201d</p> <p>With a single fingertip, he tilted her face to his. Her eyes sparkled with the reflected torchlight. Brave and beautiful.</p><p>He marveled at the wild kaleidoscope of emotions she inspired in him. Violence, admiration, skin-scorching desire. The tenderness welling in his heart was almost too much to bear. No woman made him feel these things. Not all of them at once.</p><p>He cupped her chin in his hand and stroked the lovely cheek that had received such vile treatment. \u201cYou are never going back to that man again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have my very own circulating library, stocked with every book a proper young lady should never read.\u201d She sent a look toward the house. \u201cJust as soon as I can get back into that ballroom and earn it.\u201d</p><p>He studied her delicate profile, amazed by the strength and determination writ there. She couldn\u2019t know how remarkable she was.</p> <p>Perhaps . . .</p><p>Oh, damn. Perhaps he ought to tell her. Gather her close, turn her face to his. Give her the truth.</p><p>You\u2019re lovely. You\u2019re clever. You\u2019re turning me inside out, and I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t want to care for you. I\u2019ve suffered enough over females who crawled inside my heart and deserted it after one week. But if I don\u2019t say these words right now, I\u2019m the lowest of the low. So here it is. You\u2019re remarkable.</p><p>\u201cYour stickpin,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His mind reeled. It was as if wild horses had been dragging his thoughts to Blitherington, Clodpateshire\u2014and they\u2019d stopped just shy of a dizzying cliff.</p><p>\u201cYour stickpin.\u201d She stared hopefully at the diamond stud embedded in his cravat. \u201cIt\u2019s the answer. We can use it to cut the threads.\u201d</p> <p>Right. She was too clever by half.</p><p>Her fingers flew to his neck cloth and she started tugging at the diamond stud. \u201cHow does it come apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a clasp.\u201d He dug under the folds of his cravat to find it. \u201cHere. I\u2019ll hold the bottom and you take the top.\u201d</p><p>She gripped the stickpin in her fingertips and began to twist it loose.</p><p>\u201cCareful there,\u201d he said. \u201cGo slowly.\u201d</p><p>The way this week was going, it would be just his luck that she\u2019d rip the pin free, pitch forward on the bench, and bury the sharp end in one of his vital arteries.</p><p>\u201cAlmost have it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He adored the way her delicate eyebrows knit in concentration, the way her bottom lip folded under her teeth. Oh, this was bad.</p> <p>At last the golden pin popped free.</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d She held it up between them, eyes shining with triumph\u2014as though it were the sword in the stone she\u2019d loosed, or the key to Aladdin\u2019s cave. Her smile could have lit the night sky. \u201cWe did it.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that just his luck. She\u2019d missed his vital arteries\u2014and plunged the cursed thing straight into his heart.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she said, teasing his button loose. \u201cOur bargain is rescued. We\u2019re free of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>He drew her close and took her mouth in a kiss. He sank into her, reassuring himself that the taste of her remained the same despite this new, elegant attire. That though the curves of her body might be squeezed and shaped for public display, he knew how they felt. Supple, warm, strong and alive. He kissed her hungrily, relentlessly, savoring her natural ripe-berry taste and the intoxicating whisper of brandy on her lips. Pressing her further and faster than any decent man would\u2014because he expected at any moment she\u2019d push him away.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. She just kissed him back, drawing him closer with a tilt of her head and a soft, dreamy sigh. So generous, so achingly tender.</p><p>As he bent to kiss her neck, her fingers sifted through his hair, sending jolts of pleasure down his spine. Encouraged, he slid one hand to claim her breast. He needed to feel her, fill his grasp with her soft heat.</p><p>Instead, he got a handful of cotton batting.</p><p>\u201cDeuced corset,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked the corset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like this.\u201d He slid his thumb under her neckline. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>She sighed as he skimmed his touch lower, dipping to trace the curve of her slight, round breast. He found the tight knot of her nipple and rolled it back and forth.</p><p>When he claimed her mouth again, the shy sweep of her tongue . . . it rocked him in his boots. Again and again she caressed him. As though she were painting him with sweetness in languid strokes.</p><p>A low, feral growl of yearning rose in his chest. He wanted to thrust his hands under all this bothersome fabric, explore the precious silk of her skin. Feel her bared body pressed to his. Coax sounds of pleasure she\u2019d never made.</p><p>He wanted . . . more. Hours and days and nights of this, and not a moment of feeling alone.</p><p>But he knew that didn\u2019t work. Some of the loneliest moments in his life had been spent bodily tangled with somebody else. Perhaps she wasn\u2019t entirely innocent, but that didn\u2019t matter. He refused to drag this sweet, determined soul into depravity.</p><p>He pulled away from the kiss.</p><p>\u201cGriff . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done this.\u201d He withdrew his touch from her bodice and skimmed his lips over hers in a fleeting kiss. \u201cI know we agreed that this . . .\u201d He tilted his head and kissed her again, lingering. \u201c . . . shouldn\u2019t happen again. Because it\u2019s a very bad idea, this.\u201d</p><p>He gave her one last, firm peck.</p><p>She kept her eyes resolutely closed. Those long eyelashes lay like fans on her cheeks. \u201cWhat was it again, this thing we\u2019re not doing? Perhaps you could demonstrate one more time.\u201d</p><p>Sweet heaven. He wanted to demonstrate for hours, all over her body. That was the problem.</p><p>He kissed the tip of her nose, once. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes, and their brilliant green savaged him. \u201cYou are a ruthless tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an impertinent minx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She smiled and shrugged, unrepentant. \u201cThat is what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Damn it, it was. Apparently, after years of seducing every worldly, sophisticated woman in London, an impertinent minx of a serving girl was exactly what he wanted.</p><p>But Griff vowed to himself then and there . . .</p><p>This was one woman he would never have.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cLast night was perfection.\u201d</p><p>The duchess drizzled a precise spiral of honey atop her buttered toast. Pauline briefly wondered if the older woman had chosen the citrine pendant at her throat to match her breakfast.</p><p>But she pushed the query aside, thinking it best to work one puzzle at a time.</p><p>\u201cPerfection?\u201d she echoed. \u201cLast night? But it was terrible. I was terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy girl, we cannot argue with results.\u201d She waved a hand over a gilt-edged salver heaped with sealed envelopes. \u201cSo many invitations already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense. Think of gemstones. Some jewels are prized for their exquisite cut and polish. Others are coveted by collectors, even when riddled with flaws, simply because they are so very rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not rare in any way,\u201d Pauline objected. \u201cI\u2019m exactly the opposite. I\u2019m common.\u201d</p><p>The duchess made a contrary snort over her bite of toast. \u201cHe danced with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all of ten seconds. Perhaps fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was more than enough. You don\u2019t understand. My son never dances. It\u2019s been years since he\u2019s danced with any unmarried lady, for the exact purpose of avoiding this speculation.\u201d</p><p>Pauline sighed. \u201cBut . . . but he only danced with me to escape his bothersome friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of you disappeared into the gardens, and when you returned his cravat was mussed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had to remove his stickpin. The duke\u2019s button was caught on my seam, and he couldn\u2019t get loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know he couldn\u2019t get loose.\u201d The duchess teased a folded newspaper out from beneath the heap of envelopes. \u201cPrecisely as it\u2019s printed in the Prattler. \u2018The Duke of Halford, Snared at Last.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>Pauline cringed as she scanned the newspaper gossip column. Just as the duchess had said, it was filled with speculation about the duke and \u201cthe mysterious Miss Simms.\u201d</p><p>Any thrill of overnight fame was lost on her. She was consumed by the common girl\u2019s worst daily fear: that of losing her post.</p><p>If the duchess was this happy with the results of last night, Pauline knew one thing.</p><p>The duke would not be.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t blame her for this scandal sheet, could he? If the evening had ended in anything other than humiliation, it was all his fault. He was the one who\u2019d caught her when she slipped, tangling their clothing. He was the one who\u2019d danced her out into the garden.</p><p>He was the one who\u2019d kissed her. Touched her, so sweetly.</p><p>The duchess whisked the newspaper aside. \u201cWe\u2019ve made excellent progress, but there remains a fair bit of road ahead. And you have your elbows on the table.\u201d</p><p>Pauline removed them grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cThis morning, our task is accomplishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccomplishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next time you attend a social event, you\u2019ll stay longer than an hour. As is the case with all young gentlewomen in attendance, you may be called on to exhibit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExhibit?\u201d Pauline laughed.</p><p>Oh, this would be a joke. Her worries about accidentally succeeding in this duchess-training endeavor all melted that instant\u2014like so much butter scraped across her warm, evenly browned point of toast. No scorched bread in this house.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to make me an accomplished lady in one morning? That\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to find the natural talent you already possess. There must be one.\u201d</p><p>Pauline paused, toast halfway to her mouth. \u201cYour grace . . .\u201d</p><p>She set the toast aside, suddenly uneasy. The duchess thought she had a hidden talent. Her, Pauline Simms. It was so strange\u2014and rather wonderful\u2014to have someone who believed in her, even this small bit.</p><p>Though Spindle Cove was stocked with unconventional ladies, none of them had ever taken much time to know Pauline. Her own mother was a sad, defeated shadow of a woman. She\u2019d never had anyone like the duchess in her life\u2014a guiding feminine presence who not only believed she could be something better than a farm wife or serving girl, but demanded she try.</p><p>But the more she came to treasure the duchess\u2019s confidence in her, the more Pauline worried about how this week would end. She hated the idea of watching the older woman\u2019s dreams unravel.</p><p>She said, \u201cPlease believe me when I tell you, nothing remotely matrimonial is ever going to transpire between me and the duke. It just . . . won\u2019t happen. Nevertheless, your grace, I\u2019m starting to like you. You\u2019ve been kind to me in moments, and I know you have a good heart under all that phlegm. I don\u2019t want you to form lofty expectations, only to have your plans spoiled.\u201d</p><p>In response, the duchess only gave a slight smile. She lifted a spoon and tapped at her egg sitting in its enameled cup. A delicate lattice of cracks bloomed over the egg\u2019s smooth shell.</p><p>Tap, tap, tap.</p><p>Pauline reached out with her own spoon and gave the egg a good, hard crack. She didn\u2019t know how else to make the older woman listen.</p><p>\u201cYour grace, you must take me seriously. I\u2019m trying to tell you to give up your hopes of grandchildren\u2014at least, any mothered by me\u2014and you\u2019re calmly eating a boiled egg. Are you losing your hearing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot at all.

Drat. The duchess was right. She had said the words correctly. What was happening to her?</p><p>She knew the answer to that question.</p><p>Griff was happening to her. When the duke kissed her, her head spun, her knees melted . . . and her elocution improved. Limber tongues and all that.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d she mumbled into her palm.</p><p>The duchess gave a weak sigh and motioned to the servant for more tea. \u201cYour H\u2019s still need work.\u201d</p> <p>Griff woke up at the crack of . . . half-nine. Hours earlier than usual.</p><p>He\u2019d always been the sort of person who felt most himself at night, and in this last year he\u2019d become a veritable vampire. More often than not he went to bed as the sun came up and remained there until well past noon. But yesterday\u2019s debacle had made it clear to him he couldn\u2019t afford to doze though another day of his mother\u2019s scheming.</p><p>How had yesterday gone so wrong?</p><p>It had started with the frock. That damnable sweet, sheer, innocent white frock. She\u2019d turned his head, and the rest of the day had been one mistake piling atop the next.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t lost his concentration with Del, he wouldn\u2019t have been wounded. If he hadn\u2019t been wounded, he would have never agreed to attend that ball. If they hadn\u2019t attended the ball, he wouldn\u2019t have ended with her in that dark, fragrant garden, sliding his fingers over her tempting curves and contemplating acts of romantic lunacy.</p><p>The answer to this situation was plain.</p> <p>No new frocks.</p><p>No attractive ones, anyhow.</p><p>No more kisses, either. That was obvious.</p><p>And most important of all, no more surprises.</p><p>As he walked through the house in search of them, Griff passed an unusual amount of clutter. Strange debris littered every room\u2014all sorts of activities hastily abandoned. As though the house\u2019s occupants had recently fled an erupting volcano.</p><p>In the salon, he found various instruments of needlework strewn on the settee and table. In the morning room, an abandoned easel displayed a drippy mess of a watercolor. Nearby a few drawing pencils lay cruelly snapped in half.</p><p>He heard a faint melody, so he walked toward the music room. When he arrived, he found it empty of people\u2014but every instrument in the place, from harp to harpsichord, had been stripped of its Holland cloth, dusted, and attempted.</p><p>Where were the servants? Why weren\u2019t they putting these rooms back to rights?</p> <p>And he still heard that strange, slow melody. Like a drunken music box winding into a death spiral.</p><p>The tune ended. It was followed by an enthusiastic smattering of applause.</p><p>\u201cBrava, Miss Simms,\u201d he heard.</p><p>And then, from someone else, \u201cGive us another?\u201d</p><p>The melody began again.</p><p>With slow, quiet footfalls, Griff traced the sounds to the dining room. He eased open the door a fraction.</p><p>At the far end of the room, he spied Pauline Simms. She stood before about fifteen water goblets lined up on the table, each one filled with a different amount of water, and she was pinging them with two forks. He couldn\u2019t tell if they were pickle forks or oyster forks. And then he decided this absurd preoccupation with forks was why he didn\u2019t do mornings.</p><p>Anyhow, she was doling out a cheerful melody with these forks, as if each note were a bite of music.</p><p>No wonder the house was a shambles. All around her the assembled servants of Halford House stood looking on, rapt. Anticipating each musical morsel that fell from those precious little tines. None of them noticed Griff standing in the door.</p><p>The music was only part of the entertainment. As she worked, she pulled the most amusing faces. Delicate frowns of concentration, punctuated by disarming cringes when she struck a wrong note. When a lock of hair worked loose to dangle over her brow, she huffed a breath, blowing it away without skipping a beat.</p><p>She was working so very, very hard\u2014so very, very earnestly\u2014to create this display. It was absurd. Ridiculous. And utterly adorable.</p><p>Everyone in the room was enchanted, and Griff couldn\u2019t claim he was immune to her spell. She was enchanting.</p><p>When the last note faded, all the servants clapped.</p><p>\u201cThat was Handel, my girl,\u201d his mother said, beaming with pleasure. \u201cHow did you learn that piece?\u201d</p><p>Pauline shrugged. \u201cJust by listening to the village music tutor. She taught piano lessons in the Bull and Blossom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s natural musicality,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cYou could translate that ability to any of several proper instruments, with practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly? But, your grace, there\u2019s no time for prac . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as she looked up\u2014and saw Griff, standing in the doorway.</p><p>Their gazes tangled.</p><p>Without breaking eye contact, he could feel all the others in the room turning his way.</p><p>Griff knew he had a split-second decision to make. He was either going to be caught staring at Miss Simms, exposed for the enraptured, lusting fool he was, in front of his mother and all his servants\u2014or he could do what he did best: hide his every emotion behind the mask of an indifferent, entitled jackass.</p><p>Really, there was no choice.</p><p>Jackass it would be.</p><p>He began to applaud in slow, smug claps\u2014and continued long after the room had gone silent.</p><p>Long after the shy, endearing smile had fled her face.</p><p>He let one last, ringing clap echo through the sobered room. He brought out his most bored, condescending tone. \u201cThat . . . was . . . capital, Simms. You will certainly stand out from the debutante crowd.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head, looking flustered. \u201cJust an old trick I learnt at the tavern. Some nights are slow. The duchess asked after my musical talent, and this is the sum of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you juggle tankards, too? Fold table napkins into jousting cranes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . No.\u201d She set aside the forks.</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she muttered, rushing out the dining room\u2019s other door.</p><p>Griff stared at the empty space she\u2019d left. He hadn\u2019t expected her to take it quite that hard. She wanted to be a successful failure, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>Once she was gone, every footman and housemaid in the room turned in his direction. Their eyes shot beams of pure resentment.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Higgs cleared his throat in subtle rebuke.</p><p>Good God. He\u2019d lost them, their loyalty. Just like that.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Griff said. He ceased leaning on the doorjamb and drew to full ducal height. \u201cReally. I\u2019ve been your employer for years. In some cases, decades. Annual rises in pay, Christmas boxes, days off. Simms pings a fork on some goblets, and now you all side with her?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re servants. Stop standing about, and go . . . serve.\u201d</p><p>A dour parade of footmen and maids filed past him on their way out of the room, leaving Griff alone with his mother.</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, but he held up a palm.</p><p>\u201cI will do the talking,\u201d he said. He was the duke. He was solely responsible for six estates, a vast family fortune, and this very house\u2014and he meant to assert that authority.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else you have planned for Simms this morning, but I intend to be a part of it. No more of this scheming and shopping in secret, only to ambush me with new frocks and water goblet sonatas. Am I understood?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He clapped his hands together. \u201cSo what\u2019s on today\u2019s agenda, now that music is finished? Whatever it is, I\u2019m joining you. More shopping? Etiquette lessons? Some stab at exposing the girl to art or culture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharity,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCharity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday. We\u2019re going to the Foundling Hospital. I visit every Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>The Foundling Hospital. The floor dropped out of Griff\u2019s stomach. Of all the places. He had no desire to spend his day at an orphanage.</p><p>\u201cYou only have a week with Simms. Why not skip this particular Tuesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s an essential part of any duchess\u2019s duty\u2014charity toward the less fortunate.\u201d Her brow quirked. \u201cIt\u2019s an essential part of a duke\u2019s duty, too.\u201d</p><p>Now he saw where she was going with this. And he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cOn second thought,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an urgent appointment. I\u2019ve just remembered it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cAn urgent appointment with whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith . . .\u201d He churned air with one hand. \u201cSomeone who needs to see me. Urgently. The land steward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Cumberland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant the family solicitor.\u201d He looked down his nose at her. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to decrease your quarterly allowance.\u201d</p><p>She hmphed. \u201cWell, then. You can discuss the matter with him today. His office is in Bloomsbury, directly across from the Foundling Hospital.\u201d</p><p>Griff sighed. Damn.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Pauline was amazed. In London, it seemed even the orphans lived in palatial splendor.</p><p>The Foundling Hospital was a grand, stately edifice in Bloomsbury, surrounded by green courtyards and fronted by a formidable gate. Inside the building, the halls and corridors were lavishly decorated with paintings and sculpted trim.</p><p>As they walked down the center of the main hall, Pauline felt a cramp forming in her neck from staring upward at the artwork. But any pain in the neck was preferable to feeling the sting of Griff\u2019s indifference.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even look at him. Not after that humiliation in the dining room.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as though she took great personal pride in pinging tunes on crystal, but there\u2019d been such malice in those slow, smug claps. She expected him to be displeased after last night, but she hadn\u2019t been braced for cruelty.</p><p>Men. Such capricious creatures.</p><p>She ought to have learned this lesson from Errol Bright. Whenever they\u2019d stolen an hour or two alone together, he\u2019d been all eager hands and fervent promises. But if they crossed paths in the village, he treated her as just the same old Pauline. At first she\u2019d told herself it was romantic that way\u2014they had a secret passion, and no one could guess. Eventually she\u2019d realized the painful truth. All Errol\u2019s tender words in the moment were just that\u2014in the moment. He\u2019d never truly wanted more.</p><p>Now she\u2019d made the same error with Griff.</p><p>Last night he\u2019d made her feel beautiful and desired. This morning he\u2019d made her feel small and stupid. No doubt she\u2019d do well to take the duchess\u2019s advice: find some phlegm, and refuse to feel anything.</p><p>But that just wasn\u2019t her. And if she lost herself this week, she\u2019d have nothing left.</p><p>As they moved through the Foundling Hospital, the duchess kept up a steady monologue. \u201cThis establishment was founded last century by Sir Thomas Coram and several of London\u2019s leading men\u2014noblemen, tradesmen, the artists whose work you see displayed. The fifth Duke of Halford was among the original governors, and each of his successors has continued the tradition.\u201d</p><p>Pauline didn\u2019t think the current Duke of Halford cared a whit. He was so eager to be done with this place, both she and the duchess were trotting to keep pace with his long strides. If he didn\u2019t wish to be here, she couldn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d come.</p><p>Once they passed out of the public rooms and into the actual home, the building\u2019s decor became markedly more austere. Evidently the palatial splendor was for show, not for the foundlings\u2019 benefit.</p><p>They passed a wide green courtyard filled with hundreds of children. All boys, clad in identical brown uniforms and arranged in orderly files. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere are so many,\u201d Pauline murmured.</p><p>The duchess nodded. \u201cAnd those are only the boys of school age. There are just as many girls in the other wing. And hundreds of younger children are spread throughout the surrounding counties. They\u2019re accepted as infants when their mothers surrender them, but then sent to foster families until school age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then they\u2019re removed from those families again? That must be doubly cruel, to lose not only the mothers who birthed them, but then the only mother they\u2019ve known.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill, they\u2019re better off than many,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cThey have their basic needs met, their education provided. When they\u2019re old enough, they have help finding posts in trade or in service. Our own Margaret in the scullery at Halford House was raised here, as were several grooms and gardeners at the Cumberland estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very good of you to think of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a duty, Miss Simms. For those of our rank and privilege, it is not enough to mean well. One must do some good.\u201d</p><p>The words prodded a tender place inside her. All her life she\u2019d dreamed of doing better\u2014for herself, and for her sister. So far she hadn\u2019t achieved even that. But the Duchess of Halford possessed the power, confidence, and funds to do good for whole swaths of people in need. It was a grand step up from dropping pennies in the church box.</p><p>Suddenly, the duke halted mid-step. \u201cWhat is that miserable urchin wearing?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded toward a bench in the corridor. On it sat a child\u2014a boy of perhaps eight or nine years. He was wearing the same brown uniform all the foundlings wore, but it was capped by a malformed knitted object, fashioned from yarn in an unfortunate shade of green.</p><p>To Pauline\u2019s eye, the mess of yarn appeared to be an abandoned sleeve, but the boy had the thing pulled over his head. It seized his crown in a lopsided, putrid-green hug, covering one eyebrow and ear entirely and riding high above his temple on the other side.</p><p>She fought a smile. It could only be the duchess\u2019s handiwork.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d the duke repeated.</p><p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s a cap,\u201d Pauline offered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a travesty.\u201d The duke approached the youth. \u201cYou there, lad. Let me have that cap.\u201d</p> <p>The boy shrank from him, clutching one hand to his head and shielding his face with the other. He probably assumed that defensive posture often. He was a smallish child, Pauline noted. Pale and thin, with a fading bruise on his left jaw. Bullied by the larger boys, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to give it up? Fine.\u201d Halford removed his own brimmed felt beaver and held it out. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-What?\u201d the boy stammered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offering you an even trade. My fine, tall new hat for your . . . thing.\u201d</p><p>The perplexed boy removed his knitted headgear, and the two of them made the exchange.</p><p>\u201cGo on, then,\u201d the duke said, once the boy had the beaver in hand. \u201cPut it on.\u201d</p><p>The boy obeyed, placing the duke\u2019s hat on his head. The thing came down to his ears, but by tipping the brim back and peering in the glass of a nearby window, he was able to survey his reflection.</p><p>It was probably because he was craning on tiptoe, but . . . Pauline could have sworn the boy looked three inches taller. A dangerous pang snatched at her heart.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d the duke asked.</p><p>\u201cHubert. Hubert Terrapin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they give you that name here, too?\u201d</p><p>The boy nodded glumly.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least the hat suits you,\u201d said the duke. He balled the tangle of green yarn in his hand. \u201cChin up, then. I know you\u2019re a foundling, but surely things aren\u2019t as bad as this.\u201d</p><p>The duchess cleared her throat with impatience, and their group continued down the corridor.</p><p>As they walked, Pauline couldn\u2019t help but steal glances at the duke. It was such a slippery thing, her disgust with him. At the slightest sign of decency on his part, the anger began to wriggle out of her grasp.</p><p>She tightened her hand in a fist. So he\u2019d given a foundling his hat. What of it? He had dozens of hats, and could buy dozens more. Throwing money around didn\u2019t make him a good man. It just made him a wealthy man.</p><p>A wealthy man with a strong, handsome profile. And no more hat to shield his dark, touchable hair from her view.</p><p>He cut her a sudden, sideways glance.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to put it on?\u201d she asked, nodding at the green \u201ccap\u201d in his hands. \u201cIt was a trade.\u201d</p><p>He scowled at it. \u201cProbably writhing with fleas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d the duchess insisted. \u201cThis institution has strict standards of cleanliness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir standards are lacking,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThis is unacceptable. I know they\u2019re penniless, cast-off scamps without a possession in the world, but they must be permitted some pride.\u201d</p><p>Pauline\u2019s stomach twisted as she looked to the duchess, knowing the parcel the older lady carried beneath her arm was probably crammed with similar travesties of yarn\u2014all misshapen, all rather useless. But every one of them the products of hope and motherly love.</p><p>Griff\u2019s insults might be unintentional, but surely they had to wound her. That hurt must go deep.</p><p>Twin smudges of color appeared on the duchess\u2019s high, aristocratic cheekbones, but that was the only reaction she showed.</p><p>She said, \u201cWe are not here to quibble with the fashion sense of foundlings. Today, we are here to tour the nursery. Come along.\u201d</p><p>The nursery?</p><p>At that, Griff balked. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His mother turned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, no. A man must draw a line somewhere, and my line is definitely between this particular bit of flooring\u201d\u2014he gestured at the tile directly beneath his boots\u2014\u201cand the nursery door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like infants, your grace?\u201d Miss Simms asked.</p><p>\u201cNot especially. Noisy and noisome things, in my limited experience. I believe I\u2019ve had enough touring the facility for one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve nearly walked the perimeter of this wing,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cIf your goal is to leave, it\u2019s faster if we go through the nursery.\u201d</p><p>He leveled a hard stare at his mother. \u201cI know exactly what you\u2019re doing. You plan to take me in that room and pop a squalling, sticky creature in my arms. Because you think that experience will leave me vibrating with desire to make a squalling, sticky creature of my own. Perhaps there are men that ploy would work on. But I tell you, it won\u2019t work on me.\u201d He began a backward stroll. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d With a quick curtsy in the duchess\u2019s direction, Pauline joined him. \u201cI\u2019ll go, too. I\u2019ve had a sneeze or two this morning, and I don\u2019t want any babies catching cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimms, you should stay with my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo should you.\u201d She paced him down the corridor, taking three steps for his every two. \u201cYou truly don\u2019t like being here, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I truly don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be a little more agreeable.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m starting to understand the duchess\u2019s frustration with you. And sympathize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family has supported this establishment since its inception. I have no intent to discontinue that tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could be giving more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll donate an extra sum toward proper autumn apparel.\u201d He shook the green cap in his hand. \u201cWe can\u2019t have this sort of thing occurring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t be so snide, you know.\u201d She took the cap from him. \u201cIt\u2019s ugly, yes. But clearly it was made with love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade with love? That? That was made with incompetence, if not outright malice.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. You\u2019re missing my point, and your mother\u2019s. When I say you could be donating more, I mean more than money. You could give your time and attention.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe doctors and matrons who run this establishment want nothing from me but a timely bank draft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seem happy to have your mother\u2019s involvement. She makes regular visits and brings . . . things.\u201d</p><p>As they moved back toward the main hall, they passed an empty room. Pauline noticed a familiar-looking face cowering in the corner.</p><p>\u201cHubert,\u201d the duke said. \u201cThat\u2019s you again?\u201d</p><p>The boy approached them, mournful and hatless.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your fine new hat?\u201d Pauline asked. But the fresh split in the boy\u2019s lip told the story well enough. \u201cAn older boy took it from you, did he?\u201d</p><p>The lad nodded.</p><p>She pulled Griff aside and whispered to him. \u201cGriff, this is exactly what I mean. You can do something for him.\u201d</p><p>He showed his empty hands. \u201cI don\u2019t have another hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. You made an impression on that boy earlier, and it had nothing to do with the hat. You spoke with him, treated him like a person worth something. Talk with him now. Give him some manly advice, or teach him to fight. It might be beneficial for you, too. It\u2019s good to feel useful now and then.\u201d</p><p>He cast a wistful glance toward the exit. \u201cSimms, you seem to have forgotten that you are my employee. I hired you to distract my mother, not to give me advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Consider it a bonus.\u201d</p><p>Good God. Did her impertinence know no bounds?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a powerful man,\u201d she went on. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not only to do with your money or your title. You have the ability to make people feel valued, when you\u2019re not making them feel like rubbish.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand. He wanted to help the lad. He truly did. But he wasn\u2019t in any condition to offer benign encouragement right now. This place had his viscera in turmoil. All the little footsteps pattering right over his heart . . .</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the time.\u201d</p><p>Oof.</p><p>The punch seemed to come out of nowhere, though rationally he knew it must have originated at the end of her right arm. There was no doubt about where it landed\u2014square in his gut.</p><p>He fell back a step, reeling.</p><p>\u201cHubert,\u201d she said, her eyes never leaving Griff\u2019s, \u201csince his grace can\u2019t spare the time, you\u2019re getting your fighting lessons from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimms, you can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m serious.\u201d She tugged off her gloves with her teeth and cast them aside. She circled him with raised fists, taunting. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re not going to fight back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know very well I can\u2019t hurt a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. You are entirely capable of hurting a woman. Expert at it, I\u2019d guess.\u201d She feinted a jab to his ribs, then darted away.</p><p>Clearly she was angry with him, for reasons that had little to do with hats and foundlings. Griff would gladly let her take swings at him later, but he couldn\u2019t have this discussion right now.</p><p>He held up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, you\u2019re not.\u201d She dodged in front of him, blocking his only route of escape. \u201cIf you\u2019re not brave enough to throw a punch, I\u2019m sure you can find other ways. Call me names, perhaps. Insult my origins. Or I know. Perhaps you could bring out that slow, obnoxious applause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is about?\u201d He narrowed his eyes at her. \u201cYou\u2019re vexed with me for not cheering your little water-goblet concert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she shot back, defensive. Then she revised, \u201cIn part. You were purposely hurtful this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made an arrangement, Simms. You agreed to be a failure. I\u2019m paying you handsomely for the trouble. I thought that\u2019s what you wanted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the terms of our bargain are no longer satisfactory, I can send you back to Sussex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI signed on for a week of society\u2019s disdain. Not yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then. Consider it a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2014\u201d With a growl, she swung at him again.</p><p>This time he was ready. He caught her fist in his hand, enveloping the tight, small knot of knuckles and holding it fast.</p><p>\u201cI told you everything last night.\u201d Her whispered words were barbed. \u201cMy dreams, my secrets. Everything. And this morning you treated me like nothing.\u201d</p><p>He made his voice low. \u201cWhat is it you want, Simms? What is it you\u2019re wanting to hear? Am I supposed to say you\u2019re the equal of any well-bred lady?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not. No. I don\u2019t want to be like those Awful Haughfells or any of their sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He nodded slowly. \u201cNow I see. You don\u2019t want to hear that you\u2019re their equal. You want to hear that you\u2019re their better.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to deem your little water-goblet tune more enchanting than any Italian aria. Proclaim your wholesome country manners a breath of fresh air in my sin-clouded life.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhat else? Perhaps you\u2019re hoping to hear that your purity is the most intoxicating and rare of perfumes. Your hair smells like hedgerows and your eyes are like chips of wide-open sky, and God above, you make me feel things. Things I haven\u2019t felt in years. Or ever.\u201d With his free hand, he clutched his chest dramatically. \u201cWhat is this strange stirring in my breast? Could it possibly be . . . love?\u201d</p><p>She stared at his waistcoat button, refusing to look at him.</p><p>Somewhere in his brain a fragment of reason shouted that he was being a bastard and cocking everything up. But he wasn\u2019t acting on logic right now. He was torn between two impulses: the need to push her away from that raw, aching wound she kept poking, and the impossible desire to draw her close, possess her completely.</p> <p>Most of all, he needed to leave this place before he went blind and mad with grief.</p><p>\u201cI employed you for a reason, Simms. I\u2019m not looking for a fresh-faced girl to teach me the meaning of love and give me purpose in life. And if you\u2019re looking for a well-heeled gentleman to make a fetish of your feisty spirit . . . perhaps you could find one here in London, but it won\u2019t be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a speech,\u201d she whispered, drawing close. \u201cI\u2019d be inclined to believe it, if it weren\u2019t for the way you kissed me last night.\u201d</p><p>Her angry warmth was palpable. Arousing.</p><p>\u201cOh, Simms. What kind of shoddy libertine do you take me for? I\u2019ve kissed a great many women without caring for them in the least.\u201d</p><p>Hm. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever seen that shade of green.</p><p>That was his last coherent thought, staring into her eyes. Then her left fist crashed into his face, and his world exploded with fireworks of bright red pain. He staggered a few steps backward. His skull rang like a bell.</p><p>Well. He deserved that.</p> <p>When his vision focused again, he saw her talking to the boy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your first lesson, Hubert.\u201d She crouched before the wide-eyed lad, speaking to him on his level. \u201cDon\u2019t fight fair. Life isn\u2019t fair, especially not life in a place like this. If you have a shot, take it. There\u2019s no call to be sporting about it, not with bullies.\u201d</p><p>She went on, \u201cI grew up on a farm, see. A small one. A poor one. It was always one of my chores to mind the chickens. Now, newly hatched chicks are the sweetest, downiest, most innocent looking creatures on earth\u2014but they\u2019re savage little beasts. They\u2019ll peck their own brothers and sisters to death if they sense a weakness.\u201d</p><p>As he listened to her, Griff felt his own defenses softening.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same with places like this,\u201d she went on. \u201cThere\u2019s always a pecking order. The big will torment the small, and the small will torment the smaller, and on down the line. It\u2019s the nature of chicks, and it\u2019s the nature of children, too. Don\u2019t dream it will change. You\u2019ll never be able to pummel every bully, and no amount of prayer or patience will convince them to change their ways. Just keep your head up and get what\u2019s yours. Your food, your schooling. Whatever they give you, don\u2019t squander it. All bread goes straight in your belly, and all the learning you can gather goes here.\u201d She tapped a fingertip against her temple. \u201cStash it away. Because once it\u2019s in you, it\u2019s yours. No one can take it from you. No schoolyard bully, no mean-tempered lessons master . . .\u201d</p><p>Nor an abusive father, Griff silently added. He pictured her, a lock of hair dangling over her smudged cheek as she furtively memorized bits of etiquette and poetry between farm chores. Reading the same words again and again, until they were stashed away. Safe inside, where no one could rob her of them.</p><p>\u201cNot even a duke,\u201d she finished.</p><p>Hubert eyed her silk day dress, with its flounce of lace. \u201cYou, my lady? You raised chickens on a farm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. And as a child, I took more than my share of licks. But I got mine, just like I told you. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve come this far. And if you find me impressive now . . . ?\u201d She rose to her feet and patted the boy on the shoulder. \u201cCome visit me next week. I\u2019ll be living wealthily ever after.\u201d</p><p>With a fiery glance at Griff, she left the room.</p><p>He started off in pursuit, somewhat hobbled by his aching . . . everything. God\u2019s teeth, what this woman was doing to him. He trailed her clipped footsteps down the corridor, catching up to her at the building\u2019s main entrance.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said, snaring her arm at the top of the steps. \u201cAbout this morning. I wasn\u2019t trying to be the savage chick, or the pecking bully, or whatever it is you\u2019ve likened me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, please. Then I might feel compelled to apologize for hitting you, and I don\u2019t want to be sorry in the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not apologizing. Just explaining. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings, Simms. But if the damned things are really so fragile, you shouldn\u2019t let me anywhere near them. I told you, I\u2019m no prince.\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders, apparently reaching some decision. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You did warn me. And I shouldn\u2019t care what you think.\u201d</p><p>No, wait, he stupidly felt like contradicting. I take it back. You should care. Please care.</p><p>Because he could see it on her face\u2014just like that, she\u2019d decided she didn\u2019t need him. She would take her own advice to Hubert: complete her week\u2019s employment, take his thousand pounds, and never think of him again.</p><p>He wanted her to think of him. Not just this week, but always.</p><p>What an ass he\u2019d been, baiting her with all those compliments she might hope to hear. Griff saw himself clearly now. He was the one yearning for approval. Long after this week was over, he wanted her to remember him as the beneficent, handsome duke who\u2019d whisked her away to London and changed her life. No matter what other disappointments he added to his family legacy, he could console himself with the knowledge that there was a shopkeeper at the arse-end of Sussex who worshipped him. Who believed he had a heart of pure, chivalric-grade gold\u2014or at least sterling\u2014hidden beneath the arrogance and vice.</p><p>She was meant to be the one good thing he\u2019d done.</p><p>And now she looked at him like something that slithered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. They exited through the front gates, where she drew to a halt in the drive. \u201cOf course you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been a fool, wanting you to like me, approve of me. If you found anything in me to approve, you wouldn\u2019t have hired me in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Now that they were out of the orphanage, he could breathe again. There were too many people about to do what he truly wished\u2014which was to pull her into his arms for an embrace that might comfort them both. He settled for righting her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Simms.\u201d</p><p>She looked at his touch on her sleeve. \u201cOh, I understand you perfectly. You have good, generous instincts, but they\u2019re all smothered under that aristocratic phlegm. You\u2019re so choked with it, you\u2019re afraid to care about anything. Or at least, you\u2019re afraid to show that you do.\u201d</p><p>It started to rain then. Cold, fat drops struck the pavement with audible force. In moments the damp had flattened her clothing to her back and plastered locks of hair to her face, making her look small and alone.</p><p>\u201cSimms.\u201d</p><p>She flinched from his touch. \u201cWhat, Griff? What? Did you have something to say to me here? In the midst of a busy street, with people nearby\u2014not in a darkened garden or locked room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d He set his teeth. \u201cVery well. I like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou \u2018like\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. In fact, I like you a great deal more than I should. And it\u2019s precisely because you are all wrong.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, pursing those delectable, berry-pink lips. Far too many hours had passed since he\u2019d kissed her.</p><p>He cursed. \u201cI\u2019m not explaining it right. I\u2019m not used to making these sorts of speeches. But can\u2019t we call a truce? Find somewhere to have a spot of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish the thought, a woman in dark, shapeless wool rushed up to him. Like a raven, winging out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sir. I c-can\u2019t . . .\u201d She sobbed from deep in her chest. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She darted away just as quickly, and it took Griff several instants to register that she\u2019d left something behind.</p><p>A babe. Wedged into his arms.</p><p>Oh, Jesus.</p><p>Gray-blue eyes, scratchy little fingers. No nose or neck to speak of. All wrinkles, from head to tiny toes. Christ, why did they all have to look so much the same?</p><p>\u201cOh, goodness,\u201d Pauline said. \u201cThat poor woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014\u201d He held the child slightly out from his body. His arms were frozen with shock. \u201cWhere is she? Where did she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She must have meant to surrender the child. Perhaps she was afraid to come inside.\u201d</p><p>Griff scanned the busy environs, hoping stupidly for one flash of dark wool to stand out from the dark, woolen crowd. She\u2019d probably stayed nearby. She was likely watching him now\u2014this stiff, useless nobleman she\u2019d trusted to do right by her child\u2014and feeling keen regret.</p><p>The infant knew she\u2019d been done wrong. She wailed up at Griff, puckered and red-faced, waving little fists clenched in anger. Drops of rain spattered her face and blanket. She opened her mouth so wide, her lips seemed to thin and disappear. Her toothless gums and little tongue were bright vermilion with rage.</p><p>You\u2019re a bloody duke, the babe seemed to shout at him. Near six foot tall, thirteen stone. Do something, you worthless lump. Make it all come out right!</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Pauline asked.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>Griff didn\u2019t know. With everything in his hollowed-out shell of a heart, he wanted to soothe the child\u2019s cries. But he couldn\u2019t. He just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He passed the baby into Pauline\u2019s arms, muttered a few words of excuse that he\u2019d never remember later. Then he turned and strode away, into the rain.</p><p>\u201cYour grace! Griff, wait!\u201d</p><p>He could shake off her calls, but the wailing carried high above the din of the streets, above the dark clatter of rain. Those wordless cries of accusation followed him all the way to the street.</p><p>Haunted him for miles.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Very early the next morning, Pauline woke in the darkness. She wrapped her body in a dressing gown, lit a taper, and made her way downstairs to the library.</p><p>She didn\u2019t find the man she\u2019d spent a fitful night alternately worrying over and dreaming about. But she found something almost as intriguing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The naughty books.</p><p>She plucked a volume from the shelf, built a fire in the grate, and settled in.</p><p>An hour or so later she was immersed in a scandalous encounter\u2014a dairymaid\u2019s lover had his hands under her skirts and was questing determinedly higher\u2014when the library door swung open with a whoosh of freezing air.</p> <p>She startled, whipping her head up. Her attention was ripped from the story roughly, unevenly\u2014like a sheet of pasted paper torn loose. Little scraps of lewdness clung to her. She was blushing so fiercely she worried her cheeks would glow in the dark.</p><p>Thank goodness the intruder wasn\u2019t the duchess or a servant.</p><p>Only Griff.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t call him \u201conly Griff.\u201d He could never be \u201conly\u201d anything. The intruder was life-altering, heart-muddling, oft-maddening Griff.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t know what they\u2019d make of each other, after all that happened yesterday.</p> <p>He tossed her a brief, dark look. She couldn\u2019t tell whether he was glad to see her or the reverse. \u201cYou\u2019re awake at this hour?\u201d he said.</p><p>She closed her finger in her book, holding the page. \u201cI wake early every morning. I\u2019m a farm girl at heart. Can\u2019t sleep past five, it seems.\u201d</p><p>As he shrugged out of his coat and draped it over the back of a chair, she recognized it as the same one he\u2019d been wearing when she\u2019d seen him last. His jaw was unshaven. He was still hatless as well. And he looked every bit as miserable as when he\u2019d left her at the front gates of the foundling home, squalling babe in arms.</p><p>However he\u2019d spent his night, the activity hadn\u2019t succeeded in cheering him.</p><p>\u201cAre you just coming in?\u201d she asked, hoping she didn\u2019t sound too managing or . . . well, wifely.</p><p>He nodded.</p> <p>What a stark illustration of the differences between them. This hour meant early rising for her, but late homecoming for him. The two of them were literally night and day.</p><p>But even night and day had to cross paths sometime.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His answering sigh was a slow, weary rasp. \u201cSimms, I honestly don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, he crossed to his desk and rolled up his uncuffed shirtsleeves. He lit two candles, sat down and regarded the broken clockwork he\u2019d left waiting the other night.</p><p>\u201cI hope your evening was more exciting than mine,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cAfter dinner, your mother set me reading aloud from Scripture to improve my diction. I was told to read only the H words. Hath, holy, heresy. Rather a bore.\u201d She lifted the book in her hand and reopened to her current page. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve found the naughty books, the exercise seems much more interesting. Hard as hornbeam. Heaving hillocks of bounteous flesh.\u201d</p><p>When that failed to coax a smile from him, she set the book aside and curled up in the chair. Propping her chin on her knees, she regarded him through the veil of lingering dark.</p> <p>Something was very, very wrong. In a word (in an H word, no less\u2014they seemed all the words she could think of now) he looked horrible. Haunted, too\u2014even more so than he had the first night.</p><p>And part of her suspected he needed to be held.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how to initiate anything of that sort. To make the attempt seemed unwise, for many reasons. But there was one thing she could do for him\u2014a skill learned through years of practice.</p><p>She rose from her chair, crossed to the bar in the corner and poured him a drink.</p><p>\u201cWhen I started working at the tavern years ago, Mr. Fosbury told me I prattled on too much.\u201d She watched the amber liquid swirl into a glass. As she recapped the decanter, she made her voice gruff in imitation. \u201c \u2018Pauline,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018you have to learn to tell the difference between men who come in wanting a chat, and men who just want to be let alone.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>After crossing the carpet in slow, careful steps, she set the drink on the desktop just inches from Griff\u2019s elbow. He didn\u2019t look at it, nor at her. He rubbed the fatigue from his face and peered at the broken clock. As if he could stare at the thing hard enough that the gears would leap into motion of their own accord. Perhaps begin churning time in reverse.</p><p>\u201cI took his advice,\u201d she went on, \u201clearned to mind my conversations. But I also learned Mr. Fosbury had something wrong. There were men who wanted a chat and those who didn\u2019t.\u201d Gathering her courage, she laid a hand to Griff\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut none of them wanted to be alone.\u201d</p><p>He drew a deep breath. His strong, linen-clad shoulder rose and fell beneath her palm.</p><p>She silently counted to five, as slowly as her skittering nerves would allow.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Well, then. She\u2019d given him a chance. Nodding to herself, she lifted her hand and turned away. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The hoarse command froze her in place.</p><p>He swiveled his chair so that they faced one another, reached to take her by the waist, and drew her close between his sprawled legs.</p><p>Then he leaned forward\u2014slowly, inexorably\u2014until his forehead met her belly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he told her navel. \u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>Overwhelmed with some unnamable emotion, she stroked her fingers through his thick, dark hair. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I know.\u201d</p><p>They remained that way for several moments. Touching. Breathing. Warming each other in the dark. Gratitude swelled in her heart. She hadn\u2019t let herself realize how worried she\u2019d been for him. Not until this moment, when he was home safe. With her.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Something told her he didn\u2019t mean the duchess. \u201cThe babe?\u201d</p><p>She felt his nod of confirmation chafe against her belly.</p><p>\u201cThe babe was a he, actually. And he\u2019s fine. I took him in to the matrons. They dressed him in clean swaddling, filled his belly with milk. He\u2019ll have been named and christened by now, I expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he fared better than Hubert with that naming part.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and stroked his hair again.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left you. I just . . .\u201d He huffed out a breath.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself. It was obvious the whole place set you on edge. Many a big, strong man has been sent into a panic by a wailing infant.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and gave her a searching look.</p><p>And her silly, girlish brain picked that moment to decide he was the handsomest man she\u2019d ever seen. Probably because he was the only man to ever look at her this way. Holding her together with his strong, sculpted arms while his heated gaze turned her to slag.</p><p>\u201cCan we return to the conversation we were having just before all that?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe were standing at the gate. You were saying how much you liked me, asking for a truce. And I . . .\u201d She grazed a light touch over his cheek. \u201cI was about to apologize for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I deserved the punches and then some. For most of my life I\u2019ve been a first-rate jackass. For the past year I\u2019ve been trying to be less of one. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m succeeding. I\u2019ve merely graduated from first-rate jackass to flagship bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d She tamed a lock of his hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your moments this week. Saved me from falling not once, but twice. You were perfect with my sister. And I suspect that when you offered me this post, you thought you were doing it to rescue me.\u201d</p><p>Now she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Now she wondered if she was here to rescue him.</p><p>He said, \u201cAt any rate, I owe you an apology for everything today. Including the water goblets.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cIt truly was nothing. Just a silly tavern trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have embarrassing party tricks, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He released her, reclining in his chair. \u201cI can pleasure two women with both hands tied behind my back. Blindfolded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow boastful you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoasting would imply I\u2019m proud of it. I\u2019m not boasting.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. The look on his face told her he wasn\u2019t. The images now filling Pauline\u2019s mind made her a little bit queasy.</p><p>And very, very curious.</p><p>\u201cI found the naughty books,\u201d she said. \u201cI have questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord.\u201d He rubbed both hands over his face. \u201cNo, Simms. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the only person I can ask. And you owe me for the water goblets.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hands. \u201cVery well. You have questions? Here are some answers. \u2019Yes,\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 and \u2018Only with ample lubrication.\u2019 Apply them to your questions as you like.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and gave him a playful smack on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the books make it sound so ridiculous. All this pulsing and divine throbbing and unparalleled ecstasy and cataclysmic smelting of two souls into one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCataclysmic \u2018smelting\u2019? What book said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind the smelting,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the rest of it. The unparalleled ecstasy part. Is it . . . is it really supposed to be that way?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThat particular question is best answered by experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just it, you see. I\u2019ve had experience.\u201d She cringed. \u201cA little bit of it. And it was nothing like that. No ecstasy whatsoever. Nor even any flutterings. That\u2019s why I was wondering if the books tell lies, or . . . or if it was just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimms.\u201d He rose from his chair and looked her in the eye.</p><p>It was killing her not to look away, but his expression made it clear he wouldn\u2019t answer otherwise. So she slid from the edge of the desk, met him toe-to-toe, and held his gaze directly.</p><p>Then waited, miserable.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you,\u201d he said.</p><p>In Griff\u2019s head alarm bells were sounding by the hundreds. He shouldn\u2019t have this conversation. Hell, he shouldn\u2019t even be here with her alone. But he needed to be with someone right now. And by God, she needed to hear this.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cSo the books do exaggerate,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that, either.\u201d</p><p>Her nose crinkled. \u201cI\u2019m so confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because there are no simple answers. Can it be divine bliss? Yes. Can it be a dismal trial? Yes. It\u2019s like conversation. With the wrong person, it can feel forced, perfunctory. Boring as hell. But sometimes you find someone with whom the discussion just flows. You never run out of ideas. There\u2019s no awkwardness in honesty. You surprise each other and yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how do you find that person without . . . conversing all over town?\u201d</p><p>Griff gave a dry laugh. \u201cWhat a question. Find the answer and bottle it, and you\u2019ll have the most successful shop in England. I might even queue up myself.\u201d</p><p>He had \u201cconversed\u201d with many women in his life, and he wasn\u2019t proud of it. Oh, he had been proud of it once, and the women themselves had few complaints. But he\u2019d come to realize it was a cold thing, when the best you could say of a bed partner wasn\u2019t \u201cI love you\u201d or even \u201cI\u2019m fond of you,\u201d but merely \u201cI despise you a bit less than I despise myself.\u201d</p><p>But he meant what he\u2019d said at the foundling home gates. He liked this woman. He could talk with her, as he hadn\u2019t talked with anyone in ages. And any man who\u2019d let her go was a goddamned fool.</p><p>He reached for her, framing her sweet face. He traced her bottom lip with the pad of his thumb. \u201cI don\u2019t have many answers, but I can tell you this much. It wasn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>He approached her, feeling the darkness compress and heat up between them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGriff.\u201d Her hand went to his wrist. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He leaned in, tilting his head for the kiss. The anticipation of her taste set his pulse racing.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSimms. You asked the question. Don\u2019t interrupt when I\u2019m making a point.\u201d</p><p>He hovered an inch above her lips . . . then reconsidered. A kiss wasn\u2019t what she needed. A kiss gave her too much room to hide. She needed to see him, see herself and how beautiful, how sensual, she was.</p><p>He ran his hands over the curves of her body, tracing them through her dressing gown. Her little gasp of pleasure thrilled him.</p><p>\u201cI think I had a dream that went like this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that.\u201d The vision of her dreaming fitfully beneath white sheets . . .</p> <p>\u201cWhat should I tell you, then? That you\u2019re the most attractive man I\u2019ve ever known, and the mere scent of your cologne sets fire to my petticoats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should tell me to go to the devil.\u201d His hands went to the ties of her dressing gown. He paused, one finger looped in the corded sash. \u201cBut would you tell me so, if that\u2019s what you felt?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you know me at all?\u201d</p><p>He yanked on the knotted sash, drawing her to him. \u201cI just know I\u2019m desperate to touch you, everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Just this, he told himself. Just touching.</p><p>He would allow himself this much, and no more.</p> <p>He worked the knot of the sash free and divided the edges of her robe, exposing the crisp white shift beneath it. This one was new\u2014not nearly so frail and translucent as the one she\u2019d worn the first night. But he found it arousing as hell anyway.</p><p>He slid his hands up and down her body, cupping her breasts through the chemise, then stroking downward to her hips and thighs. The linen softened and heated under the friction, molding to her form. He found her nipples and claimed them with his thumbs, teasing and rolling them to tight peaks. He slipped a button free, then another. Just enough so he could push the fabric aside, bend his knees, and finally\u2014finally\u2014suckle her the way he\u2019d yearned to in that darkened garden.</p><p>As he kissed his way back up her neck, he sent one hand downward, arrowing straight for her sex.</p><p>He worked his fingers between her thighs, massaging the linen until he could cradle her sex in his palm. Even through the fabric, she was warm for him. Wet for him.</p><p>Dear God, he could have her so easily. Undo a few trouser buttons, push up her shift, and glide straight home. He could be in her in seconds.</p><p>\u201cNothing but your pleasure,\u201d he vowed to them both, stroking her with the heel of his hand and pressing his fingertips through the linen, dampening the fabric with her body\u2019s moisture. \u201cYou have my word. I don\u2019t mean to take from you. Only give.\u201d</p><p>He supposed he should have carried her to the divan or laid her down on the carpet, but he was selfish. He wanted all of her, all for himself. All of her weight in his arms, all of her heat against his body. He did not want to share her with a sofa or a carpet, or even something so slight as a chair.</p><p>Wrapping his arm tight about her middle, he bound her to him. With his other hand, he coaxed and explored her sex. Desperate for her secrets.</p> <p>There were few things that gave him more satisfaction in life than bringing a woman pleasure. In so many ways, it was like solving a puzzle. Each woman had the same anatomy. But the crucial bits came in all shapes and sizes, fit together in different ways, and each responded to a unique set of strokes and caresses. The same techniques might not work from one woman to the next. The process of discovery was humbling and intoxicating.</p><p>But when he triumphed\u2014when he found just the right touch to apply in just the right place for just as long as she needed it\u2014ah, the sweet thrill of success. Victory was a heady drug. He loved feeling a woman come undone in his arms. Loved feeling the taut ring of her sex soften and melt for him, then grasp him tighter than a fist. He loved learning each little expression and sound that heralded her orgasm. Some women sighed, some wept, some laughed, some whimpered, some begged, some screamed. Some were wickedly grateful in the aftermath, and others grew endearingly bashful.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what Pauline would be like when she reached her peak. But he knew he must find out. Deep inside, he expected transcendence. Something utterly different than anything he\u2019d experienced before.</p><p>He gathered a handful of her shift and drew the fabric upward.</p><p>\u201cYou can say no,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Thank heaven. He slid his hand beneath the linen, skimming a slow, patient touch up her thigh. When he reached her cleft, his patience left him. He had to be inside her, somehow. He parted her folds and plunged a single finger into her tight, wet heat.</p><p>She gasped. Her hands clutched at him. The delicious bite of her fingernails made him wild.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened?\u201d he asked, holding still. \u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m a bit frightened.\u201d She looked up at him and swallowed hard. \u201cAnd no, I don\u2019t want you to stop.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, thrusting his tongue in rhythm with his touch. Slowly in, then out. When he felt she was ready, he added a second finger. Her intimate muscles stretched and contracted around the combined girth, gripping him tight. His cock throbbed vainly in his trousers, trapped in a painful state of arousal.</p><p>She nestled close to him, and her belly pressed against the aching ridge of his erection. It wasn\u2019t nearly all that he desired, but the friction provided some relief.</p><p>She broke the kiss and rested her head on his shoulder, slack-jawed and breathing hard. Her hips writhed as she worked herself against his hand, grinding against him in the way that pleased her most.</p><p>He began to whisper against her ear. He knew she\u2019d passed the point of coherence, so he said any foolish thing that came to mind. How lovely she was in the moonlight, and how proud he was of her courage. How she\u2019d enchanted him that very first night, and he still hadn\u2019t found his way back through the magic cabinet. How he adored her neck and her sharp green eyes. How sweetness clung to her, and how he fantasized spending blissful hours slowly lapping it up with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he whispered, skimming his thumb up and down her crease. \u201cI\u2019d taste you here. You\u2019d be so sweet. And then . . .\u201d</p><p>He pushed his fingers deep, driving them to the hilt. With his thumb, he worried the swollen nub at the crest of her sex.</p><p>\u201cGriff,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>She gave a few charming little hitches of breath. Like an ascending scale on the pianoforte. And then she came with one perfect sighing, shuddering moan.</p><p>A lovely sound, that moan. Her intimate muscles contracted deliciously around his fingers. But all in all, her orgasm was not quite the epic, transcendent experience he\u2019d expected.</p><p>What stunned him breathless was his own reaction.</p><p>That was entirely new.</p><p>The surge of emotion he felt\u2014it wasn\u2019t just the usual triumph of bringing a woman pleasure. An unbearable font of tenderness welled in his chest. Mingled with protectiveness, fondness. The impulse to not just pleasure her, but cherish her, guard her. He pressed kiss after kiss to the crown of her head, as if he could expel this painful excess of emotion.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you,\u201d he whispered, nuzzling the delicious lobe of her ear. \u201cWhoever he was, he was a fool. Or a boor. Or just too damned young to know what the hell he was doing. But it wasn\u2019t you. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She clung to his shirtfront for long moments, breathing hard. Finally, she looked up at him. \u201cWill you take me upstairs?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never wanted anything so much. To simply take her upstairs, let his world explode, and then contend with the rubble later.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything,\u201d she rushed on. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for promises. I just want to know what it\u2019s like when it\u2019s good. And I might go my whole life without another chance. I\u2019m not a lady with a reputation to guard. There\u2019s no one to care.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, he cared.</p><p>He cared, and he could no longer deny it. He\u2019d brought her into his house, taken her under his protection. Lady or not, he wanted to treat her well.</p><p>Her hands slid up his chest, then trailed down his arms. She pressed a light kiss to his neck. \u201cGriff, please.\u201d</p><p>His cock throbbed in eager agreement.</p><p>Her, his stupid heart whispered. I\u2019ll take her.</p><p>But beneath all this, his veins ran cold with a deep, dark current of fear. It was too great a risk for them both. He couldn\u2019t take her like this when she\u2019d never be his for the keeping. That way lay danger and months of despair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He stroked her hair. \u201cIt isn\u2019t you. I want you more than you could possibly know, in ways you couldn\u2019t even fathom. But I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He released her with abruptness\u2014because that was the only way he could do it at all.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Pauline came late to breakfast. She considered skipping the meal entirely\u2014pleading headache or fatigue\u2014but she didn\u2019t want to invite any questions.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d even look at the duchess this morning. The woman had the perception of a hawk. She would have to mind her every move, word, and glance to avoid giving anything away.</p><p>As she neared the breakfast room, she stopped in the corridor and took a moment to compose herself.</p><p>She could hear voices from within\u2014both the duchess\u2019s and Griff\u2019s.</p><p>Drat.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t supposed to be awake this early. How was she going to manage this?</p><p>The same way he managed it, she supposed. After their encounter in the dining room the previous morning, she knew Griff would have no difficulty. He would barely acknowledge her presence, no doubt.</p><p>In fact, that was probably why he\u2019d come to breakfast at all\u2014because he worried that she would blurt out over toast that she\u2019d shamelessly thrown herself at him mere hours ago. He wanted to quell any speculation.</p><p>Just pretend nothing happened, she told herself. You were not alone with him in the library. He did not gather you in the most tender, needing of embraces. He most especially did not lift your skirts and give you delicious pleasure while whispering the most tender, arousing words to ever caress your ear.</p><p>The memory was so acute, she bit her knuckle to keep her reactions in check.</p><p>When she had her resolve firmly in place, Pauline turned the corner and entered the breakfast room. She kept her eyes downcast.</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon for my tardiness, your graces. I slept rather\u2014\u201d</p><p>The scrape of chair legs interrupted her. The sound froze the blood in her veins.</p><p>Oh no. Surely he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She looked up in horror.</p><p>He had.</p><p>The eighth Duke of Halford had come to his feet when she entered the room. Without thinking, apparently, because he couldn\u2019t possibly have meant to do such a thing. Gentlemen rose to their feet when ladies came in. They did not rise for servants.</p><p>No man had ever stood for Pauline. Not once in her life. It was the best, most thrilling sensation. But when it came to the cause of discretion, this was complete disaster.</p><p>And then he made it worse\u2014he inclined his handsome, dark head in a sort of bow. \u201cMiss Simms.\u201d</p><p>Up went the duchess\u2019s eyebrow. \u201cWell.\u201d</p><p>That one syllable spoke volumes. Her grace knew everything. At least, she knew something had happened. Pauline could only pray the details remained a rough sketch in her imagination.</p><p>\u201cBe seated, Miss Simms,\u201d Griff said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou first, your grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you, remain as you are,\u201d the duchess said. She rose from her own chair. \u201cI was just about to leave for the morning room, and now I\u2019ve saved you the trouble of rising twice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo we have lessons this morning, your grace?\u201d</p><p>She gave Pauline a strange look. \u201cNo. It\u2019s Wednesday.

If they want another look at you, there\u2019s the fete at Vauxhall Gardens this evening. For now, you may be at your leisure.\u201d</p><p>Pauline curtsied as the duchess exited the room.</p><p>As soon as the older woman had gone, she whispered to Griff, \u201cWhat are you doing, standing for me? You shouldn\u2019t stand for me. You saw the duchess\u2019s face just now. How smug she looked. She\u2019ll think something has changed between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything has changed between us.\u201d</p><p>Everything changed inside her, at that statement. Her internal organs began scouting for new neighborhoods.</p> <p>He said, \u201cWhen you\u2019ve finished your breakfast, get your things. We\u2019re going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? Out? Where?\u201d Pauline was aware she sounded something like a yipping dog. But her mind was full of questions.</p><p>\u201cYou and I. Will go out of the house.\u201d He walked his fingers in demonstration. \u201cOn an errand. Did you have some other plans for the morning?\u201d</p><p>Pauline had just been contemplating an hour or two of reading, followed by a nice long nap.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any plans,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cVery good. Meet me in the entrance hall when you\u2019ve fetched your wrap.\u201d</p> <p>She still wasn\u2019t sure what last night meant to him. Or even what it meant to her. But this morning she couldn\u2019t turn down the chance to spend time with him.</p><p>She wanted to be with Griff more than she wished to be anywhere else.</p><p>In her heart she knew this meant she was on the verge of something emotional and treacherous\u2014and at serious risk of falling in.</p><p>Be careful, Pauline. Nothing could come of it.</p><p>For today, she decided to ignore the posted warnings and dance on the edge of heartbreak. Surely she could teeter on this brink a few hours longer without falling completely in love with the man.</p><p>After all, it was only an errand.</p><p>Except that it wasn\u2019t only an errand.</p><p>Oh, no. It was something far better. And far worse.</p> <p>He took her to a bookshop. The bookshop.</p><p>When the coach pulled up before the familiar Bond Street shop front, Pauline\u2019s heart performed the strangest acrobatics in her chest. It tried to sink and float at once.</p><p>The cruel words echoed in her memory. I\u2019ll chase you off with the broom.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d she asked, accepting Griff\u2019s hand as he helped her down from the carriage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bookshop. If you mean to open a circulating library, don\u2019t you need books? They don\u2019t sell very many of those at the fruiterer\u2019s or linen draper\u2019s.\u201d He tugged at her hand. \u201cCome, we\u2019ll buy up every naughty, scandalous, licentious volume in the place.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her toward the shop entrance, but Pauline held back.</p><p>Griff looked bemused. \u201cIf you\u2019re too proud to accept a gift, I can deduct it from your thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>She chided herself for her reluctance. He meant well. He meant more than well. He\u2019d brought her here for the express purpose of making her dreams come true.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there another bookshop in London? A bigger one, with a larger selection? This one looks rather small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnidling\u2019s is the best. My family has patronized this shop for generations. They offer bindings done to order, of the finest quality. That\u2019ll be important for your circulating library. You\u2019ll want the books made to last.\u201d</p><p>Her heart ached at all the evidence of how much thought he\u2019d given this. This was the extravagant shopping trip her heart yearned for\u2014not a whirlwind of pink in the dressmaker\u2019s shop, or hours spent poring over trays of gold and jewels. And the fact that he understood it meant he knew her.</p><p>\u201cYou were right yesterday,\u201d he said, more softly. \u201cAbout Hubert and the hat. I can\u2019t just hand you a thousand pounds, brush the gold dust from my hands and walk away. If this is your dream, I want to be sure you\u2019ll make a go of it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Griff.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go in there,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cBut of course you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m not welcome there.\u201d</p><p>His face went serious. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>There was nothing for it but to tell him the truth. As Pauline related the tale, he received it with a stony, impassive expression. It hurt to own up to the humiliation. But if she were going to refuse his help, he deserved to know why.</p><p>\u201cSo you see, I can\u2019t go in. Not this shop.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. Not in words. When his footman opened the door, Griff ushered her into the bookshop with a firm hand.</p><p>The shopkeeper rushed out from behind the counter to greet him with a deep bow. \u201cYour grace. What an honor.\u201d</p><p>Griff removed his hat and placed it on the counter.</p><p>\u201cHow may I serve you this morning, your grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my mother\u2019s friend, Miss Simms. She is looking to acquire some books for her personal library. I believe you made her acquaintance earlier this week.\u201d</p><p>Snidling\u2019s gaze flicked to Pauline and his tongue darted out in a reptilian manner. \u201cEr . . . I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t recall, your grace. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. This is a busy shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. So many people come and go, you see. I can\u2019t possibly remember each face.\u201d</p><p>The snake. Pauline knew he recognized her. His gaze kept darting in her direction, and his face was showing hints of crimson.</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to confront his lies. She wasn\u2019t afraid of him. Not now, with a duke at her side. This time, she would stand up for herself.</p><p>But Griff\u2019s hand pressed against her back, relaying an unmistakable message: Allow me.</p><p>\u201cSo you do not remember Miss Simms?\u201d he asked the shopkeeper once again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, your grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me shake your recollection,\u201d the duke said, imbuing the word \u201cshake\u201d with the crisp ring of a threat. His voice was smooth, aristocratic, commanding, and honed to a blade-sharp edge.</p><p>Pauline thought it was the most arousing thing she\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cYou had a conversation with her,\u201d he continued evenly. \u201cAbout oranges, Leadenhall, the Queen of Sheba, and chasing vermin off with brooms.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s stammering became a violent tremor\u2014nearly as violent as the bloodred flush of his cheeks. \u201cYour g-g-grace, I humbly and abjectly apologize. I had no idea the young lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not I who deserves your apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, your grace.\u201d The scaly man turned to Pauline. He barely met her eyes. \u201cMiss Simms, please accept my profoundest apologies. I didn\u2019t realize. I am deeply sorry if you interpreted my remarks in any way that offended you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d The duke turned to her. \u201cDo you accept his apologies, Miss Simms?\u201d</p><p>Pauline glared at the shopkeeper. His was the worst, most insincere apology possible. To say \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were offended\u201d was not the same as apologizing for the offense. She didn\u2019t believe he was sorry in the least, and if she\u2019d been alone and feeling brave, she would have told him so.</p><p>But she was here with Griff, and he\u2019d meant this to be a pleasant errand. Part of her fairy tale.</p><p>So she said quietly, \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Griff clapped his hands together. \u201cLet\u2019s begin an order. Take a list, Snidling.\u201d</p><p>The shopkeeper\u2019s relief was plain. He scurried behind the counter and turned his ledger to a fresh sheet before dipping his quill in ink.</p><p>Griff began to dictate, rattling off titles and authors with an arousing tenor of authority. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with all of Mrs. Radcliffe and Mrs. Wollstonecraft. All the modern poets, as well. Byron and his ilk. The Monk, Moll Flanders, Tom Jones, a good translation of L\u2019\u00c9cole des Filles . . . Fanny Hill. Make it two copies of that last.\u201d</p><p>Snidling looked up. \u201cYou did say these are for the young lady\u2019s library, your grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grace, might I suggest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Griff clipped. \u201cYou may not offer suggestions. You will continue to write down the titles that I name.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dried. Good heavens. If he\u2019d torn every scrap of clothing from his body and held the shopkeeper at the point of a glimmering sword, every muscle flexed in anger\u2014she could not have found him more attractive than she did right now.</p><p>He went on listing titles and dictating names. They were all a muffled stew in her ears.</p><p>When the list filled an entire page, front and back, he said, \u201cI suppose that will make a start. Now, for the bindings.\u201d</p><p>Griff turned to Pauline and waved her over to view samples of leather. As she neared him, her heart began to pound. Last night he\u2019d skimmed his rough, hungry touch over her breasts, filled her with his wicked fingers. But nothing\u2014none of the previous night\u2019s exhilaration\u2014could compare to this moment.</p><p>She stood next to him, buffeted by the full, soul-rattling force of her adoration. How could he fail to notice? How could the world not have changed around them? She\u2019d been struck by lightning, and he just went on speaking in that same, even tone.</p><p>\u201cYou must have Morocco bindings, of course. It\u2019s the best. Gold leaf embossing for the title and the spine. Do you have a favorite color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFavorite color?\u201d She was lost in his dark, inquisitive stare. \u201cI . . . I like brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrown?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s too commonplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Pauline ran a loving touch over the scrap of fawn-colored leather she\u2019d admired the other day. Just as butter soft as it appeared, but wholly impractical. She tried to focus her attention to the samples of Morocco he\u2019d suggested.</p><p>\u201cI should think red,\u201d she decided. \u201cRed, for all of them.\u201d She lifted a scrap of supple crimson kidskin. \u201cRed is the best color for naughty books, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndubitably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd people will know at a glance they came from my library. It will be a good advertisement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed it is, then. With marbled endpapers and gold leaf. Write that down, Snidling.\u201d</p><p>The shopkeeper scribbled greedily in the margins. Pauline could tell he was already tallying up the outrageous profits he\u2019d turn on this one order alone.</p><p>\u201cMay I view the list?\u201d the duke said.</p><p>\u201cBut of course, your grace.\u201d Snidling turned the ledger so the duke might view the page.</p><p>Griff ran his finger down the list, nodding with approval.</p><p>Then he grasped the page and ripped it from the ledger. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, folding the paper in two and creasing it smartly. \u201cThis will prove helpful when we place the order with your competitor.\u201d</p><p>The shopkeeper flashed a nervous smile. \u201cYour grace, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Don\u2019t you? Then permit me to make it clear.\u201d He approached the man until the difference between their heights was evident. \u201cPerhaps Miss Simms accepts your measly, insulting apologies. I do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-But, your grace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would offer you a farewell, but I don\u2019t bother with insincerity. I hope you fare very ill indeed.\u201d</p><p>Pauline wanted to cheer and applaud. Kiss him, in full view of everyone. Or at least stand there and gloat a few moments longer.</p><p>But Griff was eager to leave.</p><p>He ushered her out the door. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll find another shop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do that right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d he replied. \u201cI sent the coach around the corner to wait. Do you mind walking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p> <p>He barely paused to gain her agreement before storming down the sidewalk at a terror of a pace. His boots hit the pavement with crisp reports, and his gloves flapped comically in his grip. Pauline had to dash to keep up with him.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d When he noted her struggles, he slowed his pace. \u201cI\u2019m angry at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being angry. And for what you just did. The way you handled him was marvelous.\u201d</p><p>He stared into the distance and snapped his gloves against his thigh.</p><p>\u201cGriff, I\u2019m going to work so hard for you the rest of this week,\u201d she promised. \u201cStarting with Vauxhall tonight. I\u2019ll be the best, most comprehensive failure you could imagine.\u201d</p> <p>He made a dismissive wave, brushing off her vows.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it. Truly. That was . . .\u201d There was no other way to say it. \u201cIt was the best thing anyone ever did for me.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, then turned to her. \u201cAnd that, Simms, makes me angriest of all.\u201d</p><p>The fiery look in his eyes . . . it undid her. She knew that look. It mirrored the fast-blooming vine of devotion and rage that grew inside her whenever Daniela was harmed. She knew it well\u2014the pure, unreasoned fury at a world that would allow such things to happen, coupled with the frustration that she was powerless to prevent it from occurring again.</p><p>Griff felt that same frustration right now. On her behalf. And he wasn\u2019t even bothering to hide it.</p><p>If she\u2019d harbored any hope of not falling in love with the man, it vanished that instant. It was only a matter of time. She would love him before the week was out, and it would be gloriously terrible, wonderfully hopeless.</p> <p>Her heart was now a coin with two sides\u2014dread and joy\u2014and it seemed to flip back and forth with every racing beat.</p><p>\u201cMiss Simms?\u201d</p><p>At the sudden address, Pauline startled.</p><p>\u201cWhy, it is you.\u201d Lady Haughfell appeared on the pavement before them. \u201cAnd your grace. What a pleasant surprise. We\u2019ve just come from your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Griff replied.</p><p>\u201cYes, we came hoping to make a social call and further our acquaintance with dear Miss Simms. We do so long to hear more about her and her people. Our copy of Debrett\u2019s was curiously of little help.\u201d</p><p>Pauline didn\u2019t miss the implication in Lady Haughfell\u2019s words. You\u2019re not one of us. I know it, and I mean to learn the truth.</p><p>\u201cWe were out,\u201d Griff said.</p> <p>\u201cObviously,\u201d the lady replied.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies for the inconvenience,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cPerhaps you will be so good as to call another day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. And allow me to express my deepest concern for the duchess\u2019s health and my best wishes for her speedy recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His voice changed instantly.</p><p>Lady Haughfell arched a brow. \u201cWere you unaware? The butler informed us. Your mother has taken gravely ill.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Griff couldn\u2019t get home fast enough.</p><p>The carriage was too far away, the traffic too congested. Time dallied in a most impertinent way.</p><p>Pauline tried to mollify him. \u201cShe\u2019s fine, I\u2019m sure. Perhaps she merely said she was ill so she wouldn\u2019t have to entertain the Awfuls.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, hoping she was correct. Still, he could not rest easy until he\u2019d confirmed it with his own eyes.</p><p>When they reached Halford House, he took the stairs two at a time and stormed down the corridor to the duchess\u2019s suite. He flung open the door and saw her lying in the center of her bed, eyes closed and hands clasped atop the bedcovering.</p><p>Motionless.</p><p>His veins became ice floes. This couldn\u2019t happen. Not yet. He knew she was getting older and that inevitably her health would fail. But she was still so strong-willed, so alive. She couldn\u2019t do this to him now.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t ready to be alone.</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d When she gave no answer, a knot stuck in his throat. \u201cMother.\u201d</p><p>At last her eyes opened, with an innocent flutter of lashes. Her voice was weak. \u201cGriffin? Is that you, my dear boy?\u201d</p><p>Devil take it.</p><p>He knew in that moment that this was all a ruse. In all his life, his mother had never once referred to him as her \u201cdear boy.\u201d He would have remembered.</p><p>The duchess was alive, well, and cunning as ever. He was going to throttle her.</p><p>\u201cCome closer.\u201d Her pale hand groped the air. \u201cI want to look on your face one last time.\u201d</p><p>Really, her acting skills were most impressive. She should take to the stage.</p><p>She mustered a pathetic cough. \u201cMy only regret . . . the fete at Vauxhall tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind it. We won\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The volume of her protest seemed to revive her a bit. \u201cNo, you must attend. Everyone\u2019s expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you playing ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing.\u201d She smoothed the bedcoverings with one hand. \u201cI\u2019m simply too weak for Vauxhall this evening. The drafts, the fog by the river, all those stairs. I feel a chill coming on, just to think of it. The two of you must go without me. I don\u2019t want to ruin your evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that hard to believe. You were all too eager to ruin our afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Diabolical woman. Did she truly not understand the panic she\u2019d just put him through? It was a thousand times worse than any matchmaking, or even drugging and kidnapping. He couldn\u2019t forgive her that.</p><p>\u201cYou are not ill,\u201d he said. \u201cI command you to rise from that bed and be well.\u201d</p><p>She fixed him with a droll gaze. \u201cGriffin, you are a duke. You are not St. James curing the lepers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, which saint is the patron of beleaguered sons?\u201d He glared at a mysterious lump beneath the counterpane. \u201cWhat is it you have under there?\u201d</p><p>Her hands covered the lump. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing. I can plainly see you have something under that blanket. What is it?\u201d He reached for the counterpane and bed linens, planning to draw them back.</p><p>She tugged them close. \u201cLeave me be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will know what you\u2019re hiding.\u201d</p><p>They tussled back and forth for several seconds. Until something sharp stabbed him in the wrist.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back his hand. Incredulous, he rubbed at a small round wound. She was stabbing him with pins now? Good Lord. She\u2019d be a terror with a saber.</p><p>\u201cI revise my previous statement,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are ill. Seriously ill. And when this week is over, we\u2019re going to discuss living arrangements for your decline. I hear there are lovely sanitariums in Ireland.\u201d</p><p>Pauline waved him to the side of the room. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s for the best. If I\u2019m to be a social disaster, it will go much easier without her there.\u201d</p><p>Griff wasn\u2019t so sure. He knew exactly what his mother had in mind. She wanted to force the two of them alone. So they\u2019d spend the whole evening together in a hopelessly romantic setting, and then . . .</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her green eyes pleaded with him. \u201cI\u2019m only in London this one week. Chances are, I\u2019ll never return. I was looking forward to seeing Vauxhall. And to earning my keep, at last.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and leveled a single finger at her nose. \u201cYour comportment had better be dreadful.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a hand in mock salute. But her fetching smile gave him grave misgivings. Soon, there\u2019d be nothing he could deny her.</p><p>On his way out of the bedchamber he addressed the vigilant butler. \u201cHiggs,\u201d he said, \u201csee that my mother does not move from that bed. And summon the doctor. Not the gentle-mannered one, either. The one with the leeches.\u201d</p><p>Once the duke had left the room, Pauline approached the duchess\u2019s bed. \u201cReally, your grace. That wasn\u2019t kind of you. He was terribly concerned.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been more than concerned. She\u2019d watched his face go pale as ash, and he\u2019d clenched his hands until his knuckles bleached to bone. Didn\u2019t they realize how fortunate they were to have each other? She\u2019d never known two people who so clearly loved each other yet spent so much time and effort denying it.</p><p>There was phlegm, and then there was sheer obstinacy.</p><p>\u201cI should think this sort of ploy is beneath a duchess.\u201d</p><p>She clucked her tongue. \u201cVery well, I admit it. I\u2019m not truly ill. I\u2019m desperate. Look.\u201d</p><p>The duchess threw back the counterpane, revealing a misshapen baby blanket large enough to swaddle a calf. Not even just a bovine calf, but possibly an elephant calf. The yarn had been changed twice, partway through. So one-third of it was peach and another third was lavender. Now she was working her way through a ball of pink.</p><p>Skeins of white, green, and blue lurked ominously nearby.</p><p>Pauline whistled at it. \u201cThat is dire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it. And it\u2019s growing worse by the hour. This evening is the chance we\u2019ve been waiting for. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your grace. I\u2019m going to be a disaster. I have to be. Elegance, comportment, accomplishment, elocution . . . all of it. I don\u2019t possess any of the qualities a duchess needs.\u201d</p><p>The older woman waved a hand. \u201cForget all that. There is exactly one quality, and one quality only, that makes a woman a duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe marries a duke.\u201d</p><p>Pauline shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my son, girl. He\u2019s half in love with you already. It started that very first day, and then this morning . . . ?\u201d She hmphed. \u201cOne strong push in the right direction and he\u2019ll fall hard. Don\u2019t try to tell me you\u2019re not feeling something for him.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, not knowing how to argue. He\u2019d declined to take her to his bed. But after the bookstore today, she believed that Griff did care about her. At least a little. And she knew herself to be dangerously close to falling in love with him.</p><p>But what did it matter? That didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d want to marry her. Or that she could ever marry him.</p><p>She rose from the bedside. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to your rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne last thing,\u201d the duchess said just as Pauline had reached the door. \u201cYou\u2019re to have the amethysts tonight. I\u2019ll tell Fleur.\u201d</p><p>The amethysts?</p><p>Pauline was stunned. \u201cBut, your grace, I couldn\u2019t possibly wear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ready for them. And what\u2019s more, he\u2019s ready to see you in them.\u201d As she left the room, the duchess called after her, \u201cI\u2019m counting on you, girl.\u201d</p><p>Too many people were counting on her, it seemed. Her loyalties were growing more and more divided. The duke had hired her to save him from matchmaking. The duchess wanted to be rescued from a creeping tangle of yarn. Pauline was coming to care for them both\u2014and she knew they each needed something more.</p><p>But somewhere, much too far away, there was poor Daniela, faithfully gathering eggs and counting the days until Saturday. Her sister needed her most of all.</p><p>Pauline drew to a halt in the corridor and cast a look at the porcelain shepherdess she\u2019d nearly demolished a few days back.</p><p>What am I doing here?</p><p>To these people, country life made for decorative figurines. She knew it to be backbreaking, ceaseless work. No matter what delusions the duchess suffered under, she could never belong in this aristocratic world.</p><p>All she wanted was a little shop in Spindle Cove and a circulating library of naughty books. Not to mean well, but to do well\u2014for her and her sister both. She couldn\u2019t start dreaming of the wrong fairy tale. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was a hardworking girl, and she\u2019d been hired for a reason. To be a comprehensive catastrophe.</p><p>\u201cColin. Colin, something terrible has happened.\u201d</p><p>Colin Sandhurst, Lord Payne, looked up from the letter he was writing. His wife stood in the doorway of his study\u2014as always, an enticing vision of dark hair and plump, kissable lips.</p> <p>But her lovely eyes had gone grim behind her spectacles.</p><p>He rose from his desk at once. \u201cGood God, Min. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must do something,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course we will, darling.\u201d He crossed the room to her. \u201cOf course we will. I could crash through the window this instant, if you asked. Or pen a strongly worded letter to The Times. But the actions we take will be more effective if you explain to me first what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>He took her by the shoulders and guided her to the divan.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s that horrid, debauched friend of yours,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom before we married.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThat description fits a shocking number of people, I\u2019m afraid. You\u2019ll have to narrow it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe duke. That grabby, disgusting duke from Winterset Grange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalford?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the one. He\u2019s got Pauline Simms. Our Pauline, from the Bull and Blossom. And he\u2019s holding her hostage here in Town.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cGod knows what he\u2019s done to the poor thing. Probably made her his sordid love puppet.\u201d</p><p>Colin struggled not to laugh. \u201cMinerva, I\u2019m trying to follow you, but you\u2019re making it quite difficult. Perhaps you can start again and tell me what actually happened today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw them together. I was going to the bookshop to . . .\u201d She blushed a little. \u201cTo see if any more copies of my book had been sold. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd had they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, Min. That\u2019s brilliant.\u201d Colin had only purchased two of them himself.</p><p>He knew she\u2019d throttle him for buying them up, but he couldn\u2019t help it. The market for geological treatises wasn\u2019t especially robust. But she was so damned adorable when she was pleased with herself\u2014and especially creative in bed. His motives were entirely selfish.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow, as I was approaching the bookshop, I saw the two of them leaving it. The Disgusting Duke of Halford and Pauline Simms. Clear as day.\u201d</p><p>Colin sighed. He hated to prod at a sore spot, but this was too much to be believed. \u201cWere you wearing your spectacles?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an offended look. \u201cOf course I was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill. I think you must have been mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I know I\u2019m not, Colin. Don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe, without a doubt, that you believe you saw them.\u201d He clasped one of her sweet little hands in his and stroked it soothingly. \u201cBut I still think it a great improbability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that two more different people never existed,\u201d Minerva agreed. \u201cThat duke is vile and debauched. And Pauline is so well-meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Opposites do occasionally attract. And Spindle Cove women \u2018abducted\u2019 by rakes are not always so unwilling as the observer might suspect.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore we go haring off on a rescue mission, let\u2019s consider a few bits of information. From all evidence, Pauline had no means of traveling to London. Secondly, I know Halford. The man would never be near a bookshop. And last\u201d\u2014he placed a light, affectionate touch to her nose\u2014\u201cyou have been complaining that your spectacles need new lenses. A mistake seems the most likely explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d he added, \u201cI will do all I can to set your mind at ease. Today, I\u2019ll ask around at the clubs. See what gossip there is of Halford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019ll pay a call on Susanna and Lord Rycliff. If anything were amiss in Spindle Cove, they would have heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. And if our little fact-finding investigations turn up nothing, we\u2019ll perform an experiment. We\u2019ll call at Halford House tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Her eyes misted with tears.</p><p>\u201cDarling Min.\u201d He stroked her cheek. \u201cAre you truly that concerned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, Colin. I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d She squeezed his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re using the scientific method.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Griff kept busy for the rest of the day. He had a full slate of appointments that afternoon, all related to the business of his estates.</p><p>It still wasn\u2019t enough. All his meetings with solicitors and land agents and secretaries . . . They were like cannonballs stuffed in a crate. They were weighty, and they took up space\u2014but they didn\u2019t make the crate truly full. Thoughts of Pauline slipped in to fill every void, like a million grains of sand.</p><p>Or crystals of sugar, it might be more appropriate to say.</p><p>Somehow he made it to late afternoon, when he surrendered to the attentions of his valet. He emerged an hour later\u2014smooth-shaven, fully dressed, and completely unprepared for the vision coming down the staircase.</p><p>Good Lord.</p><p>One look at her and Griff knew it was over. The evening was a failure before it began. No one would ever believe her to be a common serving girl. Not tonight, not looking like this.</p><p>She wore a gown in deep, lush pink, with gauzy layers of skirts billowing out from a fitted, off-the-shoulder bodice. Matching elbow-length gloves. Her hair was curled, looped, and pinned\u2014but all in a way that managed to look effortlessly lovely and elegant. Quite a trick, that. Fleur deserved a rise in wages.</p><p>She carried herself well, too. Her neck was a pale, slender column, and her bare shoulders . . . ah, her shoulders looked sculpted from moonlight. Delicate and serene, mysterious and feminine. A rope of pale amethysts dipped sensuously above her d\u00e9colletage, catching the light with a thousand facets.</p><p>He was a duke and a libertine, he reminded himself. He\u2019d seen many a beautiful woman in his life. Finer gowns than this, more lavish jewels than these. Rationally, he knew that Pauline Simms could not eclipse everything and everyone who had come before her. And yet, somehow she did.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t any one feature he could point to, or any particular gesture she made. It was just . . .</p><p>Her. I\u2019ll take her.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>Finally, he looked her in the eyes\u2014those bright green, cat-tipped, intelligent eyes, set in a heart-shaped face. They were anxious tonight, and transparently vulnerable.</p><p>Lord above. She had no idea. She had him enraptured to the point of drooling incoherence, and she had absolutely no idea.</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>She\u2019s waiting for your reaction. React. But not too much. Only the appropriate amount. A well-chosen word or two.</p><p>What he said was, \u201cGuh.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. Had that unformed syllable actually escaped his throat?</p><p>Pauline blinked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Apparently it had. He cleared his throat with a loud harrumph, then searched for a way to amend his statement. \u201cGood,\u201d he pronounced, clearing his throat again. \u201cI said good.\u201d</p><p>A pretty flush rose on Pauline\u2019s cheeks. Still, she bit her lip, looking hesitant. \u201cWhat kind of good?\u201d she asked. \u201c \u2018Good\u2019 as in \u2018rather bad,\u2019 which aids our purpose? Or \u2018good\u2019 as in \u2018actually good,\u2019 and you\u2019re displeased?\u201d</p><p>Griff sighed inwardly. What was he to say? \u201cGood\u201d as in \u201cGood God, you are the most radiant, lovely thing I\u2019ve seen in all my life, and I\u2019m a speechless, shuddering fool before you.\u201d Does that clear matters?</p><p>\u201cGood as in good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not displeased.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth pulled to the side. \u201cThen that\u2019s . . . good.\u201d</p><p>This was now officially the most inane conversation in which Griff had ever been a participant\u2014and that included a drunken debate with Del over ostrich racing.</p><p>\u201cThe color isn\u2019t too awful?\u201d She twisted a fold of the skirt. \u201cThe draper called it \u2018dewy petal,\u2019 but your mother said the shade was more of a \u2018frosted berry.\u2019 What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man, Simms. Unless we\u2019re discussing nipples, I don\u2019t see the value in these distinctions.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed into a chastening pout.</p><p>\u201cWhatever shade it is, it looks well on you.\u201d Too well. He tugged his black evening gloves on and gathered his hat from Higgs. \u201cLet\u2019s be going.\u201d</p><p>The carriage was readied and waiting. He turned to Pauline. She obviously needed help, what with those ungainly skirts. Without hesitation, she took the hand he offered and clutched it tightly, borrowing his strength. The warm clasp of her satin-clad fingers nearly undid him. He was unsteady himself as he made his own way into the coach and sat across from her on the rear-facing seat.</p><p>He turned his head to the window. He needed to bring himself under control. They were only just leaving the house, and the whole evening lay ahead.</p><p>When they reached the place for the river crossing and alighted from the coach, twilight had descended. The air was heavy with wisps of fog and shadow. An air of romantic mystery lingered, despite all Griff\u2019s attempts to discredit it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to cross the river in boats?\u201d she asked, eyeing the boat launch with alarm. Her grip tightened on his arm.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to Vauxhall. Eventually there\u2019s to be a bridge, but it isn\u2019t complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a boat. Not in my whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever? But you live by the sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s absurd, isn\u2019t it? Sometimes the ladies go boating, but I never had a reason to join in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened.\u201d He reached for her. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Helping her into the boat was even more precarious than handing her into the carriage had been. Griff went first, wedging his boots fast against the floorboards and steadying his balance.</p><p>Pauline accepted his hand and took a cautious step onto a seat near the bow. But just then the waterman launched the boat. She stumbled. Griff had to catch her by both arms as she fell against his chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, bollocks.\u201d She struggled to correct herself, and the boat lurched.</p><p>His stomach nearly capsized. He had a vision\u2014a brief, waking nightmare of a thought\u2014in which she tumbled straight into the black water and all those heavy, embellished skirts dragged her straight to the depths.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he told her, tightening his grip. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He held her close and tight. For long moments they stood absolutely still\u2014swaying in each other\u2019s arms while the boat regained its equilibrium.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYour heart is racing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo is yours.\u201d</p><p>He smiled a little. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>When the boat finally steadied, he helped her onto the seat and motioned to the waterman, who ferried them across the Thames in smooth, even strokes.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he murmured, keeping her close. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to fear. Just imagine we\u2019re traveling through that crystal cabinet in the poem. On our way to another world. Another England. Another London with its Tower. Another Thames and other hills.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed against his shoulder. \u201cA little lovely moony night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly so.\u201d There she went again, enchanting him.</p><p>Griff had never been the fanciful sort, even as a boy. When he was with Pauline, the world was different. She forced him to see things through fresh eyes. Suddenly his library was the eighth wonder of the world, and Corinthian columns merited blasphemy. A ferry across the Thames was an epic journey, and a kiss . . . a kiss was everything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Deep down, beneath the overworked, sharp-tongued serving girl, he saw a woman who craved the poetry in life. She\u2019d never been given anything\u2014not even favorable odds. But there was a liveliness in her spirit that fed on simple possibility\u2014soaked it up like a wick and shone the brighter for it.</p><p>And tonight? Griff tilted his head westward and regarded the setting sun. Less than an hour from now her world was going to explode with brilliant possibility.</p><p>He wanted nothing more than to be near her when it did.</p> <p>Pauline found Vauxhall rather overwhelming. And that was before they even entered the place.</p><p>When they disembarked on the far side of the river, her stomach took several moments to cease bobbing. They ascended a long flight of stairs, leading up the riverbank to a grand entrance gate. The higher they climbed, the louder the music grew.</p><p>Cor, she thought. She didn\u2019t say it aloud, not tonight. But it was the constant thought in her mind as they made their way through the gate and into the gardens proper.</p><p>Cor, cor, cor, cor, cor.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know nature could be tamed to this degree. The greens were perfectly flat. The shrubs were pruned in squat shapes. The trees were planted in straight lines.</p> <p>Stately colonnades ran in various directions, marking covered pathways. At the end of each aisle vast paintings were hung. From this distance she couldn\u2019t quite make them out. She glimpsed a white orchestra pavilion in the form of a giant seashell, with carvings and embellishments all over it.</p><p>Suddenly, she realized her mouth had been hanging agape for the past few minutes. And the duke had noticed.</p><p>He gave her an amused look.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s growing dark,\u201d she said. \u201cShould we head toward the pavilion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said, catching her arm. He guided her off the main walk, into a darkening grove of trees away from the colonnades.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething is about to happen, and I want you to see it. I want to be with you when you see it.\u201d</p><p>She popped up on her toes, craning her neck to look in all directions. \u201cWhat is it we\u2019re waiting to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s starting,\u201d he said, turning her head. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Pauline looked. She caught sight of a glowing orb. One single ball of light, hanging in the distance.</p><p>She blinked, and there were two of them.</p><p>And then ten.</p><p>And then . . . thousands.</p><p>A warm glow spread through the gardens like a wave of light, touching here a red lamp, there a blue or green. Breathless with delight, she tilted her head back. The trees above them were strung with lamps on every branch. The glow traveled from one to the other, and before long the entire grove was illuminated. The effect was similar to standing beneath a stained-glass church window at the sunniest part of the day. Except this was night, and all the colors had a luminous richness. The lamps were like a thousand jewels, hanging from every tree and carved stone archway.</p> <p>Pauline couldn\u2019t even come up with words. She laughed and clapped a hand to her cheek. \u201cHow do they do it?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow do they light them all at once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a system of fuses,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey only need to light a few, and the spark travels to all the lamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s magical,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, softly. \u201cI think it is, rather.\u201d</p><p>She turned to the duke, giddy with the beauty of it. He wasn\u2019t looking around at the thousands of lit globes hanging from the trees.</p><p>He was watching her.</p><p>A shiver passed over her bare shoulders. She crossed her arms to warm herself.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he said, placing his gloved hands on her upper arms, then rubbing up and down.</p><p>The supple leather slid over her bare skin, warm and buttery. It was a lovely gesture, but it wasn\u2019t doing a dratted thing to cure her of gooseflesh.</p><p>His gaze caressed her mouth. \u201cPerhaps coming here was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted, hoping her words weren\u2019t drowned by the mad thumping of her heart. \u201cNo, I promise I can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalford!\u201d The voice carried to them through the glen. She turned to spy Lord Delacre waving at them from the colonnade. \u201cCome along, then. We\u2019ve a booth over this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my cue,\u201d she said, giving Griff a wink. \u201cTime for me to earn my thousand pounds. Prepare for disaster.\u201d</p><p>They made their way to the colonnade and found the booth Del had reserved. Pauline slipped away to mingle with the group. Griff watched her laugh and joke, sip champagne and devour slice after slice of wafer-thin ham.</p><p>For his part, Griff stood to the side, nipping brandy from his pocket flask and finally coming to grips with a painful truth. He needed to find some new friends.</p><p>Martin had his Drury Lane songstress in tow, and Delacre had taken up with that widow again. A few well-dressed prostitutes hovered at the edges of the group, hoping for their glasses to be filled before they wandered away. Without even making an effort, Pauline was the most refined woman in the booth. If she made any ill-informed remarks about the Corn Laws, no one would care.</p><p>All the halfway decent fellows who\u2019d once been part of their circle had drifted away in recent years\u2014married, come into their titles, settled down. Griff would have liked to drift away, too\u2014without the marrying part\u2014but it was harder to leave a circle when you were the center of it.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you opening the Grange this year, Hal?\u201d Martin asked, one arm draped about his mistress\u2019s powdered shoulders. \u201cRuby here fancies a holiday in the country. She\u2019ll bring friends. Quite friendly friends.\u201d</p><p>The painted blonde gave him a coy promise of a smile.</p><p>In years past, Griff had spent the colder months at Winterset Grange. The house was the first thing he\u2019d purchased after reaching his majority. Even with six family properties, he\u2019d felt the need for a place of his own. Other men had bachelor apartments. He was a duke; he had a bachelor estate. There, for several years after leaving university, he and his Oxford friends had taken the country house party tradition to new heights\u2014or lows\u2014of dissipation.</p><p>Always the generous host, Griff famously opened his door to any and all guests\u2014especially the pretty, female variety. Days were for sleeping. Nights were for gambling, drinking, and other vices of the flesh.</p><p>The Grange had become such an institution that when Griff failed to open the house last winter, rumors of his insolvency had circulated.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been broke, of course. Just broken.</p><p>\u201cYou are opening the Grange this year, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Martin asked.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t decided,\u201d Griff replied. \u201cPerhaps not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come along, Hal. You must. Last winter I was forced to go home to Shropshire. A crashing bore, I tell you. The old man\u2019s after me to join the Church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond sons and their problems.\u201d</p><p>Griff wasn\u2019t interested in opening his house just so Martin and Delacre and every other overgrown adolescent in England could come laze barefoot on his furniture and organize drunken billiard tournaments that lasted three days and three nights straight. It had been good fun when they were youths, but now . . . He supposed his patience and his generosity had run out.</p><p>Or been redirected.</p><p>He could see himself opening that house for one reason only\u2014and her name was Pauline.</p><p>As soon as the idea flickered through his skull, his mind pounced on it. He knew she had her dream of opening a bookshop in Spindle Cove. But perhaps she dreamed of that simply because she couldn\u2019t conceive of more.</p><p>He could give her more.</p><p>She turned to him then, as though she could feel the force of these new, visceral intentions. Sidling her way through the crowded booth, she made her way to his side.</p><p>\u201cLord Delacre has asked me to dance,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea of the steps. If I time my stumble at just the right moment, I think I can take us both into the punch bowl. Will you give me a ten-pound bonus?\u201d</p><p>He smiled despite himself. \u201cTwenty.\u201d</p><p>He watched her as she drifted away on Del\u2019s arm, headed out to join the colorful whirl of dancers.</p><p>Oh, he couldn\u2019t marry her. He couldn\u2019t marry at all. But he could take care of her, see that she never struggled again. At the age of twenty-three, she\u2019d worked enough for a lifetime. She shouldn\u2019t have to toil anymore. She deserved to be spooned delicacies, pampered with the softest linens, waited on by a dozen maids, and bathed in deep copper tubs.</p><p>Delacre swung her through the dance. In that blush-pink gown, her light figure was a dream. He hoped she was enjoying herself, at least a little. In a more just world, she would have been given her own coming-out ball, with dozens of admirers queuing for her hand. Then again, he could admire her enough for dozens of men. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes from her now.</p><p>The dancers turned a corner, and Griff caught a glimpse of her face.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>He recognized that expression she was wearing. He didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Before he\u2019d even decided on a course, his feet were in motion. He had to get to her, immediately.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known the duke?\u201d Lord Delacre led her capably through the dance. He was so elegant a dancer, she scarcely had the opportunity to misstep.</p><p>\u201cOnly this week,\u201d Pauline answered truthfully. \u201cAnd you, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were at Eton together. Close friends ever since.\u201d He fixed her with an unreadable gaze. \u201cWe have a pact, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A pact, blood-sworn on our crossed blades. To protect one another in the face of all threats\u2014treachery, betrayal . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath?\u201d Pauline finished.</p><p>\u201cNo, worse. Marriage.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. She couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cHow old were you when you swore this pact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineteen. But it never lapses, you know. It automatically renews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She tried to look thoughtful. \u201cLord Delacre, if a duke wishes to avoid matrimony, isn\u2019t he capable of protecting himself?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou really are new in London, aren\u2019t you? A man like Halford needs a trusted friend to watch his back at all times. The ton is rife with fortune-hunters. And as fortune-hunting goes, his fortune is the elusive white tiger\u2019s pelt. The greatest prize to be had. There are women in this town who\u2019d stoop to poisoned darts and mantraps just to bag him.\u201d He arched one brow and swept a playful look around the crowd.</p><p>His gaze returned to her. \u201cYou never know when they\u2019ll strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think I\u2019m one of those women,\u201d Pauline concluded. \u201cA fortune-hunter like the rest. My lord, let me assure you\u2014I have no designs on the duke. No sharpened arrows or slingshot in my reticule. I possess no qualities that could remotely tempt a man like Halford into marriage.\u201d</p><p>Where was that punch bowl anyway? She didn\u2019t feel like explaining her bargain with Griff to Delacre, but acting it out might serve the same purpose. Surely he wouldn\u2019t view her as a marital threat once he was drenched in arrack punch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re aware of Halford\u2019s reputation, I hope,\u201d Delacre said. \u201cFling your favors at him all you like, but he won\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d \u2018fling my favors\u2019 at anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, Miss Simms,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend any such implication.\u201d</p><p>Liar. He\u2019d meant exactly what he\u2019d said. As though he could look at her\u2014without having any knowledge of her humble, common origins\u2014and just know she was that sort of girl.</p><p>What was worse, he was right, to a point. In her youth, she hadn\u2019t guarded her \u201cfavors\u201d as closely as she should have. But Griff knew about that, and he never made her feel lesser for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pauline looked about, growing desperate to end this. She wanted to get back to Griff.</p><p>Aha. There it was. A vast silver tub of punch, shaped like an open clamshell. As soon as they reached the far end of the dance floor, she\u2019d ask Lord Delacre for some refreshment. They\u2019d approach the bowl . . . he\u2019d lean over to dip with the ladle . . .</p><p>And from there, just one good push would do the trick.</p> <p>\u201cLord Delacre, your friend is in no danger from me.\u201d Mentally, she added, You, on the other hand . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take you at your word, Miss Simms.\u201d Delacre\u2019s eyes wandered to a spot beyond her shoulder. \u201cIf only Halford himself weren\u2019t about to prove you wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be enough.\u201d Griff appeared out of nowhere and stopped them in the middle of the dance. \u201cI\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d</p><p>Delacre resisted. \u201cOh, come along, Halford. Let us get through one dance. We\u2019re having a conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Griff gripped his friend\u2019s lapel, pulled him away from Pauline and lowered his voice to a growl. \u201cI said, she\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Delacre raised his hands. \u201cVery well. She\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>With a little bow\u2014and a wary look in Pauline\u2019s direction\u2014Delacre disappeared.</p><p>As Griff took her in his arms and resumed the dance, Pauline stared at him, amazed. \u201cWhy did you cut in? I was on the cusp of brilliant disaster.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI decided I didn\u2019t care to watch you dive in the punch bowl. Someone worked too hard on that gown you\u2019re wearing. And on the punch. Not to mention, there\u2019s a breeze this evening. You might catch cold.\u201d</p><p>Might catch cold?</p> <p>\u201cYou do realize,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthat for our bargain to work, sooner or later you will have to let me stumble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it won\u2019t be tonight. Tonight, I\u2019m here for you. And I will not let you fall.\u201d He leaned close and whispered in her ear. \u201cI could see you were upset, Pauline.\u201d</p><p>Her heart twisted. The fact that he\u2019d been able to tell from all that distance\u2014and wasted no time coming to her side\u2014it warmed her deep inside. She didn\u2019t care what anyone said about his past or reputation. This was a good man.</p><p>She clutched his shoulder tight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d He firmed his hand against her back. \u201cJust follow my lead.\u201d</p><p>He danced her to the side of the pavilion\u2014the one opposite his friends\u2019 booth. Instead of rejoining the party, he steered her away from the orchestra and onto a dimly lit path. Once they left the crowds behind, he turned her to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked, bracing his hands on her shoulders and searching her face. \u201cWas it something Del said? I can easily kill him for you.\u201d</p><p>Pauline smiled weakly. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d Even though Delacre had insulted her, she knew he was trying\u2014in his own, warped way\u2014to be a good friend to Griff. She didn\u2019t want to be caught in the middle.</p> <p>\u201cDid someone else insult you? Are you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re homesick, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am homesick.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a lie. \u201cThis place has me awestruck. Everywhere I turn, I think, \u2018Daniela would love to see this.\u2019 And from there . . .\u201d</p><p>He drew her close. \u201cAnother landslide.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt will pass. A walk will help.\u201d</p><p>He offered his arm, and she took it. Together they ambled away from the orchestra and into a darkened grove. Once again she found herself wondering how he understood her feelings so completely. Almost as if they were his own.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask you something?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOnly if it\u2019s nothing to do with cataclysmic smelting.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s about my sister. You were perfect with her. Just perfect. Do you have someone like Daniela in your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cI have no siblings at all. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>So he had lost someone. She squeezed his arm. \u201cGriff. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re thinking. I mean, it is, but it isn\u2019t. My mother bore four children, but I\u2019m the only one who lived longer than a week. I have no clear memories of my brothers and sister.\u201d He moved a low-hanging branch out of Pauline\u2019s way, and she ducked under it. \u201cI found Daniela charming. You\u2019re lucky to have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I didn\u2019t always know it. But I am.\u201d</p><p>Pauline wasn\u2019t a saint, and neither was Daniela. Like any sisters, they had their episodes of bickering and resentment. And there\u2019d been that shameful day in their girlhood when they traveled to market with Father. Pauline, perhaps eight years old, had run off to make new friends, steal a bit of joy from someone else\u2019s life. And when Daniela caught up with their merry group, Pauline had been embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cIs that dummy your sister?\u201d a boy had sneered.</p><p>\u201cLud, no,\u201d she\u2019d replied. \u201cNever saw her before in my life. Make her go away.\u201d</p><p>Even now she could still see her sister\u2019s horror-stricken face. The guilt had crushed her like a millstone. She\u2019d known, in that moment, she\u2019d denied the only person who loved her most in the world. And for what? To impress a few children at market? She had dashed after Daniela, begging forgiveness. They\u2019d clasped each other tight and cried and cried. It was a painful memory, but one she didn\u2019t dare forget.</p><p>She would never let anyone make her feel ashamed. And she would never betray her sister again.</p><p>\u201cI am lucky to have her,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAnd no one else understands that. No one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they have siblings to spare. We aren\u2019t all so fortunate.\u201d</p><p>With that, he fell quiet.</p><p>Pauline stared at him, tracing his handsome features in the lamp-lit darkness. He was a complex man, with a rich family legacy and responsibilities she couldn\u2019t begin to fathom. Who was she\u2014a serving girl, from Sussex\u2014to tell him anything?</p><p>But she had to try. There was no one else who could.</p><p>She turned to him, placing a hand on his sleeve. \u201cGriff . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d At the new tone in her voice, his eyes narrowed. He backed away, leaning against a nearby tree. \u201cDon\u2019t, Simms. Don\u2019t start this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start what? I merely said your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut in that tone. I know that tone. You\u2019re embarking on some vain attempt to fix me, mend the brokenness of my life . . . Whatever fool womanly notion you\u2019re entertaining, abandon it now. You\u2019ll only embarrass yourself.\u201d</p><p>Good heavens. The man was so transparent, it was like she could look at his waistcoat and see straight through to the tree trunk he leaned against.</p><p>If he thought a few boorish words could shake her off, after the way he\u2019d clutched her to him last night . . . the sweet words he\u2019d whispered . . .</p><p>\u201cYou are being ridiculous,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cSo ridiculous, I can\u2019t even be angry with you, so don\u2019t think you\u2019re pushing me away. Griff, I know you\u2019re hurting somehow. I know it. I could feel it, even that first day, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m not having this discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Deny it. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s male pride or aristocratic phlegm. But whatever quality it is, it\u2019s not one I possess. You can pretend you\u2019re not hurting. I can\u2019t pretend not to care.\u201d</p><p>She steeled her courage to continue. \u201cI\u2019m not asking to be in your confidence. I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t share your problems with a girl like me, but . . . perhaps you shouldn\u2019t dismiss the idea of marriage entirely. I hate to think of you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m alone?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cI don\u2019t lack for companionship if I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. You\u2019re a great rake and libertine\u2014or so I hear. But I haven\u2019t seen any evidence of it. From my observation, you\u2019re just an impulsively generous, occasionally decent man who roams the house alone at night and tinkers with old clocks.\u201d</p><p>His arm shot out and he pulled her tightly to his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t mistake me for a decent man.\u201d</p><p>In one swift move he had their positions reversed. His broad chest pressed her against the tree. She struggled just a little, and the gauzy fabric of her dress snagged and caught on the bark.</p><p>She would not let him see her trembling.</p><p>\u201cYou declined to ravage me last night,\u201d she said. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t expect me to fear it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d He leaned forward, until they were nose-to-nose. \u201cI expect you\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>He took her mouth in a deep, demanding kiss. His tongue moved against hers, again and again, and he angled his head to slide deeper still. Exploring her, possessing her. Relentless.</p><p>And it didn\u2019t stop there. His hand slid to her bodice, claiming her breast.</p><p>Oh, sweet heaven.</p><p>He cupped the batting-enhanced mound capably, his fingers lifting and stroking. His thumb skimmed back and forth, searching for her nipple. The padding thwarted him. He gave up with a curse and tugged at her off-the-shoulder sleeve, working her neckline downward.</p><p>She sucked in her breath. He couldn\u2019t mean to do this here.</p><p>Or perhaps he could.</p><p>With a firm, unapologetic motion, he gathered what there was to gather and lifted, hiking her breast above the border of her corset and exposing it to the cool night air. It was dark, but she felt thrust into a spotlight, vulnerable and quivering.</p><p>He kissed her again, exploring her mouth with possessive sweeps of his tongue. As their tongues sparred, he rolled her nipple with his thumb. His masterful caresses destroyed all will, all reason. Somehow, between the delicious sparks and shivers of bliss, one simple, straightforward goal began to coalesce.</p><p>This time she wanted to touch him, too.</p><p>She slid her gloved hands inside his coat, surveying the ridged, stony muscles of his torso and chest. Even through his waistcoat the power in his body was palpable.</p><p>She yanked his shirt free of his waistband and thrust her hands beneath. He growled in encouragement as she ran her flattened palms over the hard cobblestones of his abdominal muscles and traced the light furrow of hair bisecting them. Then she swept her touch upward, grazing over his nipple and centering on the fierce thump of his heart.</p><p>Boom.</p><p>Something exploded. She felt the concussion of it in her chest, and thought it might have been her heart bursting. Then flashes of sparks from the heavens lit the space between them.</p><p>She laughed at herself as the realization dawned.</p><p>Of course. \u201cFireworks.\u201d</p><p>With one last brush of his lips against hers, he lifted his head. She held her breath, expecting him to speak. But he didn\u2019t say a word. He just stared down at her, the same way he had that first day in Spindle Cove\u2014as though she were the most wonderful, terrible, puzzling, perfect thing he\u2019d ever beheld.</p><p>No, no. This was all too much.</p><p>She held his heartbeat in her hand. He treasured her small, insignificant breast with his. And overhead, great bloody fireworks exploded with trails of silver and gold.</p><p>The power in the moment was soul-rattling. Without the shield of a kiss, she couldn\u2019t hide her own feelings. There was nowhere she could look but straight into his dark eyes.</p><p>Her own pulse was an incoherent flutter, but there was no hesitance in the rhythm beneath her palm. No stutter, no doubt. Just a strong, insistent beat of wanting.</p><p>Pauline, she could almost imagine it to say. Pauline, Pauline, Pauline.</p><p>That couldn\u2019t be right. It had to be saying something else.</p><p>Probably, You fool, you fool, you fool.</p><p>Somewhere nearby, love was an ominous, gaping hole in the earth, widening every moment. Unless she were very careful, she\u2019d be sure to fall straight in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGriff,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou need someone. Everyone needs someone.\u201d</p><p>With an impatient motion, he hiked her bodice, covering her breast. Then he stepped away.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand this.\u201d His words were dark and fierce. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I need someone. My whole life has been an endless string of someones. Another \u2018someone\u2019 is exactly what I don\u2019t need. I most especially do not want to stand in a room of pitiful, lackluster young women and hear, \u2018It\u2019s your duty to marry, Halford. Just choose someone.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>She reeled away from him, stung. \u201cOh. I see.\u201d</p><p>He cursed. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right.\u201d She edged away in small, hurried steps. \u201cChoosing a lackluster girl from a crowded room. What a nightmare. No good could ever come of a scene like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPauline, wait.\u201d</p><p>She turned and ran, leaving him in the darkened grove and emerging into an open square where a crowd had gathered to watch the fireworks. She stopped in her tracks, working for breath. All around her, people were laughing and cheering and gasping with joy.</p> <p>An unseen man bumped into her, hard. The old Pauline would\u2019ve elbowed him back, but she didn\u2019t have the heart for it right now. Instead, she turned to face him, laying her hand to her throat in apology.</p><p>Oh, God. Oh no.</p><p>He was gone. It was gone.</p><p>Griff made his way through the grove, searching for her.</p><p>At last he caught sight of her gown on the far side of the crowded green. That throbbing blur of pink, illuminated by gold pulses from above. He felt as though he were watching his own heart, separated from his body.</p><p>Then a man emerged from the shadows\u2014and his heart stumbled.</p> <p>\u201cPauline!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear him\u2014or didn\u2019t turn, if she had. Instead, she paused for a moment. Then she rucked up her skirts and tore away, darting into the night.</p><p>She was chasing someone. He heard her call, \u201cStop! Stop, you bloody thief!\u201d</p><p>Thief?</p><p>Griff ran after her, but he still had the crowd to navigate, and she had a formidable lead. He was amazed at how fast she could run in all those skirts. She was giving the villain\u2014whoever he was\u2014quite a chase through colonnades and across lamplit groves.</p><p>And as she ran, profanity unfurled behind her like a brightly colored banner. Whatever gains she\u2019d made in elocution this week all disappeared.</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d she shouted, jostling past a bemused gentleman Griff recognized as an Austrian ambassador. \u201cStop, you black-\u2019earted devil!\u201d</p><p>Well, if she\u2019d wanted a disastrous public spectacle\u2014she had it. No punch bowl necessary.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll \u2019ave your bollocks, you filthy whoreson!\u201d</p><p>Griff made an apologetic No, no, not you grimace in the direction of the royal booth, not daring to slow down long enough to explain. He would have laughed if he weren\u2019t so breathless\u2014and so worried for Pauline.</p><p>They reached the borders of Vauxhall and plunged out into the surrounding neighborhood\u2014a jumble of factories and shipping merchants\u2019 homes and tenements. None of the streets were lit. God only knew what dangers lurked in the alleyways.</p><p>Still, she charged on.</p><p>What was she thinking? Whatever the brigand had taken, it wasn\u2019t worth risking her life.</p><p>She was losing ground on the thief, but Griff was gaining on her.</p><p>\u201cPauline!\u201d he shouted, digging deep for breath. \u201cLet him go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>She turned a corner in pursuit and Griff lost sight of her for a few bleak, endless seconds. He kicked up his pace, just praying that she\u2019d still be whole and unharmed\u2014so he could catch her and shake her silly.</p><p>Just as he neared the same corner, a short, piercing scream rent the air.</p><p>Holy God. Please.</p><p>He rounded the corner, and there she was\u2014crumpled to the ground in the middle of the lane.</p><p>\u201cPauline. Pauline, are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop for me,\u201d she cried. \u201cRun after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d Griff didn\u2019t even bother to look. \u201cHe\u2019s gone. And even if I could catch him, there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d abandon you here.\u201d</p><p>People were already filing out from the nearby dwellings, having a good look at the fine lady and gent in the street. Griff made his posture strong and turned a wary glance in all directions, letting any ruffians know that they\u2019d better not take their chances.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d he murmured, crouching down before Pauline. \u201cDid he hurt you? Strike you with something?\u201d He began searching for splashes of blood. A horrid thought struck him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a pistol or a blade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>He breathed again. Thank God.</p><p>\u201cNothing of the sort. It\u2019s just these dratted shoes. I caught my heel between the paving stones and my ankle turned.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her skirt, and he could see her stockinged ankle, caught at an angle that made him wince.</p><p>He freed her foot first, then the shoe. With gentle fingers, he explored her swelling ankle. She choked back a sob of distress.</p><p>\u201cIs it so very painful? Perhaps it\u2019s broken.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not broken. And the pain isn\u2019t so bad. It\u2019s just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said darkly. \u201cWhat did the villain do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. You\u2019ll despise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>She slumped against him, as if all the fight and fire had gone out of her. \u201cGriff, he took the necklace. Your mother\u2019s amethysts. They were worth thousands. And now they\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>That was it, then. Pauline gave up. She surrendered to his care, not knowing what else there was to do. She\u2019d always considered herself a resilient person, but tonight she was beat.</p><p>London one, Pauline nothing.</p><p>Less than nothing. Even considering the thousand pounds in wages Griff had promised her, she was now several thousand in his debt. The duchess would never forgive her. How would she ever pay them back?</p><p>The duke was still crouched at her side.</p><p>\u201cPut your arms about my neck,\u201d he directed.</p><p>She obeyed, halfheartedly lacing her wrists about his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHold on tightly,\u201d he admonished, muttering a curse. \u201cYou\u2019re a farmer\u2019s daughter and serving girl. I know you can do better than that.\u201d</p><p>She willed her muscles to flex. He was right, she had a sturdy frame\u2014which meant she wasn\u2019t precisely a feather\u2019s weight. She owed it to him to do her part.</p><p>He lifted her with a low grunt of exertion, shifting his arms until her weight settled against his solid chest.</p><p>\u201cThe shoe,\u201d she said feebly.</p><p>\u201cDamn the shoe.\u201d</p><p>She supposed he was right. What difference did a shoe make, when she\u2019d just lost a necklace worth thousands of pounds?</p><p>He carried her to the end of the street, down a different way than they\u2019d come in pursuit. She thought about pointing out the discrepancy, but decided he knew where he was going. His face, when she now and then glimpsed it in the weak light thrown from a window, was a mask of stern determination.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>He gave a terse, dismissive shake of his head. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak to her further on the way home. Not in the boat that ferried them back across the Thames. Not in the carriage back to Mayfair.</p><p>When they arrived at Halford House, she heard him giving quiet yet firm orders to the house staff. She found herself whisked into the Rose Salon and propped up on the largest available divan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling for a doctor,\u201d Griff said.</p><p>\u201cReally, I don\u2019t need it,\u201d she protested.</p><p>He left the room. And that was the end of that argument.</p><p>So Pauline sat in the Rose Salon while the doctor poked and prodded and looked over her. The swelling seemed to be improving already. No lasting harm done. Not to her ankle, anyway. Other parts of her might never recover.</p><p>As the doctor was on his way out, Griff appeared in the doorway to confer with him. He\u2019d removed his coat, rolling his shirtsleeves to the wrist.</p><p>Pauline rose from the chair and hobbled to meet him in the center of the carpet. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cI finally proved a catastrophe. I must have appeared to be a foul-mouthed harpy, swooping across those manicured greens.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to see the humor in her statement. \u201cCome. I\u2019ll help you upstairs.\u201d</p><p>She waved off his help. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad sprain. The doctor said it will quickly mend.\u201d</p><p>He insisted on placing an arm about her waist, guiding her toward the stairs. She didn\u2019t know how to refuse. The juxtaposition of his glowering expression and his solicitous attentions made everything seem worse.</p><p>She took the first stair with her good foot. \u201cYou\u2019re angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am angry,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot deny it. But I am struggling not to direct my anger at you.\u201d</p><p>She hobbled up another stair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ll pay it back somehow. Beginning with the thousand pounds, of course. As for the rest of it . . .\u201d She stopped and looked up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how. But I swear to you, I will make this right.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her with an expression of absolute bemusement. \u201cWhat on earth can you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe necklace. I\u2019ll pay for it somehow.\u201d She clutched the banister and took another step.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move with her.</p><p>\u201cThis is absurd,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Ducking, he wrapped one arm under her thighs and lifted her straight off her feet\u2014into his arms. He carried her up the rest of her steps, and at the top of the staircase, he didn\u2019t continue up another flight to her bedchamber.</p><p>He turned toward his private suite.</p><p>Balancing her weight in one arm, he opened the latch, carried her through the entry, and kicked the door shut behind him. After toting her through a sitting room, he dropped her onto a bed.</p><p>His bed.</p><p>It was an enormous bed\u2014a four-poster of solid mahogany, with velvet hangings on all sides.</p><p>She tried to struggle up on her elbows, but her heavy gown worked against her. Before she could make any progress, he had her caged. He knelt over her, straddling her thighs.</p><p>Then he framed her face in his strong hands, forbidding her to look anywhere but at him. His eyes were wild and fierce. Her heartbeat slammed against his.</p><p>\u201cI am angry, Pauline. I have immense rage for that brigand who dared to touch you. I am furious that you\u2019ve been hurt. And I\u2019m angry with you, yes. For chasing after him, putting yourself at such risk. Do you know what kind of people lurk in those paths and alleyways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what else to do. He took your mother\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNecklace. What of it? She has dozens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is a valuable one. I know she prizes it. That\u2019s why she wanted me to wear it tonight, so . . .\u201d</p><p>So you could see me, and look at me as a true lady. So you\u2019d fall in love with me and want me to be your bride. What a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou believe I\u2019d value a strand of jewels above your life? I know we\u2019ve had our differences, Simms, but that\u2019s low. You truly think so little of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . No. I think a great deal of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to think a great deal of you, too.\u201d</p><p>Kind words, but he spoke them so viciously.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said, \u201cI can buy my mother another necklace. A better one. A half dozen of them if she likes. Jewels can be replaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can serving girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t play that game.\u201d His brow pressed to hers. \u201cWhen I heard you cry out . . . it was like a saber to the gut. I wanted to die.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to die. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The words pushed a wave of doubt through her. He couldn\u2019t mean that. Just exaggeration, surely.</p><p>\u201cI could have found you broken or bleeding, or\u2014\u201d His voice broke. \u201cOr worse. Don\u2019t tell me I care about polished rocks on a chain. I want to believe you know me better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet you believe I\u2019d be so upset about a necklace that I\u2019d send you away?\u201d</p><p>She gestured uselessly. \u201cYou\u2019d just said you didn\u2019t want me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no such thing. You ran off before I could finish.\u201d He ran a hand down her body. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t need \u2018someone.\u2019 Because you\u2019re not just someone to me. You\u2019re remarkable and stubborn and lovely and too damn brave for your own good.\u201d His hand fisted in the fabric of her gown. \u201cYou\u2019re you. I want you. From the moment you stumbled through that tavern door, I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a hand to her mouth, stifling her emotion.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He pulled her hand from her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t hide. Don\u2019t ever run from me again.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her hungrily, desperately, and she opened herself to his sensual invasion, welcoming his tongue with her own and aching to hold him tight.</p><p>With labored breaths of effort, he pulled away. His eyes burned into hers. \u201cIf I asked you to stay with me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d Stunned, she went still in his arms. \u201cYou know I couldn\u2019t. I must go home to Daniela. I promised her, and you gave us your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I offered you a home. A house in the country, with everything you and your sister could ever need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be a kept mistress. Not even yours. I\u2019d lose respect for myself, and for you.\u201d</p><p>His gaze clouded. \u201cI can\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sadness pressed down on her heart. \u201cThere\u2019s no way this can last beyond week\u2019s end.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face with one hand and stroked his thumb over her cheek. \u201cWell, know this. I am damned well going to make love to you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Excitement jolted through her.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>\u201cYes, Griff. Please.\u201d</p><p>He gathered her skirts, tugging them upward. His fingers curved around her thigh, stroking up and down. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re well enough? You\u2019re not too bruised or hurting under all this silk?\u201d</p><p>His concern for her well-being touched her heart. \u201cI promise. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll judge for myself.\u201d He turned her on her belly and began to tug at her hooks and laces. \u201cOff with these things. I\u2019ve been wild to see you naked again.\u201d</p> <p>Again? \u201cWhen did you see me naked before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat first night in the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . I was wearing my shift the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He pulled the gown down over her hips, then set about untying her petticoats. \u201cBut your shift was gloriously thin. When you stepped in front of the lamp, the light shone right through it. I could see everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>Pauline didn\u2019t know how to take that. She merely went limp as he unlaced her corset and flung it aside. Then, pulling her to a half-sitting position, he lifted the chemise up and over her head. She flopped back on the bed linens, completely nude except for her stockings.</p><p>He sat up and began to remove his own clothing. Waistcoat, cravat, shirt. She watched him as he stripped off layer after layer of elegance, down to the man beneath it all.</p><p>\u201cCor,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He was perfect. Broad in the shoulders, lean at the waist. Muscled everywhere. A sprinkling of dark hair on his chest.</p><p>He turned away, sitting on the edge of the bed to remove his boots and unbutton his breeches, giving her ample time to admire the sculpted planes of his bared back.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, tossing the last bit of clothing aside.</p><p>He stretched out beside her, and she suddenly felt abashed. He was so perfect, everywhere. The ideal form of a man. And she wasn\u2019t the ideal form of woman. Not at all.</p><p>For the first time, she felt truly unequal to him.</p><p>His gaze swept her body first, but his caress soon followed suit. He cupped her breast in his hand. She began to hope, foolishly, that he might say he liked what he saw. She didn\u2019t need to hear \u201cBeautiful\u201d or \u201cLovely\u201d or \u201cPerfect.\u201d Something like his terse \u201cGood\u201d earlier that evening would do.</p><p>When his thumb found her hardened nipple, he did something much better. He gave a low growl of satisfaction, deep in his throat. The sound was so primal and unambiguous. So utterly male. It called to everything feminine in her, and the response that welled from deep inside was a faint, sighing moan of relief.</p><p>\u201cJust as arousing as I remember,\u201d he muttered. \u201cMore. You wouldn\u2019t believe how hard you made me that first night. Every night since.\u201d</p><p>A self-conscious laugh escaped her. \u201cI\u2019m built like a fourteen-year-old boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBollocks. I\u2019ve been a fourteen-year-old boy. I tell you, my breasts were nowhere near this enticing.\u201d He traced her areola, then the curve beneath her breast.</p><p>She writhed, undone by the intense sensations. \u201cSo you\u2019re one of those men who actually likes his women small-breasted?\u201d</p><p>Her well-endowed friends had always consoled her with the promise that such men existed, but she\u2019d yet to meet with one in the flesh. She\u2019d grown to think of them as mythical beasts, in the same class as pixies and dragons.</p><p>\u201cI never understood that way of thinking.\u201d As he spoke, he kissed her breasts and swept bold touches over her belly and down her thighs. \u201cIt\u2019s like those old men who come to the club for dinner every night and always take the same meal, sitting at the same table. What good is life if a man can\u2019t appreciate variety?\u201d He drew one nipple into his mouth, circling the taut peak with his tongue.</p><p>A sigh of pleasure eased from her throat. Beyond that, she didn\u2019t know how to respond. She supposed a duke would have ample access to \u201cvariety,\u201d if he wished it. After she returned to Spindle Cove, perhaps he\u2019d find a buxom, fair-haired beauty for contrast.</p><p>As if he could sense her unease, his demeanor changed. \u201cYou\u2019re an intensely attractive woman. You do know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d To her silence, he replied, \u201cYou\u2019d believe me if you could see yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have seen myself. That\u2019s the snag, you see.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, no. Not in a mirror. I know how mirrors work. They\u2019re all in league with the cosmetics trade. They tell a woman lies. Drawing her gaze from one imagined flaw to another, until all she sees is a constellation of imperfections. If you could get outside yourself, borrow my eyes for just an instant . . . There\u2019s only beauty.\u201d He pressed his hand to his heart. \u201cI swear it on the seven Dukes of Halford before me.\u201d</p><p>Several moments passed before she could speak. \u201cWell. I\u2019ve seen their portraits. I\u2019ll concede that I\u2019m prettier than they were.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThank God for that.\u201d</p><p>He wedged his hips between her thighs, spreading her wide. The hard curve of his erection pulsed hot and urgent against her core.</p><p>\u201cLet it be now,\u201d he said, burying his face in her neck. \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll go slowly. Kiss you everywhere, touch you for hours. But I can\u2019t be patient any longer. I need . . . God, I need you. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She kissed him, tilting her hips in invitation. She needed him, too. So desperately.</p><p>He positioned himself at her entrance and thrust.</p><p>When their bodies joined, she cried out\u2014but not in pain. Despite the hurried foreplay, she was ready for him. She\u2019d been ready for days, and waiting on this sensation for years. The size and heat of him were formidable, but she welcomed both feelings. The fullness. The searing pleasure.</p><p>At last, she was with Griff. Beneath him, around him, holding him, kissing him, stroking his hair and shoulders.</p><p>At last, this was how a man made love\u2014not a fumbling youth, but a proper man. One who understood not only what he wanted, but what she wanted as well. He loved her in a smooth, powerful rhythm, delving a little deeper with every stroke. Just when she thought there couldn\u2019t be more of him to take, he proved her wrong.</p><p>At last, his pelvis met hers. He was fully buried inside her. She was stretched to her limits. The tension burned like the sweetest fire.</p><p>He lowered his body to hers, and her breasts flattened beneath his chest. Their heartbeats sparred, punching back and forth like pugilists. He began a slow, steady roll of his hips. His firmness slid in and out of her in cautious increments, teasing whorls of pleasure from her center and spreading bliss throughout her body.</p><p>He stared into her eyes, looking strangely bewildered. \u201cThis is . . . This is good, Simms. I\u2019m no stranger to pleasure, but this is . . . good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did say it\u2019s been a long time for you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMonths and months. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ages. Years.\u201d</p><p>He paused mid-stroke. \u201cI suppose that must be it.\u201d</p><p>He bent to kiss her, moaning against her lips as he eased forward. She clutched at his shoulders and back, trying to urge him faster. Deeper. Wilder. She felt sure he wasn\u2019t the sort of man to make sweet, careful love.</p><p>\u201cGriff,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>He paused. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. I\u2019m trying to be gentle.\u201d</p><p>She pushed against him just enough that she could meet his gaze. \u201cJust be you. I want you.\u201d</p><p>Something feral sparked in his eyes. He rose up on his arms and dug his knees into the mattress, thrusting hard.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped, thrilled by his strength. \u201cAgain. More.\u201d</p><p>He gave her again. He gave her more. He gave her stroke after stroke of pounding bliss, and she was utterly laid waste.</p><p>This was raw, primal sensuality, but the emotions were what made her ache. He could be teasing and nonchalant with words. But each pummeling thrust was a confession of just how much he desired her, how desperately he wanted this\u2014with every muscle in his body, every pulse of his blood.</p><p>Oh, and the intensity in his dark, captivating eyes . . . it turned her inside out. She was exposed, vulnerable in the face of such bald determination. He would hold nothing back in pursuit of this pleasure. He would give her everything he had.</p><p>She lifted her arms overhead and braced her hands against the headboard, pushing back at him with everything she had.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he grunted, never breaking pace. \u201cMove with me.\u201d</p><p>Her body arced off the bed as she strained to meet his thrusts. Their joining verged on painful, but she was beyond any such cares. She couldn\u2019t take him deep enough, couldn\u2019t stretch tautly enough around the smooth, hard curve of his cock.</p><p>The contrasts were exquisite. The two of them rutting like beasts amid all the embroidered pillows and clouds of discarded petticoats. The helplessness of her splayed posture beneath him only added to the surge of sensual power she felt. When she wrapped her stockinged leg over his hips, sliding the silk across his bare thigh, he gave a fierce, primitive growl.</p><p>He was so animal and so elegant . . . and so powerfully arousing, she couldn\u2019t possibly last.</p><p>With every stroke, his body rubbed hers in just the right place. Her head rolled back and her eyes squeezed shut. She felt the pleasure building, drawing tight all through her body. Release was so close.</p><p>He groaned deep in his chest, and the sound sent worry shooting through her. Perhaps release was close for him, too.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t discussed what would happen at the end. The anxiety was enough to drag her back from the edge.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d he said.</p><p>She opened her eyes. He was looking down at her, his face a mask of resolve. His rhythm never faltered for an instant.</p><p>\u201cI have you. Just let go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And that was when she realized . . . he wouldn\u2019t stop until she reached her peak. He just wouldn\u2019t. He would stroke on. And on. And on for hours, if she needed it. Plowing his hardness into her over and over again, just as many times as it took to reduce her to quaking, shuddering bliss.</p><p>This man would not be denied.</p><p>\u201cI have you.\u201d His whispered words were hoarse. \u201cI have you now.\u201d</p> <p>He covered her hands with his, pinning them to the bed. And she let go. Her arms went limp and her hips thrashed beneath his. Little sobs began to escape her as each thrust drove home.</p><p>Through it all, she stared into his eyes, unable to look away. Those dark eyes were her anchor.</p><p>\u201cCome. For the love of God. Come, Pauline.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her name from his lips . . . it undid her. Because it let her know this was for her. All this heroic, erotic effort was for her.</p><p>Her crisis broke, rocking her with waves of keenest pleasure. The climax went on and on\u2014battering her, body and soul, with fierce, unparalleled joy.</p> <p>He slid back on his haunches and took her by the waist, lifting her body with those powerful arms.</p><p>\u201cGriff . . .\u201d she whispered, hoping she wouldn\u2019t need to say more.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He grimaced with pleasure. With a growl and a desperate jerk of his hips, he withdrew and spent himself somewhere in all those folds of sheets and petticoats.</p><p>Afterward, he collapsed beside her on the bed, perspiring and working for breath. They lay that way for several minutes, staring wordlessly up at the bed\u2019s canopy and struggling for air.</p><p>What now? she wondered. Perhaps now that his desire was slaked, he would feel regret. Perhaps whatever emotions he\u2019d imagined he had for her were obliterated by the force of his climax.</p><p>The longer they lay there, side by side but not embracing, the more anxious she became.</p> <p>She\u2019d known this couldn\u2019t last beyond the week. But was it already over?</p><p>Finally, with a soft groan, he put an arm about her. \u201cCome here.\u201d He rolled her close and pressed a tender kiss to the crown of her head.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. She wept with relief.</p><p>He pulled her tight, tucking her head to his chest and guarding her with his body. He didn\u2019t try to stop her weeping, didn\u2019t chide her for nonsensical tears. He just allowed her to have her feelings, and he held her all the while. As though he understood that all other men had failed her in this one simple way, and he was determined to make it right.</p><p>After some time, she laid her head on his chest. \u201cI\u2019d only been with one other man before you. Errol Bright, the shopkeeper\u2019s oldest son. He said he loved me. He said a lot of things, and made a great many promises he never saw through.\u201d Her face pinched in embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you this because I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m expecting more. I don\u2019t want promises from you, Griff. But I hope you understand that I don\u2019t do this often, or with just any man. Even if it\u2019s only this once, it means something to me.\u201d</p><p>Her head rose and fell as he took a slow, deep breath. His hand found hers and clasped it. \u201cPauline? Please believe I say this in all sincerity. I am honored.\u201d</p><p>Her breath rushed out in a relieved sigh. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d been hoping to hear\u2014but what he\u2019d said was even better. There was a ring of newness in those words: I am honored. Somehow, she doubted he\u2019d spoken them to a woman before. Not in bed, at least.</p><p>She turned in his embrace, skimming a possessive touch over his chest. He groaned in encouragement. She loved that she could be free to touch him now, explore him everywhere.</p> <p>Her fingers found the red, not-quite-healed slash on his biceps, and she traced it. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not . . . not there.\u201d</p><p>His words had the deep resonance of a confession. She treasured those two syllables of raw honesty.</p><p>\u201cIs it this?\u201d she asked, touching the small bruise on his cheek from where she\u2019d punched him yesterday.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere else, then.\u201d She dropped her hand to his bare chest, covering his thudding heart. \u201cSomewhere deep inside. You\u2019re hurting.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cLike the devil.\u201d</p><p>Her curiosity was intense, but she resisted the urge to press him for explanations or details. He\u2019d trusted her with this much. Perhaps he would trust her with more, in time.</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss it better?\u201d She gave him a playful smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He thoughtfully brushed a lock of hair from her face. The glint in his eyes went from wounded to wicked. \u201cBut I could be persuaded to lie very still while you exhaust yourself in the attempt.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>In another hour\u2019s time they\u2019d exhausted each other.</p><p>Griff stroked her hair, forcing himself to relax and surrender to the simple pleasure of being kissed. Her lips touched his chest, his shoulders, his neck, his belly. She was as thorough as she was sweet, covering every inch of him with tender brushes of her lips. She didn\u2019t manage to heal all his deepest, darkest wounds with her attentions\u2014but she made his mind go blank, which was almost as good.</p><p>And when her tongue traced a path from his navel downward, he reached a breaking point.</p><p>\u201cI need you again.\u201d He took her by the waist and lifted her above him, trapping his hard, aching cock at the apex of her cleft. \u201cTake it in your hand. Guide me in.\u201d</p><p>If she felt any trepidation at his bold request, she didn\u2019t show it.</p><p>A rosy flush bloomed over her chest as she reached between them. She held him in place as he moved her slowly down, lowering her heat to envelop his full length.</p><p>She fit him like a well-made glove, hugging him tight as he guided her up and down, teaching her how to ride him.</p><p>Clever girl that she was, she caught the spirit and rhythm of it soon enough. Her palms braced flat against his chest, pinning him to the bed. Her thighs flexed as she dragged herself up and down. Those pert, delicious breasts bounced and swayed. If he\u2019d ever beheld a more erotic view, he couldn\u2019t recall it.</p><p>\u201cSimms.\u201d</p><p>She moaned, lost in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cSimms,\u201d he said again.</p><p>Her eyes opened, drowsy and heavy-lidded as she looked down at him.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since you last made love?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cTwenty minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Same for me. Give or take thirty seconds.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she braced her hands on his chest. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the first time was shockingly good.\u201d He guided her up and down again. \u201cBut this . . . this is extraordinary. Even better. I\u2019m trying to understand. It can\u2019t merely be the long drought, can it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always talk this much while making love?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. That\u2019s different, too. Everything is different with you.\u201d</p><p>Tighter, sleeker, hotter, wetter, sweeter. Not dreamlike or perfect, just more real. And so damn good, he feared hurting them both in that mad, frantic race to the end.</p><p>He struggled to a sitting position. It wasn\u2019t enough to watch. He wanted to feel her breasts\u2019 softness and heat caressing his bare chest. Cushioning the mad beat of his heart.</p><p>He wanted to kiss her as he made love to her.</p><p>He brought her close, guiding her legs over his hips and locking her ankles at the small of his back.</p><p>With one arm wrapped tight about her waist, he guided her in a brisk rhythm. He worked the other hand between them and pressed his thumb to her pearl, working the nub in small, tight circles until she seized and shuddered in his arms.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t stop. There would be no laziness with her, no half measures. This woman was going to get his best. He kept up the same attentions, kissing her neck and murmuring words of praise against her ear until she reached another, more devastating peak.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she whimpered in the aftermath, clinging to his neck. \u201cOh, Griff. Oh, God.\u201d</p><p>Her words made him feel like a god. Or at least a demigod. A pagan, rutting, immortal being of pleasure.</p><p>He would have tried to bring her to a third crisis, but the clasping heat of her sex had pulled him too close to the edge. He lifted her off his cock, and she reached between them to encircle his erection with her small, delicate hand.</p><p>\u201cLike this,\u201d he said, demonstrating.</p><p>She followed his lead. \u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Her grip was gentle, but strong. Her thumb rubbed perfectly along the sensitive underside of his shaft, and with each tug, his crown grazed the silky slope of her belly. He threw his head back in surrender, clutching at the twisted sheets. Within moments she had him gasping, growling\u2014and spilling over her fingers in hot, forceful jets.</p><p>She smiled, looking very pleased with herself.</p><p>He was pleased with her, too. So damned pleased, there seemed no room for any other emotion in his heart. In his life.</p><p>And it couldn\u2019t last. It couldn\u2019t last.</p><p>God, he didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d ever let her go.</p><p>So he kissed her instead, wrapping his arms about her torso to haul her close. Using their closeness to conceal his weakness.</p><p>After lazy, lovely minutes of deep, languid kissing, she sighed against his lips. \u201cI should leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gripped her tight. \u201cNo, no, no. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t risk falling asleep. You know I must go to my room. We can\u2019t be found here together. The servants . . .\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe servants are servants. Who cares what they think?\u201d</p><p>She pulled back and blinked at him.</p><p>He winced. \u201cI beg you. Pretend I didn\u2019t say that. Or at least pretend you didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Moving off his lap, she reached for her discarded chemise. After untangling the shift, she slipped it over her head and pushed her arms through the cap sleeves. \u201cI don\u2019t want to quarrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a new development.\u201d He tugged at his ear.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to waste what we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it we have?\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze. \u201cA few days,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd a few more nights together. That\u2019s assuming we\u2019re not discovered tonight.\u201d</p><p>He would have liked to argue the point, but in the end he couldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ll see you back to your bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, stay. Rest.\u201d She pushed him back against the bed with a hand to his shoulder and a firm kiss to his brow. \u201cI won\u2019t get lost in the corridors this time.\u201d</p><p>She gathered her discarded gown and stockings into a bundle, then made her way toward the side door\u2014the one that opened onto his dressing room.</p><p>\u201cAre these rooms all connected?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf I slip from one to the next, I won\u2019t have to travel so much of the corridor. I\u2019ll be much less likely to be seen.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, suddenly drowsy. She\u2019d sapped him of everything. \u201cYes, they\u2019re connected.\u201d</p><p>She plucked a candlestick from the night table, then headed through the dressing room.</p><p>He lay back, listening. He heard her opening the door that led from the dressing room to his personal sitting room. From there, she could slip out into the corridor or cross into\u2014</p><p>Oh, Christ.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He launched from the bed, stumbling into his trousers in pursuit. As he dashed through the dressing room, he snagged a fresh shirt from a hook. \u201cWait, Pauline. Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Too late.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d she said, standing in the center of the room.</p><p>The room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I truly didn\u2019t mean to invade your . . .\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201c . . . your privacy.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his neck with one hand. No getting around it now. He\u2019d have to face this at last. He was seized by the terrible lightness of inevitability. The sense of just having jumped off a cliff. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you paint all these?\u201d she asked, holding the candlestick aloft. \u201cThey\u2019re, uh . . . they\u2019re lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t paint them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good. I mean, not that there\u2019s something wrong with a grown man painting a room with rainbows and ponies. They are quite nice rainbows and ponies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you truly think so?\u201d He crossed his arms and leaned against the wall.</p> <p>\u201cOh. Yes. How could I not? They\u2019re . . . why, on this wall they\u2019re frolicking, aren\u2019t they? Just look at them, frolicking and\u2014\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201c\u2014prancing.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. She was utterly flummoxed, trying to find some way not to give offense. For no particular reason, she was valiantly striving to spare his feelings. Making a hash of it, but the thought was sweet.</p><p>\u201cI so admire the way this one\u2019s mane is rippling in the breeze. Quite majestic.\u201d Her head tilted to the side. \u201cIn the meadow, are those buttercups?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. He laughed. It felt good to laugh in this room. It was a place he\u2019d planned to fill with smiles and laughter, but God had taken all his careful plans and torn them to shreds.</p><p>\u201cThe ponies are ridiculous,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThe artist who painted them specialized in portraits of Arabian racehorses. His patron owed me a gambling debt, so I engaged his services for this room. He got rather carried away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what do you do in here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot much of anything. It was never finished, as you see.\u201d He waved toward the blank southern wall. \u201cThe decor wasn\u2019t intended to please me. It was meant to appeal to feminine tastes.\u201d</p><p>Her expression battened. \u201cOh. I see. So you planned to move a woman into your house. Into your suite. A woman who likes rainbows and ponies.\u201d</p><p>He rather liked the obvious envy in her tone, and he might have teased it out a bit longer\u2014had the truth been any different.</p><p>\u201cNot a woman, Pauline. A little girl.\u201d A knot formed in his throat, and he cleared it with an impatient cough. \u201cMy little girl.\u201d</p><p>Pauline watched him closely for any signs of teasing. She found none.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a daughter?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . had a daughter. She died in infancy.\u201d</p><p>Her breath left her. She\u2019d known something was weighing on him, but she\u2019d never imagined this. He\u2019d lost a child? The other day at the Foundling Hospital\u2014of course the atmosphere had rattled him. It wasn\u2019t any wonder he\u2019d wanted to leave. And then to have that baby thrust in his arms . . .</p><p>The poor man. How the landslide must have flattened him. She\u2019d been so insensitive without even realizing.</p><p>\u201cOh, Griff. I\u2019m sorry. So, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSuch things happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps. But that doesn\u2019t make them any less sad.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to go to him. But when she took a step in his direction, he began to pace the room, evasive.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s why the room was never completed.\u201d He walked about the perimeter of the chamber, stopping at the window. \u201cNever got around to installing the nursery grate. There wasn\u2019t time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother has no idea?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe was in the country at the time. I\u2019ve kept this chamber locked ever since . . . Well, ever since it became unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should tell her the truth. She\u2019s noticed there\u2019s something going on in here. She thinks you\u2019re sacrificing kittens, or living out perverse fantasies.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNo wonder you looked so shocked at the paintings. I can\u2019t imagine what you must have thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care to admit to it.\u201d She swept another glance around the room. \u201cSo your little girl\u2019s mother was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistress,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cFormer mistress.\u201d</p><p>Former mistress. Try as she might, Pauline couldn\u2019t bring herself to express condolences on that part of things. \u201cDid you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It was purely physical.\u201d He pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cShe was an opera singer, and we . . . It\u2019s disgraceful, I know. But it\u2019s far too easy for men of my station to get away with such arrangements. It\u2019s just the done thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make excuses, Griff,\u201d she said. \u201cNot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had any excuses, I would owe them to you first and foremost. But I don\u2019t. We weren\u2019t close. I saw her less and less, and I was on the verge of breaking it off entirely. Then she told me she\u2019d conceived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you happy to hear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was furious. I\u2019ve always been so careful, and she\u2019d assured me she was careful, too.\u201d He paced the room again. \u201cBut I accepted my responsibility. I set her up in a cottage a short ride into the country, where she could wait out her confinement. I arranged for a maid and a midwife, set aside funds to support the child. Because that\u2019s what men of my station do, when they impregnate their mistresses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the done thing,\u201d she supplied.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI visited her in the new cottage, to see that she was settled and to make my final assurances of support. And just as I was about to leave, she grabbed my hand . . .\u201d He regarded the blank wall, as though the distant memory were painted there. \u201cThat alone was a shock. We never held hands. But anyhow, she grabbed my hand and plastered it flat to her belly.\u201d He held his open hand outstretched in demonstration. \u201cAnd the child\u2014my child\u2014gave me a wallop of a kick.\u201d</p><p>He slowly brought his hand to his chest. \u201cSo strong. This little life\u2014a life I\u2019d helped create\u2014declaring itself in such fierce, unspoken terms. I swear, that kick split my heart wide-open. Had me reeling for days.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little to herself.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, I couldn\u2019t stay away. I went back, again and again. Visited her more often than I ever had in Town, just to lay my hands on her swelling stomach. Did you know babies can get the hiccups, even in the womb?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head no.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, either. But they can. I was enchanted by each little jump. I can\u2019t even explain it. For the first time in my life I was . . .\u201d</p><p>Falling in love, she finished in her mind. Because he wouldn\u2019t say it aloud, but the truth was plain. He\u2019d fallen headlong, irretrievably in love with his own child, and in love with the idea of fatherhood. The loopy joy of it was written all over his face\u2014and frolicking all over the walls of this room.</p><p>\u201cHer family was in Austria. With the war finally over, she wanted to go home\u2014but she didn\u2019t think they\u2019d accept her with an illegitimate child. She asked me to find a family here to foster the babe. I told her no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided I would raise my own child. In my house, with my name.\u201d</p><p>Pauline gazed at him in quiet admiration. For a duke to raise a bastard child in his own home, with his own family name . . . that would be extraordinary.</p><p>It was most decidedly not the done thing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I cleared this chamber and brought in the artist.\u201d He stopped in the center of the room and looked to the ceiling. \u201cI know nurseries are usually up in the dormer rooms, but I didn\u2019t like that idea. I wanted her close.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the room\u2019s lone blank wall for several moments. \u201cI never had the chance to bring her here. She caught a fever that first week. It\u2019s been months now. I should repaint, but I haven\u2019t found the will to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one knows of your loss? Not your friends, either?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>Her heart ached for him. Naturally he\u2019d been withdrawn these past months. He\u2019d been grieving. And what was worse, grieving all alone. The duchess thought him reluctant to have children, and the truth was just the opposite. He\u2019d been ready to welcome his daughter with an open heart\u2014and then all his hopes were crushed.</p><p>She wanted to take him to bed and just hold him, for days and days.</p><p>\u201cSo you see,\u201d he said, \u201cI truly don\u2019t need a fresh-faced young thing to teach me the meaning of love, make me want to be a better man. I already found that girl. She was about so big\u201d\u2014he held his hands just a foot apart\u2014\u201cwith very little hair and no teeth. She taught me exactly what would give me true happiness in this life. And that I can never have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not true. In time you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t. You don\u2019t understand. My father was an only child. My mother bore three other children after me. None of them survived a week. I was young, but I remember the whole house in mourning. That\u2019s why I delayed even attempting a family until the issue was forced\u2014precisely because I\u2019m the last of the line. All those generations of difficult childbearing didn\u2019t bode well for my chances. But then that fierce little kick . . . It gave me hope that things could be different.\u201d</p><p>She went to his side and touched his arm.</p><p>He steeled his jaw. \u201cI can\u2019t go through that again. The Halford line ends with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound very resolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He looked around at the room. \u201cI trust you won\u2019t tell anyone about this.\u201d</p><p>She knew he wasn\u2019t concerned about her telling just \u201canyone.\u201d He didn\u2019t want his mother to know.</p><p>\u201cYou have my word, I won\u2019t tell her. But I think you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cShe can\u2019t know this. Ever. I\u2019m serious, Pauline. That\u2019s the whole reason I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole reason you brought me here. I know. I see it now.\u201d</p><p>She understood, at last. It wasn\u2019t simply that he was a rakish libertine, reluctant to marry. He\u2019d decided he couldn\u2019t marry, and he didn\u2019t know how to break the news. The duchess wanted grandchildren so desperately. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell her she had one grandchild she\u2019d already lost, and now there\u2019d never be another.</p><p>He knew it would break his mother\u2019s heart.</p><p>So he\u2019d kept his grief a secret, determined to manfully shoulder all the heartbreak himself.</p><p>\u201cGriff, you needn\u2019t go through this alone. If you won\u2019t tell the duchess, I\u2019m here for a few more days. At least talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what I just did? Talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Not really.</p><p>Throughout their conversation, his tone had been so calm. Almost eerily matter-of-fact. She knew it was a fa\u00e7ade. He hadn\u2019t been able to fully grieve. It wasn\u2019t possible to do so in a cold, secret room. He needed to talk, to rage, to cry, to remember.</p><p>He needed a friend.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been locking all your grief away. Months and months of it now. You can try to keep it secret, pretend it\u2019s not there. But until you open your heart, give it a good airing out\u2014no sunlight can come in.\u201d</p><p>She reached for his hand. \u201cWon\u2019t you tell me more about her? Did she favor you or her mother\u2019s side? Did she smile and coo? What was her name?\u201d</p><p>He remained silent.</p><p>\u201cYou must have loved her very much.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and pulled away. \u201cYou\u2019d better go. The servants will be coming around soon to lay fires.\u201d</p><p>So that was that. As close as they\u2019d come today, as much as they\u2019d shared . . . it still wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>She nodded, then moved to quit the room. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>\u201cGood heavens. This is the worst yet.\u201d</p><p>In the morning room the following day, her grace was most displeased.</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d Pauline leaned forward on her yellow-striped chair.</p><p>The older woman held up her knitting needles. From one of them dangled a grayish, shapeless lump with no conceivable function. It resembled nothing so much as a dead rat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is rather hideous,\u201d Pauline had to admit.</p><p>\u201cWrong. It is hideous.\u201d The duchess clucked her tongue. \u201cHideous. Back to your diction exercises, girl. We\u2019ve made great strides, but those H\u2019s must be clear by tomorrow night. We can\u2019t have you curtsying before \u2019Is Royal \u2019Eyeness, now can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be going anywhere near the Prince Regent at all.\u201d</p> <p>Just the thought made her stomach twist. There was to be a ball at Carlton House, the Prince Regent\u2019s own residence, tomorrow. The duchess had seized on the invitation as Pauline\u2019s last and best chance to make a splash in London society.</p><p>\u201cEven if I can say proper H\u2019s, I don\u2019t belong in a palace. Your grace, I wish you\u2019d abandon the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not abandoning anything. It\u2019s our only remaining chance, after last night.\u201d</p><p>When Pauline had appeared at breakfast that morning and Griff had not, the duchess concluded that her Vauxhall hopes had been for naught. Though her assumptions about the intervening hours might be faulty, she had the end result correct.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you,\u201d Pauline said. \u201cI\u2019ve told you and told you, he won\u2019t marry me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps not willingly.\u201d The duchess resumed her seat and began furiously working her needles again. \u201cBut he will be forced to propose tomorrow. That was the bargain. If I make you the toast of London, he promised to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Pauline shook her head. \u201cYou must accept reality, your grace. It\u2019s just not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I know it looks unlikely. But this is the point where we rally and make a triumphant finish. Diction this morning. I have a dancing master coming by the house later. We\u2019ll practice your curtsy and greetings, too. I\u2019ve bought you a set of lovely chimes to replace your water goblets. And of course, we\u2019ve ordered the finest gown available. I\u2019m not surrendering.\u201d She held up her hideous knitting. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>With a resigned sigh, Pauline cracked open the Bible. \u201cHoly,\u201d she read aloud. \u201cHe. Hath. Hosanna.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye she glimpsed a familiar figure entering the room.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell.\u201d</p> <p>Griff.</p><p>So many impulses flooded her. She wanted to fly to him, hug him, shake him, kiss him, tackle him to the carpet. She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d even look at him without giving everything away.</p><p>But she needn\u2019t have worried. The duchess was too mortified to notice Pauline\u2019s reaction.</p><p>The woman jumped to her feet. That ghastly gray rat still dangled from her knitting needles, and she had nowhere to hide it.</p><p>The duke frowned at his mother, then dropped his gaze to the knitting. \u201cWhat on earth is that?\u201d</p><p>A very good question\u2014and one Pauline hoped the duchess would now be forced to finally, honestly, answer.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d the duchess asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. That.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will tell you exactly what this is.\u201d She lifted her chin, then turned to Pauline. \u201cIt\u2019s exceedingly poor handiwork. Very bad indeed, Miss Simms. I expected better of you.\u201d She cast the entire mess of yarn into the coal grate.</p><p>Pauline rolled her eyes at the Bible. \u201cHypocrite,\u201d she pronounced softly, with perfect diction.</p><p>Ignoring her, the duchess smoothed her hands down the front of her gown. \u201cWell, what is it?\u201d she asked her son.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>Hope jumped in Pauline\u2019s chest. Perhaps he\u2019d changed his mind, seen the benefit to revealing his painful secrets and unburdening his heart. She looked up from the Bible and sent him an encouraging look. Please. You\u2019ll feel so much lighter.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t even turn her way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent your amethysts to the jeweler for repair,\u201d he told his mother smoothly. \u201cThe clasp broke while Miss Simms was wearing them last night.\u201d</p><p>Pauline released her breath, frustrated. There went her hopes of honesty.</p><p>The duchess\u2019s eyes narrowed to suspicious slits. \u201cIt broke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He tweaked a button on his cuff. The ducal calm was in top form this morning. \u201cYou\u2019ll have them back in a few days.\u201d</p><p>Surely the duchess would, Pauline thought. Just as soon as the jeweler had time to recreate the entire piece, in meticulous detail, so the duchess could never know the difference. What an absurd amount of effort. Why didn\u2019t he just tell her the jewels had been stolen? Pauline would feel much better.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain it can be repaired?\u201d the duchess asked. \u201cPerhaps I should have a look at it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. Just a simple matter of mending the clasp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d Pauline interjected.</p><p>When the duke and duchess swung on her with questioning gazes, she pointed one finger at the Bible page and added:</p><p>\u201c\u2014llelujah.\u201d</p><p>Why didn\u2019t anyone in this family simply talk to each other? For the entire season, they\u2019d been residing in the same house, dining at the same table . . . and all the while holding these deep secrets. The duchess was desperate for creatures to comfort. Meanwhile, her own son needed a great deal of comforting. Pauline was caught in the middle\u2014everyone\u2019s confidante, but sworn to secrecy on all sides. This was miserable.</p><p>They were privileged in so many ways\u2014wealthy, well-placed, well-regarded among their peers. But mostly they were just so damned lucky, the two of them, to have each other. Only their aristocratic reserve was in the way.</p><p>\u201cHogwash,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Griff snapped his fingers at her. \u201cVerse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChapter and verse.\u201d He craned his neck, looking over her shoulder. \u201cI should like to know where, precisely, in St. Paul\u2019s letter to the Ephesians, he uses the word \u2018hogwash.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She twisted in her chair, shielding the Bible from his view. \u201cIt\u2019s penciled in the margin.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one who could prevaricate.</p><p>\u201cSomeone scribbled in the family Bible?\u201d The duchess arched a brow at Griff.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me. You know I never read the thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d The duchess rang the bell, and when the housemaid appeared, instructed her to bring every servant into the room.</p><p>Once they were all lined in a perfect row, from Higgs the butler down to Margaret the scullery maid, her grace addressed them.</p><p>\u201cSomeone has vandalized the Holy Scriptures. Let the offender come forward.\u201d</p><p>No one came forward, of course. So Pauline did.</p><p>\u201cI made it up,\u201d she said, rising from her chair. \u201cAnd there\u2019s more you should know, your grace. The duke\u2019s keeping something from you.\u201d</p><p>The room went utterly silent.</p><p>And the look Griff sent her\u2014oh, it chilled her to the marrow. It was a hard glare brimming with anger, betrayal. Don\u2019t you dare, that look said.</p><p>She knew in that moment, if she broke her word to him and revealed the truth of his daughter, he would never forgive her. It wouldn\u2019t matter that he cared for her, or what pleasure they\u2019d shared last night. He would excise her from his life completely, even if it felt like slicing off his own arm.</p><p>She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cThe amethysts,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe duke is good to shield me, but he\u2019s not telling the whole truth, your grace. The clasp didn\u2019t break on its own. A thief tore it from my neck.\u201d</p><p>The assembled servants gasped.</p><p>\u201cOh, Miss Simms,\u201d the housekeeper said. \u201cYou weren\u2019t hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she assured all of them, grateful for their concern. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. But my reputation took a few blows. I might have chased after the thief, shouting blasphemy all through the pavilions of Vauxhall. And the necklace is gone.\u201d She turned to the duchess. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. But I feel much better, having told the truth. As they say, confession is good for the soul. While we\u2019re all assembled here, perhaps there are other secrets weighing heavy on our minds. Matters that would benefit from fresh air and sunlight.\u201d</p><p>She looked from Griff to the duchess and back.</p><p>For the love of God. Just talk to each other.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d someone said. \u201cMiss Simms is right. I\u2019ve done wrong and I must confess.\u201d</p><p>In the corner, Cook was wringing her apron. Tears rolled down her floury cheeks. \u201cLast month, her grace ordered turbot for dinner. Well, I searched and searched the market, and there weren\u2019t any turbot to be had.\u201d She buried her face in her apron. \u201cI served you cod. Cod. I sauced it heavily so no one could tell. But I\u2019ve felt terrible about it ever since.\u201d</p><p>Pauline went to the crying woman\u2019s side and offered a sympathetic pat. \u201cThere there. I\u2019m certain her grace will be forgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let a cinder fall on the drawing room carpet,\u201d one of the housemaids blurted. \u201cIt burnt a hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you feel better now for having the truth out in the open?\u201d Pauline asked.</p><p>The housemaid sniffed and raised her head. \u201cI do, Miss Simms. I truly do. It\u2019s like a weight\u2019s been lifted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad. No one should live under the burden of secrets.\u201d</p><p>Young Margaret spoke up, eager to have her part. \u201cI saw Lawrence in the pantry, fumbling with a housemaid!\u201d</p><p>The duchess straightened her spine. \u201cLawrence.\u201d</p><p>The footman in question paled.</p><p>The duchess addressed the housemaids sternly. \u201cWhich one of you was it? Step forward now.\u201d</p><p>Three of them did, in unison. When they looked around the room and realized they weren\u2019t alone, they each turned on Lawrence with vicious glares.</p><p>Lawrence twisted under their anger. \u201cI . . . I . . .\u201d He thrust his chin forward. \u201cHiggs wears a corset!\u201d</p><p>If he meant to divert attention from himself, he succeeded. All around the room, eyebrows soared.</p><p>Poor Higgs. His cheeks went beet red. \u201cIt\u2019s not a ladies\u2019 corset. A butler must cut a respectable figure.\u201d</p><p>For a long, uncomfortable moment, no one had anything to say.</p><p>And then . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not French.\u201d</p><p>This came from Fleur.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the duchess exclaimed. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m n-not.\u201d The lady\u2019s maid gave her confession in halting, poorly enunciated English. Her accent was even more common than Pauline\u2019s, and she had a painful stammer. \u201cI knew I\u2019d never f-f-find a lady\u2019s maid post, speaking as I do. So I let on that I was French and full of airs, so\u2019s I wouldn\u2019t have to talk. My real name\u2019s Fl-Fl-Flora. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ll pack me things.\u201d</p><p>She fled the room in tears.</p><p>The duchess went after her. \u201cFleur\u2014or, Flora . . . Whoever, you are, wait!\u201d</p><p>In their absence, a stunned silence filled the morning room.</p><p>Griff clapped his hands together. \u201cWell. Thank you, Miss Simms. This has been a most illuminating morning.\u201d</p><p>Pauline put a hand to her temple. Oh, Lord.</p><p>The doorbell rang. No one moved.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a thought,\u201d said Griff. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I answer that?\u201d</p><p>Higgs shook himself and lurched into motion. \u201cYour grace, allow me.\u201d</p><p>Griff held up a hand. \u201cNo, no. I confess, I have long harbored a deep, secret yearning to answer my own door.\u201d</p><p>As he left the room, Pauline dashed after him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had no idea all that would happen. But don\u2019t you see? This house is full of secrets, and it\u2019s making everyone unhappy. No one more than you. You need to disclose your sorrows, open your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I\u2019m opening right now is the front door.\u201d He strode to the entrance and yanked on the door latch. When he saw the visitors standing outside, he muttered, \u201cBrilliant. Just what this morning needs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pauline froze in disbelief. On the doorstep stood not one, but two familiar people. The woman she\u2019d known in Spindle Cove as Miss Minerva Highwood. And Miss Minerva\u2019s husband\u2014Colin Sandhurst, Lord Payne.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Minerva said, pushing past the duke to catch Pauline in a desperate hug. \u201cNever fear, Pauline. We\u2019ve come to save you.\u201d</p><p>Having opened the door, Griff took on the duty of closing it. As he did so, he felt heartily sorry that these two visitors were on the wrong side.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been too long, Halford.\u201d Payne offered a hand and a genial smile.</p><p>Not long enough. For his part, he could have lasted a week or two more.</p><p>Lady Payne looked up at him, eyes burning with violence behind those wire-rimmed spectacles. \u201cYou revolting trilobite.\u201d</p><p>Charming. And here he had been wondering what Payne saw in the girl.</p><p>\u201cIf only I hadn\u2019t left my reticule at home,\u201d she said bitterly.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what that signified, but he supposed this wasn\u2019t a conversation to conduct in the entrance hall.</p><p>Griff showed them to his study\u2014it was one room he felt certain would not be occupied by a sobbing housemaid. Ringing for tea seemed a chancy prospect. He poured Payne a brandy and made the offer of a cordial to the ladies. Another episode in today\u2019s adventures in self-sufficiency.</p><p>\u201cPauline, what\u2019s happened?\u201d Payne\u2019s excitable wife asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s he done to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, he\u2019s only employed me. I\u2019m in this house working as a companion to his mother, the duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really.\u201d Lady Payne\u2019s voice was rich with skepticism. \u201cAnd where is the duchess now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is upstairs,\u201d Griff said. \u201cDealing with a small crisis of the house staff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d she huffed. \u201cServants in this house are often unhappy.\u201d She slid her gaze between Pauline and Griff. \u201cAnd I\u2019m to believe nothing untoward has happened between you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re to believe it\u2019s none of your concern,\u201d Griff answered. \u201cWhy are you so suspicious of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suspicious. My dislike of you is formed on abundant evidence. I\u2019ve been to that ghastly pleasure palace you keep.\u201d She turned to Pauline. \u201cDo you know he has a den of iniquity in the country?\u201d</p><p>Pauline shook her head. \u201cNo, my lady. It wouldn\u2019t be my business to know that.\u201d</p><p>Griff frowned. Why had she become so docile and compliant all of a sudden? This was hardly the same Pauline he knew. Certainly not the same Pauline who\u2019d pressed him back against his bed last night and dragged her tongue over every inch of his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called Winterset Grange. I was there last year,\u201d his bespectacled inquisitioner continued, speaking to Pauline. \u201cColin and I stopped the night there on our journey to Scotland. Oh, it was disgusting.\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>\u201cNot so disgusting that you declined my hospitality,\u201d Griff said, leaning against the desk and crossing his arms. \u201cAnd if you\u2019ll forgive me for saying it, Lady Payne, I\u2019m not sure you have the moral high ground in this particular tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy your own admission, you\u2019d run away from your family with a scandalous rake. And, I might add, lied to my face about your identity. I seem to remember Payne introducing you as Melissande, some sort of long-lost Alpine princess and cold-blooded assassin who spoke not a word of English. I mean, really. An Alpine princess-assassin. You will call me depraved?\u201d</p><p>She sat tall, indignant. \u201cYou made inappropriate overtures to me. And you suggested Colin wager my favors in a game of cards. What can you say to that?\u201d</p><p>He spread his hands. \u201cAlpine. Princess. Assassin.\u201d</p><p>She fumed at him.</p><p>Griff said, \u201cI admit that the scene you wandered into was one of flagrant vice. I\u2019m just pointing out that you were hardly the saint in the lion\u2019s den. Isn\u2019t it conceivable that we\u2019ve all changed in the past year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t change that much,\u201d she said. \u201cNot in essentials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong,\u201d he replied angrily. \u201cIn essentials.\u201d</p><p>He stalked toward the window. This conversation was making him angry, and a little bit afraid. It had been a full year since he\u2019d engaged in anything like Lady Payne described. His heart and his life had fundamentally changed. And no one saw it. Not Payne, whom he\u2019d once thought a close friend. Not even his own mother. Society still linked him with opulent debauchery, and those assumptions would color the way they perceived anyone close to him\u2014including Pauline.</p><p>So this was the price he paid for a misspent youth. Last autumn he\u2019d wanted nothing more than to give his daughter a respectable life. Perhaps it was best she hadn\u2019t lived to feel the brunt of his failure. She would have been ashamed to be his.</p><p>He tossed back a large swallow of brandy, feeling it burn all the way down.</p><p>Payne approached him and spoke in confidential tones. \u201cListen, Halford. My wife can be protective, but we\u2019re truly not here to grill you on your life choices. We\u2019re just concerned for Pauline. I spent many dark nights in that village tavern. It\u2019s not much of a stretch to say her friendly smile and quickness with a pint saved my life a time or two. She\u2019s a sweet girl, and she means well.\u201d</p><p>He bit back a curse. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her at all. You never took the time to learn anything about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know her family situation. I know she hasn\u2019t anyone to look out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does now,\u201d Griff said. The words came from his gut.</p><p>Payne\u2019s eyebrows lifted meaningfully. \u201cOh, does she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re certain that\u2019s what she wants, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an intelligent, free-thinking adult. Ask her.\u201d With a gruff sigh, Griff moved away from his conference with Payne. \u201cMiss Simms, if you are concerned about my personal history, or unhappy with the terms of our arrangement\u2014if you want to leave this house for any reason at all\u2014I will write you a bank draft this moment, and you can go with Lord and Lady Payne.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze alternated back and forth between him and their visitors. As though she were giving it close, thoughtful consideration.</p><p>Good God. Perhaps she did want to leave him.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he asked again, somewhat hoarsely this time. \u201cDo you want to go?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Pauline halfheartedly wished she had the strength to say yes. It would be the easiest way. She and Griff would have to part eventually, and the parting would only grow more difficult.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t go this morning. Because she loved him. She loved him, and she couldn\u2019t let him go just yet.</p><p>\u201cNo, your grace,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d He turned to Minerva. \u201cI assume you\u2019re satisfied.\u201d</p><p>Lady Payne didn\u2019t even speak to him, instead approaching Pauline. She pushed a small square of paper into her hand. \u201cHere is our calling card. I\u2019ve written our direction on the back, and Lady Rycliff\u2019s as well. If you need anything\u2014anything at all\u2014you can always come to us. Day or night, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Pauline nodded. \u201cYou are very good, the both of you. I\u2019m grateful for your concern.\u201d</p><p>Even if she didn\u2019t need it, it felt good to know they cared.</p><p>Griff showed them out. When he returned, he was glowering. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They seemed to have the wrong idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t leap to correct them. You barely spoke at all, except for all that \u2018your grace\u2019-ing and \u2018my lord and lady\u2019-ing.\u201d</p><p>He was angry with her? \u201cWhat else should I say? He is a lord. She is a lady. And you are a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut on intellect and character, you are the equal of anyone in the room. Why would you defer so easily to them, when you\u2019ve never been anything but impertinent with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different with you. Everything\u2019s different with you. But you can\u2019t blame this all on me. You were rather standoffish yourself. It\u2019s not as though you jumped to tell them we\u2019re having a deeply passionate affaire.\u201d</p><p>He waved at the door. \u201cBecause I knew how they\u2019d receive it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. The same way everyone would receive that news. As an impossibility, at best. At worst, something shameful and sordid.\u201d</p><p>Pauline understood why he was upset. She felt the same way. The people who\u2019d just visited them were the closest thing they had to mutual friends, and if even they wouldn\u2019t credit a relationship between Griff and her, it was truly hopeless. No one would accept them together. No one.</p><p>She sighed. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. It didn\u2019t matter what the poems said. There was no other England, no other London with its Tower. There was only this world they lived in, and it was unyielding on matters of class.</p><p>\u201cThere are thirty-three ranks of precedence between a serving girl and a duchess,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cDid you know that? The chart takes up three pages in Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom. I have it all in my head. Duchesses are at the very top\u2014after the queen and princesses, of course. The order goes duchesses, marchionesses, countesses . . .\u201d</p><p>As she recited the ranks, she ticked them off on her fingers. \u201c . . . then wives of the eldest sons of marquesses, then wives of the younger sons of dukes. Then come the daughters. Daughters of dukes, daughters of marquesses. Next viscountesses, then wives of eldest sons of earls. Then daughters of earls . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPauline.\u201d</p><p>\u201c . . . that\u2019s ten ranks already, and I\u2019m not even to baronesses yet. Let alone all the orders of knighthood and the military ranks. And below those, you have\u2014\u201d</p><p>He approached her and tipped her face, forcing her to look him in the eye. \u201cPauline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even on the chart.\u201d She blinked hard. \u201cA girl like me, Griff . . . I\u2019m so far below you. When we\u2019re alone together, we might be able to forget it. But no one else will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it? You think I forget who you are when we\u2019re together?\u201d</p><p>She fidgeted. He must forget, a little. From their very first meeting, he\u2019d afforded her more respect and attention than any nobleman would ever intentionally give a servant. \u201cWhat matters is, we have to remember ourselves eventually. If we don\u2019t, society will force the point.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a long moment. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right. We should remember ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you agree.\u201d</p><p>He crossed the room, closed the study door, and turned the key in the lock. The tumbler gave an ominous click.</p><p>\u201cClear the desk, Simms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue,\u201d he clipped. \u201cYou\u2019re a serving girl, and you wanted me to recall it. I\u2019m the duke in the room, and I\u2019ve bid you to clear the desk. It\u2019s what you do, isn\u2019t it? Clear tables?\u201d</p><p>Is that what he was initiating, then? Playing roles? The libertine duke and the naughty serving girl?</p><p>Well . . . After about two seconds\u2019 pause, Pauline decided she could get inspired for that.</p><p>She reached for the inkwell and cautiously moved it to a nearby lamp table, where it wouldn\u2019t spill. Then with one hand, she made a broad sweep across the desktop, sending blotter, papers, sealing wax, and more crashing to the floor. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch impertinence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you like.\u201d</p><p>He tugged at his cravat, loosening it as he crossed the room. \u201cYou need to learn your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this my place, your grace?\u201d She pushed herself up to sit on the desktop, legs dangling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor now.\u201d He sat in the desk chair before her, boots sprawled on either side of her dangling legs, and fixed her with a dark, commanding gaze.</p><p>The moment stretched into a thin, brittle thing. Pauline sat very still, just waiting for it to snap.</p><p>\u201cLift your skirts,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Whoosh.</p><p>His words were a starting pistol, and her pulse took the cue to race.</p><p>After kicking off one slipper, she toed the other one loose. Both dropped to the floor. She placed her stockinged foot on his thigh and slowly drew the lacy hem of her frock higher, revealing her leg all the way to the knee. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigher.\u201d</p><p>She dragged her lacy hem upward, inching it along her thigh. Her garter peeked through the edge of her petticoat\u2014a saucy wink of lavender ribbon.</p> <p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>She slid her foot to his groin, cupping the growing bulge in his trousers. With slow motions, she teased him harder, rubbing her silky instep up and down the long, firm ridge. Soon, the sounds of labored breathing filled the air. Both his and hers. The smooth friction against the sensitive arch of her foot was a surprising source of pleasure.</p><p>And the way he looked at her . . . Unashamed of his rampant arousal, penetrating her with his dark, intense gaze. He had her panting and wet for him, without so much as a kiss.</p><p>\u201cHigher,\u201d he demanded, encircling her ankle with his strong grip. \u201cAll the way to your waist. Show me everything.\u201d</p><p>The dark command in his voice thrilled her. She wriggled on the desk, working her skirts higher. Until cool air rushed over her exposed, aroused cleft.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, sitting forward in his chair. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>He caressed her calf, running his hand up and down the silky curve. His thumb pressed against the hollow of her knee, and her thighs fell apart. As if he\u2019d found some hidden lever.</p><p>He grabbed her by the hips, jerking her to the edge of the desk. His fingers traced the dewy folds of her sex, slipping over her aroused flesh. Such sweet, sweet torture.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>He clucked his tongue. \u201cI shall do as I please. And it pleases me to taste you.\u201d</p><p>As he lowered his head, she squirmed away, breaking the little scene they played.</p><p>\u201cGriff, wait. No one\u2019s . . .\u201d She licked her lips, nervous. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever done that for me.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head. His smile was slow to spread and overtly wicked. \u201cIf you hoped to dissuade me, that was the wrong thing to say.\u201d</p><p>He framed her hips in his hands and pulled her forward again, pressing his mouth to her core.</p> <p>And as promised, he kissed her. There.</p><p>So shocking. So indescribably arousing.</p><p>She jolted in his arms, but his grip on her body was like iron. He was not going to let her escape this erotic embrace. So she reclined, limp, on the mahogany surface, surrendering to the inescapable bliss. She spread her arms wide, covering the full span of the desk. All the papers and correspondence were gone. At this moment she was his work. And he was attending to her thoroughly. Single-mindedly.</p><p>Masterfully.</p><p>His tongue explored her most feminine, intimate places with confidence and zeal. She relaxed her thighs, spreading herself for his kiss, trusting that he knew what he was doing.</p><p>And he did. Oh, he was good at this. A true champion. She had no basis for comparison, but she\u2019d wager the entirety of her thousand pounds on the fact. If there were an order of knighthood awarded for proficiency in pleasuring women, he would have achieved the top rank.</p><p>He licked up and down her slit, savoring her as if she were most delicious course in a royal banquet. When he lavished attention on that tight, swollen bundle of nerves at the crest of her sex, she couldn\u2019t help but moan. Then he parted her folds with his thumbs, using his tongue to delve inside her sheath. He moved his tongue in and out, in shallow thrusts that mimicked intercourse.</p><p>\u201cGriff.\u201d She writhed on the desk.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pause to reply, but answered her by sliding one hand to her breast, squeezing and kneading her through the fabric.</p><p>She clutched at his head, shoving impatiently through layers of petticoats to weave her fingers into the lush, dark waves of his hair and grip tight. She held him fast to her, grinding against his hot, wet, talented mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she panted. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t stop. He showed no signs of flagging in the least. His every lick and thrust pushed her higher. She began to whimper, wordlessly begging him for release. He moved his head back and forth, nuzzling her pearl.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh.\u201d</p><p>She arched straight off the desktop, rocketing through an intense, soaring climax. He pressed the heel of his hand to her mouth, giving her that something she needed to bite and moan and cry out against.</p><p>Eventually the tremors of bliss subsided, and he let his hand slip to cup her breast again. For several moments she stared mutely up at the ceiling while he fondled her breasts and dropped lazy kisses along her thighs.</p><p>There were no words she could utter. None.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she managed. There were no words, save that one. \u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe that I worship every inch of this lithe, delectable body? Do you understand that I would take a saber to the kidneys before letting you come to harm?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, breathless.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His expression darkened. \u201cBecause now I\u2019m going to teach you a lesson.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her to her feet, spun her about, and then moved her toward the desk until she bent at the waist. Her breath rushed out as her breasts met the unyielding surface of the desktop.</p><p>Behind her, Griff pushed up her skirts with brisk motions, gathering all the heavy fabric of gown and petticoats and shoving it above her hips.</p><p>His hand cupped her backside, and his knee nudged her thighs apart.</p><p>\u201cThis is what happens to serving girls who forget themselves with a duke. They get a firm reminder.\u201d</p><p>At the playful sternness in his voice, Pauline felt the slope of her inner thighs erupt into gooseflesh. Her nipples hardened against the cool, polished wood.</p><p>\u201cImpertinent minx.\u201d</p><p>His palm spanked lightly against her bottom, and she let out a breath that was part startled laugh and part sensual excitement. There was no pain, only a stinging pleasure.</p><p>\u201cSaucy temptress.\u201d</p><p>Another delicious smack.</p><p>She knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt her\u2014this was a fantasy for him. If she could play at being a seductress, he was welcome to play his role, too. She liked that he would be playful. It meant he felt safe with her.</p><p>He leaned over her, pinning her to the desk with his body weight. His breath was hot against her neck. \u201cYou are a very naughty girl.\u201d</p><p>As he whispered to her in a rough, needy voice, his hand worked between her legs, rubbing her aroused, sensitized sex.</p><p>\u201cYou like this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou like to imagine that you drive me out of my mind with wanting. Until my cock does all the thinking, and I forget myself completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Her voice failed her as his fingertip brushed over her pearl.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d he demanded. He slipped a finger inside her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, what?\u201d He thrust his finger deep.</p><p>She moaned. \u201cYes, your grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow this,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not forget my place. And you will not forget it, either.\u201d</p><p>Oh, how she hoped his rightful place was deep, deep inside her. She wanted him so badly, she would have said anything he pleased. Called him by any name he liked.</p><p>He slid his finger almost entirely out of her slickness before pushing back in. \u201cWho am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA duke,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want of me?\u201d He withdrew his fingers, leaving her empty and aching for more.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She writhed on the desk. \u201cI want you to tup me.\u201d</p><p>At her use of such crude language, she felt his cock jump against her thigh. Despite all his chastisement, she knew her words excited him. This language was who she was, after all. Common. Low-born.</p><p>\u201cManners.\u201d He gave her bottom another teasing smack. \u201cRemember whom you are addressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, your grace.\u201d By now she was desperate for him. She made her voice as sultry and enticing as she could. \u201cTup your humble servant, I beg of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her hips and slid into her in one smooth, thick stroke. Her moan of satisfaction echoed his.</p><p>She was wet and ready from his earlier efforts. He didn\u2019t need to proceed slowly, so he wasted no time setting a brisk pace. Driving deep, and deeper still.</p><p>Pauline gripped the edges of the desktop to keep from being tupped straight off the desk. The heat and fullness of him thrilled her. He was reaching unexplored places inside her, showing her new, dark facets of herself. The pleasure consumed her.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d she gasped. \u201cHarder, if it please your grace.\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cOh, it pleases me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her by the waist until her toes left the carpet, holding her off the ground as he pumped his hips harder, faster. She bit the soft flesh of her forearm to keep from crying out. He had her weightless, utterly at his mercy as he rode her at whatever angle and pace he desired. He was using her for his pleasure, and using her well.</p><p>Then he lowered her feet to the floor and bent forward, looming over her on the desk. His hands covered hers where she clutched the edges of the desktop. She felt a drop of his perspiration splash against her exposed shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWho am I?\u201d His voice was so close\u2014and so guttural. Her intimate places pulsed in response.</p><p>\u201cA duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe eighth Duke of Halford . . . your grace.\u201d</p><p>Her whole body throbbed for release. His cock was so long and solid inside her. Why had he stopped? She rolled her hips, trying to entice him back into a rhythm.</p><p>He held firm, motionless. \u201cThe courtesy titles. Recite them, too.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. \u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recall. I never forget who I am. Not even when I\u2019m this deep inside you and so desperate to come I could explode.\u201d His hips flexed. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>He began to move again. This time his pace was slow but relentless. He drove into her with such force, a dry sob wrenched from her throat with his every thrust.</p><p>\u201cGriff,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>This \u201clesson\u201d of his was both arousing and devastating. When they were together, alone, she did want him to forget the thirty-three rungs between them on the ladder of English society. But he couldn\u2019t. And she couldn\u2019t. The truth would never go away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Duke of Halford,\u201d he said, plunging deep.</p><p>She shut her eyes, trying not to cry. It was all too much\u2014the emotion, the pleasure. The hopelessness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Marquess of Westmore.\u201d</p><p>Thrust.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also the Earl of Ridingham. Viscount Newthorpe. Lord Hartford-on-Trent.\u201d</p><p>Thrust. Thrust. Thrust.</p><p>\u201cAnd I am your slave, Pauline.\u201d</p><p>Oh, mercy.</p><p>She sobbed in earnest that time. She couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>He stopped, the full length of him buried deep inside her. Filling her, lifting her, shaping her to his desire. When they parted, she would ache with emptiness for him, always.</p><p>His voice was edged with need. \u201cDo you hear me? Do you believe it now? There could be a thousand ranks between us, and I would not give one damn. Every blue-blooded vein in this body pounds with desire for you.\u201d</p><p>He slid an arm beneath her torso, lifting her as he drew himself tall. Her back fell against his chest. He held her up with that strong, powerful arm, and his other hand burrowed under bunched petticoats until his fingertips grazed her pearl. A shiver of ecstasy had her trembling on her toes.</p><p>\u201cLook up at me,\u201d he rasped. \u201cKiss me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She did as he bade, and gladly, turning her head and stretching to press her lips to his. His tongue plundered her mouth, and his cock filled her sex, and his fingertips worked her just where she needed it. He had her wrapped in strength and adoration.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to come. She didn\u2019t want this to ever end. This was the purest bliss she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>But he was wicked and skillful and so cursed efficient. Within moments her whole body was racked by waves of pleasure.</p> <p>His thrusts quickened, lost their elegance. Once again that coiled power in his thighs had her toes lifting off the ground. He broke the kiss and buried his face in her hair. Profane, inarticulate mutterings rained on her ear, making her pulse drum even harder.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t forget who you are,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd it\u2019s you I want. So . . . damned . . . much.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew, finishing with a few last thrusts between her thighs. His primal growl gave her a thrill of satisfaction.</p><p>And then he held her so tightly it grew difficult to breathe. But she didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said finally, hoarsely. \u201cI hope that\u2019s settled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>He slumped into the armchair and pulled her into his lap. They sprawled there, tangled and sweaty, filling the silence with ragged breaths. He lazily stroked her hair with one hand.</p><p>She pressed her face to his shirtfront. \u201cGriff, that was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI know. It was. I don\u2019t mind saying I\u2019m rather proud of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d</p><p>His chest rose and fell with a deep, satisfied sigh. \u201cI feel like jaunting over to Piccadilly to wait for someone in passing to ask me, \u2018How do you do?\u2019 Simply so I could reply, \u2018Just had the best sexual encounter of my life, thanks for asking.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>She laughed, imagining that exchange. \u201cBest of your life?\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but ask. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil later tonight, at least.\u201d He nuzzled her neck. \u201cPauline. Every time with you is the best of my life.\u201d</p><p>And how many more times would they have left? Too few, too few.</p><p>Ding . . . ding . . . ding . . .</p><p>As if it were some fateful portent of their time growing short, a nearby timepiece chimed the hour. Pauline looked over at the side table. She recognized it as the clock he\u2019d been tinkering with all week.</p><p>\u201cYou were able to repair it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shushed her, and his breath warmed her earlobe. \u201cWatch.\u201d</p><p>From a little window in the front, a tiny couple emerged. A soldier and a lady. In halting, mechanical motions, they bowed to one another, twirled in a little waltz, then parted and retreated back into the clock.</p> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always loved watching it when I was a boy.\u201d</p><p>A hint of melancholy deepened his voice. No doubt he\u2019d hoped his own offspring would one day love watching it, too. Now he believed he would never have someone to share it with.</p><p>At least she could share it with him now. She slid an arm around his back, hugging him tight. Listening to the last chimes of the clock and the fierce thump of his heart.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I\u2019d donate it to the Foundling Hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought perhaps the children in the infirmary would enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. I\u2019ll have my mother take it when she visits next.\u201d</p><p>She twisted in his lap and peered up at him. \u201cI have a better idea.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>The plan might have been Pauline\u2019s idea, but Griff quickly took control of it. This wouldn\u2019t be any namby-pamby Ladies\u2019 Auxiliary tour of the establishment. If he was going to visit a foundling home, he was going to do it his way. The dissolute ducal way.</p><p>With authority, extravagance, and unabashedly wicked intent.</p><p>His arrival was unannounced\u2014all the best, most dramatic appearances were. He led a parade of servants through the gate, each of them laden with treasures: sweets, oranges, playthings, competently knitted caps\u2014and at Pauline\u2019s suggestion, storybooks.</p><p>By the time they marched this bounty straight into the central courtyard, the entire place was in upheaval, with brown-clad children pouring out from every classroom and dormitory.</p><p>The matrons were not pleased. Their already dour expressions reached new excesses of sternness\u2014many a new wrinkle would be carved that day. But the matrons had no recourse, unless they wished to refuse the thousands he gave them per annum.</p><p>It was good to be a duke.</p><p>Once all the children were assembled, Griff called out, \u201cWhere\u2019s Hubert Terrapin?\u201d</p><p>The lad shuffled forward. He was easy to spot\u2014the smallest in his queue.</p><p>\u201cHubert, I\u2019m appointing you quartermaster,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean, your grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re to supervise distribution of all this. It\u2019s quite a job. Can you manage it?\u201d</p><p>The youth pulled himself tall. \u201cYes, your grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. The rest of you, fall in line. Youngest first.\u201d</p><p>The file moved painfully slowly. As good-natured, oft-slighted children are, Hubert was painfully fair in his apportionments, solemnly counting out sweetmeats and sections of orange.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so conscientious,\u201d Griff whispered to Pauline. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dear, isn\u2019t it? But I\u2019m not surprised. Squabbling over too little is just human nature. But it says a great deal about a person, what they do with abundance.\u201d She put a boiled sweet in his hand. \u201cSomething to chew on.\u201d</p><p>He smiled to himself as she drifted away. Apparently, she\u2019d found time this week for duchess lessons in subtlety, or lack of it. But she was wrong if she thought these few hours of spontaneous generosity were some sort of saintly exercise on his part. Whether he bestowed it on charity or lost it at the card table, parting with money had never been a trial for him.</p><p>Parting with her, on the other hand . . . God, he couldn\u2019t even think about it yet. The hours remaining before her inevitable departure were growing too few. He needed a task to occupy himself or he\u2019d go mad.</p><p>\u201cHubert,\u201d he said, \u201cpass me one of those oranges. Let me give you a hand.\u201d</p><p>Sometime later he congratulated the lad on a job well done, left the courtyard littered in orange rinds, and went in search of Pauline. At last, he found her in the infirmary.</p><p>Such a cozy scene. His repaired clock occupied the center of the fireplace mantel. On the hearth rug, Pauline had three little ones piled in her lap like kittens, as an older girl read aloud to them all from a book of fairy stories.</p><p>The irony ripped open his chest and went straight for his heart. This picture before him\u2014Pauline, children, sweetness, the fairy-tale ending\u2014it was everything he could want in life. And everything he could never have.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted to fall in love with her. Lord knew, he\u2019d tried his best to avoid it. But now it was too late. And he couldn\u2019t even employ the younger man\u2019s trick\u2014talking himself out of the emotion, pretending he felt something less. Perhaps his heart did lie at the bottom of a black, fathomless well, where he\u2019d succeeded in ignoring it for years. But he\u2019d dug deep while waiting for his daughter. Now the pump had been primed.</p><p>He knew what it was to love. And this was it.</p><p>God help him.</p><p>He remained silent in the doorway, unwilling to interrupt. Not knowing what he\u2019d say, if he dared. He\u2019d probably blurt out a stream of desperate raving. Don\u2019t leave me, I love you, I can\u2019t go on without you. He\u2019d send the children screaming. They\u2019d have nightmares for weeks.</p><p>So he just stood there, silently reeling on the edge of life-long desolation.</p><p>Until a thin, high-pitched sound pushed him over the edge.</p><p>Pauline snuggled the little ones close. Beth had reached the most delightfully gory part of the story\u2014the bit with the dragon who plucked out black hearts with a single claw. But just as the heroine of the story prepared to face the ultimate test, they were interrupted by the high, keening cry of an infant.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s that new one,\u201d Beth said. \u201cAlways wailing. He\u2019ll be sent to the country soon, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor thing,\u201d Pauline said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were so close to the nursery.\u201d</p><p>Beth turned a page. \u201cIt\u2019s straight across the corridor.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, toward the corridor in question.</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>Griff stood in the doorway, mildly rumpled and devilishly handsome as ever. But his face . . . Oh, his face had gone the color of paper. One look at him and she knew. He was in torment.</p><p>\u201cI have to go, darlings. Beth will finish the story.\u201d</p><p>They fretted and mewled and tugged at her skirts. \u201cWill you come back, Miss Simms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m going home tomorrow night. I have a sister who\u2019s missing me. And I\u2019m missing her.\u201d She gave Griff a cautious smile. \u201cPerhaps his grace will visit another day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d From the other room, the babe wailed again. He winced.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said to him and hurried to gather her bonnet and wrap. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave at once.\u201d</p><p>They made hasty strides for the front gate. Pauline struggled to keep pace. She knew Griff was racing his emotions, determined to outrun the epic landslide those cries had set off.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t outrun it forever. The grief would catch up with him eventually, but she didn\u2019t want to see him plowed under here. Not with so many people about.</p><p>She hurried toward the front entrance.</p><p>But then, without a word, he turned and passed through a side door instead. Pauline changed course and chased after him as they made their way to the street. His face had that same blank, unfocused look he\u2019d worn the other day\u2014the day when he\u2019d walked off into the London streets and wandered them all night.</p><p>\u201cGriff, wait,\u201d she called. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe carriage is in front. The coachman will take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about you?\u201d</p><p>He gestured aimlessly at the bustling, anonymous streets. \u201cI need a walk. Some time. It will pass if I can just . . .\u201d His voice failed.</p><p>Her heart ached for him. Perhaps he had successfully outrun these emotions for months now. But this was one race he was losing.</p><p>\u201cJust leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said as they reached the curb. \u201cNot this time. I\u2019m not leaving you alone.\u201d</p><p>With a brisk wave, Pauline hailed a hackney cab. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of that church?\u201d she asked the driver. \u201cThe one all the way on the other side of London?\u201d</p><p>The black-clad driver peered down his sharp nose at her. \u201cSt. Paul\u2019s, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. We\u2019re going there.\u201d She climbed into the cab, knowing Griff would have to follow. He wouldn\u2019t let her drive off alone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to a bloody church.\u201d He slung himself down across from her, folding his long legs into the cramped, dark cab.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I, really. I just needed some destination that was far away. I know you need time, but you need to be with some\u2014\u201d</p><p>She bit the word off. He didn\u2019t need someone. He needed her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He tugged a silver flask from his breast pocket and began to unscrew the top. His fingers were too clumsy to manage it. With a disgusted curse, he hurled the flask into the corner of the cab.</p><p>Pauline bent to retrieve it, calmly unscrewed the cap and held the flask out to him. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave me.\u201d His hands were clenched into fists on either knee. \u201cI\u2019m not in control of myself. I . . . I might lash out.\u201d</p><p>As if he could ever hurt her. \u201cI\u2019ll duck,\u201d she promised. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI might weep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already weeping.\u201d She dabbed her eyes with the back of her wrist.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d He bent over, bracing his elbows on his knees. \u201cJesus. I think I\u2019ll be sick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d She held out her bonnet. \u201cUse this.\u201d</p><p>He stared at it.</p><p>\u201cReally. It\u2019s so ugly. You could only improve it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers, wounded and dark. \u201cI can\u2019t make you leave me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn it, Simms.\u201d As he looked away, he pressed a fist to his mouth, as though to suppress a flood of emotion.</p><p>But she could sense there were cracks in the dam.</p><p>She moved forward on the seat until their knees met in the center of the coach. \u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIn this space, with me\u2014you\u2019re safe. Whatever happens in this cab will remain here. I will go home tomorrow night. No one need ever know.\u201d</p><p>With a curse and the swiftness of desperation, he reached for her, grasping her by the hips and lowering his head to her lap. His hands fisted roughly in the fabric of her gown.</p><p>At last, with his face buried in her skirts, he released a sound. A growling, razor-edged howl of anger and anguish. It built from his gut and erupted through his body. She could feel the force of it sending tremors all through his joints\u2014and hers. His fingers tugged at her, drawing her closer, holding her more tightly.</p><p>Every hair on her body seemed to lift on end. The sheer violence of his emotion terrified her. Her instinct was to shrink from it, but she beat down the fear.</p> <p>She laid one hand flat on his shuddering back and touched the other to his hair.</p><p>Though her heart yearned to soothe him with crooning words, she resisted the urge. There was no good in telling him she understood, or that everything would be all right. It wasn\u2019t true. She couldn\u2019t possibly understand his loss\u2014the sheer agony racking his body was beyond her comprehension\u2014and everything would not be all right. He\u2019d lost someone who could never be replaced, and he\u2019d been holding in the sorrow much too long.</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d His voice was muffled by her skirts. \u201cGod damn it. God damn it.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms about his quaking shoulders, pressing a kiss to the top of his head and embracing him as tightly she could.</p><p>They stayed like that as the coach rattled on through streets and neighborhoods she\u2019d never seen before and would never visit again.</p><p>Pauline had never dreamed how much a father could love his child\u2014her own upbringing hadn\u2019t given her a clue. But Griff showed her today. If one took every battered hope in a grieving father\u2019s heart and laid them all down end to end\u2014they could stretch across London.</p><p>Mile after mile after mile.</p><p>Sometime later, emptied of all that pent-up emotion, he lay sprawled with her on her seat.</p> <p>\u201cTell me about her,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was exactly this big.\u201d He touched the tip of his longest finger, then the crook of his elbow. \u201cHer hair was like little wisps of spun copper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have taken after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hair is dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your beard is ginger when it grows in.\u201d She grazed his cheek with her fingertip. \u201cI noticed it that first day. Did she have your fine brown eyes as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They were that cloudy blue-gray, but the midwife said they\u2019d darken.\u201d He rubbed his face with one hand. \u201cShe rarely opened her eyes while I held her. I don\u2019t think she ever saw me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew you were there.\u201d Pauline laid a hand to his chest. \u201cShe could feel these strong arms holding her. She would have known your voice. And your cologne. You have the most wonderfully comforting scent. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have ever left Spindle Cove with you if you hadn\u2019t smelled so marvelous. She probably kept her eyes closed because she felt so safe.\u201d</p><p>He let out a deep breath. \u201cI was so happy when she was born a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly? I thought men want sons.\u201d</p><p>Her own father had wanted sons. When he received daughters instead, he\u2019d never recovered from the disappointment. He even refused to give them names other than those he\u2019d chosen for boys. It was only by the grace of the old vicar\u2019s pen that she and Daniela weren\u2019t named Paul and Daniel.</p><p>\u201cI wanted a girl,\u201d he said. \u201cAn illegitimate son would have had a harder time of it. He could never have been my heir, and I would have worried he\u2019d feel lesser, no matter what attempts I made to be a good father. But a daughter . . . a daughter, I would have been free to spoil and cherish. I had so many plans. You can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, grief-stricken for him. \u201cOh, I can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the nursery room. I had birthdays, holidays, outings all planned out. Nursemaids already hired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you chosen her finishing school yet?\u201d</p><p>A wry smile tipped his mouth. \u201cI\u2019d started investigating possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you had.\u201d It eased her heart to see him smiling. Even a little.</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cShe lived less than a week. It\u2019s been the better part of a year. How can it be that I still mourn her this much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t pretend to understand how love works.\u201d Pauline sifted her fingers through his hair, smoothing a touch over his brow. \u201cHow many days have I known you? Not many more. And I doubt I\u2019ll ever go a day without thinking of you, even if I should live to see ninety. I . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cI love you so.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a poor time to say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen would be a better time?\u201d He rose to a sitting position next to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She knotted her hands in her lap. \u201cProbably never. But I\u2019m not good at hiding these things, and you deserve to hear it. I fell desperately in love with you this week.\u201d</p><p>He pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. We had an agreement, Simms. How did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Vauxhall, the bookshop, those first kisses in your library . . . When I try to understand how it began, I go back and back. I don\u2019t know how it started, I just\u2014\u201d She made herself look at him. \u201cI just feel rather sure it\u2019s not going to end. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPauline.\u201d He cupped her face.</p><p>\u201cStill, I can\u2019t be sorry for it. I won\u2019t be. I know we have to part, and my heart will break. But even if it\u2019s aching, at least I\u2019ll always know it\u2019s there.\u201d She gave him a weak smile. \u201cAnd the naughty books will make so much more sense.\u201d</p><p>His mouth thinned to a solemn line. He inhaled slowly. Then he raised his fist and banged on the coach top to signal the driver. \u201cThat\u2019s it. We\u2019re going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re unhappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gave her a look that said, Isn\u2019t it obvious? \u201cBecause lovemaking in a moving carriage isn\u2019t all it\u2019s purported to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He hauled her into his lap and swept her into a passionate kiss.</p><p>\u201cPauline.\u201d His voice was a dark murmur against her lips. \u201cMy heart, my dearest love. We are done with this cab. To do every wicked, delicious thing I mean to do to you, I need a bed. And hours.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>There was no denying it. Despite a week\u2019s worth of duchess training, Pauline remained a farm girl at heart. Once again she woke before first light.</p><p>Griff lay tangled with her, snoring softly. His dark head lay heavy on her breast. She wished she could let him sleep all morning. After his efforts in this bed last night, he\u2019d certainly earned his rest.</p><p>But all too soon it was dawn. She could hear servants stirring on the lower level of the house.</p><p>\u201cGriff,\u201d she whispered. She teased her fingers through the dark, tousled waves of his hair. \u201cGriff, I have to go. It\u2019s nearly morning.\u201d</p><p>He clutched her tight about the middle. \u201cIt can\u2019t be morning. I won\u2019t let it be morning.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t think even the Duke of Halford can make time stand still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can try.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her down and yanked the bedsheet over them both, making a sort of tent for two. The early morning light shone through the linen, painting their naked bodies with a warm, honey-gold glow.</p><p>Pauline ceased worrying about what would happen later that day, and for the rest of her life. She was here now. In his arms. His touch could make her forget everything.</p><p>Except the muffled crash and scrape of a grate being cleaned downstairs. That was hard to ignore.</p><p>\u201cIs the door locked?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He made a nod of confirmation as he tongued her nipple. \u201cIt\u2019s locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d His hand delved between her thighs.</p><p>She put a hand to his chest, holding him back. \u201cPlease go check. I\u2019ll feel safer.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a moment. \u201cWell, then.\u201d He rose up on his haunches. \u201cI won\u2019t have you feeling anything less than safe in my bed.\u201d</p><p>With a quick kiss to her brow, he rose from the mattress and made his way toward the door. Pauline rolled onto her side, watching him.</p><p>As he covered the distance in easy strides, she admired the long, lean muscles of his calves and the sculpted tone of his shoulders and back. And his arse . . . Lord above. The world had not seen such a perfectly formed arse since the sixth day of Creation. His buttocks were taut, rounded domes of pure muscle. As he walked, tantalizing hollows appeared on each cheek, alternating with every step.</p><p>Right, left, right . . .</p><p>He reached the door and rattled the latch. \u201cLocked,\u201d he confirmed aloud.</p><p>Then he turned around\u2014praise be\u2014and began the walk back.</p><p>If he was arousing to view from behind, he was devastating in the approach.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cStop there.\u201d</p><p>He halted. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . I\u2019ve lied to you about something.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyebrows gathered like storm clouds. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t truly that concerned about the door latch,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI just wanted to watch you walk across the room.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, startled. His abdominal muscles tensed in a delicious manner.</p><p>She reclined on her elbow and sighed languidly. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. If \u2018beautiful\u2019 is the right word to use for a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t often compliment naked men.\u201d He tugged at his ear in a self-conscious gesture. \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel like a display in the British Museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou belong in a museum.\u201d She shook her head, amazed. \u201cHow do you stay so fit? You\u2019re a nobleman, but that body puts farmhands to shame.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a palm over his washboard of a belly. \u201cI just stay active. It\u2019s important to me. One winter at Oxford, I caught a pneumonia. Lay sick in bed for months and nearly died. It was a difficult time.\u201d</p><p>Pauline could imagine it would have been. Not only for him, but for his parents. Griff was their only child remaining of four, and if something had happened to him . . .</p><p>He confirmed her suspicions. \u201cI was already a disappointment to them. But it seemed the least I could do was stay alive, you know? As soon as I was able, I worked hard to recover my strength.\u201d He stretched and flexed one arm. \u201cNot only strength, but balance, reflexes. And I\u2019ve tried to stay fit ever since. Lately, it\u2019s mostly the fencing.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAll that thrusting has served you well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFencing\u2019s not only about the thrusting.\u201d He drew closer. \u201cIt\u2019s about quickness of mind and body. Flexibility. Concentration. Strategy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dark quality in his voice was making her intimate places swell and ache. Her gaze dropped to his eager, arcing cock. Seeing how badly he wanted her . . . it made her desire him even more.</p><p>Just to tease him, she moved back to the middle of the bed. \u201cLet me gaze a bit longer, please. It might be my last chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be your last chance.\u201d</p> <p>The mattress dipped as he joined her. He rolled atop her and settled between her thighs. Thanks to his brief sojourn out of bed, his body was cool. Cool and solid as marble.</p><p>\u201cThis will be the last time,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He slid into her with one long, powerful stroke. \u201cIt can\u2019t be the last time.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her legs over his. He worked in and out of her, bracing himself on his hands and staring down at her, deep into her eyes. The intensity was piercing. She felt so exposed, so raw and vulnerable. Her hands began to tremble where she touched his arms. She hoped he wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>He stopped, holding still within her. A slight frown wrinkled his brow.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a single thing. You\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>Her heart wrenched in her chest. At last, that word again. And it didn\u2019t come when she was dressed in a silk gown and draped with jewels, but just here. Here, when she lay naked beneath him in the full light of morning. Nothing hidden, nothing concealed. Nothing between their bodies but musk and heat.</p><p>It was worth the whole week\u2019s wait, to hear it now.</p><p>She slid her hands to his back and arched her hips, drawing him deeper. \u201cTake me hard. Hold nothing back. I want to be sore. I want to feel you for days.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to ask twice. He did as she asked, lifting her legs and guiding them around his hips so he could ride her hard and well. Her breasts danced to his rhythm. His thighs smacked against hers with every deep, penetrating stroke.</p> <p>She raked her fingernails down his back, scoring his flesh\u2014so that he\u2019d feel her for days, too. She rode the wave of his deep, forceful thrusts.</p><p>He pressed his brow to hers. \u201cI don\u2019t want to withdraw. I want to be deep inside you when I come.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned. \u201cGriff, no. The risk is too great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the risk.\u201d He kissed her lips. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say that again, but I want it. I want you, always.\u201d</p><p>He was talking madness. Lust had addled his brain. She had to leave; he must stay. They were both completely unprepared to deal with those consequences. But some crazed, unthinking part of her wanted the same. The decision would be made. No undoing it. He couldn\u2019t shut her out of his life. And how wonderful it would feel, to someday place a cooing, healthy infant in his arms. Her heart melted at the idea.</p><p>She could make him so, so happy.</p><p>He paused above her, tensing every muscle. And when he began to thrust again, she sensed a now-familiar shift in his rhythm. His peak was near.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop me.\u201d He pumped hard and fast. \u201cI can\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGriff . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d he breathed, driving deep. \u201cTake everything. Just love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her own climax broke, sending her into a place beyond thought or reason. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The door crashed open.</p><p>Pauline shrieked. They jolted apart, and she burrowed under the bed linens, still shuddering with the last tremors of orgasm.</p><p>Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God.</p><p>Griff cursed and flipped onto his back, drawing her into a protective embrace. The hard, frustrated ridge of his cock throbbed against her hip. \u201cWhat the devil?\u201d</p><p>Lord Delacre stood framed in the entryway. He lifted a hand to shield his view. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than I thought. My eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the door was locked,\u201d Pauline whispered, clutching the bedsheets to her chest.</p><p>\u201cIt was locked,\u201d Griff said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cI broke it in,\u201d Delacre said. \u201cThis is urgent, Halford. Do you know this girl you\u2019ve been squiring all around the ton is a bloody barmaid?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord. Pauline\u2019s face blazed with humiliation.</p><p>Griff\u2019s arm slipped from its protective perch around her shoulders. She felt his erection flagging, too. He slowly sat up in bed, rubbing his face with both hands.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows,\u201d Delacre answered. \u201cEugenia Haughfell ferreted out the truth, and now it\u2019s all over Town.\u201d</p><p>She should have known. Those cursed Awfuls.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt this week has been quite the lark for you, Miss Simms. But it\u2019s at an end.\u201d He walked a few paces into the room, plucked Griff\u2019s discarded breeches from the floor and flung them at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve had some narrow scrapes, Halford, and I\u2019ve seen some brazen fortune-hunting schemes in my time. But this beats all. Seduced by a barmaid in the ancestral bed.\u201d</p><p>Calm and silent, Griff collected the breeches. He turned aside\u2014away from Pauline\u2014and slid his legs into them one at a time. His back was to her as he stood and yanked the breeches to his waist.</p><p>Farewell, she thought wistfully. Farewell, finest arse in Creation.</p><p>This was it, then. She\u2019d known they were down to their last few hours of bliss, but this was a mortifying ending.</p><p>She wanted to disappear under the mattress.</p><p>Delacre went on, \u201cAt least no one can expect you to marry the girl. The gossip will deem her just another of your debauched larks. Toss her a bit of money and send her off. But I hope you\u2019ve been careful not to get a brat on her. She probably hid it from you, but there\u2019s imbecility in the bloodline.\u201d</p><p>Griff paused in the act of fastening a button on his breeches falls. He looked up at Delacre for a brief moment.</p><p>\u201cDel,\u201d he said, in a low, easy voice, \u201cit will take me about ten seconds to button these. That\u2019s how much time you have to run.\u201d</p><p>Lord Delacre shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere until I\u2019m certain this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun.\u201d Griff finished the last closure. He swung his arms at his sides, shaking his fingers loose. The expression on his face was thunderous. \u201cI mean it, Del. You had better flee. Because I fully intend to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Griff could tell by the look on Del\u2019s face that his oldest \u201cfriend\u201d didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>\u201cCome along, Halford.\u201d He held up his hands. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>Griff pulled back his right fist and crashed a full-force punch into Del\u2019s gut. \u201cConvinced?\u201d</p><p>Del doubled over, eyes wide with shock. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, say your prayers. You\u2019re going to need them.\u201d He threw another punch, this time catching Del on the jaw.</p><p>Realizing he was at a disadvantage, Del scrambled down the corridor. \u201cStop and think about this, Griff!\u201d he called. \u201cWe had a pact, remember? I\u2019m trying to be a friend. Rescuing you from entrapment. Saving you from greater scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had better save yourself.\u201d</p><p>They raced toward the salon, where they\u2019d begun so many days together.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t be using blunt practice swords today.</p><p>Griff yanked a short sword from its wall mount and swung it, limbering his arm. \u201cI\u2019ve something to tell you, Delacre. All these years we\u2019ve been perfectly matched fencing opponents?\u201d He raised his blade. \u201cI\u2019ve been holding back.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Del had armed himself, Griff went on the attack, swinging in savage blows, driving his opponent backward until he had him against the wall.</p><p>Griff let the blade press ever so slightly against Del\u2019s cheek, until a thin line of blood appeared. \u201cOh, too bad. That might leave a scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen are mad for scars. I\u2019m still miles better looking than you.\u201d Del smirked. \u201cPerhaps barmaids aren\u2019t particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou vermin. She is not a barmaid, and she will never be one again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean you knew?\u201d Del lifted one boot and kicked Griff in the chest, sending him reeling back a step.</p><p>Griff recovered quickly, but the brief separation gave Del enough time to raise his weapon and defend himself.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Delacre said, panting. \u201cAre you . . . God, you can\u2019t believe yourself to be in love with that girl.\u201d</p><p>Griff shook his head, but not in denial. Love was too small a word for what he felt. Just now, when she\u2019d been beneath him . . . He\u2019d never thought he would feel that way again. Ready to brave any sorrow just to keep her at his side. Perhaps the impulse wasn\u2019t logical or reasoned, but it was real and true. It was choosing hope rather than despair. Seizing the one sparkling possibility in a roomful of someones.</p><p>It was her. All her.</p><p>He\u2019d been dead inside. She\u2019d brought him back to life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d die for her,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d kill for her. The rest doesn\u2019t concern you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevil take me. You do love her.\u201d Del ducked, parrying Griff\u2019s enraged strike. \u201cOh, this is even worse. Just what are you expecting to come of it? You plan to make her your mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I know you don\u2019t mean to marry her.\u201d Delacre laughed. \u201cThat would be rich. I can see the scandal sheets now: \u2018the Barmaid Duchess.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>They locked swords. Griff flexed his arm, pushing the crossed blades forward until one edge lodged against Del\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cI think the papers will carry a different story tomorrow. One about the late Lord Delacre.\u201d</p><p>He mustered all the strength in his arm and prepared to flex.</p><p>\u201cGriff! Griff, no!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Pauline skittered to a halt in the doorway, having hastily dressed in yesterday\u2019s discarded frock. \u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she called. \u201cHe\u2019s your oldest friend. You don\u2019t want to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I want to hurt him,\u201d Griff said evenly. \u201cI want, very much, to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. She couldn\u2019t deny that after hearing his cruel words, watching Lord Delacre squirm conveyed a particular sort of pleasure. But it had to stop there.</p><p>\u201cGriff, please.\u201d In cautious steps, she approached the men. \u201cHis life isn\u2019t worth one-tenth of yours. Your mother is in the house somewhere. You don\u2019t want her to see this. And if nothing else moves you, think of the servants. There would be a horrific mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hear that, Del? That\u2019s the lowly barmaid pleading for your life. The woman you insulted, begging me to spare your loathsome skin. I think you ought to thank her.\u201d Through gritted teeth, he added, \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Delacre nervously cleared his throat. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Thank you, Miss Simms,\u2019 \u201d Griff demanded. \u201cAnd make me believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Simms. I owe you my loathsome skin.\u201d</p><p>Griff inhaled through his nose. Then slowly exhaled. After a long moment, he shoved away, and both swords clattered to the floor.</p><p>Delacre slumped to the ground with relief.</p><p>Pauline felt like doing the same.</p><p>\u201cWhen next you see her,\u201d Griff said, giving Delacre a light kick in the ribs, \u201cyou will greet her with respect and address her by her rightful name. As her grace, the Duchess of Halford.\u201d</p><p>Now Pauline\u2019s knees truly buckled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Delacre echoed. \u201cHalford, we had a pact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake. Leave off about the stupid pact. We were nineteen. At that age, we thought midnight grouse hunts were a grand idea, too.\u201d</p><p>Griff crossed to Pauline and took her hands in his. \u201cI can\u2019t let you leave today.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head with vigor. \u201cNo, no. Griff, I can\u2019t stay. My sister. I promised her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d he promised. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you both. Always. From this moment on you will never need to work again. Never need to be anxious or fearful. I will take care of everything.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord.</p><p>\u201cBut you must stay with me and see this through. If you retreat today, the gossips will claim their victory.\u201d His thumb caressed her hand. \u201cWe can have a future together, but we must seize it now. We can be married today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday? Are you mad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all. There are only a few men in England who could procure a special license on such short notice. I\u2019m one of them. We\u2019ll marry today, and tonight you\u2019ll appear in public as the Duchess of Halford. No one will dare to cut you, just on the basis of a rumor in the scandal sheets. You\u2019re beautiful and gracious and clever, and you have that whole silly etiquette book memorized. We\u2019ll show them all tonight. You can do this.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to believe him. She did. But how could she, when she could see very well the reaction of his own supposed best friend?</p><p>\u201cShe will never be one of us,\u201d Delacre said. \u201cNot even if you marry her. You know it, too, Halford. Be honest with yourself, and with her. The gossip will be savage. You will lose almost all of your social connections.\u201d He struggled to his feet. \u201cIt gives me no pleasure to say this. But I\u2019m trying to be your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not my friend,\u201d Griff grated out. \u201cGet the hell out. And pray I don\u2019t send my second with a challenge tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am your second,\u201d Delacre said as he left the room. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>See? she wanted to exclaim. It was happening already. Perhaps Delacre wasn\u2019t much of a loss, but there would be others. She didn\u2019t want to see Griff estranged from all his friends.</p><p>As for her, there was no question. She must go home, tonight. If she didn\u2019t come back as promised, Daniela would feel betrayed and abandoned. Pauline couldn\u2019t live with herself then. She\u2019d sworn to never make her sister feel that way again.</p><p>She had to end this now. In no uncertain terms.</p><p>The duchess entered then, dressed in a quiet gray silk enlivened by a collar of sapphires and diamonds. \u201cWhat on earth is going on?\u201d she demanded, her keen gaze sweeping the room. \u201cGriffin, explain this commotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelacre\u2019s a jackass. And I\u2019m in love with Pauline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the duchess said after a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cI already knew both of those things. Neither quite explains the state of my salon.\u201d</p> <p>Griff\u2019s eyes never left Pauline\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m going to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your grace,\u201d Pauline countered. \u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>The duchess arched a brow. \u201cDoes that mean I cast the deciding vote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Griff and Pauline said in unison.</p><p>She seemed unconvinced. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Pauline drew him aside and whispered, \u201cGriff, this just can\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times must I point out the obvious? You are a duke. I am a serving girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be a serving girl tonight. You will be a duchess. A beautiful, poised woman who can hold her head high anywhere. And I will be the proudest man alive to stand at your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what pride will I have, when I\u2019m pretending to be someone I\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to pretend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d Her voice faltered. \u201cYou told me I wasn\u2019t a \u2018someone\u2019 to you. You called me perfect, said you wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what? You don\u2019t mean to stand before all of London\u2019s Quality and tell them you\u2019re in love with me. A serving girl with a coarse, yeoman farmer for a father and a simple-minded sister. Do you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Which was answer enough.</p><p>\u201cNo. You want to dress me up in a fine gown, throw your name over me like a cloak, and pretend this barmaid everyone\u2019s gossiping about just doesn\u2019t exist. As if you\u2019re ashamed of me.\u201d She pressed a hand to her chest. \u201cI can\u2019t hide the truth of who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am asking you to live the truth of who you are. The full truth.\u201d His tone was impatient now. He took her by the shoulders and gave her a mild shake. \u201cThere is so much more to you than a common serving girl, Pauline. Inside you, there\u2019s a remarkable woman who soaked up poetry and squirreled away etiquette lessons, turned cruelty into dreams and plans\u2014because she knew she was meant for better things. I saw that woman the first day we met. I don\u2019t know why you won\u2019t let the world see her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would chastise me for hiding secrets? For not living the truth? You, with that locked room upstairs?\u201d</p><p>The color drained from his face. He darted a gaze at his mother, then lowered his voice. \u201cThis has nothing to do with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does.\u201d She retreated a step. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to trust you\u2019ll love me openly. That you\u2019ll never be embarrassed or resentful of my origins, my family. How can I believe those promises when you won\u2019t tell your own mother about her?\u201d</p><p>The duchess stepped forward. \u201cGriffin, who is she talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>Pauline gasped in shock. \u201cYou would deny her? She\u2019s not even a \u2018someone,\u2019 but a \u2018no one\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He drilled her with a fierce look. \u201cYou gave me your word. You promised. Stop this now, Pauline. Or I can never trust you again.\u201d</p><p>She felt a twinge of guilt. She had given her word, and she knew she was pushing him toward a dangerous edge. But someone had to. After today she\u2019d never have another chance.</p><p>\u201cYou never told a soul she existed, Griff. Then she died, and your heart splintered into a thousand pieces, and still you didn\u2019t say a word. How am I to believe that you\u2019ll protect me and my sister? How am I to trust that Daniela won\u2019t be hidden away in some locked, shameful room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you suggest that I\u2019m ashamed of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve you aren\u2019t, then! For God\u2019s sake. Love shouldn\u2019t be a secret. You gave her a name, and you can\u2019t even use it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed.</p><p>\u201cDid you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I did. I do.\u201d</p><p>She raised her voice. \u201cThen say her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary.\u201d His angry shout echoed through the room.</p><p>Pauline went very still, absorbing the quiet swell of his fury. She knew he would never forgive her for this. But at least, at long last, he might be able to heal.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Mary,\u201d he said. \u201cMary Annabel York. Born the fourteenth day of last October, died the following week. She lived all of six days, and I loved her more than my own life.\u201d He turned away from her, leveling a small table with a single, savage kick. \u201cGod damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The duchess pressed a hand to her mouth.</p><p>Pauline rushed to her side, afraid the older woman might swoon. She helped her to the nearest chair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so very sorry.\u201d</p><p>She said it over and over again. Words of regret, apology, condolence. But she knew they couldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But I\u2019ve come to care so deeply for you both, and I can see plainly how you love each other. How you\u2019re hurting each other, too. Please. You can hate me forever, but talk to each other.\u201d</p><p>Griff stared out the window, emotionless. \u201cI\u2019ll call for the coach to be readied. You can leave within the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want it to end this way. I hoped we could part as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs friends?\u201d He tapped one finger against the window glass. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe that I\u2019d change anything, give up everything, move heaven and earth to keep someone I love, even if it\u2019s only been a week . . . ? Then you don\u2019t know me at all.\u201d He fixed her with eyes gone cold. \u201cIt seems I was wrong about you, too.\u201d</p><p>Reeling backward, she fled the parlor. Then she turned and ran down the corridor, headed for the entrance hall.</p><p>\u201cPauline,\u201d the duchess called after her. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She only ran faster. What more could be said? Nothing would change.</p><p>When she reached the front door, she wrenched it open and darted through.</p><p>Outside, a crowd greeted her with a roar.</p><p>Good heavens. The square was jammed with carriages and people, all of them thronged about the steps of Halford House, craning their necks for a look.</p><p>A look at her, apparently. Lord Delacre hadn\u2019t been exaggerating. The word was all over London, and now all of London had converged on the duke\u2019s front step.</p><p>\u201cThere she is! That\u2019s her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Simms!\u201d a man shouted. \u201cIs it true you\u2019re a barmaid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive pounds for an interview for the Prattler!\u201d</p><p>Pauline cowered in the doorway. She couldn\u2019t go back inside and face Griff again. But this crowd churned with enough curiosity and excitement to pulverize her. Even if she managed to escape these people, where would she go? She had no money. No possessions, save the clothes on her back.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t even wearing shoes.</p><p>\u201cPauline!\u201d A familiar voice filtered through the din. \u201cPauline! It\u2019s me, Susanna.\u201d</p><p>Her heart leaped. Shading her brow with both hands, she scanned the crowd until she saw a friendly wave from a gloved hand, and a halo of red hair.</p><p>A friend.</p><p>As Pauline pushed toward her, people grabbed at her disheveled clothing and jostled for a glimpse of her face. She felt buffeted about like a cork.</p><p>At last she and Susanna made their way to each other. \u201cOh, Lady Rycliff. I can\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t know how to\u2014\u201d Overwhelmed, she clapped a hand to her mouth.</p><p>Susanna folded her in a protective hug. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, dear. It\u2019s all right. You\u2019re coming home with me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>Ensconced at Rycliff House, safely away from the crowds, Lady Rycliff\u2014who now insisted Pauline call her Susanna\u2014poured another cup of tea. \u201cWhat a week you\u2019ve had, dear.\u201d</p><p>Pauline watched the fragrant liquid filling her porcelain cup. Lady Rycliff serving her tea. The world had turned upside down.</p><p>\u201cIt has been eventful.\u201d And the story had taken the better part of two hours to relate, from the first tossing of clayed sugar to the cold, bitter end.</p><p>Of course, she hadn\u2019t told everything. She left out the amorous details. And Griff deserved his privacy where Mary Annabel was concerned. She\u2019d never tell another soul about that.</p><p>\u201cI knew Halford was a villain.\u201d Lady Payne\u2014who insisted Pauline call her Minerva\u2014plucked a biscuit from the tray and took a vengeful bite.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken,\u201d Pauline said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. The best kind of man.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d hurt him. Whenever Pauline closed her eyes, she saw his angry, betrayed expression. The image was stamped into her memory, embossed in guilt. Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have pushed, but she\u2019d been so concerned for him . . .</p><p>And so afraid.</p><p>Griff was right. She\u2019d been so very afraid for herself.</p><p>\u201cDid he truly propose marriage?\u201d Lady Rycliff asked.</p><p>Pauline nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you refused?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again. \u201cYou must think me a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not a fool.\u201d Susanna reached to squeeze her hand.</p><p>No. Pauline supposed she wasn\u2019t. In truth, she was a coward. She\u2019d panicked and pushed him away.</p><p>His suggestions had been such madness. The two of them, marry? Her, become a true duchess? An elegant lady, admired by the London elite?</p><p>It just couldn\u2019t be. The crowd outside Halford House knew the truth. She could still feel them tugging at her clothing, shouting in her ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Griff could claim not to care about gossip\u2014but that was easy for a duke to say. He\u2019d never been the object of mockery and scorn. He didn\u2019t know how it felt to be at the bottom of the pecking order, and if Pauline tried to live in his world, that was exactly where she\u2019d be. Always. Even if she could withstand a lifetime of snide remarks and subtle cruelty, she couldn\u2019t expose Daniela to that treatment.</p><p>\u201cYou were right to refuse him,\u201d Minerva said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t let it end this way.\u201d</p><p>We?</p> <p>Why should either of these ladies care how her week ended? Pauline felt lucky enough that they\u2019d offered her a place to gather herself and help finding transportation back to Spindle Cove.</p><p>\u201cThis ball tonight,\u201d Minerva said, adjusting her spectacles. \u201cYou must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that? I doubt the duke will attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t attend. Go for yourself. Just to let those gossips see you, undefeated and proud. Simply to prove you can.\u201d</p><p>To prove you can.</p> <p>But could she, really?</p><p>Pauline shook her head. In Spindle Cove she\u2019d half listened as Minerva Highwood lectured the other ladies on the most impossible topics\u2014vast underwater caves and giant prehistoric lizards. This latest suggestion seemed no different.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t attend the ball tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even know where to go, or how to get there. I haven\u2019t anything to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave all that to us,\u201d Minerva said, tapping Susanna on the arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll handle the arrangements. You need only supply the courage. Spindle Cove ladies band together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a lady, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would stand by you even if you were a serving girl,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cBut I believe you\u2019ve always been something more.\u201d</p> <p>Pauline warmed a little. She did have more inside of her, and maybe Griff wasn\u2019t the only one to notice. To be sure, she wasn\u2019t up to the standards of Lady Haughfell and her set, and she certainly was no duchess. But neither were Susanna or Minerva, or any of the other ladies who sought refuge in Spindle Cove.</p><p>She belonged there. Her heart expanded with a sense of certainty. She knew her right place in the world. She was going to have her cozy, welcoming, wonderful-smelling library, and it would be a home for any girl who needed it.</p><p>And she would have her sister\u2014the one person who loved her wholly, without shame or reservation. That was something even the fourth-largest fortune in England couldn\u2019t buy.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d she said. \u201cAs soon as it can be managed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the ball first,\u201d Minerva urged.</p><p>Pauline shook her head. \u201cI must be back in Spindle Cove tomorrow. I promised my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do both. The mail coach is the fastest way home, and it doesn\u2019t leave London until after midnight. Isn\u2019t that right, Susanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Lady Rycliff replied. \u201cPauline, if you wanted to attend the ball for an hour or two, we could still have you to the mail coach in time.\u201d</p> <p>Pauline hesitated.</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d A housemaid entered the room, looking apologetic. \u201cI beg your pardon, but there\u2019s someone here for Miss Simms.\u201d</p><p>Pauline\u2019s heart fluttered. \u201cIf it\u2019s the duke, I . . .\u201d</p><p>The maid looked confused. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any duke, ma\u2019am. It\u2019s a lady caller. She\u2019s brought a good many parcels, too.\u201d</p><p>A young woman entered the sitting room, laden with a tower of boxes. Pauline couldn\u2019t even see her face for all the packages.</p><p>\u201cMiss Simms, it\u2019s m-me.\u201d</p><p>She rose to her feet. \u201cFlora? What are you doing here?\u201d She helped unload the parcels from the maid\u2019s arms.</p><p>Once unburdened, Flora dropped her gaze. \u201cThey\u2019ve s-sacked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacked you? Oh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I deserved. Her grace let me go without a reference, and I haven\u2019t any way to find a new p-post. I thought, perhaps if I readied you for the ball tonight\u2014so\u2019s everyone was dazzled by your beauty, and it made it to the papers\u2014maybe someone would hire me anyhow.\u201d She grabbed Pauline\u2019s arm. \u201cPlease, Miss Simms. It\u2019s you who\u2019d be d-doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlora, I\u2019d like to help. But I don\u2019t know. Perhaps you could dress Lady Rycliff or Lady Payne.\u201d</p><p>Flora shook her head. \u201cIt has to be you. I want to see you do this, Miss Simms. You worked so hard all week. We all d-did. And then there\u2019s this. It was made for you. It won\u2019t fit anyone else.\u201d</p><p>From the largest box, she withdrew a breathtaking flash of silver.</p><p>Oh goodness.</p><p>The gown seemed to be at least three-fourths skirt. The bodice was small and tight, boned for stiffness and fitted with the shortest puffs of sleeves. The skirts were a cloud. A great shimmering, airy, fluffy cloud of tulle overlaying satin. Little sparkling things were affixed to the tulle by the thousands. It truly was a thing of wonder.</p><p>\u201cOh, Pauline,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cIf any man can look at you in that and not simply fall to his knees before you . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll eat his own hat.\u201d Minerva clapped with glee. \u201cDo it. Do it for every young woman who ever felt scorned or overlooked. This is your chance, Pauline.\u201d</p><p>Pauline ran a touch over the beautiful silver fabric, spangled with seed pearls and tiny crystals. She didn\u2019t need to prove her worth to anyone. She didn\u2019t need a lavish wardrobe or the wealth that accompanied the title of duchess.</p><p>But she needed to wear this gown, just this once. It was made for her. Literally.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne question,\u201d said Susanna. \u201cDo we tell the men about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Minerva stoutly. \u201cColin will steal all the credit. This is going to be our grand success. We\u2019ll show everyone what Spindle Cove ladies can do.\u201d</p><p>Pauline wasn\u2019t so certain about that \u201csuccess\u201d part. She still doubted that she could ever blend in at such an event.</p><p>But after tonight, she could go home with her pride. No one could say she wasn\u2019t brave enough to try.</p><p>\u201cCorinthian.\u201d As the carriage rolled up before the Prince Regent\u2019s grand residence, the word just rolled from her tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Pauline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose columns on the portico. They\u2019re Corinthian.\u201d</p><p>Amazing. This week in London had taught her the strangest things. What an odd assortment of lessons she would bring home with her.</p><p>She still hadn\u2019t learned how to hide her anxiety, however. It helped that Susanna and Minerva were clearly nervous, too.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not much good with balls, either,\u201d Minerva confided. \u201cPerhaps we should have warned you beforehand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d said Susanna. \u201cWe\u2019ll all go in as a group.\u201d</p><p>As they made their way into the entrance hall, Susanna\u2014the tallest of them\u2014craned her neck to look over the crowd.</p><p>\u201cOh, drat,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re checking names against a list.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t good news. Pauline knew she\u2019d been on the list earlier that week. But today\u2019s gossip had no doubt removed her from it. Or perhaps moved her to another list\u2014one written in red and headed with the words, Not to be admitted under any circumstance.</p><p>\u201cYou could give another name,\u201d Minerva suggested. \u201cYou could be me. I don\u2019t mind. Everyone will just assume I\u2019ve removed my spectacles for once and undergone a thrilling transformation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Pauline smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of you, but I can\u2019t. I must be here as myself or not at all.\u201d</p><p>When the crowd shifted, she quietly remained in place and let her friends drift away. If this evening proceeded as disastrously as she suspected it might, she didn\u2019t want Lady Rycliff and Lady Payne to be tainted by association. They\u2019d brought her this far, but she must face the rest on her own.</p><p>Surely there was another way into the ballroom. There must be a smaller passageway for the staff. She was a servant; she could find it.</p><p>After a few moments\u2019 surreptitious investigation, she turned down a narrow corridor. She passed near a clashing, steamy din that must have been the palace kitchen. When she spied a footman returning with a tray of empty glasses, she knew she needed to proceed in the direction he\u2019d come.</p><p>Pauline traversed a passageway with stairs. At the top, she listened for the sounds of chatter and music. Turning toward the noise, she rounded a corner . . .</p><p>And reeled to a halt when she nearly collided with a finely dressed man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she started to apologize. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>When she swept a look from his boots to his face, she gasped.</p><p>Oh, bollocks.</p><p>Fitted tailcoat. White gloves. An angry red line running down his left cheek.</p><p>\u201cLord Delacre.\u201d</p><p>Griff had been right\u2014that wound would probably leave a scar. Not a disfiguring one. Just a thin, indelible reminder.</p><p>Good.</p><p>\u201cI knew I saw you here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPlease excuse me.\u201d</p><p>When she tried to move past him, he grabbed her arm. \u201cI won\u2019t let you do this. I\u2019ve known Halford all his life, and I know what\u2019s best for him even when he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her heart jumped. Did that mean Griff was here?</p><p>She pulled against Delacre\u2019s grasp. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>Delacre didn\u2019t frighten her\u2014but he was a man, much larger and more powerful than she. Moreover, this was his native environment. His friends at this event numbered in the hundreds. She could count hers on one hand and still have a good many fingers left over.</p><p>She was outsized, outranked, outclassed. And unless she figured out a way around him, she would remain outside that ballroom forever.</p><p>\u201cIs it money you want?\u201d He released her arm and slid a bank note from his breast pocket. She could just make out the writing on it.</p><p>Five pounds.</p><p>He waved it at her. \u201cTake it, then. And use the servants\u2019 exit. This isn\u2019t the place for you.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not for you, girl.</p><p>Her cheeks burned. With those words, he wasn\u2019t Delacre anymore. He was every book that had ever been ripped from her hand. Every door that had ever been slammed on her.</p><p>She wanted to fight back, throw something. Spit in his face.</p><p>But this situation called for a different sort of phlegm.</p><p>She pulled her spine straight, lifted her chin and fixed him with a cool, direct look. \u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>While he stood sputtering, she dashed past him and rejoined the crowd near the ballroom entry. Before she could lose her nerve, she cut ahead of the queue of waiting guests. Impolite, perhaps. But the gossips already knew her to be a serving girl\u2014it wasn\u2019t as though they could think much worse of her.</p><p>She gave her name to the majordomo, and he announced, \u201cMiss Simms of Sussex.\u201d</p><p>The ballroom went utterly silent, except for the thunder of her heart. Her hands trembled at her sides.</p><p>Breathe, she told herself.</p><p>And then: Go.</p><p>She let that transparent cord at her navel pull her forward, guiding her as she descended the small flight of stairs. As she walked, her gown caught the light of hundreds of candles and lamps, sending arrows of light in every direction.</p><p>Once she reached the bottom of the staircase, she sought refuge behind a cluster of potted palms and scanned the crowd for familiar faces. Where were Minerva and Susanna? She knew she\u2019d resolved to go this alone, but she didn\u2019t feel so brave anymore.</p><p>And then\u2014</p><p>Griff.</p><p>He strode toward her, wearing an immaculate black tailcoat and carrying a wicked gleam in his eye. So assured, so handsome.</p><p>Oh, the flutterings. She had flutterings all through her. They were so strong, they just about carried her away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d attend,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI was hoping, of course. I just wanted to see you again. To tell you I\u2019m sorry, and that you were right. I was afraid. I\u2019m still afraid, to be honest. I don\u2019t think I can do this at all. But if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>She was seized by a pulse of pure terror. It didn\u2019t matter to her if the rest of the gathering scorned her. But if even Griff would cast her out . . .</p> <p>He didn\u2019t cast her out.</p><p>He took her by the hand.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said, more gently this time. \u201cThe most beautiful woman in the room does not belong in the corner with the potted palms. Come out from there. Or else Flora did all this for nothing.\u201d</p><p>She pulled up short and stared at him. \u201cYou. It was you. You sent Flora. And the gown. You didn\u2019t sack her at all.\u201d</p><p>A little smile played about his lips. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have come if I\u2019d asked.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the tricks. She couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI thought you were furious with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was furious with you. For about . . . ten minutes. Perhaps a full quarter hour. Then I came to my senses.\u201d He tugged her forward. \u201cCome. We have a bargain to complete. There\u2019s someone to whom you should be properly introduced.\u201d</p><p>Not the Prince Regent, she prayed.</p><p>Worse.</p><p>He steered her straight toward the Haughfells. All three of them\u2014mother and daughters\u2014were united by the grim sets of their mouths and their refusal to even look at Pauline.</p><p>What was Griff playing at now?</p> <p>\u201cLady Haughfell.\u201d He bowed. \u201cWhat a happy coincidence. I know you\u2019ve been longing to further your acquaintance with Miss Simms. And here she is.\u201d</p><p>Sheer horror flickered across the matron\u2019s powdered face. \u201cI do not think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is ideal. What better time or place? In fact\u201d\u2014he took a dance card and its small attached pencil from the older Miss Haughfell\u2019s hand\u2014\u201clet me write down the key details. Just so there can be no question in the scandal sheets tomorrow. Miss Simms hails from Spindle Cove, a charming village in Sussex. Her father is a farmer, with thirty acres and some livestock.\u201d</p><p>As Pauline looked on in amazement, he narrated the entire tale for them. His mother\u2019s kidnapping ploy, their arrival in Spindle Cove. Pauline\u2019s appearance in the Bull and Blossom\u2014sugar-dusted and muddied. His visit to her family\u2019s cottage and their eventual bargain. He spared no detail, but told the story plainly and with good humor. Occasionally, he noted an important fact on the dance card:</p><p>Bull and Blossom.</p><p>Thirty acres.</p><p>One thousand pounds.</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d he said, \u201cI brought Miss Simms to London to thwart my mother\u2019s matchmaking schemes. She was supposed to be a laughable failure. A hilarious joke.\u201d</p> <p>One of the Misses Haughfells began to giggle. Her mother smacked her wrist with a folded fan.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Griff said. \u201cDo laugh, please. It\u2019s most amusing. A barmaid, receiving duchess lessons. Can you imagine? The best part was the diction training. My mother was forever drilling Miss Simms on her H\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Lady Haughfell arched a brow. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose she made much progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but she did. Show them, Miss Simms.\u201d</p><p>Pauline smiled. \u201cHideous. Ham-faced. Hag.\u201d She looked to Griff. \u201cThere. How was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d He beamed at her.</p><p>\u201cWrite it down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d As he scribbled the epithets on Miss Haughfell\u2019s dance card, he went on talking. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t heard the funniest bit, Lady Haughfell. See, I thought I was playing a trick on my mother\u2014and all London\u2014but it turns out, the joke was on me.\u201d</p><p>The matron stiffened. \u201cBecause you have lost what remained of your family\u2019s honor and society\u2019s good opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because I fell desperately in love with this barmaid and now cannot imagine happiness without her.\u201d He looked up and shrugged. \u201cWhoops.\u201d</p><p>All three Haughfells stared at him in mute, slack-jawed horror. Pauline wished she could have a miniature of their expressions to keep in a drawer forever and pull out on dull, rainy days.</p><p>Griff sharpened the pencil stub with his thumbnail. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure to have that down. It\u2019s important.\u201d He spoke the words slowly as he inscribed them. \u201cDesperately . . . in . . . love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the \u2018whoops,\u2019 \u201d Pauline said, looking over his shoulder. \u201cThat was the best part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looked up, and his dark gaze caught hers. \u201cSo it was.\u201d</p><p>They stared into each other\u2019s eyes, utterly absorbed in affection and silent laughter.</p><p>The moment was perfect. He was perfect. Teasing, wonderful man.</p><p>\u201cIs that a waltz they\u2019re playing?\u201d Griff suddenly asked. He stared at the marked-up card in his hand before handing it back. \u201cPity your card is full, Miss Haughfell. I suppose I\u2019ll dance with Miss Simms instead.\u201d</p><p>He led her to the center of the ballroom and slid one arm about her torso, fitting his hand between her shoulder blades. Together, they joined the waltz.</p><p>Almost immediately, other couples began to disappear. One by one, at first. Then two or three at the same time. And the more alone they grew, the less self-conscious she became. Soon it felt positively magical. Here they were, dancing under the full weight of society\u2019s disapproval. And it felt as though the orchestra and canopied ballroom and general resplendence of the setting had all been arranged just for the two of them.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019ve fulfilled my end of the agreement,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the toast of London tonight, nor any night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>With that, she thought surely Griff would put a stop to the dance, but he didn\u2019t. He just twirled her into turn after turn.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve done enough,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m a confirmed disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. A comprehensive catastrophe. A beautiful, perfect failure.\u201d He pulled back to regard her. \u201cAnd I could not be more proud.\u201d</p><p>His words settled as warmly as a hug. They both knew she could never have sustained any pretense at gentle breeding. Families like the Haughfells would not have been fooled. Instead, he\u2019d embraced Pauline for her true self\u2014publicly and completely, in a manner that ensured they\u2019d never accept her at all.</p><p>But by letting her fail, he\u2019d made her a success. At long last, she was a triumph. The serving girl who\u2019d conquered not society, but its most recalcitrant duke. A huntress, draped in the elusive white tiger\u2019s pelt.</p><p>Just for tonight.</p><p>He swept her with an adoring look. \u201cRadiant. Just as you were that first day.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI am sure I look nothing like I did that first day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do. You sparkled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced. I think it was just you.\u201d His voice softened to a caress. \u201cIt was always you.\u201d</p><p>A lump stuck in her throat. She swallowed hard.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, Pauline spied a few of the Prince Regent\u2019s hussars conferring in the corner, hands on their sabers. If they didn\u2019t leave the dance floor soon, armed guards might chase them from it. That would be a night to remember.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re down to minutes, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s make them count,\u201d Griff said. \u201cHere I am, a duke. Waltzing with a serving girl. Holding her improperly close, for everyone to see.\u201d He shivered for effect. \u201cWhat\u2019s that I feel? Could it be the social fabric unraveling?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twisted as she tried not to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just the gout. I\u2019ve heard dukes are gouty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve heard serving girls taste like ripe berries.\u201d He touched his lips to hers.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cGriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere. Now I\u2019ve kissed you, in front of everyone. Shocking. And look, I\u2019m going to do it again.\u201d</p><p>He stopped dancing and used those strong arms to pull her close, and claimed her mouth in a passionate kiss.</p><p>When they parted, he wore a sly, roguish smile. \u201cWhat would Mrs. Worthington say?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know about Mrs. Worthington, but somewhere a clock began to chime the hour. Pauline\u2019s heartbeat stuttered.</p><p>The mail coach.</p><p>\u201cI have to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cI must go, or I\u2019ll never make it home in time.\u201d She tugged out of his embrace. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I promised my sister. You promised her, too.\u201d</p><p>She dashed away from him, streaking out of the ballroom, back through the crowded antechambers, to the portico and down the stairs\u2014just as fast as her slippers would carry her.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He called to her from the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she called over her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t make it harder, Griff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPauline, you can\u2019t leave yet. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>She tried to hurry but his footfalls outpaced hers easily. These stupid heeled slippers. When she tripped again, she kicked one off and threw it over her shoulder.</p><p>He dodged the flying slipper and caught her by the arm. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to stop you,\u201d he said.</p><p>All the fight went out of her. She blinked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d His expression turned serious. \u201cYou need to go. Go home to your sister and open that circulating library. It\u2019s your dream, and you\u2019ve earned it. As for me . . . I have some work to do, too. I think it\u2019s time I lived up to the vaunted Halford legacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, solemn. \u201cTo start, I\u2019m going to be a man of my word. I promised to have you home by Saturday, and so I will.\u201d</p><p>This was it, Pauline realized. He was truly letting her go. She would return to Spindle Cove and be a shopkeeper, and he would become a respectable duke. They would be further apart than ever.</p><p>Oh, God. They might never meet again.</p><p>\u201cI have my carriage and fastest team waiting to see you home. But first there\u2019s something I owe you.\u201d He rummaged in his pocket.</p><p>The thought of him paying her made her stomach turn. The words spilled from her lips. \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t take your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But that was before, and now . . .\u201d She shuddered, thinking of Delacre and his five-pound note. \u201cIt would make me feel cheap. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. You must take this much, at least.\u201d He pulled a coin from his pocket and placed it in her hand. He folded her fingers over it, still breathing hard. \u201cFor Daniela. I don\u2019t have a penny.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Griff.</p><p>\u201cI expect great things of you, Pauline.\u201d He touched her cheek. \u201cDo me a favor and expect the same of me? Lord knows, no one else will.\u201d</p><p>As he retreated back into his glittering, aristocratic world, she opened her fingers and stared at the golden sovereign on her palm.</p><p>Dukes and their problems.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Griff watched his mother closely as she turned in place, taking in the walls painted with incongruous rainbows and frolicking Arabian colts.</p><p>\u201cI did want to tell you.\u201d He took a seat on a wooden stool draped with a Holland cloth. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know how. She was gone so quickly, and then afterward . . .\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off, and the duchess raised a hand in a firm, silent gesture, letting him know further words were unnecessary. She was no stranger to quiet suffering, holding her aristocratic grace through all manner of trials. He knew this news would hurt her deeply\u2014it was why he hadn\u2019t wanted to tell her. But she was the duchess. If he knew his mother, she would cling to her composure. Bear up under the weight and never crack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Perhaps he didn\u2019t know his mother at all.</p><p>She turned to him with tears in her eyes. \u201cOh, Griffin. I\u2019ve been so worried for you. I knew you were hurting, and I knew the cause must be something horrible. You\u2019ve looked horrible.\u201d</p><p>Griff rubbed his face with both hands.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I mean it. Just perfectly wretched.\u201d</p><p>He made a gesture of helplessness. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI was so hoping it wouldn\u2019t come to this. Stay right there.\u201d</p><p>She left, and returned within a minute, approaching him where he sat in the center of the room.</p><p>From beneath her arm, his mother unfurled the ugliest, most malformed knitted muffler he\u2019d ever seen. She wrapped it once, twice, thrice about his neck.</p> <p>It was the tightest, warmest hug he\u2019d ever received.</p><p>He stared up at her, bewildered. \u201cWhere did this come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe knitting? Or the affection it represents? I\u2019d rather not talk about the knitting. As for the love . . . it\u2019s always been here. Even when we haven\u2019t discussed it.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet and kissed her on the cheek. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>For so many years now they\u2019d been all the family each other had. He suspected they\u2019d avoided admitting how much they meant to each other, for the simple fear of acknowledging how close they were to being alone.</p><p>She touched one of her cool, papery hands to his face. \u201cMy darling boy. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you bear it?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow did you bear this three times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as bravely as you have. And never alone.\u201d She looked around at the painted walls. \u201cThe loss was keen. In my heart, I have a room something like this for each of them. But even in the darkest hours, your father and I took comfort in each other. And in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn me? God. I never felt good enough to be one son. Let alone take the place of four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that you felt that way. Looking back, we should have been more nurturing. But we were so afraid of coddling you, when we knew the strong man you\u2019d need to become. Left to my own devices, I could have hugged you to my bosom and held you there until your sixteenth birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d His mouth pulled to the side. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m glad you resisted that urge.\u201d</p><p>She patted his cheek. \u201cGriffin, I\u2019ve always looked at you and seen a generous, good-hearted man. I\u2019ve merely grown impatient waiting for you to see the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be better for her.\u201d He lifted his eyes to the ceiling. \u201cI didn\u2019t hide all this because I was ashamed of Mary Annabel. I was only ashamed of myself, my dissolute life. I\u2019d resolved to make myself a better man. I didn\u2019t want anyone to look at my daughter and see one of my mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Mistakes he kept right on making, it seemed.</p> <p>\u201cShe was right,\u201d he said. \u201cPauline was right about our chances, but she had the blame laid wrong. If society won\u2019t accept her, it\u2019s not her fault. It\u2019s mine. A stodgy, boring sort of nobleman might fall in love with a commoner, and society would give her the benefit of the doubt. An even chance to prove herself, at least. But with my sordid history, people will always assume she\u2019s just a debauched duke\u2019s latest, greatest scandal. She deserves better than that. I want better for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late,\u201d his mother said. \u201cLet her come here. Not just for a week, but months. You can take your place in Lords, and we\u2019ll introduce her to society slowly next year. You\u2019ll see, people will eventually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, that\u2019s just it. She doesn\u2019t want this life, and I don\u2019t blame her. I don\u2019t even want it, but I know it\u2019s my duty now.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThere may never be a ninth Duke of Halford, but I want the eighth to be remembered well. For my daughter\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Pauline?\u201d</p><p>Pauline, Pauline, Pauline. She\u2019d been gone from his life a matter of hours, and he already missed her so acutely. He would spend his life digging out from landslides.</p><p>\u201cI just want all her dreams to come true.\u201d</p><p>Had the cottage always been this small?</p><p>Pauline stood in the lane, just staring. Uncertain how to approach her own home. Major the guard goose came honking toward her, alerting those within the house.</p><p>\u201cPauline?\u201d Her mother\u2019s face appeared in the window. \u201cPauline, is that you?\u201d</p><p>She dashed a tear from her eye. \u201cYes, Mum. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>Later, up in the sleeping loft, Pauline and Daniela hugged and cried. Then they brushed and plaited one another\u2019s hair and laid out their Sunday dresses for the next morning.</p><p>As always, Griff\u2019s sovereign went straight in the collection box.</p><p>During the church service, Pauline could feel all the curiosity of Spindle Cove focused on her. She knew she\u2019d have to answer a great many questions, but she just wasn\u2019t ready yet.</p><p>And even though she managed to delay her first trip to the All Things shop for another several days, she still wasn\u2019t prepared to answer them.</p><p>Sally Bright pounced on her the moment she walked through the door. Aside from being her oldest and dearest friend, Sally was the most inquisitive, gossipy person in Spindle Cove. Pauline knew the curiosity must be gnawing at her friend with a hundred teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u201d\u2014she lifted and waved a stack of newspapers\u2014\u201chave so much explaining to do! Did you really attend a ball? Make a duke fall madly in love with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally, I don\u2019t wish to speak of it yet. I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s all too . . .\u201d Her voice broke.</p><p>Sally didn\u2019t press for more. She hurried out from behind the counter and wrapped Pauline in a tight hug. \u201cThere there. We\u2019ll have years to talk it over, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Pauline nodded. \u201cSadly, I think we will.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been harboring the absurd hope that Griff would come chasing after her, perhaps show up at the farm cottage some morning, unshaven and smelling of cologne. But as the days passed, her hope seemed more and more like a fanciful dream. That wasn\u2019t the fairy tale he\u2019d promised her.</p><p>\u201cI have some news that will cheer you,\u201d Sally said.</p><p>\u201cOh? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nasty old Mrs. Whittlecombe. She\u2019s moving to Dorset to live with her nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly? That is good news, I suppose. For everyone but the nephew. I thought she\u2019d never leave that tumbledown old place.\u201d</p><p>Sally shrugged. \u201cWell, she did. And cleared out of the neighborhood quickly, too. Now I\u2019m stuck with a half-dozen bottles of her noxious \u2018health tonic.\u2019 I don\u2019t suppose anyone else is going to want it.\u201d Her eyebrows lifted. \u201cAnd there\u2019s something else. Something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome see.\u201d</p><p>Sally pulled her over to the storeroom. On the floor in the center sat an immense wooden crate, labeled with Pauline\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cA man delivered it special yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come through the regular post. But he told me it wasn\u2019t to go to your cottage, ever. I must wait until Miss Simms came to the shop, and I couldn\u2019t speak a word of it to anyone. It was all just painfully mysterious.\u201d She gave Pauline\u2019s arm an impatient shake. \u201cCan\u2019t we open it now? It\u2019s heavy as anything. I\u2019m dying to know what\u2019s inside. Dying.\u201d</p><p>Pauline nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Sally gave a little cheer of excitement. With the help of a slender crowbar, she pried the top from the crate and sifted through a top layer of straw.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cWell, that\u2019s disappointing. I hope you didn\u2019t have your hopes too high. It\u2019s only books.\u201d She lifted a red-bound volume off the top and peered into the crate. \u201cYes. Books, all the way down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see,\u201d Pauline said, snatching the book from Sally\u2019s hand.</p><p>She ran a palm over the fresh red Morocco binding, brushing aside a blade of straw so she could read the cover: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure: The Life and Adventures of Fanny Hill.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this Mrs. Radcliffe person?\u201d Sally lifted a handful of books from the crate. \u201cShe wrote a great many books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful with them, please.\u201d Pauline went to her side and began to sort through the volumes. Radcliffe, Johnson, Wollstonecraft, Fielding, Defoe. All the books on the list that Griff had dictated that day in Snidling\u2019s bookshop.</p><p>He\u2019d remembered. And he\u2019d known not to send them to her home, for fear her father would pitch them all into the fire. She lifted the book to her nose and inhaled that aroma deeply\u2014her second favorite smell\u2014before setting it aside to look at the rest.</p><p>Halfway through the crate, she found a small volume not bound in red Morocco, but instead covered in the softest, most impractical fawn-hued leather. Collected Poems of William Blake.</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes as she opened the cover. Inside, right on the exquisite marble endpaper, there was affixed a bookplate with a stamp.</p><p>FROM THE LIBRARY OF MISS PAULINE SIMMS</p><p>\u201cOh, Griff.\u201d</p><p>This crate wasn\u2019t merely stuffed with books. It was full of meaning. Messages too complicated to explain and too risky to send in a letter.</p><p>He knew her, this crate of books said. He knew her to the deepest, most hidden places of her soul. He respected her as a person, with thoughts and dreams and desires.</p><p>He loved her. He truly did.</p><p>And most poignant of all, this crate of books held one clear, undeniable message:</p><p>Goodbye.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>A few months later</p><p>If there was anything better than the smell of books, it was the smell of books mingled with the scents of strong tea and spice biscuits\u2014and all of it on a rainy afternoon.</p><p>A celebration was in order. The Two Sisters circulating library was exactly one month old today.</p><p>All the Spindle Cove ladies had come to their party. The small shop was crowded with young women poring over scandalous books and dunking their biscuits into cups of milky tea.</p><p>Pauline loved this shop, as she\u2019d never thought she could love something that was supposed to be work. And she did work hard\u2014every day, from dawn to dusk\u2014but the labor was a fatiguing kind of joy. Spindle Cove was bustling with a new crop of ladies on holiday, all of them eager for new reading material.</p><p>Some days, a young woman might come through the door looking rather lost. And then she\u2019d find an old friend sitting on the shelf, bound in red Morocco. Or perhaps a new, exciting acquaintance. She\u2019d leave with a book in her hand and a smile on her face. Those days made all the hard work worthwhile.</p><p>And she never worked alone. She had her sister.</p><p>She and Daniela had traded one sleeping loft for another. They lived above the shop now, the two of them. Except for visits to Mama on Sundays, they kept their own hours, made their own meals, cleaned as little or as much as they liked. They were wildly extravagant with candles, burning them late into the night and reading verses to each other.</p><p>This place truly was home.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that walking across the square?\u201d a lady said, peering out the window. \u201cDo we know him?\u201d</p><p>A second young lady laughed. \u201cI think we might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh goodness,\u201d said Charlotte Highwood. \u201cNot him again.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be. He wouldn\u2019t have come. But in the end, curiosity won out. Pauline made her way to the window and peered out through the rain.</p><p>Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord. It was him. Even with the rain, she\u2019d know those strong features and broad shoulders anywhere. The Duke of Halford was walking straight toward her shop.</p><p>Griff.</p><p>Her pulse began to pound. Why was he here now, after months had passed with no word? Just when she\u2019d gathered the pieces of her heart and built it a new, safer home.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Simms,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI\u2019ll devil him before he can trouble you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pauline stepped toward the rear of the shop, trying to steel herself.</p><p>He opened the door, ducking his head to enter. \u201cIs this the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalt.\u201d Charlotte blocked the doorway with a broomstick. \u201cAre you looking for someone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d His deep voice rang out. \u201cI am most certainly not looking for \u2018someone.\u2019 I\u2019m looking for Pauline Simms and no other.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Charlotte held firm. \u201cThe cost of entry is a verse. No exceptions.\u201d</p><p>Griff looked past her, scanning the crowded shop until his eyes locked with Pauline\u2019s. Heavens above. He was even more handsome than she remembered.</p><p>\u201cMiss Simms,\u201d he said. \u201cMay I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo exceptions,\u201d Charlotte repeated. \u201cA verse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any verses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrite one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, very well.\u201d He pushed a hand through his dark, damp hair. \u201cThere once was a libertine duke. He . . . He . . . preferred trout and cod to fluke. He let his love go, but he wants her to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>Pauline turned away, unable to look at him anymore.</p><p>He shouted after her. \u201cI haven\u2019t ceased thinking of you since that night, Pauline. Not for a moment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible verse,\u201d said Charlotte, holding the broomstick turnpike in place. \u201cDoesn\u2019t even rhyme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else rhymes with duke.\u201d</p><p>The ladies muttered among themselves, debating possibilities.</p><p>\u201cI have it.\u201d Charlotte\u2019s voice rang out over all. \u201cPuke! \u2018He let his love go, but he wants her to know . . . that thoughts of her face make him puke.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t do,\u201d Griff said. \u201cThat\u2019s not right at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it rhymes,\u201d Charlotte grumbled.</p><p>\u201cRebuke,\u201d Pauline declared, exasperated. \u201cHe deserves a stern rebuke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Griff said. \u201cI\u2019ll take that one. May I pass now?\u201d</p> <p>Daniela threw a biscuit. It bounced off the duke\u2019s forehead. \u201cGo, Duke. Leave my sister be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniela has the right of it,\u201d Pauline said. \u201cYou should go. I can\u2019t imagine what you want after all these months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you, see how you\u2019ve done.\u201d He looked around the shop. \u201cThis is brilliant, Pauline. I knew you\u2019d make a go of it.\u201d</p><p>That was all? He\u2019d made the journey all the way down from London just to have a look at his investment, so to speak?</p><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019ve seen me,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you can go.\u201d</p><p>The other ladies in the room agreed, adding their voices to the call for Griff to leave.</p><p>\u201cListen, if you\u2019ll all just give me a moment alone with Miss Simms, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go,\u201d she shouted, her nerves in tatters. The scent of his cologne was wafting its nefarious way to her, and soon she\u2019d be reduced to a puddle on her newly painted floor. \u201cYou might be a duke, but you can\u2019t make a habit of this. Popping into my place of work unannounced and turning my life on its ear. I won\u2019t have it. I just can\u2019t. So unless you\u2019ve come here to fall on your knees, grovel for forgiveness, and beg me to marry you, you can leave this moment and never return.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t leave. He merely stood there, staring at her.</p><p>Then he went down on his knees.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Pauline pressed both hands to her face. \u201cGriff, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t refuse before I even ask.\u201d He ruffled his hair with one hand. \u201cWhy is this all happening backward? I knew you\u2019d be surprised to see me, and no doubt angry that it\u2019s taken me so long. But I thought you\u2019d at least let me have a few words. I had a whole speech prepared, you know. A good one, too. But now that you\u2019ve ruined the surprise . . .\u201d</p><p>He reached into his pocket and removed a small velvet pouch.</p><p>Pauline peeked at it between her trembling fingers. By now she was crying messily. She swiped impatiently at the tears with both wrists, straining to make out the ring he shook free onto his palm. An emerald, set in a thick gold band and ringed with tiny diamonds.</p><p>Well, at least she knew he\u2019d chosen it himself.</p><p>It was beautiful.</p><p>She turned away, burying her face in her apron. Griffin Eliot York, the eighth Duke of Halford, was here, on his knees. For her. Ring in hand, with the whole village watching.</p><p>It was too much. Too much impossibility to accept. To much joy to comprehend.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Pauline Simms. I\u2019ve loved you since the day we met. In fact, I suspect some part of my heart loved you long before then. There was no woman for me before you, and if you refuse me, there\u2019ll be no one after. I know I\u2019m no prize, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him with a burst of indelicate laughter. \u201cNo prize?\u201d Turning, she dabbed at her eyes. \u201cGriff, you\u2019re a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d noticed that. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . we settled this. A duke can\u2019t marry a serving girl. Or even a shopkeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right. Our lives were too different. For the two of us to make a go of it, something had to change. I couldn\u2019t change the world. And I didn\u2019t want to change one thing about you. It seemed clear, however, that I was overdue for some improvement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImprovement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re familiar with the Halford legacy. I come from a long line of scholars, explorers, generals. They amassed quite the string of accomplishments and a vast amount of wealth. And I finally realized there\u2019s one thing I had the heart to do that none of the rest of them could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could give it all away.\u201d</p><p>The shop went very quiet.</p><p>\u201cAll of it?\u201d Pauline echoed.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Charlotte moaned. \u201cNow he\u2019s worse than an arrogant, debauched duke. He\u2019s a poor duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no pauper,\u201d he said. \u201cYou needn\u2019t look so stricken. A duke can\u2019t surrender his title. There are entailed properties, trusts. It\u2019s boring solicitor business, that part. The short version is, I\u2019ll always be a wealthy man. I might sink from fourth richest in England to somewhere about fourteenth. But even so, there was a great deal of money I was free to part with. And it went easily, once I applied myself to the task.\u201d</p><p>Pauline eyed him, wary. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What are you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found my natural talent. I was born to give money away. But no more of this \u2018squander a few thousand here or there\u2019 nonsense. This is a full, systematic divesture of the family\u2019s dispensable fortune. The eighth Duke of Halford will be remembered as the single largest charitable benefactor in England\u2019s history. This will be my legacy.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, shocked. But he did look happy. Entirely at peace with himself and his place in the world. Not precisely humble. She didn\u2019t suppose that rakish arrogance would ever wear off, nor did she wish it to. But he looked like a man with purpose and direction.</p><p>And the best part was, she knew he hadn\u2019t given any of it up for her. He\u2019d done it for himself.</p><p>\u201cI confess, I did make one last selfish purchase.\u201d A sly grin tipped his mouth. \u201cA crumbling farmhouse, of all things. At the arse-end of Sussex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou purchased the Whittlecombe farmhouse? That was you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only land for sale in the parish.\u201d With a muttered curse, he shifted his weight. \u201cWill you say yes soon? This floor is damned hard. And you\u2019re much too far away.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer. \u201cI don\u2019t remember hearing a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to ask, truthfully. \u2018Will you be my wife\u2019 or \u2018be my duchess\u2019 or just \u2018be mine\u2019 . . . they all sound dangerous. I don\u2019t want to put names or titles to it, or you\u2019ll find some way to argue. I don\u2019t even care if you wear the bloody ring.\u201d He tossed the velvet pouch to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear the ring,\u201d Charlotte offered.</p><p>Pauline sent her a look. Don\u2019t touch it.</p><p>Griff held out his empty hand. \u201cPauline, I\u2019m here asking you\u2014begging you, if it comes to that\u2014to take my hand. Just take my hand, and promise before God you will never let it go. I will vow the same. Can we arrange for that to happen, someday soon? In a church?\u201d After a moment, he added in a quiet voice, \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>She put her hand in his. His fingers curled around hers in a grasp that was as poignant as a hug, as iron-forged as a promise. And she knew, in her heart, that the church vows would only be formalities.</p><p>This was the moment. And from here, the world only grew warmer.</p><p>He raised her hand to his lips and kissed it. \u201cTell me this means yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, to all the questions. To every question. And I\u2019d be honored to wear your ring.\u201d</p><p>Excepting Charlotte, who muttered \u201cDrat,\u201d everyone gave a hearty cheer.</p><p>Hours later, after all the biscuits were eaten and the teapot down to dregs, after Daniela had gone up to sleep upstairs, the two of them stood on opposite sides of the shop counter, holding hands and trading fond looks back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just noticed something,\u201d Pauline said. \u201cI always feel most in love with you when we\u2019re surrounded by books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. I must speak with the architect designing our new house. I\u2019ll instruct him to install floor-to-ceiling bookcases on every wall of our bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s enough that you\u2019re here. I confess, I\u2019d lost hope. I read in the paper that you went home to Cumberland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. My mother went with me. I settled matters with my land steward so I wouldn\u2019t have to return for some time. And we placed a stone for Mary Annabel in the family churchyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Griff. I\u2019m glad you were able to do that together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d He cleared his throat and looked around at the shop. \u201cHow did you manage all this without the funds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI started with the books you sent, of course. The ladies helped me gather more. And for the shop rental, I took out a loan from Errol Bright.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy flashed in his eyes. \u201cErrol Bright made you a loan?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cA friendly loan. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m halfway to paying him back already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you are.\u201d He kissed her hand and stroked it fondly. \u201cI will demand some compromise, you know. Spindle Cove is home now, but I have other properties that need attention. Responsibilities in London, as well. I\u2019m now a governor of several charities. And I suspect the next year or so will teach us who our true friends are. If we\u2019re invited to a ball or party, I should like to attend and show off my beautiful wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, too.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed as he studied the notch between her second and third fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you children. You know that. I\u2019d love nothing more than a family with you, but . . . there are no guarantees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I can offer you with certitude is a devoted husband and devious mother-in-law. Can it be enough?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMore than enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, and we can\u2019t forget Daniela. She\u2019ll be with us, too. I know change is difficult for her, but I\u2019ve given it a great deal of thought. We\u2019ll arrange for her to have a bedchamber in every one of our residences, each arranged and decorated exactly the same. So she\u2019ll always feel at home. And we can hire her a companion, if you like. An excellent one. You know I only employ the best.\u201d</p><p>Her throat itched so fiercely, it was all she could do to squeeze out, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need of thanks. You know I was raised an only child. It will be my joy to have a sister. If you\u2019ll share her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was nothing\u2014nothing\u2014he could have said that would have meant more. He was the best of men. She should never have doubted him, not even for a moment. She never would again.</p><p>He said, \u201cDaniela and my mother will get on like thieves, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>The image made Pauline smile through her tears. \u201cGoodness. The shopping trips alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever mind the shopping. Imagine the knitting.\u201d</p><p>They laughed together.</p><p>She touched a hand to her brow. \u201cIt\u2019s too much. You\u2019re being too perfect. Quickly, say something horrid so I know this isn\u2019t a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. I have a creeping skin condition, and I hoot like a barn owl when I reach orgasm.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cBut I know very well those things aren\u2019t true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t true a few months ago. I think you\u2019d better strip me naked and make sure nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. I might know of a quiet hayloft.\u201d</p><p>He leaned across the counter and kissed her. Warmly, leisurely. It was possibly the best kiss he\u2019d ever given her.</p><p>It was an everyday kiss.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s truly going to be all right,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>His lips quirked, and he squeezed her hand in his. \u201cSometimes it will be all right. But for the most part, it\u2019s going to be wonderful.\u201d</p><p>And it was.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Five years later</p><p>\u201cDo you have a name picked out for her?\u201d Victor Bramwell, Lord Rycliff, reclined in his chair at the Bull and Blossom and stacked his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d Colin echoed. \u201cHow do you know the babe will be a \u2018her\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certain to be a girl,\u201d Bram said. \u201cSusanna calls it the Spindle Cove Effect. There\u2019s my Victoria. Thorne has little Bryony. Susanna even had a letter from Violet Winterbottom\u2014twins. We\u2019ve all had firstborn girls.\u201d He cocked his head, indicating Griff. \u201cSave for Halford, of course.\u201d</p><p>Griff didn\u2019t correct him by mentioning Mary Annabel\u2014this wasn\u2019t the time\u2014but took a thoughtful sip to her memory.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t place any bets,\u201d Colin said. \u201cNothing about this has gone according to custom or reason. Minerva wasn\u2019t supposed to give birth for a month yet. We wouldn\u2019t have imposed on Halford for a visit otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as well you\u2019re here, and not in London,\u201d Griff said. \u201cIn Spindle Cove, she has her friends around her. And there\u2019s certainly space enough at the house.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d razed the crumbling old Whittlecombe farmhouse years ago, replacing it with a home that was grand enough for a duke and his duchess, but not too overwhelming for Daniela or too ostentatious for the neighborhood. He and Pauline thought of it as the honeymoon cottage to their larger homes in Cumberland and Town. It was the one residence that was all theirs\u2014not populated by generations of history.</p><p>And most of the year, it was home.</p><p>But while it boasted twenty rooms and the finest in modern construction, the house wasn\u2019t soundproof\u2014nor big enough to contain three anxious noblemen while a woman suffered through childbirth upstairs.</p><p>Susanna, exhausted by assisting the midwife and replying to constant requests for updates, had shooed the men down to the village for a drink. She promised to send word as soon as there was anything to report.</p><p>Cowardly as the retreat might have been, all three of them took it gratefully. Griff bought round after round of ale in the cozy, familiar tavern, and the hours stretched. If this dragged on until nightfall, he suspected they\u2019d need to move on to something stronger. Brandy or whiskey, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a girl,\u201d Bram said again. \u201cSo have a name ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinerva insisted I leave the naming to her.\u201d Colin drained his tankard. \u201cShe said I\u2019ll undoubtedly call the child everything but her proper name anyhow.\u201d He blew out his breath and drummed his fingers on the tabletop. \u201cHow many hours will this take? As long as Min and I waited to start a family, I find my patience is exhausted. This is torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink how your wife is feeling, my lord.\u201d Becky Willett served them a fresh round. Fosbury hadn\u2019t lost his weakness for smart-mouthed serving girls.</p><p>\u201cHe is thinking of his wife,\u201d Griff said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s torture.\u201d</p><p>If anyone thought Colin\u2019s moaning was excessive, they should have seen Griff the first time Pauline began her labor pains. He\u2019d been a right bastard. Barking for doctors, shouting orders at the maids, prowling up and down the corridors. He\u2019d needed to put up a strong front, lest anyone see the sheer terror eating him from the inside. If anything had happened to her . . .</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Bram told Colin. \u201cWhen it\u2019s over\u2014once you see she\u2019s well, and the midwife places your red, shriveled female offspring in your arms\u2014all this worry will be forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Griff hoped that would be the case for his old friend. It certainly hadn\u2019t worked that way for him. He hadn\u2019t slept for a fortnight after his son\u2019s birth. He\u2019d hovered over the cradle, walked the halls with him swaddled in his arms.</p><p>Finally, Pauline had found him in the library one early morning.</p><p>He\u2019d nodded off in a chair, little Jonathan tucked into the crook of his elbow. When he awoke, it was to the vision of his lovely wife, her hair unbound and haloed by new sunlight. So beautiful, she could have been an angel.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word\u2014just took their child from his arms, kissed the cheek Griff hadn\u2019t shaved in days, and smiled.</p><p>In that moment a sense of peace had descended on him. For the first time since they\u2019d learned Pauline was with child, he stopped worrying about everything that could go wrong and began looking forward to everything that would go right.</p><p>Almost four years now, and he hadn\u2019t looked back.</p><p>He was sure his peers would look at his life here and find it highly confusing. The duchess kept a circulating library and remained best of friends with the dry goods shopkeeper. Their children frequently wore lumpy, ill-knitted jackets, and they played with children of farmers and fishermen. To balance his charitable work for the local school and St. Ursula\u2019s parish, Griff hosted a weekly card game that was legendary.</p><p>It was an unconventional life for a duke, perhaps. But an unquestionably happy one.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t young Lord Westmore.\u201d Fosbury\u2019s voice boomed from the kitchen. \u201cAnd her grace and little Lady Rose with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sweets, please, Mr. Fosbury.\u201d Pauline\u2019s voice. \u201cTheir grandmother spoils them enough. No, Rose. You mustn\u2019t touch.\u201d</p><p>Griff smiled to himself. So many years since she\u2019d worked in this tavern, and his wife\u2014his duchess\u2014still entered the establishment through the rear door.</p><p>And even with frazzled hair and two small children in tow, she still took his breath away. Every time.</p><p>Colin shot to his feet. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich \u2018she\u2019?\u201d Pauline led Jonathan by one hand and had little Rose propped on the opposite hip. \u201cDo you mean your wife or your daughter?\u201d</p><p>Bram thumped the table, triumphant. \u201cTold you it would be a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both well,\u201d Pauline hurried to add. \u201cIn excellent health and enjoying some hard-earned rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . That\u2019s . . .\u201d Colin paled and dropped to the chair again as his knees gave out. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>Pauline came to Griff\u2019s side and nodded at Colin\u2019s dazed state. \u201cIs that from the drink or the shock of fatherhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, I suspect. Give him a moment, he\u2019ll recover.\u201d</p><p>She released Jonathan\u2019s hand and shifted Rose from one arm to the other. \u201cWill you watch them while I pop over to see Sally? I\u2019m expecting a new parcel of books for the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. But I expect a reward for my trouble.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his cheek and whispered a husky, \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d He caught Rose and lifted her into his arms, tweaking the snub of her tiny nose. \u201cLook at you, darling. You\u2019re all spangled with sugar.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
