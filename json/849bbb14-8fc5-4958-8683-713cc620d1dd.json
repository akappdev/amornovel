Out of habit, he poured Ben\u2019s, leaving it caffeine-coma black as he added sugar and cream to his own Colombian blend. \u201cJanet hears you barking like that, she\u2019ll wash your mouth out with soap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll shove Irish Spring dry up the ass of whatever moron in Personnel decided to send me an intern while Alice is on vacation. Christ. I would have come in this weekend if I\u2019d known, but Alice said she had it handled. Fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlice doesn\u2019t usually make mistakes. Whoever the intern is, she\u2019s probably top of her class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. She knows her way around a stack of books. Doesn\u2019t mean a fucking thing in the real world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. O\u2019Callahan?\u201d</p><p>Turning, Ben saw Janet, their CEO\u2019s imperious admin, standing in the doorway of the office kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSince I and everyone else can hear you,\u201d she said coolly, \u201cyour finished contract is on your desk. The baby intern scaled the walls of her crib and spent most of the weekend getting up to speed on the negotiations with Senecorp so you\u2019d have it first thing this morning. You\u2019ll find her sucking her thumb at Alice\u2019s desk. I\u2019ve given her a handful of Cheerios to keep her happy. I trust you\u2019ll handle any diaper changing personally.\u201d</p><p>Peter shot him a droll I-told-you-so look. Ben narrowed his gaze, but when he turned that irritated expression on Janet, she didn\u2019t blink. She and Alice had worked for Kensington &amp; Associates long enough to know they were utterly indispensable. Alice had been Matt\u2019s admin before she took paralegal training, after which she became Ben\u2019s assistant, but both women routinely handled the diverse personalities of the five men who comprised K&amp;A\u2019s executive management.</p><p>That included Ben\u2019s formidable Irish temper, which he knew had been rising to the top more often of late, enough that he\u2019d had to suffer jokes about male menopause at the ripe old age of thirty-two. And send apology bouquets to both admins more than once.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Janet,\u201d he said. \u201cI appreciate your excellent hearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She gave him a reproving look and then vanished, her heels soundless on the carpeted hallway.</p><p>\u201cThe contract will probably be fucked up five ways to Sunday,\u201d he muttered. \u201cOnly thing worse than an intern who doesn\u2019t know anything is one who thinks she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019ll have a great rack and a nice ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get that from a Playboy centerfold. Doesn\u2019t help me when Matt is tearing me a new one for sloppy prep work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re way tougher on yourself than Matt could ever be.\u201d Peter gave him a thoughtful look. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty grumpy these days. I know you\u2019re getting plenty, so maybe you\u2019re fucking the wrong type of women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no such thing, Dr. Phil. Bite me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPass. Haven\u2019t had my shots. I know where you\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>Ben snorted. \u201cPlaces you can only dream about now, ball-and-chain.\u201d</p><p>Taking his coffee, he headed for his corner office. He balanced the cup with his briefcase as his phone buzzed with several incoming messages. He had forty-five minutes to review and fix that contract, and then he had a meeting with Johnson in Matt\u2019s office that would take up the hour before his ten o\u2019clock. If the intern hadn\u2019t totally screwed it up, he could have her run the contract over to Senecorp so they could digest it before he arrived.</p><p>The desk where Alice was normally stationed, a few paces from the door of his office, was vacant. The baby intern had escaped from her high chair or the Cheerios hadn\u2019t been sufficiently entertaining. Setting aside his briefcase, he took a seat at his desk, his eye on the contract sitting neatly in the middle of it.</p><p>When he had a free weekend, he spent it immersed in sweet female ass and Irish whiskey, his reward for work weeks often eighty-plus hours long. He worked hard, played hard, with exacting demands in both areas of his life. Which was why Alice\u2019s voicemail this morning had set him off.</p> <p>The revisions for the Senecorp contract will be done by the intern Personnel has hired. Don\u2019t worry. She\u2019s good. And don\u2019t curse when you get this message.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fucking curse if I want to,\u201d he muttered. Just not around Alice. Or Janet. Cognizant of her superhero hearing, he\u2019d have toned it down in the kitchen, except he hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d arrived as early as he had this morning.</p><p>As he scanned the contract, his brow eased. Well, hell. The revisions were damn near perfect. Some of the points had even been tweaked for smoother language, keeping his original meaning intact. Not a typo to be found, not even a random crayon mark or a smudge from fingers stained with Juicy Juice. His lips quirked. Putting the document down, he rubbed a hand over his face.</p><p>Hell, what was the matter with him these days? He didn\u2019t used to get so worked up about shit like this. Yeah, he was an ogre on details, but in the past he\u2019d had a scathing sense of humor about it. From Peter\u2019s sidelong glances, he knew he and the others had ongoing theories about him, especially Jon, Mr. Touchy-Feely-Let\u2019s-All-Hug. He gave them credit for sticking to the guy code, though, giving him room to steer the boat the way he needed to steer it for right now.</p><p>Still, he had to push down resentment at Peter\u2019s teasing. It was easy to be smug about the hollow state of a single guy\u2019s sex life when you were married to the submissive of your wildest dreams, the way Peter was. Though Dana was blind, she had the courage and unbridled sensuality of a woman with all her senses intact. Ben knew it firsthand, because on one memorable night, Peter had enlisted his help to make one of her fantasies come true, to be taken by two men at once.</p><p>All five members of Kensington &amp; Associates executive management were hardcore sexual Dominants, and four of them had found their perfect submissive match. Soul mates, if you believed in that bullshit, and it was hard not to, looking at how they got along with one another. Ben remembered the aftermath of that night with Dana. He\u2019d gone into the bathroom to clean up, and when he came out, he\u2019d seen her curled inside the curve of Peter\u2019s muscular body. His arms were wrapped around her like she was the beginning and end of everything, his lips cruising over her temple and cheek, his deep voice rumbling soft in her ear. Ben felt like an intruder. He\u2019d slipped out without another word. He didn\u2019t really do cuddling, anyhow.</p><p>So here he was, four years later, still single. That didn\u2019t bug him. If he wanted a more serious relationship, he could seek it. Yeah, maybe in his few off hours he\u2019d started opting for whiskey and strolling through the Quarter, rather than seeking female companionship. No big deal. His tastes were the most extreme, so club submissives had been good enough for him for the past year or two. Dating was too much effort, always the wrong ingredients, a meal he had to eat to be polite, but couldn\u2019t wait to finish and step away from the table.</p><p>Things had changed, and much as he knew that was the way of the fucked-up world, it didn\u2019t always sit so well. It stirred up shit he didn\u2019t want stirred, and maybe that was what kept griping his bowels. Hell, maybe it was time to take a vacation, go somewhere tropical where he could seduce pretty women and get his boxers out of their permanent bunch. Except all he seemed to see when he imagined that vacation was a stretch of empty beach, nobody on it but him.</p><p>Christ, was he lonely? He didn\u2019t need down time. He needed more up time, juvenile sexual pun intended. He\u2019d drive down to Baton Rouge, do an extra session at Club Surreal this week. In the past couple years, Surreal had opened a sister club here in New Orleans, appropriately called Club Progeny, but he preferred to go to Baton Rouge when he didn\u2019t want to run into one of the other guys. He\u2019d find one of his regulars, or a new submissive looking for a club-only experience. Take her on one of his extreme roller-coaster rides, not letting her off until she was too shaky to walk.</p><p>When he was breaking down her shields, opening her up to everything he demanded, getting the maximum level of response, far beyond what she imagined was possible, time stopped for him. It was all about that moment. It was the same feeling he\u2019d had when he was doing trial lawyer work, earlier in his career. When he felt the steel jaws closing around his opponent, knowing he was the guy with his foot on that spring lever, it was almost as good as sex. Negotiations with Matt\u2019s acquisitions gave him the same sensation, particularly when it was a hostile takeover.</p><p>Jon had recently observed that Ben was Genghis Khan in a previous life, happy with nothing but conquering. Asshole. Their mechanical genius didn\u2019t do barbed digs, though. If Jon said something like that, he was sending a message. Ben chose to ignore it.</p><p>The light tap of heels moving from the carpet to the wood floor around the admin desk alerted him to the arrival of his intern. He bit back a sigh. He really wasn\u2019t in the mood to be charming and welcoming, but he\u2019d make the effort. He wasn\u2019t in the habit of snarling at women even on his worst days, particularly young ones right out of school and wet behind their ears.</p><p>Then he glanced out his doorway, and discovered another way time could stop, one he hadn\u2019t experienced in a while. His gaze got stuck in full lock.</p><p>She\u2019d turned to the file cabinets, so he\u2019d missed her face. Instead, he saw a classic Audrey Hepburn slim hourglass shape, complete with tailored skirt that nipped off above her knee. When she sat down, a hint of thigh would tease male senses. She was wearing those provocative nylons with the old-fashioned lines up the back, and they were perfectly straight. Following the contour of calf, the sweet valley behind the knee, they ran up the back of her thigh and disappeared beneath the snug hold of the skirt. Her pale yellow blouse was translucent silk that showed the impression of her bra in the same color, making him wonder if there were panties in that same butter color beneath the skirt.</p><p>Her dark blonde hair would fall a little farther than her shoulder blades, but right now it was clipped shorter by a wide bronze barrette, a Celtic knot design with a tiny shamrock done in emerald rhinestones. As she put the files away, he saw well-kept nails, a French manicure with white tips that drew attention to capable, feminine grace. There was something familiar about the way she moved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t know what scent she was wearing because he wasn\u2019t that close, but he wanted to be. His gaze slid back down to that tempting ass, shaped nice and round by the tailored skirt. If she\u2019d bend down to the lower file drawers, he could let his mind go some pretty interesting places. Not that he\u2019d be anything but professional with her, of course. Baby intern and all that.</p><p>She turned then, and his attention coursed up the flare of hips, registering generous breasts, probably a C-cup, cradled in a lacy, low-cut bra, thank the lingerie gods. The two-button opening of the blouse collar was modest, but would still give him a glimpse of bare curve at the right angle. She was perfectly put together, office executive with appealing woman, class and style all the way. Jesus, this was an intern? Then he reached her face and was poleaxed.</p><p>Holy Christ, it was Marcie.</p> <p>Snapping his chair back to an upright position, he managed to send his pen spinning off his desk when he set down his coffee. He damn near splashed the document she\u2019d prepared for him.</p><p>When Lucas, K&amp;A\u2019s CFO, had married Cassandra, she\u2019d been the guardian of five younger siblings. Marcie was the next oldest girl, about to turn seventeen when Ben first met her. She\u2019d already been pretty, but pretty teenager had obviously given way to breathtaking young woman.</p><p>For the past four years, she\u2019d been away at college. During her freshman and sophomore years, he\u2019d seen her briefly at holidays, because the five K&amp;A men were a family. They\u2019d congregate at Matt\u2019s family estate in Texas, or Jon\u2019s second home in Baton Rouge for family get-togethers. But for the last two years, Marcie hadn\u2019t been home, though Lucas and Cass had flown out to see her once or twice. She\u2019d been doing work co-ops in Europe, then New York City. If not for the occasional postcard, he\u2019d have had no contact at all.</p><p>During the first two years of college, she\u2019d sent him lots of letters. Not just emails. Handwritten letters on scented girly stationery, with clippings from her studies or the college paper to interest or amuse him. At the beginning, when she told him she was going to write him, he\u2019d told her he wasn\u2019t going to become her pen pal. She\u2019d fixated on him in high school, a crush he\u2019d always carefully managed with platonic affection. While she seemed to accept that, she sought his advice on a variety of things, often inappropriate. The guys had teased him about his wary navigation of those treacherous waters, but he\u2019d opened the letters, read each one, and even answered a few.</p><p>Yeah. He\u2019d become her regular damn pen pal.</p> <p>She was family, damn it. She was like having an annoying little sister, one he\u2019d taken under his wing. All the kids had needed some one-on-one in the male role-model department, given that Cassandra\u2019s father had bailed years before and Jeremy, the oldest son, had been a drug addict living on the street. When it was obvious Marcie was gravitating toward Ben, Lucas had trusted him to give her that big brotherly protection and guidance while he and the others focused on the rest of the family.</p><p>Honestly, she got under his skin. Her worries and fears, her successes and missteps. Used to being \u201csecond Mom\u201d when Cass was working her ass off to take care of all five of them, she was a serious kid, too locked down, one who\u2019d had too many responsibilities thrown on her too early. He knew enough about that to feel a kinship with her right off.</p><p>When her letters and phone calls slowed to a trickle in her junior year, he\u2019d received the infrequent postcards, sometimes a passed-on hello when she talked to Cass on the phone. It was all normal for a girl growing into a woman, of course. She shouldn\u2019t be spending all her time writing to a guy almost a decade older.</p><p>He admitted he missed those letters, the things she talked about with him, no matter how wildly unsuitable some of those past topics might have been. They\u2019d been friends\u2014in the ultra-cautious way that an older man and jailbait could be. He almost snorted at the thought. She wasn\u2019t jailbait now, but God above, he knew trouble when he saw it.</p><p>\u201cBaby intern?\u201d She\u2019d come to his door, was studying him. Jesus, her voice. How had she developed that sultry little purr to tag her syllables? She was...how old was she? Twenty-three. Barely. \u201cYou\u2019re still such an asshole. I\u2019m surprised Janet doesn\u2019t smack you down a couple times a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe leaves that to Alice. And Alice is out of town.\u201d Ben kept his gaze fastened on her. \u201cWhen\u2019d you get home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCouple weeks ago. Hi.\u201d Marcie\u2019s voice softened. There was a touch of shyness to her smile, something he remembered from her teens, but it was also openly glad to see him. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi yourself.\u201d He realized his voice had become husky, and he cleared it. \u201cWho are you again?\u201d</p><p>She crinkled her nose, stuck her tongue out at him. When she\u2019d done that as a teenager, he definitely hadn\u2019t reacted the way he did now. He watched that tongue go back between her full lips, touching them briefly, an involuntary gesture. Leaning in the doorway, she crossed her arms beneath her ripe breasts, hooking a delicate ankle around the other heel. \u201cCass told me you needed someone to fill in while Alice was island hopping, so I had her set it up with Matt as a surprise. I\u2019ve heard working for you is like working for Satan, and I figure that\u2019ll look good on a resume. Especially if you give me a glowing reference letter.\u201d</p><p>For some of the thoughts he was having, he was going to get up close and personal with Satan. He needed to stand up, go give her a friendly hug, stop acting like something else was happening in this room, in the way they couldn\u2019t seem to stop looking at one another. She was a kid. Like a little sister.</p><p>She was also apparently tired of waiting on him. Straightening, she moved across the carpet. The heels she wore were pencil thin, four inches and made her legs look ready to wrap around a man\u2019s hips. She still had those solemn, steady brown eyes. Her features had traces of the girl he remembered, but they\u2019d become more refined. Her makeup was applied with a light touch, because with those doe eyes and thick lashes, the cushion of her bottom lip frosted with a light gloss, she didn\u2019t need much. A few wisps of hair strayed over her brow and around her temples, increasing the focus on her face while emphasizing the delicacy of it.</p><p>He realized then why her movements had seemed familiar. They were like Cass\u2019. Lucas\u2019 wife was a top negotiator who could hit a guy broadside with understated female wiles and nerves of steel. She\u2019d move in for the kill so smoothly a man died with a smile on his lips. Her younger sister had obviously inherited some of that, but this was also Marcie, a separate and unique entity with mysteries of her own.</p><p>She had a gymnast\u2019s grace. In high school, she hadn\u2019t had the time to join teams or clubs, but she\u2019d pursued gymnastics on her own, used the school equipment to stay flexible and lean, and he knew she continued that in college. She\u2019d excelled at everything she attempted, studying business principles practically from the time she was in middle school. Majoring in business and minoring in pre-law, she was as brilliant and driven as her sister, who\u2019d been a child prodigy of Pickard Consulting, a negotiation and corporate investigations firm.</p><p>The slim choker she wore caught his attention. The pendant was a crystal disk with a tiny trio of blue flowers pressed under the glass. Forget-me-nots. Something about that niggled at his mind, but the fact there was a lock above the pendant, a small keyhole decorated with scrollwork, was even more distracting. It could be an affectation of course, not a true lock.</p> <p>She was coming around the desk, giving him a warm look. Since he hadn\u2019t moved, he saw a flash of uncertainty behind it, something hard to pin down, as if she wasn\u2019t sure a hug would be welcome. Get up, asshole. Say hello, be nice. What the hell\u2019s the matter with you?</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t he getting up? When he\u2019d been younger and more street raw, Matt\u2019s father and then Matt himself had hammered courtesy into him as a mandate, not just as a way to hustle marks. Like Matt\u2019s unbreakable rule about not cursing around women, that and the rest of it had become part of who Ben was somewhere along the way, the instinctive breeding of a Southern male rising above the circumstances of his birth.</p><p>But he was also a Dom with extreme preferences, whose radar was on full alert. Something was keeping him right where he was, studying her with firm, unsmiling lips and a calculated gaze he intended her to see.</p><p>It was a weighted moment, that indefinable quality teetering on a scale between them. When her gaze shifted to the floor between his knees, her lashes lowering, it hit him in the solar plexus. But then her smile became a wry twitch of her lips. Putting her hand on his shoulder, she gracefully squatted and picked up the pen by his polished shoe. Her fingers slid down over his biceps, an exploratory touch. When she placed her palm on the desk to lever herself back up, she caught the edge of his notepad, knocking it off as well.</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d With a glance at him beneath those long lashes, she knelt fully to reach farther under the desk. As she did, she reached over his polished shoe, stretching out to retrieve the pad. He got an eyeful of Marcie on her hands and knees before him, her ass turned up, her back that shallow valley that made him imagine caressing the sweet, naked line of it. Her skirt was pulled drum tight over those toned cheeks, the cleft nicely teased. His palm would make a firm smacking sound on it if he gave her a swat for dropping his papers.</p><p>What would it be like to cover her with his body, hold her there on her elbows as he ripped the fragile silk open, her breasts filling his hands so he could squeeze? She\u2019d gasp, rub her ass against his cock, wanting, begging...</p><p>Christ. Okay, if he invoked that name one more time, he was going to have to go to mass or confession, something he hadn\u2019t done well...ever. To be a lapsed Catholic, you had to be a practicing one first, right?</p><p>She\u2019d knocked that pad off deliberately, was doing this deliberately. He wrapped his mind around that as she straightened, turned in the span of his knees to put the note pad on his desk next to the pen. She took her time, straightening things, making sure they were exactly the way they\u2019d been before she\u2019d disrupted them. Kneeling there, her back to him, she had her hair in range of his fingertips. He could unclip that barrette, bury his fingers in those thick strands, pull her head back to set his teeth to her throat. She smelled the way a candy shop did, so many flavors to sample and explore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now she shifted back toward him, her hands settling on his thighs as if to push herself back to her feet. He was surprised the heat coming off him didn\u2019t burn her fair skin, even through his slacks. Her gaze traveled along his thighs, lingering over his groin, where it was starting to be very obvious he was responding to her. He stifled a growl. She was putting off every signal in the world, challenging him to take over. When she moistened her lips at the size of his reaction, her eyes widening slightly, he almost gave himself away by putting a death grip on the chair arms. Those sultry lashes lifted, her brown eyes meeting his.</p><p>\u201cSomething else I can do for you, Mr. O\u2019Callahan?\u201d</p><p>He saw it in her eyes. She wanted to go down on him, wanted to feel his hand fisted in her hair, driving her according to his will. Since she wanted it that bad, he wouldn\u2019t give it to her right away. He\u2019d make her get up, turn around so he could grasp her hips, work her against him in a lap dance then and there, make her show him how much her pretty ass hungered for his cock. And then he\u2019d blister it good, so that he\u2019d wring a few tears out of her before he fucked her right here on his desk.</p> <p>Holy fuck. She was teasing him the way a sub did, trying to goad a Dom into action. He had to be mistaken, but the set of her chin said she could get more determined about it, until she\u2019d be outright bratting, blatantly topping. What the hell was going on here?</p><p>He didn\u2019t know, but while one part of him was reeling, the part of him that was sure of this ground, as sure as breathing, steadied and locked like a collar clamping around a pale white throat. He knew this terrain, even if being on it with Marcie was unexpected.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d As she rose, he met her eyes squarely.</p><p>\u201cJust helping.\u201d She wasn\u2019t up to that direct stare. But that only made it worse, because what she did wasn\u2019t calculated. She responded the way a natural submissive did when a Dom finally got his shit together and took the reins. She looked down. Back at his desk, straightening the contract unnecessarily, shifting his coffee farther out of the way. Then she stepped back, and she was smiling again, though it was a little forced. As she put that distance between them, she shrugged, tossed back her hair.</p><p>He\u2019d seen that look before, usually when she\u2019d been figuring her way through the difficulties that had been their home life until Lucas and Cass had gotten together and moved things in a better direction, with the K&amp;A men becoming their extended family to help out.</p> <p>\u201cHey, why don\u2019t you let me take you to dinner tonight?\u201d She held that smile, probably trying to pretend that whatever she\u2019d been trying to pull hadn\u2019t taken an unexpected turn for her as well. Her cheeks had a light flush. \u201cYou can bring me up to speed on the things you need me to do, and I can tell you all about my co-ops in the Big Apple and Europe. Don\u2019t say no, because I\u2019ve never paid you back for that trouble you bailed me out of in college. It can be an adult thank-you for helping me out when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a kid.\u201d</p><p>That smile disappeared. He was getting an overwhelming compulsion to lick at that frosted color, see if it tasted sweet. As her brown eyes became more thoughtful, she leaned in, reaching out to touch his face. He caught her wrist, holding her there.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. Her fingers closed, touching his knuckles in a light caress. \u201cI\u2019m not a kid anymore, Ben. Will you let me take you to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo catch up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he decided. She reacted with a brief flash of hurt, which quickly disappeared behind an unfathomable expression. He needed to make this right, put it on the proper footing. She was still Marcie. He needed to talk to her about this kind of behavior. If she used it on the wrong guy...well, it wouldn\u2019t be good for a lawyer to have a murder rap hanging over his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you to dinner. Old family friends don\u2019t pick up the tab.\u201d He managed a charming smile he hoped didn\u2019t look like a big bad wolf salivating. \u201cPretty girls especially don\u2019t have to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with money.\u201d She slipped his hold with a devilish grin and a little sass to her walk as she headed back to the door, contract in hand. It was as if that hurt look had never existed, but he knew better. Whatever Marcie had been trying to do, she wasn\u2019t the duplicitous kind when it came to emotions. \u201cI better get back to work,\u201d she added, throwing him a look, the blonde hair spilling over her shoulder. \u201cMy boss might paddle my ass if I don\u2019t get this contract over to Senecorp this morning. At least a girl can dream he might. Oh and Matt said he wanted to meet with you about fifteen minutes before Johnson arrives. I\u2019ve pulled the file and the notes you\u2019ll need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie\u2014\u201d He was going to give her a piece of his mind and then some, but of course Peter buzzed him. By the time he\u2019d glanced toward the phone and debated whether to answer, she\u2019d grabbed up some other folders on the desk and was gone, moving with breezy energy on those thin heels.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d been so outmaneuvered, taken by surprise, flat out punched in the gut. By a freaking kid, a twenty-three-year-old baby. He had about a hundred things to wrap his mind around from that little interchange, but there was one thing his aching hard-on was telling him, loud and clear.</p><p>That\u2019s no baby, buddy. She\u2019s a freaking natural submissive, hungering for a Master.</p><p>What the hell had happened to Marcie? Did she know she\u2019d just thrown down a gauntlet to an experienced Dom, daring him to pick it up?</p> <p>He was afraid she sure as hell did.</p><p>I\u2019m really glad to be here, very grateful, but sometimes\u2014don\u2019t tell Cass and Lucas\u2014I feel so isolated. A lot of these kids came straight from high school, from lives where they didn\u2019t have a lot of responsibility. They talk about being on the basketball team, in clubs, with loads of friends they miss, because they hung out together so much. I miss my siblings. It\u2019s crazy. I miss taking care of them, feeling like they\u2019re counting on me to look after them, even though I remember days when I had to step outside the kitchen and scream, pull at my hair, because it became too much. Sometimes I think I should have gone to a community college with single moms, or adult students, where the intention is to learn, not to party or be on my own for the first time. I don\u2019t really know what this kind of freedom is supposed to feel like, Ben. If it\u2019s supposed to feel good or bad. Or how to even handle it.</p><p>Letter from Marcie to Ben, freshman year</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Marcie bolted for the fire stairwell, avoiding the elevator. Once she was three floors down, she stopped in the echoing stillness of concrete and metal. Leaning against the rail, she put her hand on her stomach, calming the butterflies. She\u2019d done it. She\u2019d fired the first shot, and she was pretty sure she\u2019d scored a direct hit. Oh God, she was so over her head.</p><p>That was the only toe-to-toe volley she\u2019d get, she knew it. She had to come at him from a more unexpected angle next time, keep him off balance. Once Ben O\u2019Callahan rallied, he\u2019d either rebuff her like an impenetrable fortress or... Her cheeks heated at that loaded or.</p><p>Don\u2019t tease the wild animal. Isn\u2019t that what they posted at the zoos? Kneeling between his thighs, she\u2019d seen up close what she was poking with a stick, had felt the heat coming off him. She\u2019d heard the rumors about his size, but if that was a partial erection, there were monsters in Japan who would run screaming.</p><p>It gave her a half chuckle, which helped calm her down some. Age wasn\u2019t a factor in negotiation, unless you used it to your advantage. Cass had told her that. It was all about confidence, will, commitment, being prepared. More prepared than anyone else, one step ahead.</p><p>Only that was the irony. She didn\u2019t want to be one step ahead. Her goal was to be a step behind. Following a Master, following his lead, serving his desires, no matter how extreme they were. Following Ben.</p><p>So while she was experiencing a somewhat hysterical form of exultation at what she\u2019d just accomplished, making him see her as a submissive, even if only for a second, she also had a wrong sort of coil in her belly. She was approaching the problem from the only direction that would work right now, but it didn\u2019t mesh with who she really was or wanted to be. This was a means to an end, that was all.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t deny the forces at work seemed to know what they were doing. Right before she\u2019d stepped into his office, she hadn\u2019t been sure what the hell she was going to do, but when she saw him, something else had taken over, guiding her into that crazy maneuver with the pen and pad.</p><p>A girl\u2019s gotta do what a girl\u2019s gotta do, as the song said. Before she could serve him, she had to push him past any reservations about wanting her. The whole \u201ckid\u201d thing. Touching the pendant at her throat, her fingers glided over the words engraved on the flat back. She knew what she knew. She wouldn\u2019t start doubting herself now, no matter how scared she was of opening a tiger\u2019s cage and stepping back to see what would happen. She could handle herself. She would. The stakes were too important.</p><p>Ben sat back in his chair, the contract forgotten, his coffee cooling. That trouble in college... Well, he\u2019d been kind of obligated to help, hadn\u2019t he? Since he was the reason she\u2019d needed bail.</p><p>Under her serious nature, he\u2019d glimpsed something struggling to get out. A fresh wildness, the reckless innocence of youth she\u2019d never been able to indulge. He remembered one of her freshman letters, talking about how out of sync she felt with the other students. He told himself he remembered it nearly word for word because he had a damn near photographic memory. Not because he\u2019d read it a little too often, feeling an uncomfortable connection to what he\u2019d experienced in college.</p><p>He\u2019d called her, because her loneliness had been too much for him to address through the written word. He didn\u2019t remember half of what he\u2019d said, but he\u2019d stayed on the phone for an hour and a half with her, until he had her giggling uncontrollably and calling him names. He\u2019d told her to loosen up, stop worrying about everything. Do something unexpected, stretch her wings and relax her inhibitions. Get in trouble occasionally, for Chrissakes. Not real trouble, okay, but you know. \u201cStay out overnight, get a little tipsy on Budweiser, kiss a boy you don\u2019t know very well who has a cute butt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBen!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d laughed at her embarrassed outrage, but then he\u2019d sobered, fingers tightening on the phone. If he was there, he would have hugged her. It bugged him to know she was hurting. \u201cLearn how to have fun, Ella-Marcella.\u201d Marcella was her full name, and he\u2019d made up the pet name for her because it annoyed her. \u201cI know you\u2019ll ace the studies. You\u2019re too responsible to do otherwise. But Jesus, cut loose and be a kid. See how it feels. You may like it so much you\u2019ll decide never to grow up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCute. I have a life, so I\u2019m getting off the phone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just have a date with some woman with big boobs and no brains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they have the big boobs, the brain\u2019s not really necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexist pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d But before he hung up, he added, \u201cGo. Have. Fun. Don\u2019t worry. If you end up in jail, I\u2019ll bail you out. And don\u2019t do the Budweiser thing around boys. Only girls.\u201d</p> <p>So maybe he felt a little responsible about the actual need for bail. One night, late, she and six other kids decided to jump in the beat-up Toyota she\u2019d bought with her own money. All packed in with snacks and pillows, they\u2019d driven overnight to Mammoth Cave in Kentucky. They were near their destination, close to dawn, when her passengers decided to moon a passing motorist just for the hell of it. Unfortunately, it was an unmarked police car, and one of her passengers was carrying a bag of weed, something Marcie hadn\u2019t known until it dropped out of the kid\u2019s pocket when he stumbled out of the car.</p><p>Ben got the call in a morning meeting, Alice breaking in with the pointed look that said You need to take this. He\u2019d talked to a tearful, apologetic Marcie, but what he most remembered was her pulling it together, enough that he heard her audible swallow on the phone, the sudden attack of dignity as she stated, as solemnly as a defense attorney nailing the key point, \u201cYou said if I got into trouble, you\u2019d bail me out. Right?\u201d</p><p>Telling Matt he had something personal to handle, he took the private jet to Kentucky. He worked it out, getting them released without anything going on their records. Fortunately, the sheriff was a decent sort who could tell Marcie was a straight-arrow kid and no one had any other priors. Marcie didn\u2019t make Ben cover for her for long; she told him she would tell Lucas and Cass about it, and she did, a couple weeks later. Her main concern was making it go away before Cass had to worry about it, because her older sister had spent so much of her life protecting them. Marcie couldn\u2019t bear to give her another moment of worry on her behalf.</p><p>On the drive back to the school, where he took the wheel of her Toyota, and the other kids followed in a chauffeured van, she\u2019d freaked out to the nth degree, resolving never again to leave the campus grounds until graduation. He\u2019d been able to convince her she shouldn\u2019t stop being adventurous and going after things she wanted just because she got set back on her heels now and then. Life was about the experience, not just the nose to the grindstone.</p><p>Why did he have a feeling he was about to pay dearly for that advice?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to that guy?\u201d Ben poured Marcie a second glass of her preferred after-dinner white zinfandel as she finished chuckling over the recap of her Kentucky mishap. He\u2019d chosen one of his favorite casual caf\u00e9s, with a table outdoors so she could enjoy the New Orleans\u2019 nightlife.</p> <p>\u201cAllan milked the whole anti-establishment pothead image as a freshman, but he was too smart to stick with it for long. He was a chemistry genius, so he\u2019s working for one of the major pharmaceutical companies now. He\u2019ll probably discover the cure for cancer. Thank God he cut those gross dreadlocks. He was actually a decent-looking guy without them, a real Michael Bolton makeover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want dessert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever known me not to want dessert? I\u2019d have started with it, but I\u2019m convincing you I\u2019m a grown-up. Then I\u2019ll be the oldest one at the table, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, keep it up, wiseass.\u201d He passed her the dessert menu so she could consider her choices for later. As he watched her eyes flicker over the selection, her teeth worried her bottom lip in an altogether distracting manner.</p><p>He\u2019d kept their conversation to her school years, the work education co-ops in Europe and New York, because it helped him remember who she was, who she was supposed to be to him. A little smile played around her lips now and then, a knowing look as if she was wise to the ploy, but he found himself absorbed by her experiences with corporate offices in Paris, Milan and Stuttgart, the differences in legal practices, as well as the sights she\u2019d indulged. She\u2019d always been detail oriented, and she recalled everything with ease, answering his questions and frankly impressing the hell out of him.</p><p>\u201cYou were smart, integrating the co-ops into your studies. I knew you were impatient about it putting your graduation a year later than your classmates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you all didn\u2019t have to go to one of those mind-numbing graduation ceremonies. They mailed me my diploma. But I admit, when you said it would give my resume that extra polish, it did.\u201d She gave him an eye roll and a smirk. \u201cI\u2019ve already been invited back to two of the European firms and the New York one wanted to hire me then and there.\u201d</p><p>He licked his finger, touched her with the sizzling noise of hot stuff, and she laughed. \u201cYeah, yeah, go ahead and be smug. It gave me valuable work experience as a corporate investigator, which is the field I intend to pursue. Steve Pickard\u2019s already given me a couple projects to do while I\u2019m home. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust so they don\u2019t interfere with the vital tasks of collating, copying and organizing paper clips for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell Alice and Janet you mocked what they do. They\u2019ll load your stapler with C-4 and wait for the boom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t need any help creatively planning my demise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d She grinned at him, then gave him a mock scowl. \u201cYou didn\u2019t warn me what the absolute best experience in Europe would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll-night orgies with rugby teams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but that was a close second. Oh my God, the food. If you ate everything you wanted you\u2019d exceed the weight limit for the plane trip back. I thought of you so often, because you\u2019re such an amazing cook. You really need to go to Italy sometime and do one of their week intensives on Italian cooking. You\u2019d love it. Do you still bring something for the monthly family dinner at our house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, sat back. \u201cWhatever you brought was always our favorite. Well, not Nate\u2019s, but that was because he had a serious hot dog and macaroni fetish going then, but those orgasmic desserts, or the bread... I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever tasted bread as good as what you bake, not even in Paris. If you ever decide not to be a lawyer, I think you should open a bakery.\u201d Her gaze went back to the menu, then up. \u201cWill you choose for me, like you did dinner? I trust your instincts.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d implied it was his culinary expertise, but if he was the suspicious sort, and of course he was, she\u2019d maneuvered him into taking control of the meal, deciding what she would and wouldn\u2019t eat. The way a full-time Master might.</p><p>The candlelight on the table flickered, catching her eyes, the gleam of her freshened lipstick. Glinted off that pendant. Reaching out, he touched the disk. His fingers were large, couldn\u2019t help whispering over her throat, just a brief touch, but he saw her register it, her fingers tightening on the stem of her wineglass. His own skin tingled with heat. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave it to me. The forget-me-nots?\u201d At his puzzled expression, she prodded his memory further. \u201cMy senior prom, the night my date stood me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. I remember. What happened to that clueless loser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, but I\u2019ve often hoped it involved several flights of stairs and a year in traction. I was mortified that Cass told you about it. The other guys were okay, but it embarrassed me that you knew.\u201d</p><p>He decided not to touch the why of that, because it was too uncomfortably obvious. Marcie was continuing anyway, relieving him of the need to do so. \u201cI was crying on the back-porch swing. You came out with a corsage of fresh forget-me-nots and roses, and a handkerchief. You told me any guy worth my time would always come to me with flowers and a handkerchief. One to make me smile, and the other to dry my tears, because a smart guy knows women need to cry as much as they need to laugh. It was good advice on judging which guys were worth my time.\u201d</p><p>She touched the disk. \u201cSo I pressed three of the forget-me-nots, and a friend who likes making jewelry designed the collar and pendant.\u201d</p><p>He paused in lifting his whiskey. Before he could respond to that startling statement, the waiter was there, asking for their order. \u201cWe need a few more minutes,\u201d he said brusquely. When the waiter nodded, retreated, Ben leaned forward. \u201cMarcie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sat on the swing with me, kept me distracted.\u201d She was lost in the memory, tracing the edge of the wineglass. \u201cEveryone else decorated the front yard with lights, turned on music. Any of the neighbors who wanted to relive their prom day were invited. There was food, dancing. It became a party. You and I danced. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>They were near Frenchmen Street, which meant there was always music in the air. He\u2019d chosen a restaurant across the street from a hole-in-the-wall club renowned for local-band favorites. As a result they\u2019d enjoyed the music while eating, but it hadn\u2019t been so loud they couldn\u2019t talk. Now she tilted her head, drawing his attention to the bluesy jazz piece playing. Giving him an infectious smile, she rose from the chair, tugged on his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s dance now. Just one song. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m back in New Orleans. I\u2019ve missed it so much here.\u201d</p><p>He closed his fingers on hers, holding her in place. \u201cMarcie.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against his grip, trusting him not to let go as she swayed back and forth. \u201cAre you worried about what people will think, us dancing on the sidewalk? Have you forgotten how to cut loose and have fun, Ben?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed, tossed down the napkin. Their outdoor seating was cordoned off with a painted iron fence hung with bright beads and fresh potted flowers. He delighted her by putting his hip on it, swinging over, and in the same motion, curled a strong arm around her waist and brought her over as well. He rolled her into an easy Cajun two-step, twirling her out and under his smoothly moving hands, taking her around his body.</p><p>She laughed out loud as he caught her hips, kept her in place as he stayed behind her, doing the footwork in tandem and out to the side, then bringing her back for the turns and the two-step basic again. It didn\u2019t take much to get people in New Orleans to dance, so several couples joined them almost immediately.</p><p>Marcie reveled in the feel of his hands on her. She knew the steps, but not as well as he did, so she followed his lead. He more than met the challenge, directing her without hurry or hesitation, comfortable in that role as he always seemed to be. To the outside viewer, he was just a capable dancer, but anyone who had the craving in her blood as she did would see it, feel it.</p><p>She knew he\u2019d picked up on her ploy, having him order the meal for them both, but he had no idea what it did to her, watching him assume command of a situation where her only preference was to trust his direction. And now, how he took control of her movements so easily...she was content to stay in this moment forever.</p><p>This man was meant to control and lead a woman in ways that would overwhelm her with pleasure, open the deepest wells of her heart, the places she was afraid to surrender. She\u2019d put the white flag in his hands, happy to have him tie it around her wrists, binding him to her.</p><p>They did two songs, going from the Cajun two-step into the faster jig, improvising some freestyle steps that had them both laughing. It brought her heart in her throat. Ben hadn\u2019t laughed during dinner, not once. Cass had mentioned he\u2019d gotten more serious these past couple years. Marcie had seen it when she first stepped into his office, in his green eyes, the tighter set of his mouth. He\u2019d always been the jokester of the group. But even then she\u2019d known what they saw now, that sometimes it was more habit than true levity. Whatever demons plagued him, she hoped she was helping to push them away. She wanted to do it forever.</p><p>On those turns and brushes, she took full advantage, making sure his grasp fell lower on her hips than he intended. She worked herself in closer to his body, pressing full against it before she stepped back for the next turn. He was solid and strong, so sure on his feet, his large hands bringing heat and pleasure even in a casual touch. She was glad for the nature of dance itself, the way it let worries be set aside for a little while, allowing what both dancers wanted to come to the surface.</p><p>The band took a break, the club switching to a DJ. Recognizing the Jennifer Paige song Crush, she bit back a snort. Perfect timing.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. Ben was a smart guy. Her feelings at sixteen wouldn\u2019t have evolved and persevered this many years unless they were something else. The song actually illustrated the point, the lyrics suggesting the singer knew it was far more than a crush, that she was just trying to fool herself. Ben was probably doing the same, maybe even trying to convince himself he was the one suffering a crush now. She would love knowing that, that she was starting to be an inseparable part of his thoughts, the way he\u2019d been of hers for so long.</p><p>Those two years of travel and staying away from home had been hell. But Cass always said you couldn\u2019t enter into a challenging negotiation without believing a hundred percent in what you wanted. Marcie had needed to prove it to herself before she could prove it to Ben. And she had, in spades. Nearly seven years, and she\u2019d never wanted anyone else to touch her. Every time a boy had, something inside her turned off, and she could only imagine Ben. She\u2019d made herself do those dates, though. While she tried to avoid the emotional entanglements that might hurt the male in question, she needed a certain level of experience to achieve her goal. Those dates had been a testing ground for this, a game with very real stakes.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember our slow dance, at my home prom?\u201d He was still wearing his suit jacket, additional armor against her, she was sure. Rather than putting her hands on his shoulders, she slid her hands inside his coat, along the firm, heated skin over his ribs, separated from her touch only by his thin dress shirt. He stilled, but she stepped closer. He gripped her upper arms, but she kept coming, until her palms were against his back, fingers stroking his shoulder blades, the male muscle beneath the shirt. Ben was over six feet, so it was easy to lay her cheek on his chest, just under his jaw.</p><p>He still had his hands on her arms, but as she sighed, let her body melt into his, he muttered an oath against her hair. She closed her eyes, triumph sweeping through her as he slid his arms around her. One at her waist, his palm against her hip, the other staying at her face, cradling it where it lay against him. He slid his thumb along her throat, touching that collar, his fingers playing in her hair. They swayed together to Jennifer\u2019s song, Ben\u2019s sure footwork keeping them moving in a slow glide.</p><p>\u201cI put my hands under your coat, just like this. The other guys were grinning at you, knowing you were trying to figure out a way to push me away a little bit without hurting my feelings. You knew I was too old for you to dance with me like a little girl, too young for us to dance that close. Isn\u2019t that odd, how that change happens?\u201d</p><p>When she lifted her head, Ben still had his hand on the side of her face, his gaze intent upon her. His grip on her tightened, and she knew from his expression he was done letting her dodge and retreat. His mouth had that firm set, his eyes pinning her in place. But she still had a couple key seconds, and she wasn\u2019t going to lose them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d started to get hard when you pushed me away. You covered it in your usual smooth way, but I remember it.\u201d Had dreamed about it.</p><p>Particularly when she brought herself to climax in her dorm room at night. She\u2019d lean back from her laptop, think of Ben. She\u2019d imagine him coming up behind her, his fingers sliding around her throat, tipping her head back against his abdomen. He\u2019d whisper to her, tell her to spread her legs. He\u2019d command her to put her fingers down her panties, and then watch her get so aroused she was begging him. Begging for permission to come.</p><p>She\u2019d had submissive cravings for a long time, but it wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d read between the lines, picked up on what she\u2019d overheard and seen between Lucas and Cass and the others, that she\u2019d understood what she was. Why her sexual desires were different from the vanilla sex fantasies of a high school or college girl. Her dreams had to do with her being on her knees, being spanked, restrained. Tortured and tested. By him.</p><p>She wanted to say all of that, wanted to be that brave, but something about his look now, the tightening of his fingers on her face, kept her silent.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking for trouble, little girl.\u201d The hard tone was different. It wasn\u2019t the Ben he\u2019d always been with her, and though she knew he was trying to warn her off, it speared need and hope through her vitals. This was the predator she wanted. Hell, she\u2019d bathe in raw meat if that was what she had to do. It gave her the courage to answer him.</p><p>\u201cI surely hope so. I don\u2019t think I could be any plainer about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie, cut it out now, or your internship is over. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the internship. We\u2019re close to Club Progeny. Just a cab ride away. Why don\u2019t you take me there, do everything you want to do to me, that I can feel you wanting? I\u2019ve been to clubs, I\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop.\u201d The word was a knife, cutting her off. Taking her arm, Ben led her back to her chair, this time going through an opening in the iron fence that required them to wind past the other closely placed tables. He motioned to the waiter as he held her chair, pressed her back down into it, his fingers gripping her nape in a way that made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cA chocolate torte to go, and the check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>He sat back down. Before, with the bistro table being so small, and the other tables so close, his knee had ranged alongside her crossed legs, his other foot placed beside hers. Now he set the chair back toward the rail, putting a more circumspect distance between them. She was losing ground fast, but she\u2019d made enough progress this battle wasn\u2019t a complete loss. Picking up her wine, she took a bracing swallow, regarded him. She\u2019d been on the debate team in college, she knew how to hold her own. That is, if she imagined him as anyone other than Ben, who was looking as if he could eat her in three sharp bites.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in over your head, and you need to quit this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that, take me to the club and show me what it\u2019s really like. I think what you\u2019re really worried about is that I won\u2019t scare. How would you punish me? Spank me? Tie me up. Fuck\u2014\u201d</p><p>In a snap of motion, his hand closed over hers, forcing the wineglass back to the table. He caught her chin, leaning forward so she was staring into brilliant green eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the key to this?\u201d</p><p>Since her senses were reeling from his proximity, it took a moment to realize he was asking about the collar.</p><p>She could go with the coy, smart-ass answer, like \u201cWhere do you want it to be?\u201d or \u201cWhy don\u2019t you search me to find it?\u201d, but while she knew what she was, it was more fantasy than experience. She\u2019d never had it tested under the searing regard of a fully unleashed Master. This wasn\u2019t a practicing Dom with protocols and reasonable discussions of limits. Ben was an actual, in-his-blood Master, who demanded only one response from a submissive. The unembellished truth, delivered promptly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... The key\u2019s attached to my navel jewelry.\u201d</p><p>His gaze still locked on hers, he dropped a hand to pull the blouse free of her skirt. When he found the tiny key, his attention dropped to examine the connection. She bit her lip at the pressure on the catch bead, a jeweled flower that provided the fastener to hold the key there. His touch passed over her navel, and she couldn\u2019t help it, a small noise came from her throat, her thighs tightening at the moisture that came from her sex. His eyes flickered up to her face. \u201cPart your legs,\u201d he said in that same hard tone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She obeyed, but as she did, everything quivered. Her nipples were stabbing against her bra, and her palms were damp.</p><p>He unhooked the key, smoothed her blouse back down over the area. \u201cLift your chin.\u201d</p><p>As she did, he fitted the key to the lock. The collar loosened, came away in his hands. He laid it on the table between them. Her neck felt too bare, too light without it. Once she\u2019d made her decision about Ben, she\u2019d put it on, resolved not to take it off, and she\u2019d been wearing it over a year. His gaze lingered on her neck, then lifted to hers. \u201cLook down at the table, and don\u2019t look up unless I give you permission.\u201d</p><p>She was going to hyperventilate. Everything was tightening up inside. Her skin was cold and hot at once, and that trembling continued. It was as if she had the flu. Was he having the waiter box up the dessert to take her to the club? Was he going to agree to her desires? Was she ready for that?</p><p>\u201cA slave doesn\u2019t collar herself,\u201d he said, his voice low. Uncompromising. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever set foot in a club, that won\u2019t happen again. That\u2019s not your world. You defy me on this, I won\u2019t hesitate to take it to Cass and Lucas.\u201d</p><p>He was chastising her like a child, but his orders, his touch, had been that of a Master taking sexual control. Another emotion swept through her now.</p><p>Anger.</p><p>She lifted her gaze, locked with his. Before she could respond, the waiter came back, carrying a to-go box. Ben rose, lifting his hand for one of the slow-cruising cabs patrolling for evening patrons. The waiter handed her the dessert box when Ben brusquely gestured for him to do so, then the man wisely retreated. They were too crowded in the dining area for her to try digging in her heels, so she set her chin, allowed herself to be guided back to her feet and out of that area to the waiting cab.</p><p>However, once there, she stopped and faced him, extricating her elbow from his grasp. He\u2019d pocketed the choker, and she wouldn\u2019t wrest it from him, no matter how much it meant to her. If he was right, and she knew he was, it was his to put back on her. She wondered if he\u2019d read the inscription on the back of the pendant. If he did, would it have the same meaning for him it had for her?</p><p>Giving her a hard look, Ben spoke to the cab driver, telling him Cass\u2019 address and handing him enough to cover fare and tip. He opened the door for her. \u201cGet in. You\u2019re going home.\u201d</p><p>She set her chin. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-three. I\u2019m no longer a child, Ben. Cass and Lucas don\u2019t have any say in my decisions about this.\u201d She drew a breath. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to be my Master, you don\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>The anger was strong enough she was tempted to tell the driver to take her to Progeny instead, right in front of him. But she wasn\u2019t going to go without him, and she couldn\u2019t bluff a man like Ben. She had to be willing to do everything she said she was going to do.</p><p>She got into the car with quiet dignity, though she was vibrating with emotion. As he closed it, he stepped back without saying anything more. He\u2019d reverted to that unsmiling expression, his eyes so calculating, seeing so much. She wondered if he was going to end her internship, try to block her from seeing him again. But that was what could happen tomorrow.</p><p>While she hadn\u2019t been completely prepared for the emotional impact of his rejection, she had anticipated something like it happening. There were always snags in a negotiation, setbacks. The key was a backup plan, and she had one. When she\u2019d come up with it, she\u2019d wondered if she\u2019d have the bravery to pull it off. Now, galvanized not only by his stubbornness and anger, but those moments she\u2019d seen and felt something entirely different from him, she had the courage to use a battering ram if necessary.</p><p>As the cab moved away, leaving him behind, it gave her the space to take some deep breaths, marshal her thoughts. It was time to stop reminding him of the child she\u2019d been and hit him full force with the woman she was.</p><p>Ben brought the choker back out. It was still warm from her skin. Staring at the forget-me-nots pressed under the glass, he knew he needed to go to Progeny himself. He\u2019d find a submissive, fuck her brains out, work her over hard. He\u2019d pay a staff member to do the aftercare so he could walk away. Finish out the night at his favorite bar filled with questionable characters and the odor of stale beer. He might get a drink, or two or three. The Irishman\u2019s crutch. He knew the dangers. Which was why he\u2019d probably go straight to the bar.</p><p>Progeny wasn\u2019t where he wanted to be. Doing a scene with a submissive required precision, control, artistry. A mutual exchange of pleasure. What he needed was a down and dirty whore, one who\u2019d blow him off, let him fuck her in the ass with enthusiasm, and then leave him with a knowing half-smile and a pocketful of his money.</p><p>In the past when this mood took him, he\u2019d go find one of the guys, hang out at a sports bar or one of the classy burlesque clubs, eye naked females, and it would be okay after a while. When Peter had been single, they\u2019d often trawl the streets together until dawn. It was why they\u2019d called the ex-National Guard captain Nightcrawler. Ben had even given him an original signed cover of the famous comic book character for his birthday. It was framed on the wall of Peter\u2019s office.</p><p>But things were different now. Savannah was seven months pregnant. Matt wasn\u2019t going out in the evenings right now, because her pregnancy hadn\u2019t been an easy one and she was on bedrest until the baby came. Lucas and Cass still had three of her siblings at home, Cherry, Talia and Nate. He could call Peter and Dana, or Jon and Rachel, but it felt wrong. It all felt wrong.</p><p>He\u2019d told her she was asking for trouble, and she\u2019d parried with that half-smile, the taunt in her gaze. But she hadn\u2019t been making light of the threat it was, and that made it worse. If she would act like a clueless kid, reckless and na\u00efve, he could brush it off easier. But the knowledge was in her eyes.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t experienced; if she\u2019d been to a club, he\u2019d bet money she\u2019d only watched, not participated or given herself to a Master. Something ugly tightened in his chest at the thought of her being anywhere near a Dom in that setting. He pushed past that. No, she wasn\u2019t experienced, but she understood. She knew what she was, what he was. She was daring him to let it loose, wanting to see if she could handle what he\u2019d dish out.</p><p>He thought about calling Lucas, sounding him out on it, then played out how that conversation would go. \u201cHey, just wondering. Did you know your wife\u2019s little sister is a submissive, and oh, by the way, have you been taking her to clubs to have her ass smacked by random Doms?\u201d</p> <p>Oh yeah. That would go over well. Luc would say, \u201cStay right there, Ben. I\u2019ll be by directly with a baseball bat to beat your fucking brains into the sidewalk.\u201d</p><p>He returned to the table, paid the check. He had some work he could handle at the office, but he wasn\u2019t in the mood to go back and do that either. Jesus, she\u2019d be there tomorrow. Alice was gone for two weeks. It was too much to hope he\u2019d taken care of the problem tonight, spooked her. He\u2019d read the stubborn jut of that chin when she got in the cab. She\u2019d been one breath short of telling the driver to ignore his directions and take her to Progeny. If she\u2019d done it, he would have yanked her out of the cab and blistered her ass right there up against it until she was moaning...</p><p>Holy fuck. He\u2019d walked down the street several blocks, and now he decided to sit down on a bench. Seedier elements who kept an eye out for the solitary pedestrian traffic gave him considering looks and he met their gazes square on. Yeah, you want to be fucked up, you give it your best shot.</p><p>There were some working girls, and he motioned to one of them. When she approached, he shook his head before she could start her spiel. Instead, he nodded to the cigarettes in her purse. \u201cA fifty for one of those and a light, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a fifty, I\u2019ll give you two, sugar.\u201d When he handed over the cash, she proffered the two cigarettes. He cupped his hands over hers to protect the flame as she used her lighter. She had wicked long nails, scarlet with some flashy stuff on it. Nodding, he sat back, and she trawled back to her friends, recognizing a man who wanted to be alone. Good whore. On another night, he might have taken a second look. Yeah right. He hadn\u2019t tapped that risky kind of pussy since he was a dumb-ass teenager.</p><p>Drawing deep, he closed his eyes and laid his head back against the wall of the old brick building behind the bench.</p><p>Marcie lost her virginity at nineteen. Christ on a cupcake, she\u2019d called him to talk about it. He\u2019d given up lecturing her on what was appropriate to discuss with him. The last time he\u2019d tried, she\u2019d teased him, told him he was her best girlfriend, earning a snort. Then she\u2019d become more serious.</p><p>You listen. You always give me the right kind of advice, and you know when not to give me any at all. You\u2019re my friend, Ben.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know him or what he was. He and that whore had way more in common. It was showing in the smoking, in the proliferation of f-words in his vocabulary lately. His increasing apathy about all of it.</p><p>Marcie had sex at nineteen. By the time he was nineteen, he hadn\u2019t been a virgin for years. Those experiences weren\u2019t innocent gropings in the back of a Mustang. They were the type of memories best left buried like the rotting corpses they were.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to dwell in those dark spaces, so he thought back to that phone call. In truth, he\u2019d been surprised she\u2019d waited that late, given that most teens these days lost their virginity in high school. She\u2019d stumbled around a bit, but she\u2019d wanted to talk about it. The guy had been an okay sort who\u2019d done a decent job, not completely screwed up. She didn\u2019t say so baldly, but he could tell she hadn\u2019t had an orgasm, not unusual for a girl\u2019s first time, but she\u2019d felt those stirrings that suggested it could go that way sometime down the road. He\u2019d confirmed her experience was normal. Without endorsing her going out on a Debbie-Does-Dallas pilgrimage to find the ultimate orgasm, he\u2019d told her it would get better.</p><p>He\u2019d cautioned her to be careful, told her what to watch out for. She\u2019d gotten a little teary. After he made sure the tears were just typical female catharsis over an important turning point, and not because Bill What\u2019s-His-Name needed to have his dick twisted off, he\u2019d reassured her they were normal too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not too long after that, the letters and calls stopped coming so regularly. Cass had said she didn\u2019t have a steady boyfriend, so Bill hadn\u2019t lasted. However, dinner tonight clearly suggested she\u2019d figured a lot of things out, and not just about sex.</p><p>Was the brat smart enough to realize the importance of that break in contact with him, setting a clear demarcation line between the relationship that had existed between man and teenager then, and man and woman now? Plotting it out so she could show up in his life as a sexy, grown-up young woman, homing in on him like a sleek barracuda? That kind of calculation was a bit scary, but she\u2019d always been precocious.</p><p>She had self-confidence, determination, and the Dom in him who recognized it, recognized what she was, hungered for it. He wanted to hurt her, give her pain, and she acted like she\u2019d welcome it. She was off limits, but a big portion of him\u2014entendre intended\u2014was just not giving a rat\u2019s ass. The combination of innocence and sexual drive made her damn near irresistible.</p><p>So if that was all there was to it, why wasn\u2019t he going to a club to blow off steam? Or calling up his preferred reputable escort service to take care of his more functional and dangerous cravings?</p><p>Because she was in his head. Hell, her scent was still on his clothes, where she\u2019d rubbed up against him during the dancing. He\u2019d smiled at her during the Cajun two-step, and kept smiling. It was hard not to appreciate her, especially when she was utterly serious and yet had that dancing light in her eyes.</p><p>It had reminded him of something he couldn\u2019t deny. While he may have helped the teenage Marcie let loose and laugh again, her dry wit and self-deprecation, unexpected for her years, coupled with the occasional dose of teenage omniscience on every subject, had kept him grinning and impressed back then. Plus, as the others had found their \u201cone\u201d and gotten married, affecting him in ways he hadn\u2019t expected, she\u2019d seemed to understand when it was getting to him. She\u2019d loosened up things inside him about that.</p><p>That was the problem, wasn\u2019t it? His relationships with women were about the physical, and the pure psychology of D/s. Marcie had an emotional connection to him he couldn\u2019t deny, something no other woman\u2014other than the K&amp;A wives who had more clear boundaries\u2014had with him.</p><p>He imagined her eating that dessert at home, alone, the chocolate melting in her mouth. The tines of the fork imprinting on her lips, her moist tongue coming out to catch a bit of sweet. He could see her brown eyes, thinking over the evening, analyzing, planning her next attack. Hell, Marcie had started studying for her SATs when she was eleven. Superhuman focus and drive was a family trait. Except in her older brother Jeremy, unless you counted a superhuman determination to self-destruct.</p><p>He drew on the cigarette again, a shadow passing through his mind at the thought. It had been awhile since he\u2019d asked Lucas how that was going. For the past few years, Cass went to Thailand monthly to visit Jeremy. She took one of the kids with her each time. Sometimes Lucas went. Through him, Ben knew Marcie had made the trip a few times as well. But the last report Lucas had given the group said Jeremy\u2019s time was running out.</p><p>Of course, if Jon hadn\u2019t found that clinic trying an alternative treatment, and mixed it up with some Eastern hocus pocus by having Jeremy stay in a Buddhist temple near the clinic, the kid would have been dead over six years ago. With full-blown AIDS, he\u2019d been living every day on borrowed time, a fucking miracle. Of course, all of them were living on borrowed time, weren\u2019t they?</p><p>Lately it felt like he wasn\u2019t doing shit with his.</p><p>Jesus, he wasn\u2019t even fit company for himself. He was beating himself up for sending her off in that cab. He thought of the way she\u2019d sneaked in those little brushes of her body, her wandering hands during their dance. He\u2019d had her turned against him once, her backside soft against his groin. It would have been so easy to cup her breasts, hold her tighter against him, bury his nose in her hair.</p><p>He was going to go home, stand naked under a cold shower, wrap his fingers around his dick and jack off until his legs buckled. He already knew he\u2019d be imagining her on her knees, working him in her mouth, that blonde hair slick on her skull. He\u2019d probably have to spurt three or four times tonight. When he was finally drained, he\u2019d lie in bed, stare at the blinking light of a mute television, make his way through a bottle of whiskey, and try not to think about the fact he was starting to backslide into a person he\u2019d vowed he\u2019d never be again. But the monsters were always waiting, weren\u2019t they?</p><p>Some shit was best not stirred up, and she was like a great big wooden spoon, ready to attack that cauldron with a double-fisted grip. She\u2019d get scalded, and he couldn\u2019t allow that.</p><p>Marcie: I can\u2019t believe you couriered French bread and capellini to me in a warmer. It was so fresh, it was as if I was sitting in the kitchen at home watching you pull it out of the oven. The only thing more perfect would have been if you brought it yourself, though maybe that wouldn\u2019t be a good idea, since half the girls on the floor are now in love with you.</p><p>Ben: Hmm... Not really interested in the \u201cin love\u201d part, but a floor of co-eds in lust with me? I\u2019ll be right there. That Mercedes you\u2019re always mocking can do well over a hundred on interstate. Prepare the Jell-O tub and wet T-shirts.</p><p>Marcie: Pig. Yes, your car is fast, but you have to stop for gas every hour. Of course, it was pretty thrilling, taking it from 0 to 60 in four seconds. But I\u2019ll deny it if you tell any of my green friends.</p><p>Ben: That\u2019s green with envy, brat, not eco-conscious. And you better not tell Cassandra I let you do that. She\u2019ll want to do it too. I only let you do it because you nagged incessantly.</p><p>Phone call between Ben and Marcie, freshman year</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cYou know, all the greats\u2014Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth\u2014they could pick up any old bat and hit it out of the park. You only need a caveman\u2019s club if you can\u2019t hit the side of a barn without one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust keep telling yourself that, Luc. Whatever you need to feel good about that inferior equipment of yours.\u201d</p> <p>Jon snorted, coming into Ben\u2019s office. \u201cGlad to see you two are getting some real work done this morning.\u201d</p><p>Ben braced his foot against the side of his desk as he drank his morning coffee. He eyed Lucas, who had his ass planted on the arm of his couch. \u201cYou know Lucas can\u2019t resist talking about my dick. It fascinates him.\u201d</p><p>Lucas raised an unimpressed brow. \u201cYou brought up the distasteful subject of your dick. I was just asking how your new intern is doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he\u2019s doing her.\u201d This from Peter, coming into the door with a box of donuts. \u201cI saw her winging her way down the hall yesterday. Only got a profile shot when she turned to say something to Janet, but what a gorgeous pair of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Marcie,\u201d Ben snapped, bringing his feet down to the floor with a resounding thud. \u201cJesus, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter shot a glance at Lucas. \u201cOh shit. Sorry about that, bro.\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled wryly. \u201cShe\u2019s grown into a beautiful woman, like her sister. And just as strong-willed, God help the man who falls for her. But her assertiveness will stand her well. She wants to be a corporate investigator.\u201d</p><p>Assertive, hell. There was an understatement. Ben snorted into his coffee.</p><p>\u201cShe did exceptionally well at the intern level in Europe,\u201d Lucas continued. \u201cShe\u2019s had a few lucrative entry-level offers from firms in Milan and Stuttgart. Cass hopes she won\u2019t go that far away from home though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least that puts one family member closer to Jeremy,\u201d Peter offered.</p><p>Ben remembered his thoughts of last night. \u201cWhat\u2019s the latest on that, Luc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so good.\u201d Lucas\u2019 expression became more somber. \u201cWe talked about bringing him home, letting it end here, like a few years back when we thought it was going to happen then, but he seems truly at peace at the monastery. It\u2019s a good place. Cass wants to be with him, though, so she\u2019s talking with Pickard about a leave of absence in the next couple weeks. She\u2019ll go spend his final days with him there, and I\u2019ll fly back and forth as needed. I intended to talk to Matt about it today.\u201d</p><p>Shit, Ben hadn\u2019t realized Jeremy\u2019s time was that close. Because he\u2019d been tuning out a lot of the domestic discussion crap of late, he wasn\u2019t staying connected to each of their lives on the things that mattered. Maybe he wasn\u2019t the balloon who\u2019d been cut loose, but the one who\u2019d untied himself from the rail.</p><p>The men were quiet for a few minutes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Lucas,\u201d Jon said. Their philosophical boy-genius leaned forward in the guest chair, his blue eyes sad. \u201cI knew it was a long shot, but I hoped that treatment would help turn the tide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did.\u201d Lucas shook his head. \u201cWe thought he was going to die years ago, Jon. You gave him every moment since then. Nearly seven years not to be a junkie on the street, seven years for his life to be something better. It meant the world to Cass, to the whole family. You gave him back to them.\u201d</p><p>Ben cleared his throat, rose. Coming around his desk, he put his hand on Lucas\u2019 shoulder. \u201cWhatever you need, you\u2019ve got it, from all of us. If Cass needs you with her full time, we\u2019ll cover here, no problem.\u201d</p><p>Lucas studied Ben with shrewd gray eyes. \u201cYou know same goes, right? Whatever you\u2019re fighting, Ben, we\u2019re here. You don\u2019t have to marinate your liver and walk the streets looking for a fight. You dumb Cajun-Irish brawler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget his sporadic New England accent from that fancy education. Or the midwest drawl to put our more country clients at ease.\u201d Peter grinned, defusing the sudden tension in Ben\u2019s chest. This was about Jeremy, not him, damn it. \u201cYou know you can call me and Dana any night,\u201d Peter added. \u201cWe\u2019ll go out or, if it\u2019s a guys-only thing, she\u2019ll cut me loose without a second thought. Especially if it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s got a thing for me.

I\u2019ve actually been thinking about taking some time off.\u201d Though that would now wait until whatever happened with Jeremy happened. He\u2019d want to be close for that, to support Lucas and Cass. And Marcie.</p><p>She\u2019d had a hard relationship with her brother. Before he\u2019d become an addict, she\u2019d idolized him. Then, when she was thirteen, one of his friends had tried to rape her while Jeremy was stoned in the other room. That was the end of him living under the same roof with Cass and the other kids. The past few years had mended things, but it reminded him now why he needed to keep their relationship where it had always been. Yeah, they\u2019d stepped way the hell over that line yesterday, but he\u2019d taken that step back. End of story. Time would take care of the rest. Marcie couldn\u2019t afford having another male let her down.</p><p>\u201cMmm. A vacation may be a good idea.\u201d Lucas rose then. \u201cOnce we get the Senecorp issue off the table, you\u2019d be clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas is just trying to cut Marcie\u2019s internship short.\u201d Peter chuckled. \u201cWe all know what a corrupting influence Ben is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you blame me?\u201d Lucas said dryly. He gave Ben a shove. \u201cUp until the last couple years, she pretty much hung onto everything you said and did, so hell, I figured you\u2019d already corrupted her.\u201d</p><p>Great. Just what he wanted to hear. He managed an amused expression, no small feat when he\u2019d swallowed nails.</p><p>\u201cTime to get to work.\u201d Lucas turned toward the door. \u201cDid Janet say if Matt was coming in today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jon had been studying Ben\u2019s expression, but now he thankfully turned his attention to Lucas. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in around lunchtime. Savannah wasn\u2019t feeling too great this morning, so he wanted to stay with her awhile. Even though she nearly took his head for telling her he was coming in late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s tired of being in bed, and she hates to feel like the whole world is waiting on her, particularly Matt. No worse patient in the world than a submissive female,\u201d Peter noted.</p><p>\u201cExcept Dana,\u201d Ben snorted. \u201cShe has no problem with foot massages and being handfed bonbons.\u201d</p><p>See? He\u2019d jumped in with that one. Proof that he was fucking fine, right?</p><p>Peter took the bait with a chuckle. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell her she can\u2019t drive the Batmobile or scale tall buildings with a nail file. She likes to be pampered, but on her own terms. She doesn\u2019t like being helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we all go hang with Savannah and Matt tonight?\u201d Jon suggested. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten together in a few weeks. Ben, can you make it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>Lucas met Jon\u2019s gaze, what Ben privately called the secret decoder ring glance, because Lucas tried to cover it with a shrug. Ben knew what it meant, regardless. He\u2019ll spend another night alone drinking. Jesus. Sometimes working with four guys known for their incredible intuition as businessmen and Doms was a pain in the ass. At least they weren\u2019t women. If they were, they\u2019d want to talk about feelings, and he\u2019d have to throw himself off the top of the building.</p><p>He decided to ignore the look. He still had enough whiskey in his system to keep him mellow, and that\u2019s where he wanted to stay.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>Glancing toward the doorway, Ben saw Randall Caldwell, the K&amp;A security chief. \u201cMorning, Randy. What brings you?\u201d</p><p>The man shrugged casually. \u201cJust need a minute of your time, Mr. O\u2019Callahan, once you get done with your morning bullshit session.\u201d</p><p>Peter gave the man a punch as he went by. \u201cThere\u2019s important corporate strategy going on in here, rent-a-cop.\u201d</p><p>Randall effectively blocked the blow, giving him a grin. \u201cYeah, yeah. A bunch of suits who don\u2019t know what hard work is.\u201d</p> <p>There was some more banter back and forth, but Ben was focused on the steadiness of Randall\u2019s pale green eyes. He was teasing to lighten the atmosphere, to distract focus. The others picked up the hint, though none were fooled. Lucas gave Ben that same look again, the look that was supposed to convey solidarity. Ben wasn\u2019t sure where to go with that, given he\u2019d been imagining the girl Lucas had shepherded to adulthood going down on him like a high-powered vacuum. Christ.</p><p>After they filed out, all traces of humor left Ben. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Randall?\u201d</p><p>The security head pulled a disk out of his coat, laid it on Ben\u2019s desk. \u201cThat\u2019s the only copy, sir. If you don\u2019t want it returned, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll need to mark it on my monthly report to Mr. Kensington, but it\u2019ll go no further than that. If this is something you want us to investigate further or file charges, we will. But I wanted you to see it first. No damage appears to have been done to your vehicle.\u201d</p><p>That brought Ben\u2019s attention up sharply. \u201cSomeone was fucking around with my car?\u201d He hadn\u2019t retrieved the Mercedes from the parking deck last night, but when he checked on it this morning, it had looked fine. \u201cWhen did this happen? How the hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime stamp\u2019s on the disk, sir. Best to look at it first. I\u2019ve taken disciplinary action on the security detail assigned that shift, but... Well, I\u2019ll be in my office to discuss questions, after you look at it.\u201d Randall had moved to the door. Without further explanation, he stepped out and pulled it shut after him, so Ben wouldn\u2019t be disturbed unexpectedly.</p><p>Ben stared after him. What the hell?</p><p>Putting the disk into his laptop, he called up the footage. To better see the details of the black-and-white security tape, he put it on his wall screen.</p><p>The time stamp was 12:50 a.m. The security patrol went through each level of the parking deck once an hour, though they rotated that time by a varied amount each night so no one could anticipate their schedule. Apparently, whatever had happened had occurred right after the detail went through, because he watched the guard walk past, checking between the cars and in the shadows near the stairwell as always.</p><p>So the perpetrator had anticipated their schedule, known to do his worst when he had at least an hour to pull it off. There was a guard in reception to watch the cameras pan through the buildings and decks, but he didn\u2019t pay close attention unless one of the guards called in a camera check. The footage was merely for history, flagged if a problem cropped up. Ben wondered what had caught Randall\u2019s interest if there\u2019d been no damage to the car.</p><p>He parked on the top covered level, the back corner. It was a secluded area, but one camera was focused directly on that section. He sat down, his attention sharpening. And then everything else disappeared.</p><p>She was walking toward his car. In five-inch heels that had a plethora of straps over her ankle and a little tassel teasing the back. She was crossing one leg over the other, putting a serious sway to her hips. As he watched, she unbelted the thin coat she was wearing, let it slide down slow, until it fell below her bare shoulder blades. Her hair was slicked back and in a tight knot on her head, the black and white of the camera making it look darker. But he already knew that hair was blonde and thick. With a faint scent of perfumed coconut.</p><p>The garment dropped to her waist, the sleeves holding her elbows to her sides. She stopped in front of the grill of the car as if studying it, her back to the camera. Then the coat fell to the ground. Milk-cream skin, slim arms and legs, a gentle flare of hips. An Audrey Hepburn figure in truth. Completely naked.</p><p>\u201cFucking Jesus.\u201d He snapped up straight in his chair as if he could throw a coat over her, ask her if she\u2019d lost her mind, even realizing he was looking at something that had happened hours ago.</p><p>She moved another several steps toward the car, keeping his gaze glued to the swing of her ass. She didn\u2019t play it up, just put everything that was female and perfect into the movement, the slight quiver of the buttock as her heel made contact with the deck concrete, the shift of hip as she moved forward. When she put her knee on the nose of the car, Ben stifled a groan as she braced her hand on the hood and then looked over her shoulder at him, right at the camera.</p><p>She was wearing a mask. A Mardi Gras mask with deep purple and teal green feathers, the gold thread edging drawing attention to her lips and sweet line of chin. The feathers brushed her temples. A tiny waterfall of rhinestones emphasized the eyes.</p><p>Holy fuck. He\u2019d seen this mask before. Her movements at the file cabinets had been familiar for reasons other than inheriting her sister\u2019s grace. Marcie hadn\u2019t been lying. She had gone to a club. She\u2019d been at Surreal ten days ago.</p><p>He usually played private, but lately the privacy mocked the intimacy he really wasn\u2019t getting with his subs, so he\u2019d decided to go for a public playroom scene. He\u2019d gone over the top, chosen three women. Clara, Sharon and Myra. All staff regulars up for hire, and his preference that night because they thrived on rough edge play.</p><p>He\u2019d put them in a triangle of stocks, the kind that bound neck and wrists, and then he\u2019d locked their feet to the floor in the anchored boots that increased the sense of vulnerability. He\u2019d gone to work on them with a flogger, then wielded a paddle with expert precision and force until they were crying, the marks showing on their asses, but they were also soaked as honey hives. Drawing out that honey with clever fingers that had them on the cusp of orgasm, he\u2019d mixed that natural lubricant with a stimulant that would heat up their rectums, make them even more sensitive to his penetration.</p><p>He\u2019d been ruthless that night, wringing two or three orgasms out of each woman before he\u2019d plunged his cock into them. Three different condoms, three different orgasms. When he was done, his chest was heaving and his vision was a little gray, so when he sat down on a nearby bench to watch their aftercare, handled by the staff, he was almost spent. But not too spent to notice her.</p><p>He\u2019d been peripherally aware of her during the session, which was unusual in itself, because once in a scene, it usually absorbed him completely. In this case, as the scene became more intense, he noticed her more. She kept circling, so he saw her first on his left, then right, at a distance, then closer. She\u2019d eventually found a stationary spot, near the wall across the floor of the public play area, blending with the shadows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d been wearing a simple black cocktail dress, no rubber club bracelet that gave a clear indication of her status. No jewelry except the silver collar and pendant he\u2019d never seen close up, not until last night. She\u2019d worn a killer pair of strap heels then as now, and the dress\u2019s neckline framed her swelling cleavage in an eye-catching way. Because the dress was snug, he\u2019d had a few tempting glimpses of her ass.</p><p>Throughout his scene, she\u2019d stayed riveted on what he was doing. She was a sub; he\u2019d felt it from her like a beacon call, and just the kind of sub he took pleasure in breaking down, breaking open. She\u2019d be a virgin to having her ass fucked, he was sure of it.</p><p>By the end, it was almost as if he was performing for her. When he was balls deep inside Myra, listening to her grunt deliciously at the power of his strokes, he saw the mystery woman\u2019s lips part, her tongue touch her lips, a delicate movement of need and yearning. Her fingers had gripped the rail so that he suspected her knuckles were white, and her body was pressed against it. If she\u2019d been closer at that point, he would have told her to lift her skirt, put her fingers on her wet pussy and masturbate for him, show him how wet she was, how she wanted his cock inside of her when he was done here.</p> <p>After he got his breath back, she was gone. The staff remembered her, said she was a guest, but of course he didn\u2019t pry beyond that, respecting the privacy rules that didn\u2019t reveal names. He\u2019d thought of her more than once since then. If he saw her again, he\u2019d burn down her shields, win her sweet cries and tears of surrender.</p><p>Now he was looking at her again. Marcie. She put her other knee up on the car hood and, with a smooth ripple of thighs and buttocks, she was on the Roadster on all fours, her ass facing the camera.</p><p>A black velvet bag was in her hand, and she laid it near the windshield. As he watched, she went down to one elbow and put her cheek to the car\u2019s hood. Holding her balance on her knees and that one cheek, she reached back, cupped both hands over her ass. Curving her fingers into the seam between, she parted her buttocks to show him that delicate puckered entrance. As she flexed, he caught the glisten, realized she\u2019d already oiled herself up.</p><p>Dipping her fingers into her pussy, she worked them in and out, showing him she was also well-aroused, then she moved her fingers from there into her rectum. The muscles contracted and released, then contracted again, taking her.</p><p>He had his hand on his cock, he couldn\u2019t help it. It was straining against his slacks, threatening to split seams. Damn it. He hit the remote on his desk, locking the door, and then opened his trousers. When he put a chokehold on it, it convulsed under his hand.</p> <p>Removing her fingers from her ass, she reached for that velvet bag. She withdrew an eight-inch dildo from it, an impressively thick size, though still not as large as him. She put it in her mouth, taking all eight of those inches to the hilt, her throat working then relaxing. She worked it in and out, lips stretched over it.</p><p>Yes, baby. That\u2019s it. Take my cock. Take all of it. He had to watch this to the end. Then he\u2019d think about the ramifications.</p><p>When she had it slick from her saliva, she reached behind her again, parting her cheeks.</p><p>Who had seen this footage? Whose eyes did he have to put out? His fist clenched on himself, but not to rub. Something even deeper came to the forefront as she worked it in. She bit her lip, concentrating, trying to relax. She hadn\u2019t done it too often then, and he sensed some tension in her. If he were there, he\u2019d teach her how to relax. Best way to ass fuck a woman fairly new to it was to get them so excited, their pussy so near climax, they were contracting on air, then slide right into their rear entry like butter. They convulsed on a cock like a fist that would never let go, those sphincter muscles strong and sure.</p><p>Four inches, five...she had it past the muscles, but it was thick, and he was sure it was burning. But then she had it in to the hilt. As she turned her body, she tried to hold on to her sinuous way of moving. She didn\u2019t realize it made his blood heat to volcanic lava, seeing that sensual impairment, the awkwardness caused by such a penetration.</p><p>She made it over to her back, pressing the dildo deep inside of her against the car hood. Slowly, she spread her legs. He drew in a breath as she lifted her upper body, used that gymnastic flexibility to reach down, unbuckle the straps of the shoes. What he\u2019d thought were two sets of buckles, part of the shoe\u2019s design, was an extra set of tie straps on her ankles. She buckled one ankle to the grill. Spreading the other leg out as far as it could go, she fastened it as well. Then she eased herself to her back once again, only now her legs were spread so wide he could see her weeping pussy, the flex of her buttocks as they flattened against the hood, holding that phallus inside of her.</p> <p>She placed the other hand above her head, curling her fingers around the hood edge at the windshield. She didn\u2019t restrain her wrist, but the way she held it there suggested binding. Then she slid her other hand down her belly. He saw the navel jewelry, that glittering flower, now without a key on it, because he\u2019d taken it, removed it and her collar.</p><p>Her breasts were as fucking tempting as any Ben had ever seen. He thought Peter, dedicated tit man who he was, would agree. She was pierced there too, tiny little rings, tempting teeth. The nipples were stiff and large, her back arched as if offering them, begging. He followed the track from that irresistible view down the slope of her abdomen, over the navel piercing, down to where her hand was. Jesus, she had a clit hood piercing as well, a jeweled ring lying against her clean-shaven pussy, glistening with her juices.</p><p>She could be bound by those four rings. A collar around her neck, chains leading to her nipples, navel, clit. Chains that could be tightened and tugged to fold her over, increase the discomfort, helplessness, focusing her on her Master\u2019s desires, heightening his pleasure and her own...</p><p>She tugged on that clit piercing and moaned, arching up farther, thrusting out those beautiful tits in a way that would compel any straight man who saw this to jack off. Ben understood Randall\u2019s comment about disciplinary action now. There was no way the guard monitoring the cameras had missed her doing this. But he wouldn\u2019t put it past Marcie to have done her research, to know which on-duty guard would be most likely to hold off calling it in right away, unable to resist indulging in a little late-night adult cable entertainment.</p><p>Or more likely\u2014given that K&amp;A security were smart and well-trained\u2014the man in question had realized within the first thirty seconds this was an intentional message for Ben. As such, he\u2019d made the judgment call, decided to simply monitor her, making sure she intended no vandalism, and then reported it to Randall after the fact, earning the disciplinary action as a matter of form only.</p><p>Either way, she\u2019d taken a calculated risk, one that had panned out.</p><p>She rocked against her touch, her lips pressing hard together. Fingers dipping in, coming out, smearing more fluid against her cunt. She was saying something, urging herself on, and when Ben recognized the words on her lips, his cock convulsed hard in his hand, demanding to spurt his response.</p><p>Please, Master...let me come. Let me serve you. Master... Master... Then, Ben...please. Master.</p> <p>He traced her face, her body. Pre-cum trickled down his shaft, dampening his fingers, making him tighten his grip once more. He couldn\u2019t. This was...he was going to shake her until her teeth rattled. Security or not, she was all by herself in a parking deck in the middle of the night. If some vagrant had stumbled on her, or anyone...</p><p>She slowed then, so near climax her body had to be sheened with perspiration. Now she stretched out both her arms, a clear message of submission. She breathed deep, drawing herself back from that edge. She wasn\u2019t going to come, because he hadn\u2019t been there, hadn\u2019t given her permission.</p><p>That realization hit him hard in the chest as she at last let go of the hood. She probably had red indentations in her palms. When she pushed herself up, he saw her hair had come down, a twisted, dark tail against her neck.</p><p>She opened the tie on one ankle, moved more stiffly to do the other. Turning onto her hands and knees once more, she reversed the provocative process, sliding out the dildo until the head released with that sudden pop that made her convulse, press her thighs together. He could see the tracks of her arousal on her thighs. That tight rosebud entry point flexed as it released the phallus, such that he felt that impact all the way to his testicles.</p><p>Tucking it all in the velvet bag, she took out a handkerchief and wiped what appeared to be some drops of her arousal off the hood, then tucked that away as well. Turning to face the camera fully, she dropped to her knees and bowed her head. Then she picked up the coat, slipped it on her shoulders. Tossing her hair back, combing through it with her fingers, she managed to walk away with that same sauntering confidence she\u2019d shown in his office earlier in the day when she\u2019d been teasing him. When she reached the stairwell door, she even threw the same sassy look over her shoulder.</p><p>Speak of the devil. His gaze lifted as he heard the tap of heels outside of his door. A moment later, his intercom buzzed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Mr. O\u2019Callahan.\u201d That sultry purr. \u201cSo is your nine o\u2019clock. Are you ready for Mr. Alexander?\u201d</p><p>That effectively brought him up short. Clamping down on a variety of responses, he tucked himself back in, ejected the security footage to lock it in his middle desk drawer and tore open a sanitized towelette to clean his hands. He was proud to find his voice was even, controlled when he responded. \u201cYes, Marcie. Send him in.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, Don Alexander was a no-nonsense sort who preferred to get straight to business. He wouldn\u2019t question why Ben didn\u2019t rise from his desk for a morning handshake. If Don knew where his hand had been, he\u2019d probably thank Ben for the lack of courtesy.</p><p>The legal muscle for one of their latest in-process acquisitions took a sprawling seat in Ben\u2019s guest chair and unlatched his briefcase, already firing off the info he was here to get. Ben knew what he needed, had it ready, so his gaze slid to the view outside his door while Don did his required diatribe.</p><p>Marcie\u2019s desk was at a diagonal angle to his door. She was wearing another one of those straight, tailored skirts, only this one was a little higher and had several short, coquettish slits in the front that layered like flower petals. When she adjusted her seat, he caught a glimpse of the lace top of her thigh-high stockings. As if she was unaware of his perusal\u2014yeah right\u2014she ran her finger beneath the skirt edge, flipping up one of those layers to check the hold of the\u2014holy God\u2014garter holding the stocking in place. Her hair was twisted up in a soft, loose style, and today she wore a lightweight sleeveless turtleneck in a pale blue color. The long stretch of fabric from throat to hips drew a man\u2019s gaze right to her generous breasts. He could discern the puckered state of her nipples. A faint impression only, something that could be explained away by the well-air-conditioned office, instead of inappropriate attire, but he\u2019d put money on the fact her bra was so thin it allowed that subtle effect, while keeping those heavy breasts up nice and high. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hard-on wasn\u2019t abating in the least. She was wearing the heels she\u2019d worn on his car, the little tease. Two sets of buckles, so she\u2019d included the restraints, which yanked his mind right to the image of bending her over her desk, spreading her legs out wide and binding her ankles to the desk legs. He\u2019d fuck her, then make her do her work in that bent-over position while he enjoyed the view from his desk.</p><p>Janet might have a few words to say about that. So would Matt. As for Lucas...hell.</p><p>He pulled his attention away from Marcie, though he could smell her unique fragrance. She\u2019d probably shaken Don\u2019s hand, leaving a lingering scent on his palm. He gave Don some answers, asked a few questions of his own, which sent the man riffling through papers again. It left Ben free to shift his gaze back to the only thing that mattered to him at the moment.</p><p>Weren\u2019t you supposed to stay on the other side of that line, you prick?</p><p>Marcie was studying her laptop, but as if she felt his regard, she lifted those lashes. He caught the familiar moistening of her bottom lip, that involuntary tell of vulnerability, of possible uncertainty, as if she was weighing a decision. But then the decision was made. Like a flipped switch, her expression became hot, focused, challenging. With a surreptitious glance toward Don, she slipped her hand back down to her thigh, fingers following the silken surface of the stocking. Pushing under one of the front overlapping slits in the skirt, she traced the nylon up, up, into the dark shadows of the skirt fabric. Her fingers moved over, down, her knees parting. Biting her lip, she lifted her chin in reaction as she obviously found her pussy, stroked.</p><p>To someone coming down the hall, it would appear she was still working on her computer, but beneath the desk, where he could see, she was getting more stimulated, her movements a little more jerky. Which meant she\u2019d been hot and worked up when she put her hand down there. Given that she\u2019d come into work with a battle plan to drive him insane, he wasn\u2019t surprised. Her pussy was probably so slick and ready for his cock he could just cross the room, shove her against the wall and slam into her like a torpedo chamber ready to fire.</p><p>She kept her hot gaze on him, with those occasional maddening little flicks toward Don. If he looked left, he\u2019d get the same view Ben was getting. Then Ben would have to kill him.</p><p>Something broke inside him. No, not broke. That was entirely the wrong word. He found his footing, something kicking in that was much stronger than concerns about Lucas and Cass, about inappropriate or appropriate behavior on his part. It was the feeling he had right before he entered one of Matt\u2019s volatile acquisition meetings. Foot in the stirrup, ass on the warhorse, lance in hand, no entendre intended. Decision made.</p><p>The whiskey and damn indecision from last night disappeared. He knew how to handle this situation. Misbehaving subs, those who stepped out of line, were his particular area of expertise. His craving.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you needed, Don? All right then, I\u2019ll have my intern fax over...\u201d</p><p>He dealt with Don with courtesy, showed him out the door, using iron discipline to keep his cock from straining at the end of its chain. Marcie had of course returned both hands to her keyboard, her skirt smoothed back over her thighs. She rose, smiling. Nodding to Don, she reached out to grip his hand when the man offered his. She was going to touch him with the hand she\u2019d had on her pussy, leave that scent on his fingers. From the calculated look in her gaze, Ben knew she intended it.</p><p>He stepped between them, though it wasn\u2019t a wide space. While Don looked a little startled by the abrupt intervention, Ben ironed it out with some further BS about the documents he needed. As Don responded, Marcie\u2019s fingers brushed Ben\u2019s back, the line of his spine, tugging playfully on his dress shirt, since his coat was hanging up behind his door. Her touch felt good, too good. Ben stepped away, taking Don down the hall and back to reception.</p><p>After he turned him over to Janet, doing a few more minutes of necessary bullshit chitchat, he pivoted on his foot and headed back down the hall. Since he was striding back to his office like a wolf running down a kill, he made himself stop before he hit the corner that would take him into view of his office area. Holding himself there, he took a breath. Thought it through.</p><p>That pause didn\u2019t change anything. He knew what was needed, and wouldn\u2019t turn back from it. Wherever the hell this took them, she\u2019d pushed it too far. Time to give her a taste of what she thought she wanted.</p><p>After executing her Plan B, Marcie had been too wired to sleep, her body needy, hungry, but she didn\u2019t give it the orgasm it was screaming for. She wanted to stay like this, wild, reckless, so she\u2019d have the courage to make some really terrible decisions in judgment in the morning. Like masturbating right there where Don Alexander might have seen. But the look in Ben\u2019s eyes, the flame in those green eyes, had been worth the risk. She\u2019d broken his chain of self-control, she knew it. He\u2019d obviously seen the security footage, because there was an edge to that look, a promise of retribution.</p><p>As she heard his footsteps, she had a moment to be thrilled and terrified at once. She\u2019d pushed him past anything she could control. It gave her a primal urge to bolt, but fortunately he was turning the corner, already too close. Just the smell of his aftershave, the remembrance of the heat of his skin beneath his shirt when she\u2019d stroked him just now, without Don\u2019s knowledge, was enough to weaken her knees.</p><p>She was still standing by her desk, but he didn\u2019t pause. Locking his hand around her wrist, he strode past her, yanking her into step with him. With a little hop and skip, she was with him. He might drag her by her hair if she stumbled.</p><p>He took her to the private restroom at this end of the hall, one that had shower facilities, everything for a man who often worked long hours at the office. He pulled her in there, slammed the door behind them, twisted the locks shut.</p><p>\u201cBen\u2014\u201d That was all she got out, because in the next blink, he\u2019d shoved her against the wall and slammed his mouth down on hers.</p><p>Oh. Oh. She whimpered in the back of her throat at the strength of his aroused, powerful body against her. His hands were in her hair, yanking out pins so it spilled onto her shoulders. He gripped the strands hard, fusing her mouth to his. His tongue demanded entry, and it made every part of her tight, the way he lashed it against hers, pressing it down, learning her mouth more intimately than she thought was possible.</p><p>His hands stayed on her face, though her body writhed uncontrolled against him, her tight nipples pressed to his chest. She tried to push herself against his hard groin, but he thrust his thigh between her legs so his knee thudded against the wall, flexing muscle pressing against her mound.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking slut,\u201d he muttered against her lips. \u201cHot little cunt.\u201d</p> <p>How he could make such awful words sound like an endearment, a caress, she didn\u2019t know, but he did. She was shameless enough to nod, to confirm it. She was a slut, her pussy wet, all for him. Only for him. This was that moment she\u2019d dreamed about, overwhelming, crazy, impossible to control, and she didn\u2019t want any control. She wanted to be chained to him. Collared and belonging to him in every dark, dangerous way that horrified the civilized world.</p><p>If it were hundreds of years ago, and he were a pasha, she\u2019d want to be his slave girl, subject to the sting of his lash. If he was a pirate, she\u2019d be the nobleman\u2019s daughter he kidnapped and corrupted, night after night, turning her into a wanton, willing to do anything. Fight at his side, press her lips to his polished boot. Curl next to his feet to be there for anything he needed.</p><p>She savored every millimeter of his palm against her face, her throat, his fingers buried in her hair. Her lips stayed parted, open as he plundered, took for himself. Her pulse thundered in her throat, roared in her ears. Her clit throbbed against his leg. When the thigh muscle shifted with his stance, she gasped into his mouth. But she stayed still, his to do with as he desired.</p><p>He broke the kiss, pulled her to face the mirror over the sink. \u201cHands on the counter,\u201d he growled, gaze pinning her in that reflective glass. \u201cGet rid of the shoes. Keep standing straight. Press your cunt against it.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, kicking off the shoes, knowing that her teeth were chattering with nerves. There was something raw and volatile in this room, something she\u2019d glimpsed that night at Surreal when he hadn\u2019t known she was there. This was the kind of Master he was. Hard, ruthless, edgy. Dangerous, the kind of Dom who took the challenge of finding out what his sub was and needed down to her soul, without allowing her to say a word. He was a lawyer\u2014he had no trust of words, though he certainly knew their power.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. She wanted him any way she could get him. She could do this.</p><p>Her nipples were so stiff, it was as if she was wearing no bra at all. He slid his hand along the right stocking, traced the garter as she made a tiny mewl. The loss of her heels made her feel even more vulnerable. Dipping his fingers under the hem of the skirt, he pushed it up so it folded around his wrist as he found her panties, the soaked crotch. She moaned.</p><p>\u201cWet as you can be. You were going to touch Don with this hand.\u201d He lifted it with his other, his fingers tight on her wrist, emphasizing how much stronger he was.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t show fear, even though she was shaking like a cornered mouse. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Pushing the crotch of her panties aside, he sank two fingers into her, without hesitation, knowing her body intimately. She cried out, but managed to stay still as he ordered while his thumb settled on her clit, began to rub. He brought her hand to his mouth, sucked on her fingers, took the taste of her pussy into himself. It was a good thing he was pressed up against her, because her knees would have buckled.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come last night,\u201d he muttered, \u201call spread out on my car. Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...you didn\u2019t give me permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come now.\u201d</p><p>It was lightning, whatever he did, the skillful rhythm, pinches at just the right moments, the way his gaze met hers in the mirror, the feel of his body against hers, taking her over. She had a compulsion to resist, an automatic survival instinct before the vortex about to sweep her away, but it was useless. The climax she\u2019d held out of reach last night, stoked to trip off at the slightest provocation, swept up through her, flushing her skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He caught her throat, holding her face so she was staring at herself in the mirror, staring at him. Her mouth stretched wide, her eyes teared, and strangled shrieks tore from her throat. He kept working her with the other hand, had her up so high on her toes he put uncomfortable pressure on her jaw, keeping her straining, quivering, gasping.</p><p>As she cried out, he turned his face into her throat and bit, sucking on her skin fiercely, marking her tender flesh just below the top edge of the soft turtleneck collar. A glazed glimpse at the mirror showed him biting into her like a vampire, her breasts thrust out, nipples jutting, body jerking uncontrollably in his powerful hold, his hand working between her legs. With her skirt pushed up and gathered around his forearm, his large fingers were visible through the sheer cloth of her panties as he thrust and scissored, pinched her clit.</p><p>Because of that hold, the balance of pain and discomfort with the pleasure, it was the most unusual and intense orgasm she\u2019d ever experienced. Like a whitewater rapid ride, bumpy and thrilling, scary, a cyclone of unpredictable sensations as she cried out and shuddered, made pleading noises. The waves of feeling kept hitting her from all sides, spinning her mind, making her body buck. Just when she thought she was coming down, he\u2019d move his fingers or alter the pressure on her throat and she was bleating with helpless noises once more.</p><p>At last her body itself gave out, convulsing like a fever victim, leaving her mind blank, facial features numb, making it difficult to speak. She was panting, seeking air. At a certain point she\u2019d unconsciously let go of the counter, had grabbed hold of his forearm across her body. Now she saw she\u2019d dug her nails into his flesh, drawn blood. He\u2019d have at least three crescent marks there. She was still holding him that tightly, but she couldn\u2019t make herself let go.</p><p>\u201cDoes Lucas know what you are?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fluttered up to meet his in the mirror. He had his jaw pressed to the side of her head, his lips cruising along the hair at her temple. It wasn\u2019t tenderness, not exactly. He looked like he was learning her scent like a predator, so he could hunt her again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what he and Cass talk about.\u201d Enough belligerence slipped into her voice that she earned a deeper push of those fingers. Plus a third one, despite the constricted nature of her post-climactic tissues. She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cDoes Cass know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She swallowed against his hold, met that formidable stare. \u201cShe and I talked...when I figured it out. She also had me talk to Dana. In case I felt reservations about discussing certain things with her. I asked her not to tell Peter. So I don\u2019t think any of the other...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys\u201d didn\u2019t fit, not at this moment. Five hardcore Masters, bonded like a wolfpack. A more respectful honorific was needed, but her brain was too foggy to figure it out.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Though he still held her on her toes, he slid his fingers out of her. Her hands convulsed against his arm, the one she\u2019d marked. If he rolled down the sleeve, he\u2019d get blood on it. When he eased her back to her feet, she was already reaching for the basket of thick paper hand towels. Her fingers shaking, she tried to run one under the water.</p><p>\u201cGot to wipe that blood off,\u201d she said, hearing her voice break. \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t mess up your shirt.\u201d</p><p>Marcie: I know you\u2019ve had sex with a million women. How many women have you had that mattered?</p><p>Ben: I\u2019m not having this conversation with you.</p><p>Marcie: Why?</p><p>Ben: Because it\u2019s entirely inappropriate, and none of your business.</p><p>Marcie: I\u2019m just curious what it is you really want.</p><p>Ben: Men aren\u2019t that complex, Marcie.</p><p>Marcie: Maybe most men aren\u2019t. But I think you are. Otherwise you\u2019d just answer the question.</p><p>Phone call between Ben and Marcie</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>He pressed against her back, closing his hands on her wrists. \u201cStop.\u201d He spoke against her hair. Pulling the towel from her hands, he set it aside. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p> <p>Since she was already right against him, she wasn\u2019t sure what he meant, but it didn\u2019t matter. Turning her in his arms, he picked her up, smooth and easy. In the small sitting area adjacent to the bathroom was a settee, probably to give him a place to sit down and put on his shoes if he was dressing in here. Now he set her down on the firm cushions. \u201cStay there.\u201d</p><p>Returning to the sink, he blotted the blood off his arm, quick and functional. Then he wet another paper towel and brought it and a couple dry ones with him. Nonplussed, she watched him drop to one knee beside her, bringing them to eye level. Cupping her chin, he dabbed at her mascara, dried tears she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d shed when he took her over so completely. She didn\u2019t understand why that would make her cry, but it felt right, like it should.</p><p>Reaching out, she touched the pocket of his shirt, her fingers hooking briefly in it, caressing the man beneath. \u201cNo handkerchief,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cIt was in my coat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make do with this.\u201d</p><p>He sat back on his heels then, out of her reach. Bending his head, he gripped her ankle, began to massage the strained arches, her toes, through the silk of her stockings. \u201cOh.\u201d She suppressed a moan of sheer joy at the sensation. The little ripple between her legs at the intimate touch surprised her, her body responding as if that hollow of her foot was an erogenous zone.</p><p>\u201cUnzip your skirt,\u201d he ordered, his head still bent over his task. It took a little fumbling, since coordination wasn\u2019t happening right now, but she managed to reach behind her and do that. Rising, he lifted her back onto her bare feet, and then worked the skirt off her hips himself. The strength and yet precision of his hands captured her, the way he was able to remove the skirt with firm pressure, no jerking or awkwardness. On one hand, it was a reminder of how many women he\u2019d undressed. On the other, it was undeniably sexy, the competent way he did it, no haste.</p><p>\u201cHow you breathe in this is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLycra and cotton blend. It\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201d She hiccupped on the chuckle, felt a little silly and more than a bit nervous, flushing as he flicked a glance at her. The skirt dropped to the ground around her bare feet. She wanted to cross her arms over herself, rub arms that now had goose bumps. Instead, her hands had landed on his shoulders as he\u2019d bent to free the skirt, and they were still there. Until he straightened, and then they slipped to his forearms, her fingers curling into the folds of his sleeves. He took her wrists, lifted her hands away from him, but gave them a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cAt your sides, Marcie. You don\u2019t have permission to touch me.\u201d</p><p>It was odd, how it kicked in. That post-climactic lassitude, the numbness of her brain, didn\u2019t make her numb to instinctive obedience to her Master\u2019s order. Though he said it in a relatively mild tone, she immediately put her arms at her sides. Keeping them there became a little more difficult when he hooked her panties, drew them down her legs, his fingers following the same track over her thighs. She twitched, made a small noise. He stopped, glanced at her, and she stilled again.</p><p>Giving an approving nod, he continued, taking them down to her feet. \u201cStep out of them.\u201d</p><p>When she did, he set them aside. Now she was wearing only the snug sleeveless turtleneck and her garter belt and stockings, framing her bare sex. In the mirror over the sink she saw the silver glint of the clit jewelry against her pale skin. It was a barbell with a slender chain dipping from each of the ends, a faint tease to her clit and labia when she moved, though of course she hadn\u2019t needed the additional stimulus today.</p><p>Ben sat back on his heels, studying her. She dared a glance down at him, the strong face, those brilliant green eyes, the dark hair falling over his forehead. He had such a strong face, a solid jaw, the slope of his cheek bones beautifully sculpted. He was everything a man should look like. Even the casual power of his pose, resting on one heel, arm on his thigh, the other reaching out now. She bit her lip as he touched that tiny chain, his thumb and forefinger pinching it, giving it a tug. She closed her eyes at the sensation. God, she\u2019d just climaxed, and yet her body was so attuned to him, so hungry.</p><p>She had damp tracks on her inner thighs, her labia wet from her climax. Given his focus there now, she expected he was going to wipe away the come from her thighs with the other paper towel. Instead, he put his hands on her hips, shifted forward and put his mouth there instead.</p><p>She sucked in a gasp. He hadn\u2019t told her to widen her stance. In fact, his hands tightened, holding her still as he licked his way up to her pussy. Then he was on it, suckling away her juices, teasing her labia and clit as he cleaned her in a deliberately functional way, indulging a Master\u2019s desire to taste his toy while she stood still and suffering, aching for him. She kept her lips pressed together tight but couldn\u2019t help the pleas in her throat, the involuntary twitches from the stimulus to over-sensitized skin.</p><p>At last, he sat back. Only then did he use the paper towel, rubbing her dry, letting her feel the stroke of his fingers through it. Lightheaded, she swayed, and he put his hand back on her hip, steadying her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lock your knees.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten, but he\u2019d noticed. He noticed everything. Now he eased her down to a sitting position on the couch, perching her on the end of it so her pussy was exposed to the cool air. \u201cSpread your legs, Marcie. Put your hands behind you, straighten your back, then I want you to meet my gaze.\u201d</p><p>He rose, moved back to the sink while she obeyed. Lifting her gaze was more difficult than expected. He hadn\u2019t even taken off his clothes, while she was half naked, the bottom half, which was a far more vulnerable feeling than topless. He was leaning against the sink, watching her. His cock was a thick root against the restraint of his slacks, making her wet her lips. She\u2019d of course seen men get aroused, but not to such obvious thickness, and not with the complete lack of self-consciousness he had about it. He\u2019d given her a climax, but taken nothing for himself. She wanted to service him the way a slave should, sucking his cock until he had his own release. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he\u2019d taken her collar, he\u2019d said A slave doesn\u2019t collar herself. He even understood that about her. Yes, she was a submissive, but in her mind she preferred the far more stark and aggressive term of slave. Myriad definitions in the D/s world for each status didn\u2019t matter to her. It was what he meant when he said it, and the way it made her feel. His.</p><p>\u201cMy brain might be in my cock, Marcie, but my eyes aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She brought her gaze up to his, reluctantly. His lips twisted, seeing it. If things were different, if he truly accepted her as his, she knew he would have dished out some punishment for the infraction, minor as it was. Ben was the kind of Master who didn\u2019t let anything slide. She hungered for that, loved the idea of that kind of structure, safety. She craved the sharp edge of his discipline enough to challenge that side of him, again and again. But right now, she had enough to do controlling her own body. Her knees wouldn\u2019t stop quivering, no matter how much she tried to make them do so. She wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d ever support her weight again.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know about me? About us?\u201d he asked.</p><p>To pull it together and answer him, she imagined she was in a meeting, being asked for a report. It wasn\u2019t easy in this setting, but she let familiar practice guide her. \u201cOnce Lucas and Cass got together, I picked up on things, but I always knew, in a way.\u201d</p><p>He was still waiting. She hadn\u2019t answered the question fully, so she backtracked a few steps. It was truly odd to do this naked, and right after a climax besides. Like a surreal Penthouse letter. She quelled a strange hiccup of laughter at the thought.</p><p>\u201cMy passion\u2019s always been investigation, research.\u201d And you, but she didn\u2019t add that. \u201cI\u2019m freelancing a couple cases for Pickard Consulting now.\u201d She moistened her dry lips again. \u201cYou remember, I was studying K&amp;A, how you all do things, when I was in middle school. As I went along, I also read the social blogs, picked up hints. Things others would miss. Then at home...as I said, I noticed things. Really subtle, because Lucas and Cass were pretty discreet, given all the kids. But because of what I am...I picked up on it.\u201d</p><p>It was like hearing a song she knew, over and over. One day she\u2019d put together all the clues, found the name of it.</p> <p>She saw an ominous flicker in his eyes, but she straightened, made her voice as firm as she could manage. \u201cI could see it, in the way you interact with each other at family barbecues, Christmas, whatever. When I was eighteen, I found Cass\u2019 membership card to Surreal. By that point, it confirmed what I already knew.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, not sure what else to say. But it didn\u2019t matter. He was closing up on her. Picking up her skirt, her panties, he dropped them on the couch. \u201cGet dressed. We\u2019ll talk more in my office.\u201d</p><p>He was headed for the door, going to leave her here. The spell where he\u2019d been caring for her, all of his focus on her, was breaking. He\u2019d draw back, rationalize. If he took this away from her, if it stopped, she\u2019d die. He\u2019d opened the door, and he couldn\u2019t close it now. She couldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known what I am for a long time, Ben.\u201d She blurted it out. He paused, his hand on the latch, but he didn\u2019t turn. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t call it that when you\u2019re young, but when you fantasize about superheroes tying you up, and your favorite game is Ken torturing Barbie in a dungeon, you start to realize... You want to know the first really great erotic dream I had, the one that made me feel like, yes, that\u2019s what I am?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say yes, but he didn\u2019t tell her to stop either. Not that she gave him much of a chance, the words tumbling out. \u201cI suspected Lucas was Cass\u2019 Master, that you were all Doms. I wasn\u2019t completely sure, because I was still exploring it in myself.\u201d</p><p>Her rational mind might not have been certain, but the part of her that controlled her dreams had known. \u201cI fantasized I was blindfolded, led into a bedroom by Jon. I recognized his hands, even though I never saw him. I heard noises, soft cries. Then I could see things, even though the me in the dream was blindfolded. Cass was tied, all spread out on the bed, her knees bent over the edge of the mattress, calves bound to the bed rails. I\u2019d been pushed down on my knees on the floor, right between her spread ankles. Peter turned me so my back was against the foot of the bed, and my arms were tied to Cass\u2019 calves. My thighs and...ass hurt, as if they\u2019d been whipped. It felt good, sore that way. Then Lucas was there. He ordered me to open my mouth, fed his cock into it.\u201d</p> <p>Ben turned, his eyes narrowing. Though she pushed onward, she focused on the wall next to his head, not sure she could meet his gaze for this. \u201cI was pushed back against the mattress as he leaned over me, his cock going deeper down my throat. He made me service him as he went down on my sister, made her scream out her climax. He came just as she did. I was burning up with the desire to come, but I knew I wasn\u2019t allowed. Not until you said so.\u201d</p><p>There was a stillness in the small room now, a heated intensity that was building. She dared the flame at last, meeting the green fire of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou were there. When Lucas moved, joined Cass on the bed, you picked me up, told me I was a good girl, that I\u2019d taken care of Lucas just the way you\u2019d ordered me to do it. Then, in that very same room, while Lucas was fucking Cass, you bent me over a chair, spread my legs and began to fuck me. You were so hard, so big, I was afraid I couldn\u2019t take you all, but I wanted to. I wanted to do anything to please you. When you pushed against me, you pinched the places that you\u2019d whipped, made them hurt more. It only made me hotter.\u201d</p><p>His jaw flexed, but she wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>\u201cIt freaked me out,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut you dream what you dream. And it wasn\u2019t an incest thing, because Cass and I...we were just...we were both there to serve Masters. A bond no less strong than blood. It was all about serving a Master. Serving you, and them. I know how it works, Ben. The women...Dana, Cass, Rachel, Savannah. You play together, you share together, but each woman belongs to only one of you, her soul all his. I\u2019m that person for you, Ben. I know it. I\u2019ve wanted you since the moment I met you, and it\u2019s only gotten stronger. Everything I am tells me I can handle whatever kind of Master you are.\u201d</p><p>Boy, she\u2019d overplayed that hand, big time, but she\u2019d crested the hill and rushed down it, unable to stop the coaster that was her mouth. His expression had shuttered, of course. Guys never liked hearing shit like this, but she didn\u2019t care. \u201cTake me to a club,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me prove it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a weird dream for a kid to have,\u201d he said in a flat tone.</p><p>\u201cAll teenagers have sex dreams. I\u2019m not ashamed of them. Then or now. Lucas is my sister\u2019s husband, not my father. Any red-blooded woman who had to sleep in a room near the two of them, hearing the things he could do to a woman, no matter how much Cass tried to muffle it, would get turned-on by him.\u201d</p> <p>His brow rose, but his mouth also tightened, as if he didn\u2019t particularly care to hear her appraisal of his CFO. Of course, the idea of him being jealous was probably wishful thinking on her part. Since it was obvious he\u2019d let go of the leash he\u2019d picked up for far too short a time, she wriggled into her panties and the skirt. Retrieved her heels. That put her within a couple steps of him. Stepping into the shoes, she ran her fingers through her hair, tossed it back.</p><p>\u201cI was top of my class, won a full scholarship to college, and I\u2019m damn good at what I do. And I\u2019m only going to get better at it. I\u2019ll pay my taxes, pull my weight, and I\u2019ve never avoided my responsibilities. So...\u201d Glad she was back in her heels, reclaiming the sexual advantage they gave her, she took a step toward him, cocked a hip, drawing his attention to the angle of the body he\u2019d just sampled. \u201cI can be as deviant and twisted as I want, as long as I\u2019m not hurting anyone. The only one craving pain is me. From you.\u201d</p><p>He stepped away from the door, right up to her, her breasts brushing his chest. His mouth was thin and tight. Everything in her screamed she should give way before that Master\u2019s stare, that alpha demand for submission, but she couldn\u2019t, no matter how everything in her wanted to do it, no matter her stomach was jumping hurdles like mountains.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d As he caught her chin, his fingers pressed against that mark he\u2019d left on her throat, the impression of his teeth, the suction of his heated mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t try to act more experienced than you are. I know you\u2019re scared to death and putting on a brave face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d She swallowed against his touch. \u201cI want you, Ben. I know you want me.\u201d She dared herself, closing her hand over the front of his slacks.</p><p>He caught her wrist immediately, but she\u2019d tightened her grip, feeling the shape and weight of him. Holy God. He really was...enormous. Her gaze flicked back up to his face. She saw a coldness there that would have sent an icy shiver through her if not for that overwhelming heat in her hand.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet your slave give you release. Let me suck on you, bring you to climax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Chrissakes, Marcie. I\u2019m a decade older than you.\u201d He pushed her away.</p><p>\u201cNine years. Not so much difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes all the difference in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon says you have the emotional maturity of a thirteen-year-old, so I\u2019m technically older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon is a New Age geek...ass,\u201d Ben retorted.</p><p>They both paused. Marcie blinked. Her lips curved, tremulously. Ben swore, but his own mouth twisted wryly. \u201cFuck, this is a mess.\u201d</p><p>Not from where she was standing, but she stayed quiet, recognizing the turning point where the negotiator had to stand back and let the client argue with himself, reach the appropriate conclusion. At least she hoped that was what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cNo more of this shit at the office,\u201d he told her sternly. \u201cI mean it, Marcie. You won\u2019t be doing your internship here if you keep pushing it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She bristled at being scolded like a child, given that she could tell he was still impressively aroused, but she suppressed the dangerous urge to point it out. Instead, she gave him a short nod. \u201cOkay.\u201d She kept the fingers of her other hand crossed, behind her back.</p><p>He studied her, sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about what?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a narrow look. \u201cI\u2019ll think about taking you to a club. Not as your Master. As your mentor. Make sure you know what you\u2019re doing, show you around, keep you safe. That\u2019s not a definite yes. I may wake up tomorrow and change my mind. You\u2019ll just have to live with that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t nod, didn\u2019t give anything away, agree or disagree. Her fingers were a damp knot. Faster than she could anticipate, he reached behind her, yanked her wrist to the front.</p><p>\u201cFinger crossing? Really?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, knowing she was flushed to the roots of her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s a universally accepted escape clause for untenable verbal agreements.\u201d</p><p>Ben stared at her a heart-pounding moment. Then a devastating grin crossed his face. Her pussy dampened again, telling her she\u2019d have to seek a panty liner in the women\u2019s room of the main bathroom or she\u2019d soak through her panties and skirt, right onto the cushion of her office chair. Particularly since she\u2019d be thinking for the rest of the day about what had been done here, what tinder had been lit.</p><p>\u201cThat mouth of yours is going to be your undoing, little girl.\u201d He stepped back. \u201cI want you back at your desk. I have work to get done, and so do you. You don\u2019t get to shirk it because of this. Since HR made you my personal slave for the next thirteen days, I plan to take full advantage.\u201d</p><p>He stepped out, shutting the door firmly behind him. She wondered if he had any idea of the images that one potent word had conjured in her mind.</p><p>\u201cI sure hope so,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She had the reckless bravado and stalwart courage of her sister, despite her lack of experience. He could cut through that shit pretty quick\u2014 break her down and leave her in tears. Which was when Lucas would kill him, rightly so. Even if she seemed to be begging for such rough treatment.</p><p>Marcella Ann Moira. Marcella meant young warrior, and damn if that didn\u2019t fit. She reminded him of Eowyn in The Two Towers, disguised as a man on the battle line, shaking in her armor but still screaming out \u201cDeath\u201d with all the veterans. She wasn\u2019t backing down on this. Goddamn it.</p><p>Okay. He shifted in his chair, considered the view of downtown New Orleans, an assortment of rooftops and brick buildings, an old cathedral tower rising in the distance. She was a submissive. He wasn\u2019t going to argue an indisputable fact. And fuck him, one aspiring to be full hardcore, though he didn\u2019t much care for that word when it came to Marcie. Everything about her was soft, sweet, tempting. Too tempting. A sweet, tempting masochist who wanted pain as part of her pleasure. You pinched the places that you\u2019d whipped, made them hurt more. It only made me hotter... Christ.</p><p>She was right, no matter how unsettling hearing the truth had been. With her being a natural sub, and having that curious mind, it wasn\u2019t a surprise she\u2019d figured out they were all Doms. She\u2019d had a crush on him young, so the current fixation was normal, particularly with her exploring the way of it. It might make sense to take her to a club, show her the ropes\u2014figuratively, not literally\u2014give her some tips, guide her. Maybe even facilitate a pairing with a young Dom he trusted to help guide her. Then he\u2019d leave it there, let her continue her life\u2019s journey.</p><p>Shit, and maybe he\u2019d go live in a swamp like Yoda, Great Jedi Master, content with what he\u2019d taught his student. Go forth, young Grasshopper. What a load of bullshit. He rubbed a hand over his face. His cock was still settling, but the slightest provocation would have it at the ready again. He could jerk off in the bathroom, but he didn\u2019t trust himself with her this close. Hell, he didn\u2019t trust her. She wanted to suck him off. He\u2019d given her a wrenching orgasm, and within seconds her eyes had been back on his cock, because she hadn\u2019t done what a sub needed to do to feel complete. She hadn\u2019t serviced her Master.</p><p>It was his own fault. When he\u2019d yanked her into the bathroom, he\u2019d let the Master take over, responding to her exactly as he would a sub displaying that kind of behavior. Trouble was, she\u2019d more than held her own. He wanted to berate himself for an error in judgment, but the problem was, it didn\u2019t feel that way.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. Bottom line, he couldn\u2019t do this. She might get exactly what she was asking for. There was a reason he chose experienced, hardcore subs, ones well-trained in extreme submission. He liked cracking those hard nuts, finding the inner core they thought was impregnable, and taking it to an even deeper level. He was after a woman\u2019s soul. That was the challenge when he did a scene. But after that mission was accomplished, he let go of the soul, as easy and gentle as he\u2019d been hard and ruthless when pulling it out of its fortress. He had no desire to keep it for his own.</p><p>You\u2019re a conqueror. You conquer and move on, never finding true contentment. Jon\u2019s words of course.</p><p>He needed to be the adult here. A thirteen-year-old\u2019s maturity or not\u2014he was so getting even with Jon for that one\u2014he was going to rein himself back.</p><p>The problem was Marcie had no appreciation for his restraint.</p><p>Mini-cake donuts covered with white powdered sugar, fresh from the local bakery, were one of his favorite indulgences. Apparently Alice had told Marcie that, because the next morning she arrived with a box. He detected the aroma the moment she set it down on her desk, along with a coffee for him. Glancing up from his laptop, he saw she\u2019d worn a longer skirt today, but it held her tight from waist to just below the knee, with a little flare to the skirt at the bottom when she walked.</p> <p>He\u2019d seen Cass wear a similar style, and it made Lucas just as batshit as Ben felt now. It triggered something in an alpha male, seeing a woman wearing something sexy that also hampered her movement, making her easier prey to catch. It also gave her a hell of a walk, lots of shifting curves and provocative movement.</p><p>She wore a scoop-necked shell blouse in a pale tan color. No necklace, but simple silver earrings. Was she keeping her neck bare on purpose, cognizant he still held her collar? He wouldn\u2019t put it past her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d She paused at the door, giving him a smile. She was holding his coffee and two of the donuts on a napkin. When he met her gaze, acknowledging her, she lowered her lashes, sending a shot straight to his groin. As she crossed his carpet, her heel hooked one of the fibers, putting a brief hitch in her step. She stopped, lifted it free carefully to make sure she wasn\u2019t taking any fibers with her, then she was on the move again.</p><p>When she rounded his desk to set the coffee and donuts next to his elbow, he saw some of the sugar had gotten on her breast during that jerk in her step. It was right above the scoop neckline. When she bent to put the donuts and coffee down, the blouse shifted, giving him a brief glimpse down the front, to the barely there bra that seemed to be a lot of lace and sheer tan mesh.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t one of her calculated tricks, not this morning. She seemed oblivious to the sugar, was already talking about the day\u2019s work. He\u2019d left her a shitload to get done yesterday, not holding back in the least. Part of it was him wanting to do right by her, give her the most out of her internship, because she did take the job seriously and the opportunities and experience it could provide her. His other hope was that the work would keep her out of trouble. Off car hoods.</p><p>Right now, giving him a status on the work she\u2019d finished, she was obeying him to the letter. A hundred percent professional, going a hundred miles a minute. While that white powder was teasing him like crack to an addict, stark and tempting against the curve of flesh.</p><p>He had a full plate today. He\u2019d be out of the office at a meeting with Matt and Lucas for most of it. No time to play. But there was always time for the important things.</p><p>Touching the remote on his desk, he heard the door swing close and lock, but he kept his eyes on her. She stopped in mid-sentence, brown eyes widening as he turned his chair toward her, set his hands to her waist and brought her between his knees. She was still holding the hot coffee.</p><p>\u201cPut it down on the desk,\u201d he ordered. She complied, her simple obedience a sweet drug. Pulling the blouse free from her waistband, he slid his hands beneath it, along that soft skin. She kept her hands lifted, clear, so there was no impediment to what he wanted.</p><p>When he reached the bra cups, he curved his palms over them, squeezed to make her breasts swell up over the neckline. Leaning in, he inhaled that powdered donut and coffee smell. Then he licked away the sugar. She strangled on a breath as he took his time with it, tracing a pattern on her quivering skin. He was tempted to dip down into the bra cup, find her nipple with the curl of his tongue, but he reined himself back. She was swaying on her heels when he sat back, savoring the taste of sugar on his tongue. \u201cFix your blouse, Marcie.\u201d</p><p>He was satisfied to see her a little dazed and fumbling. \u201cSounds like you have a full day ahead,\u201d he commented casually. \u201cEverything you\u2019re doing is fine. Have those three documents on my desk by day end for review.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d A flick of those lashes showed him a quick glimpse of her bemused eyes before she lowered them. When she backed out of the space, she\u2019d recovered enough to add even more of a fuck-me-now sway to that mouthwatering backside, though he noticed she was a little wobbly on her heels. The combination made him hard as a rock. Might be good he was spending most of the day offsite, or he\u2019d be in excruciating pain by lunchtime.</p><p>\u201cThat skirt\u2019s so tight there can\u2019t be any panties under it.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder, her brow lifting. The sparkle was back in her gaze. \u201cIt would ruin the line of the skirt over my absolutely perfect ass, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehave,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cOr else you\u2019ll get that ass smacked, and it won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lips curved, completely unrepentant. He had the urge to grin at her like a feral wolf. Jesus, he was losing his mind. He was mentoring her. That was what this was. He\u2019d told her as much yesterday. Or rather, he\u2019d told her he\u2019d think about it. He\u2019d also told her to cut this shit out in the office. It wasn\u2019t like him to send mixed signals, and with an already difficult, headstrong sub, that was a recipe for trouble. Of course, with the heat boiling in his balls, he was working his way up to craving some serious trouble.</p><p>\u201cMr. Kensington, Mr. Adler.\u201d Composed now, at least on the surface, she smiled as Matt and Lucas came into Ben\u2019s area, ready to head offsite with him.</p><p>Yeah, just as soon as I get rid of this raging hard-on.</p><p>Lucas gave her a snort, a lifted brow. \u201cMr. Adler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a professional office environment.\u201d Marcie gave him a cheeky grin. \u201cI have to behave. Ben says so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s a first for everything.\u201d Lucas looked toward Ben. \u201cIt must be a trick. I\u2019ve never known you to be a good influence on anyone. Especially an impressionable young girl.\u201d</p><p>Was he really that bad? He bit back a scowl at the second reference to his dark reputation in less than a day. Jesus, you\u2019d think he raided convents.</p><p>\u201cWoman,\u201d Marcie said, an edge to her voice. When Lucas glanced back at her, she held onto that polite mask, but her next words were a direct, kick-in-the-balls contrast. \u201cC-cup, vibrator in my nightstand drawer, and I can drink you under the table in tequila shots.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so maybe that one was his fault. He\u2019d revved her up not only with the sugar thing, but with what had happened yesterday. Though the look on Lucas\u2019 face was worth money, another instinct took precedence now.</p><p>\u201cMarcella.\u201d</p><p>The sharp edge of command was in his voice, cutting across anything Lucas had been about to say. Marcie\u2019s gaze snapped to his desk, a startled look on her face.</p><p>\u201cThat was disrespectful. I\u2019m disappointed in you. Apologize.\u201d</p><p>She flushed, but he\u2019d been looking for a particular reaction, testing those waters further. He got it. He saw the chagrin, that pained response a slave had when she disappointed her Master. Her hands slipped off the desk, folded in her lap, and she bowed her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Adler,\u201d Ben corrected her. \u201cThat\u2019s what he is here.\u201d</p><p>Even as he said it, he imagined her dream again. Her lips wrapped around Lucas\u2019 dick as he ate his wife\u2019s pussy. Marcie on her knees, servicing him at Ben\u2019s command. Ben\u2019s slave entirely, to do with as he wished.</p><p>Mentoring. He was mentoring.</p><p>\u201cMr. Adler.\u201d Marcie\u2019s voice was a near whisper, but he didn\u2019t have to correct her this time. She cleared her throat, repeated it, more loudly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Lucas\u2019 gray eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cDiscipline,\u201d Matt said mildly. He exchanged a look with Lucas that said whatever this was, they weren\u2019t talking it out here. The Kensington CEO moved his shrewd dark gaze to Ben. \u201cAre you ready? We\u2019ve got about fifteen minutes to get there. And Marcie?\u201d</p><p>She looked up then, her expression still wary.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You probably can drink Lucas under the table in tequila shots. He\u2019s always been a lightweight.\u201d</p><p>She dimpled, though she stole a glance at Ben. He\u2019d picked up his laptop case, was acting as he always acted now, and he saw her register it, her shoulders ease, though there was still a cautious set to them. He\u2019d taken her off balance with that one, but she\u2019d responded to him on instinct, responded to him as her Master, over and above the other two Doms present. He didn\u2019t know if that made things better or worse. Probably worse, because now he also had to deal with those two Doms. Particularly one of them, who looked as if he was deciding whether they needed to head for their meeting or make a brief stop in an alley to leave Ben\u2019s bleeding and broken body there.</p> <p>\u201cI need a few minutes to give my assistant direction for the day,\u201d he said casually, meeting Lucas\u2019 level stare. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I meet you in the car?\u201d</p><p>Matt nodded. \u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p><p>Ben made a gesture of assent as Lucas gave him a Get the hell downstairs so we can talk this out look, then followed.</p><p>Once they were gone, Ben came out to her area, braced his knuckles on her desk. Marcie\u2019s cheeks were still stained that attractive red. He wondered if her ass would be the same color after he went after it. Leaning down, he watched her press her lips together as he got close to her mouth, stopped short to meet her gaze close up. \u201cThat vibrator better stay in the nightstand unless I tell you that you can use it. I want you hot, wet and suffering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to take me to a club?\u201d He saw that little flash of defiance, the high set of her chin. He had just the thing for that. A five-inch-width collar that locked into place under the jaw, making her hold it at that defiant angle until her neck ached and she remembered better manners. Alternatively, Peter had shown him an intriguing rope bondage design\u2014the \u201chaughty pose\u201d\u2014where the slave could be tied in a way that forced her to hold her head up until she was begging to bow it down in a deferential manner. Choices, choices.</p><p>Jesus, he needed to stop thinking about this stuff, or he\u2019d have a lot more to explain to Lucas as he hobbled to the car with his briefcase and massive erection.</p><p>\u201cTaking you to a club is my decision. I\u2019ll let you know when I make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember what I said,\u201d she returned, giving him a glare. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to be my Master, you don\u2019t get to say what I put in my pus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether I take you to a club has a lot to do with whether I think you can follow direction, obey a Master as you should, or if you\u2019re just a spoiled brat who thinks you can keep running things. No Master wants a slave like that. I won\u2019t be your Master, but I will be your mentor. If you show me you can behave. Those are my terms. No revisions, no loopholes, no games. If you can\u2019t handle that, collect your stuff, take your fuck-me-now slut attitude, and get out of this office.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t flush this time. The color drained out of her face, her cheeks paling. He\u2019d startled her, hurt her. He\u2019d intended it. His gut told him that was the way to go, except he wasn\u2019t sure if his intent was to drive her away, crush her spirit or test her mettle. He wouldn\u2019t question himself in front of her though. He held her gaze, waiting to see the outcome, even while that gut twisted, telling him he was a complete and total bastard.</p><p>No newsflash there.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at all sure of this Ben, this cruel side. But one thing she did know. He\u2019d spoken to her like a Master in front of Lucas and Matt. No, she hadn\u2019t had much experience, but every time he exercised this side of himself, it resonated somewhere in her, in shadowed corners that were waiting for the right touch, the right motivation, to rouse that natural response in her.</p><p>Earlier, she\u2019d known to counter his will with defiance. However, this was a true chastisement. She\u2019d pushed things too far, showing her ass in front of Lucas and Matt and now him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master.\u201d She lowered her gaze to the desk, feeling the strange need to push back tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I disappointed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me sir. I\u2019m not your Master.\u201d But there was a pause there, making her wonder if that was what he really wanted to say. \u201cGo into my office, to my desk. Pull your skirt up over that bare ass, spread your legs. Bend over, your nose and hands an inch above the wood. Do it quick. I only have five minutes and I don\u2019t want to be late to this meeting.\u201d</p><p>He was brusque, glancing at his watch. She moved on jerky legs, but she hurried into the office, did as he said. It took some effort to get her skirt up to her waist, but it sort of underscored his point about its tightness, didn\u2019t it? Bending down, nose to desk. Holding it that way required some precision, a little stress on the muscles. The air from the air conditioning vent in the ceiling put gooseflesh on the small of her back, her buttocks. She had brought panties. She just hadn\u2019t worn them. They were tucked in the top desk drawer.</p><p>The door closed, the locks clicked into place. The tendons of her calves quivered, making her heels wobble. Because of the shoes\u2019 height and her position, her ass was tilted up, exposing everything between her legs. As she imagined what he was seeing, the spiral of anxiety and arousal in her lower belly grew tighter.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes and open your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She did. What felt like a rubber ball was wedged past her teeth. He cupped her skull to hold her steady, allowing him to push it in that space, because it was so large it pressed down on her tongue, held it fast, held her mouth open. He hadn\u2019t used a cloth behind it, so saliva immediately began to pool around the ball. She would be drooling on his desk, nothing to stop the embarrassment of that, unless she disobeyed him and tried to wipe it away.</p><p>When her fingers flexed, uncertain, his hands covered them, curled them into closed fists, hovering just above the desk surface. Her stomach muscles were tight, holding herself in the position, and it wouldn\u2019t take long for them to start to ache. Ben would have made a hell of a teacher in an old-fashioned one-room school. She\u2019d misbehave every day for his punishment.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t make any contact with my desk. Keep your nose and hands where they are. As I do each stroke, you count it off with your fingers. It\u2019ll be ten.\u201d</p><p>She was breathing hard against that ball. Her fists trembled in their suspended position. A trickle of response slid down her thigh.</p><p>\u201cLittle slut,\u201d he muttered. She reveled in hearing that hoarseness in his voice. That impressive cock was baseball-bat hard, she was sure of it. If only he\u2019d let her go down on her knees, suck him off. She could make him come in five minutes. It would make her impossibly hot, knowing he was at his meeting with Matt and Lucas, her lipstick marking his cock. She\u2019d savor the taste of him in her mouth for hours, the abrasion at the corners she was sure his thick size would cause. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d removed something from the walk-in closet, and she caught it in the corner of her eyes. It was a short, slim cane, no more than ten inches long, perhaps made of carbon. Not so intimidating, but she revised that opinion as the first strike landed. Fuck. Like most canes, it hit fast and was gone, but the pain zinged through all her nerves.</p><p>She bit down on the ball in shock and pain. There was no titillation in this, no soft flogger that hit with a nice slap and teasing sting. She\u2019d played with one of those in her dorm room, one she\u2019d made out of nylon rope, imagining him using it on her.</p><p>\u201cCount it, Marcie.\u201d</p> <p>She managed to get the first finger out. She was pretty sure she was losing her mind, because she chose her middle finger. Damn it, he wasn\u2019t going to break her, or scare her off, or...</p><p>He chuckled, a dangerous threat. \u201cYou just doubled it, sweetie, and I don\u2019t have time to slow it down. You better keep up with the count, or I\u2019ll triple it. I plan to leave pretty welts on that rebellious ass of yours.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think. She tried to push up off the desk. His hand clamped down on the back of her neck, and he pushed her cheek down to the desk surface, locking her down, like a schoolmaster holding down a naughty, struggling student in truth. She snarled against the ball, but it was too big for her to spit it out. Then she had no room to think, because he lived up to his word.</p><p>Two, three, four...in rapid succession, striping over her ass in different places, setting her skin on fire. She started shuddering on number five, her fingers fluttering out on the one hand, palm pressed hard to the desk because she couldn\u2019t balance herself with that powerful hand on her nape. He allowed it. She was crying out against the ball gag with each stroke, no way to bite it back. Her toes curled in her shoes.</p><p>\u201cLift up against my hand. Don\u2019t you tuck down like a beaten dog.\u201d</p> <p>She arched her back, thrust her buttocks up defiantly, screamed as another blow landed. Six...seven, eight, nine... Teeth sunk into that rubber, saliva marking her chin, ass high in the air, legs spread. Every muscle clenched like iron against the pain, she nevertheless got her palms back up where he\u2019d told her to put them, even as he held her face down. She\u2019d show him she could do it. Oh God, there were ten more to go.</p><p>She howled at the eleventh stroke, a direct slap against her labia. Her legs gave out, the pain overcoming her, but he caught her by the waist, her abused buttocks abraded by the summer wool of his slacks. But it also pushed his erection between them, against her throbbing pussy, making her whimper. She tried to rub, she couldn\u2019t help herself.</p><p>\u201cUh-uh, none of that. You\u2019ll get your cream on my clothes. Be still or you\u2019ll get the other nine now.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, because hell, she didn\u2019t think she could do nine more, now or later. He guided her palms down to the desk surface, did a quick stroke and tug over her mussed hair. \u201cStay in the position you\u2019re in. Keep your eyes closed.\u201d</p><p>She heard him move around his desk, unlock a drawer, come back. Then she swallowed against the gag as a smooth and thick plug was pushed into her pussy, worked in and out a few times, then removed to be inserted into her ass instead.</p><p>\u201cFigured you\u2019d have enough honey to lube that up.\u201d She made a wordless plea as another plug was inserted back into her cunt, with a piece on the outside that closed over her clit. She felt straps dangling against the backs of her legs, then they were run up between them, and around her waist, cinched tight so all of a sudden she felt those plugs held deeper, more securely.</p> <p>\u201cA little chastity device to keep you from playing with what\u2019s not yours, hmm?\u201d Ben pulled her skirt down, a functional tug, gave her ass a firm smack. \u201cKeep your eyes closed until you hear me leave. That to-do list better be finished before I get back today, or I\u2019ll add another ten to the nine you owe me.\u201d</p><p>His footsteps, moving away. The door opening, then closing, the sound of him voice dialing Johnson\u2019s office, telling them they were on their way, his voice steady, authoritative. It was as if he weren\u2019t the least affected, though she knew he was. He was just that damn much in control. Marcie waited until she couldn\u2019t hear his voice any longer, then she cracked open her eyes. He\u2019d left the handkerchief he carried in his coat neatly folded up near her hand to wipe her mouth...and the tears.</p><p>The considerate gesture against the ruthless nature of what he\u2019d just done took her breath, almost made her knees buckle. She\u2019d imagined so many things...but she hadn\u2019t imagined this. He sent her spinning from one direction to another so effortlessly. She\u2019d known she was in over her head, but this was like being at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyss.</p><p>As crazy wild as all this was, she was sure of one thing. She wanted more. He claimed to be acting as her mentor, but that wasn\u2019t the way she was viewing it. This was a job audition, and she was going to prove exactly what she\u2019d said she would. That she was the slave he needed, that she could handle everything he dished out.</p><p>Though that had certainly been more than she\u2019d ever experienced before. When she moved, she winced at the light movement of fabric over her ass. Removing the gag, she moved to the full length mirror in his closet, where he kept spare changes of clothes. Holding her skirt at her waist, she twisted around to look at her abused flesh.</p><p>Holy God. It was not only red, but she could see the individual marks of the cane, short lines, welts. It should horrify her. Instead, it made her pussy clench against that thick plug he\u2019d put there, her anus contract on the other one. That night at Surreal, he\u2019d left marks like this on the three women. Ben was a sadist who enjoyed exploring the top limits of pain. He wanted the women who served him to earn the pleasure he gave them. It was all tied up together. She thought she would endure almost anything for that. Her body was vibrating with stress, shock...and raging desire.</p><p>He\u2019d put a chastity device on her, so she\u2019d keep herself only for him, preventing not only the touch of other men, but her own touch. Her body was his, not hers.</p><p>She fixed her hair, her face, did some deep breathing. Nothing seemed to steady her hands. The plugs were short, so she could move in them, but that clit piece was sheer torture, rubbing against her as she walked. It wouldn\u2019t move enough to make her come, but she\u2019d remain hyperaware of the desire to fuck, to be fucked, to have an orgasm that would shake the foundations of the building with her screaming.</p> <p>He\u2019d left something else at her desk. A small pillow. Like the handkerchief, the gesture made her smile, squeezed her heart. But when she lowered herself to it gingerly, she came back up just as fast. That was when she saw the note he\u2019d left on her desk.</p><p>\u201cSit on this to reinforce the lesson. Else you\u2019ll be thinking too much of misbehaving. No perching on the edge. Square in the middle. If you need to go to the ladies\u2019 room, you may remove what\u2019s necessary, but then the plugs go right back in.\u201d</p><p>Passing her hand over the pillow, she felt the tiny pricks through the fabric, like a vampire glove. Not long enough to penetrate skin, but enough to make it feel as if she were being stuck with pins.</p><p>Holding white-knuckled to the edge of the desk, she lowered herself onto it. When the barbs dug into her tender ass, she suppressed a groan. She could do this. She could. Though she really wished he\u2019d given her a different punishment, like writing I will not sass Master a million times.</p><p>A desperate smile crossed her face. No, that wasn\u2019t Ben\u2019s style. He wasn\u2019t treating her like a child. That was what was important. He was making a point. If she couldn\u2019t handle this, she needed to give up now.</p><p>She took steadying breaths, picking up the file she was going to review, the first thing on his to-do list for her. Every minute movement of her body shifted her against that pillow, renewed the agony. One small mercy\u2014the plug for her pussy and the covering for her clit protected those more tender tissues. Though her outer labia were pricked, the clit and inner petals were protected.</p><p>Despite the fact she had no idea how she was going to endure this for the hours he was gone, she was all too aware of the fact she was soaking wet. All she wanted to do was hump herself against the clit piece until she came, screaming through the pain and pleasure.</p><p>Yeah, she was twisted. Twisted for him, willing to endure anything for him, just for the right to call him Master to his face. She used his handkerchief to wipe away the tears that kept falling from her eyes, the result of stress and shock. Her mascara was wasted today.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Master,\u201d she whispered, looking toward his office. \u201cYou won\u2019t break me.\u201d</p><p>At least not that way. Not until the breaking had to do with him accepting her as his slave, now and forever, and breaking her down so that she could surrender to him utterly.</p><p>She was well aware that wasn\u2019t the most difficult problem she faced though. Could she make him believe she truly loved him? Even more challenging, could she get him to realize that he loved her? Because he did. She was sure of it.</p><p>I know it\u2019s silly, but I love hand writing letters. How many emails do you think they\u2019ll find in the future, versus packets of love letters people have kept in their treasure boxes, tied up with ribbon? A dried, pressed flower in between them, the fading scent of perfume where a woman offered a man her scent? Plus, I think better when I write it out, and I like the way cursive looks. I could be one of those monks who did the calligraphy and hand printed each book.</p><p>Marcie, letter to Ben, sophomore year</p><p>(in cursive, on elegant, scented stationery)</p><p>Not silly. Little things matter far more than big ones. We remember them longer. We can\u2019t control the big things, brat. If you think about what\u2019s happened in the past, it will be the small moments that come to the forefront, not the big transitions. The big things were just history. The small moments are yours. The books those monks printed are still preserved centuries after they were gone. Little things matter.</p><p>Ben\u2019s reply</p><p>(in block print, on preschool writing practice paper, oversized and lined)</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cYou going to explain what the hell that was?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas asked the question as soon as Ben got in the limo. Matt had already lifted the privacy screen between them and Tobias, their driver.</p><p>Ben wished he\u2019d figured out some credible way to meet them there. He needed some space, big time. But his ability to keep every hair in place during a shit storm was one of the reasons Matt paid his exorbitant salary. So he sat square across from the K&amp;A CFO, met his cool stare with one of his own. \u201cYou know exactly what that was.\u201d</p><p>Marcie might claim not to know what Cass had told Lucas, but Ben knew. Cass wouldn\u2019t keep secrets from her Master, no more than Dana would. Though Lucas had reacted with aggression to what had happened upstairs, surprise at Marcie\u2019s behavior hadn\u2019t been part of it. So he knew Marcie was a submissive. He probably didn\u2019t know whom she\u2019d decided, come hell or high water, her Master was going to be.</p><p>Jesus, she was a headstrong brat. He couldn\u2019t believe that middle-finger maneuver\u2014he\u2019d barely been able to strangle back the laugh. But what sobered him, inflamed him, was knowing she was sitting her sore ass on that barbed pillow, obeying his every order. Every order except not to think of him as her Master. It made his gut twist in an unusual way, a way he didn\u2019t like.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas said, after a considering pause. That was Lucas. Like Jon, always thinking it through before shooting off his mouth, even when his emotions were involved. \u201cBut seeing you do it in the office, and with my wife\u2019s little sister? That\u2019s fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so? She\u2019s pretty much a blood-deep sub. She responds to it, in the office or out. It was instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Ben?\u201d Matt was sprawled out in the opposite corner, looking as usual like a very well-dressed hawk, the sharp eyes missing nothing, the lazy power of the body suggesting he could strike for the kill in less than a heartbeat. But that was in business negotiations. This was a look Ben knew. Matt was the only one who could make him squirm, even if Ben would rather key his own car than show it.</p><p>His jaw set. \u201cShe\u2019s asked me to be her mentor. Show her how it works. She\u2019s ready to find a Dom, enter the scene. She hasn\u2019t really done that yet, right?\u201d He arched a brow toward Lucas, got a reluctant lip curl that admitted it. When it loosened something in his gut, he chose to ignore the inexplicable reaction. \u201cI was one of her first real crushes, so it makes sense she\u2019s hooked on me for that role.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was a misdirect, but he was the one member of the pack most likely to get away with some minor dissembling. He was damn good at concealing his hand when he needed to do so. From Matt\u2019s sharp glance, he could tell he didn\u2019t quite pull it off, but Lucas seemed to be mulling it over.</p><p>Her pussy had been soaking wet when he slid that chastity device in place, cinching it up good to keep her from playing with herself. He knew she\u2019d do it up just as tight after any trips to the restroom. She\u2019d follow his direction to the letter, until that pretty ass of hers was a raw mess and she was crying in her chair from the pain, all while hard at work on those files. Which was why he\u2019d left a folded and sealed note with Janet to give to Marcie thirty minutes after their departure. It would tell her to replace the barbed cushion with the bed pillow from his private closet, where he kept linens for all-nighters.</p><p>Those happened more often these days, even when he didn\u2019t really have to work late. He\u2019d dick around over this or that email, but then end up sitting on the couch, sipping his whiskey. He\u2019d watch the lights of the New Orleans\u2019 business district slowly wink out until all that were left were the lights of apartment hallways, the dwellings over the businesses. Lights shining on nothing, because people had gone to bed, leaving the small hours of the mornings to people like him.</p><p>He turned his mind back to how badly her ass would be hurting from that punishment. He imagined laying her out on his couch tonight, putting cloth strips of cool balm on those luscious cheeks. He\u2019d spread her hair over her bare shoulders, stroke through it, caressing the silken skin beneath while she lay completely still, on his orders. Her hair was lustrous thick and curled some, so it curved over her shoulders and lay just the right way to catch a man\u2019s eye, make him think about the way it would feel on his skin. Particularly when he was moving her on a direct line down his chest and stomach to take care of his cock with her pretty mouth, the wet heat of her eager tongue.</p><p>Her aftercare would be as tender as the punishment had been ruthless. It was always a balance, one that broke down a certain type of woman\u2019s shields, cracked open her emotions, kept her spinning and in touch with her raw feelings, no dissembling, nothing but pure, honest reaction.</p><p>Lucas shifted, drawing him out of his thoughts and irritating him further. His mind was wandering around like a damn cow grazing in a pasture. Matt cocked a brow in his direction, that gaze still way too sharp, but when he spoke, he wasn\u2019t addressing Ben. \u201cYou okay with this, Luc?\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced out the window, a muscle flexing in his jaw. His index finger was tapping a slow, pensive beat on the car door. Not a great sign, but not Def Con 1 either. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together a long time, Ben. I know things about you. I know you push hard. Your way of handling a sub...it\u2019s what they want, you prove that over and over, and so there\u2019s no reason I should doubt your judgment, but Marcie...hell.\u201d</p><p>Since Ben had stepped into the car, he\u2019d had his shields up, ready to ward off any frontal assault. Just like that, seeing Lucas\u2019 worry, the focus changed. They\u2019d been part of one another\u2019s lives too long. Beyond that, when Lucas had claimed Cass as his own, she and all her siblings had come under their protection and care. He wouldn\u2019t deflect, not when it came to that side of things.</p><p>\u201cYou feel responsible for her.\u201d Ben inclined his head. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the best at reading people of all of us. But you\u2019re not objective about this one. I can be, to a certain extent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Matt said quietly. \u201cNeither should you. We all know how important family is, particularly the ones we create for ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Matt had tapped on that door of his psyche on purpose he was sure, a reminder of the darkness behind it. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying,\u201d Ben responded evenly, with effort, \u201cis she\u2019s at the beginning of it, but that doesn\u2019t mean the signs aren\u2019t there. She\u2019s a 24/7, Luc. Rachel\u2019s got a gentle form of that, the way she defers to Jon even in front of others, but Marcie craves the hardcore brand of it.\u201d</p><p>He knew what that would look like. When she came home from work, she\u2019d follow a Master\u2019s protocol from the time she walked through the door. He\u2019d have the heat programmed to bump up a couple notches a half hour before she arrived home. Once there, she would shed her clothes, all of them, hang them up. She\u2019d slide on a thong fitted with a small clit stimulator. It would be set on a low vibration to keep her distracted as she moved to do the things she was required to do for her Master. Set the table, light the candles. Put out his dinner.</p><p>Well, the dinner he\u2019d have her heat up, because he preferred to do the cooking. Marcie appreciated good food, but she could burn break-apart Nestle Tollhouse cookies.</p><p>Right before dinner, she\u2019d remove the thong, lie down on the table. At his Garden District townhome, he had a dining room table of glossy cherry wood, with carved legs that looked like a griffin\u2019s feathered and taloned feet, a heavy antique piece that had been created during the Baroque period. She\u2019d brace her feet on the arms of his chair, her spread thighs framing his plate. When he sat down to eat, he\u2019d have the pleasure of seeing that pussy wet and glistening, needy. The candlelight would glint on the clit piercing, and her arousal would give her that sexy little quiver, her nipples high and tight...</p> <p>He\u2019d place one candle in either hand, making her hold them stretched out to either side of her body as he lit them. He\u2019d get the tallow kind with wax drippings, so she\u2019d feel the tiny burn as each drop hit her wrists, her knuckles. When he finished his dinner, he\u2019d eat her pussy until she came. Then turn her over, give her a good paddling that would have her squealing and begging before he slid into that tight little puckered hole, feeling her submission to him, to anything he wanted to do to her. Utter, total surrender of self, belonging to him forever.</p><p>After that, they\u2019d watch TV. She\u2019d curl up next to him naked, tolerate the business reports and his acerbic comments about the idiots in Washington. But then she\u2019d steal the remote and put it on some romantic chick flick she wanted to watch. Maybe she\u2019d be wearing one of his shirts, left open to give her Master access, but allowed because it kept her warm and drowsy. They\u2019d share popcorn and he\u2019d watch her fall asleep against him, her head against his heart. He\u2019d carry her to his bed, and when he was restless in the middle of the night, he\u2019d find her curled around him, arm across his chest, body snugged up so close...</p><p>He was the night owl; she was the morning person. So he\u2019d wake to find her perched like an adorable sex kitten near him, holding his coffee out of reach, teasing him with the aroma. He\u2019d wrestle her for it, carefully, so she didn\u2019t get burned, then when he got it away from her, putting it on the side table, he\u2019d snatch her to him by the waist. She\u2019d straddle him, run her fingers through his hair, smiling, then her mouth would soften and he\u2019d turn her beneath him...</p><p>Someone to wake up with, someone he wanted to see next to him in the morning.</p><p>\u201cBen?\u201d</p><p>He snapped out of it to find Lucas and Matt looking at him like he\u2019d just sprouted a second nose. Thank God he had the briefcase on his lap. As it was, the weight of the damn thing was making his cock hurt like a son of a bitch. He was lucky it wasn\u2019t knocking against it like a door. But that wasn\u2019t what freaking rocked his foundation. He was fantasizing about...nesting with a woman. Holy Christ.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cSorry. Thinking about the meeting.\u201d</p><p>Lucas raised a brow. \u201cYeah right. Subs don\u2019t usually get under your skin. She messing you up?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, the whole family relationship thing threw me for a loop.\u201d Ben forced a casual shrug. Jesus, let me out of this car. I can\u2019t breathe. \u201cI\u2019ve got my feet under me. But it would have helped if you\u2019d let us know you suspected this about her way the hell earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect I didn\u2019t for the same reason you didn\u2019t tell me where you were on it. It wasn\u2019t something I felt comfortable tossing out there. I assumed when she started to actively pursue it, it would be with someone her own age, her own group.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. That hurt more than expected, but it was nothing more than what he\u2019d told her himself. He kept his expression blank.</p> <p>Lucas rubbed a hand over his face, shook his head. \u201cThere were always clues to it, even before we realized it straight out, but of course talking about it when she was underage was a quagmire I wasn\u2019t about to touch. She was sixteen when I came into her life, so she never saw me as a father figure, more as a friend, her sister\u2019s husband. Cass was in charge of keeping an eye on it, helping to direct and manage it in subtle ways. But I figured it out from the way she watched me and Cassandra. Sometimes the way she acted toward me.\u201d</p><p>Ben lasered in on those words. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He sensed Matt\u2019s interested shift, decided he wouldn\u2019t look toward him to see if his curiosity was about what Lucas was saying, or that Ben had just tried to cover a surge of annoyingly possessive heat.</p><p>\u201cNot like she was looking for me to be her Master, but acknowledging me as one, respecting what it means.\u201d Lucas tossed his leather portfolio onto the seat, stretched his arm out on the back of it. \u201cOne night I came out of our bedroom, after I\u2019d worked Cass over pretty good. We\u2019d done laundry earlier and all the washcloths were in the laundry room. I needed one to soak with warm water and put on some of the more tender parts.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved, a Master\u2019s absorption the other two men well recognized. \u201cMarcie was home from college, up late studying in the kitchen. She asked what I needed. When I told her, though of course I didn\u2019t tell her why I needed it, she immediately got up, found a cloth. Soaked it, heated it in the microwave, placed it in a basin then handed it to me with this little nod of her head. She knew exactly why I needed it, and she\u2019d provided it exactly like I\u2019d get a staff slave assist at the club.\u201d</p> <p>Fuck. Ben could see her doing it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just one example. When Marcie was in New York, Cass suggested I let Marcus Stanton and Thomas take her to a few clubs, just to observe. Marcie didn\u2019t tell us about her experiences, but I know she took advantage of the contact. Damn, Ben, you can\u2019t tell me you never noticed. All of us pick up on this shit, and you spent more time with her than anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy focus was elsewhere. I was busy managing the teenage crush thing.\u201d But Lucas was right; the clues had been there when she was in her teens. It had probably crossed Ben\u2019s mind once or twice, given the fact he was a Dom, but it would have been an interesting factoid only: \u201chey, this girl has the tendencies of a natural submissive\u201d. It hadn\u2019t involved him or his role in her life. Until now. He sure as hell hadn\u2019t been prepared to be part of her journey of sexual discovery. Like Lucas, his job had been to prove a male\u2019s presence in her life could be a positive thing.</p><p>\u201cHow deep does it go?\u201d Surprisingly, Matt directed that question not to Lucas, but to Ben. When Ben raised a questioning brow, Matt gave him his no-bullshit look. \u201cThat call-down upstairs says you\u2019re in a better position than either of us to make the assessment.\u201d</p><p>No way was he looking toward Lucas when he answered that one. He also hoped Matt wasn\u2019t going to pry any deeper than that in front of him. But he wouldn\u2019t lie. \u201cShe\u2019s a full-blown masochist. Craves the pain. The right Master could go after her with a fucking baseball bat and she\u2019d still come at his command. She needs strong guidance, training to help her protect herself from that extreme. She\u2019s a lethal combination\u2014as headstrong and adventurous as Dana, but deeper in the psychology of it than even Rachel.\u201d</p><p>When Lucas swore softly, Ben tightened his fingers on the briefcase, even though he tried not to show his tension. Matt shifted his attention to his CFO. \u201cLucas?\u201d</p> <p>The man shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d like to say it surprises me, but it doesn\u2019t. It fits what I know of her personality. The submission is natural, but the degree of it has been affected by her experiences. Her father\u2019s love was unpredictable, weak. She latched onto her older brother, and then he betrayed her as well. It makes sense that she\u2019d need that strong hand, something rock-solid, to open herself up fully.\u201d</p><p>Matt gestured at Lucas. \u201cDon\u2019t sell short the experiences you and Cass have provided her. For at least two years she lived in a household where a healthy Dom/sub dynamic was operating. Your stability, your influence on Cassandra\u2019s sense of self-worth, her confidence as a woman, have been obvious. Those things would have also encouraged Marcie, given her confidence to pursue her own submissive inclinations to a deeper level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCass already accomplished a whole hell of a lot without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo argument there.\u201d Matt waved a hand. \u201cMy point is, I am a better man, more assured of my direction, knowing Savannah is at my side. If I\u2019m the husband and Master I should be, I serve the same purpose for her. I\u2019ve no doubt you do that for Cassandra, because she is a much more relaxed and happy person than she was when we met her.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, this was making him feel heaps better. Ben could be a rock-solid Master, but in the stability and happiness department? Jesus. He cleared his throat, considering a different direction. \u201cHave you picked up on her desire to be...part of the group?\u201d</p><p>While hearing that Marcie was a hardcore sub hadn\u2019t surprised him, Lucas now turned a startled gaze to him. \u201cWe only share a woman, all of us, if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going that way,\u201d Ben said quickly, dispelling that issue before Lucas could react in horror to it, as he was sure he would. \u201cBut we have a different situation here. She may not belong to one of us, but she already has a foot inside the circle, because of the family relationship. She\u2019s been fantasizing about it. If you\u2019re cool with the mentoring, I can keep tabs on it, redirect it if you want. Make sure it doesn\u2019t become a bigger issue. But I wanted to warn you it\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>They rode in unresolved silence for several blocks. True to form, it was Matt who broke it.</p> <p>\u201cThe key to this is you, Ben. You have the lead. You\u2019ll be able to tell us where it needs to go, what needs to happen. We can talk it out once you have a better feel for the situation. Remember, we\u2019re here if you get in over your head.\u201d His dark eyes met Ben\u2019s, again stirring that past shit that Ben really didn\u2019t want dredged up, but of course Matt didn\u2019t let anyone get away with much.</p><p>God, he needed air.</p><p>When they pulled up to their destination, Ben was the first out of the car. He muttered something about needing to see someone in Legal first and that he\u2019d meet them upstairs, then disappeared through the front doors.</p><p>Lucas looked toward Matt. \u201cHe has the lead on this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s right. You\u2019re too close, and in the wrong position to help her embrace her submissive nature. You have to trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. With my life. Not so much with Marcie\u2019s.\u201d Lucas sighed. \u201cYou know his M.O.\u201d</p><p>Matt straightened his cuffs. \u201cBen is one of the most disciplined Masters I\u2019ve ever seen. He never loses control, because he puts all his energy and focus into holding the reins, into getting the sub to give him everything. He\u2019s brutal, going to the edge of edge play. But he always gives a woman the experience of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in return, he takes nothing but the challenge of having broken her down. He doesn\u2019t let her in. Doesn\u2019t let any of them in.\u201d Lucas grimaced. \u201cThe problem is, she\u2019s already inside him, because she\u2019s family. I know what he carries around, and so do you. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a place I want her to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie has been starry-eyed in love with Ben since she first laid eyes on him,\u201d Matt pointed out. \u201cWe all saw it. As improbable as it is that it might have survived the transition from childhood to adulthood, from what I saw this morning, that girlhood crush has become a woman\u2019s passion. It\u2019s possible we\u2019re witnessing the very rare instance when a teenage crush was never a crush at all.\u201d</p><p>Matt\u2019s handheld buzzed with an incoming message. When Matt glanced at it, his lips quirked. Leaning forward, Lucas saw the screen. Not texting you. Bully. He raised a brow, his lips curving.</p><p>\u201cSavannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I told her to text me every so often while she was awake. The last one was \u2018Bite Me\u2019. She\u2019s getting more conciliatory. The first one was \u2018Fascist Asshole\u2019.\u201d Matt shook his head. \u201cI have the housekeeper texting Janet as well, to let me know if she does too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to stab you in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Savannah ever decides to take me out, she\u2019ll do it toe-to-toe while I\u2019m fully conscious.\u201d Matt gazed at the handheld screen fondly, thumb passing over it as if he was caressing the woman sending the barbed missives. \u201cShe\u2019s a mountain lion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Cass. And like Marcie, truth be known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I also know this is hard, Luc.\u201d Matt met his gaze anew. \u201cShe wants in, and she\u2019s determined to get there. It makes sense she chose the man she\u2019s always trusted the most. But yes, Ben has some very dark places in him. For most of his life, he\u2019s kept them buried, but the events of the past few years are opening them up. We\u2019ve all tried various ways of offering our help, but he\u2019s not there yet. I\u2019m not sure what will be the trigger, but if she forces her way into those rooms, eventually he\u2019s going to lose a grip on the reins. It\u2019s possible she\u2019ll get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019 hand tightened on the console between them. \u201cIf Marcie went to him for mentoring, that\u2019s a front. She wants more than that. The mentoring is just all she\u2019s been able to get him to agree to do...so far.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Matt nodded. \u201cBen\u2019s loyalty to you, to us, is unquestioned. If you want to put an end to it right here, right now, you need only tell him. He\u2019d do it, in a heartbeat. But if you\u2019re not going to make that call, you need to let it play out. Sometimes you have to step out of the way and see what Fate decides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. You\u2019ve been talking to Jon.\u201d</p><p>Matt\u2019s lips curved. \u201cNo, but he\u2019s rubbed off on me, as we\u2019ve all rubbed off on each other over the years. It\u2019s time for a change in Ben\u2019s life. He feels it, as do we all. Unfortunately, what we\u2019re suggesting makes Marcie a guinea pig. Normally, I\u2019d trust my gut, take the risk, but this part is your call, Lucas. Yours and Cassandra\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCass will get worked up about it, initially, but in the end she\u2019ll say Marcie\u2019s of legal age. That if what she wants is Ben, she has a right to take her shot. To get hurt like any other adult. But she\u2019ll worry, same as I will. Marcie is so fucking young.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll react if he breaks her heart, even if he\u2019s dealing with his own knee-jerk fight-or-flight instinct. Fair warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll protect her if she needs protecting. We\u2019ve always put the well-being of our women first. It\u2019s in Ben as strong as any of us, for all that he hasn\u2019t found a singular focus for it. Maybe he has now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, wait a minute.\u201d Lucas caught Matt\u2019s arm. \u201cDid you just suggest what I think you suggested?\u201d</p><p>Matt gave him his trademark piercing expression. \u201cHave you ever known him to act this unsettled about any woman? Or ask the question he asked about her being part of the group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it was just a heads-up, because of her fantasies. Not his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not consciously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Lucas sat back. \u201cSeriously? You think this could be going in that direction? I just wrapped my mind around him mentoring her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t swear to it, but I do know when it comes to women, Ben isn\u2019t easily rattled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Matt.\u201d Lucas sighed, ran his hand over his face. \u201cIf it\u2019s true, she will stumble on those dark places. And you know the problem isn\u2019t her inability to handle that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect. The problem is how Ben will handle it. If it\u2019s any comfort, I suspect Marcie already knows a great deal about Ben. She may not be able to withstand the storm, but she knows it\u2019s coming. She\u2019s inviting it, because she trusts somewhere in that maelstrom, she\u2019ll find Ben, and Ben will find himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you have been talking to Jon too much.\u201d</p><p>Matt grinned then. \u201cCare to place a bet? Freaked out because he\u2019s always known Marcie as jailbait, versus freaked out because maybe she\u2019s something more than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I have no choice but to take that bet, as a point of pride and personal comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to take advantage of charitable opportunities. The local animal shelter needs new fencing. Savannah\u2019s already financed it, but she wants me to match it. And adopt the ugliest dog I think I\u2019ve ever seen. I believe it\u2019s the mating between a moose and a sheep. Five thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Lucas muttered. \u201cFine. Five thousand. But no more talk about rubbing off on each other. Gives me some pretty disturbing images.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>The meeting could have been about painting circles on a monkey\u2019s ass for all that Ben really cared about it. Because of that, he sharpened his focus a hundredfold and secured everything Matt wanted from the strategy session, and then some.</p><p>Such obvious proof he was on top of things was validating. It put him in a much better frame of mind. Mentor. He was Marcie\u2019s mentor. Lucas had given his blessing, and that helped. Hell, he\u2019d always liked the brat, and now that she was a hot young woman, it could be enjoyable. He\u2019d help her find the right path in the D/s world, know he\u2019d had a part in bringing her into the full glory of that.</p><p>He\u2019d have to tread easy, be careful, but every interaction with a difficult sub was a chess game. Marcie really wasn\u2019t difficult as much as she was green and headstrong. But she sure had a lot of guts. He liked that. She was also absolutely determined to prove she\u2019d go above and beyond for him.</p> <p>When he had that thought, they were doing the usual shake-hands-while-thinking-what-a-dick ritual, part and parcel of their interactions with this particular negotiations team. Ben stopped in mid-motion. While he jumpstarted his brain enough to finish out the hand shake with Fred Marlton, Ben turned to Matt. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d intended to catch an early dinner, but Matt nodded, reading his set face. \u201cAll right. Take the limo. We\u2019ll walk down to Acme\u2019s to eat.\u201d</p><p>Normally his gut would gripe at missing out on their po\u2019boy sandwich, but his stomach had another issue right now.</p><p>The right Master could go after her with a fucking baseball bat and she\u2019d still come at his command. She needs strong guidance, training to help her protect herself from that extreme... Goddamn. Had he really made such a newbie Dom mistake?</p><p>Taking the stairs, he hit the lobby with a swift, ground-eating stride. Matt had already anticipated him, because the limo was pulling up front. He wished it was Max who was at the wheel instead of Tobias, because Max could get through New Orleans\u2019 business traffic like shit through a goose. However, by unanimous agreement of the K&amp;A team, Max was Dana\u2019s daytime driver for her job as assistant pastor at one of New Orleans\u2019 many old churches. His duties had even expanded to assisting her with some of the church\u2019s programs, like helping with the soup kitchen and doing maintenance on the building.</p><p>It was all right. K&amp;A wasn\u2019t that far. If they hadn\u2019t been running late this morning, they probably would have walked the fourteen blocks.</p><p>As Ben got into his vehicle, he checked his PDA, which he\u2019d kept turned off during the meeting. He bit back an oath.</p><p>One text from Janet, over two hours ago. There\u2019s a problem with your intern. You need to get back here.</p><p>He texted back On my way, and grimaced as he received an immediate reply.</p><p>About time.</p><p>When he arrived at the building, he took the private, coded elevator that went straight to their floor. As he emerged, he saw Janet sitting at her desk, waiting on him, purse at her elbow. Five-fifteen. The meeting had taken all day, fuck it. As she shouldered her bag, she gave him a steady look. \u201cI gave her the note precisely thirty minutes after you left, just as you instructed. We had a busy day here, so I wasn\u2019t aware of the problem until I took her some files at three p.m. That\u2019s when I sent the text. She made me promise not to call and interrupt your meeting, but I was on the verge of breaking that promise when you texted me.\u201d</p><p>He needed to address the hard note in her voice, but of course the most important thing, even in Janet\u2019s opinion, would be to skip the apologies and fix the problem. He\u2019d screwed up.</p><p>His office area was sequestered from the others because he often met with clients and adversaries who didn\u2019t need to be privy to snippets of information overheard in other sections of the office. As he turned the corner, moved down the hall toward his space, he heard her. To most, it wouldn\u2019t be detectable, but when he was in a session with a sub, he was attuned to the slightest indrawn breath, the rise of gooseflesh over fair skin, the tensing of muscles, warning him when she was reaching her limit. This was far beyond that. He quickened his step.</p><p>Tiny sobs, small expulsions of air bitten back. As he reached his reception area, something twisted in his chest. Something different from anything he\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>Marcie was still sitting on that barbed pillow. Her body was quivering as she tried to finish up some memo on her computer. Two out of the three documents he\u2019d left her to prepare were laid out on the side table. They\u2019d be perfect, because she would have re-checked them a couple extra times, taking into account her distracted condition.</p><p>Instead of following his direction, she\u2019d stayed on that pillow all day. Each time she rose to go to the printer, the file cabinet, as she would have had to do numerous times, she\u2019d had to sit back down on it, let the hundreds of barbs stab into those welts anew.</p><p>Her hands were shaking as she typed. She\u2019d apparently long ago stopped trying to stifle her tears, because there were dried tracks on her cheeks beneath the newer ones, tears caused by stress and pain. While her hands were moving, the rest of her body was rigid, trying to minimize any motion that could impact those barbs. She\u2019d still feel their bite with every key typed on the laptop.</p><p>\u201cMarcie.\u201d</p><p>She stopped abruptly but didn\u2019t look at him. Her fingers curled over the keyboard.</p><p>\u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. He knew she couldn\u2019t. But she tried, placing her hands on either side of the computer. Her elbows quivered so hard the desk vibrated. Since there was a small store of office supplies on the desk, the printer pulled closer, at some point she\u2019d stopped getting up. Now the lack of circulation, the prolonged stiff posture, was defeating her efforts to rise. Stubborn, beautiful, pain in his ass.</p><p>Going to her, he turned the chair on its swivel toward him. Clasping her upper arms, he eased her to her feet. When she tried to swallow a pained noise, he cupped her face, turning it up to him. He was tempted to take her head off with a bellow that would scare monks in their temples in the furthest corner of Asia, but he kept his voice even, steady. \u201cI left you an order. To remove that pillow when Janet gave you the note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I had to prove\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d He cut her off with the steel injected in his voice. \u201cA Master told you to do something, and what did you do? You disobeyed. You can call it interpreting, overcompensating, whatever the hell you want, but it\u2019s pure disobedience.\u201d</p><p>She was pale, and he could read her thoughts in the trembling of her body. She thought he might punish her further, and she wasn\u2019t sure how she was going to bear any more pain. But she would. Just to prove to him she could. Christ. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMarcie.\u201d He pushed her head to his chest, curving his hand over the side of her face to hold her there, shelter her. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with that later. Right now, just be easy. Easy, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>A little sigh went out of her, a hiccup. \u201cI love it when you sound Cajun.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were folded in between them, so he tightened his grip, cocooning her. He wanted her to stop shaking, but that was going to take some doing. \u201cWhere\u2019d you put your things? Purse, girly stuff?\u201d</p> <p>She straightened, holding on to him to steady herself, but determined to show him she could do it. When what little color she had drained out of her face, he anticipated the faint. She hadn\u2019t had lunch, hadn\u2019t hydrated herself at all, because her skin was too cool and dry, despite the fact she looked as if she\u2019d perspired quite a bit. She really needed to work on that bad habit of locking her knees.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here we go.\u201d He\u2019d lifted her, carried her to the reception couch. The mere pressure of the seat cushion on her ass was enough to keep her from full unconsciousness. She swayed inside his grip, her brown eyes seeking his face.</p><p>\u201cI messed up, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did. But not as bad as I did. Stay here just a second.\u201d He made sure he was back fast, bringing her a bottle of water from his office fridge, and a pack of peanut butter crackers. \u201cOkay, drink some of this. Slow, just sip it. There you go. Ease back on the couch if you can.\u201d</p><p>It was difficult, her body too stiff, her ass too sore. She was starting to shiver. He was functional, brisk, sliding his hands under the skirt, along her thighs, locating the straps to the two phalluses he\u2019d left inside her. Coiling an arm around her waist, he lifted her enough to work all of it free, then set it aside. She made a small sound as his fingers brushed her pussy, her upper thighs, the rim of her ass, a different kind of shudder going through her.</p> <p>Her cheeks colored over it, but he wasn\u2019t surprised. Given what he knew of her already, the pain and stress wouldn\u2019t have completely overwhelmed the arousal caused by being under a Master\u2019s command, his direction. Being as much of a Dom as she was a sub, he of course couldn\u2019t stop his dumbass cock from hardening.</p><p>Shrugging out of his coat, he put it around her shoulders. Then he lifted her in his arms and took her spot on the couch. When he put her in his lap, he kept her abused ass in the open area between his splayed thighs, bracing her lower back and upper thighs against that vee so she made only nominal contact with the firm cushion\u2014and his groin. Then he brought the water back to her mouth.</p><p>Cupping her hands over his, she met his eyes before her lashes lowered, suggesting that she\u2019d felt his arousal against her hip, but she focused on drinking. For the next fifteen minutes, he didn\u2019t let her speak, just worked on calming her down, getting crackers and fluid into her. At length, she let out a little sigh, rested her head against his chest. Her fingers were curled loosely in his open collar, because he\u2019d pulled off his tie in the limo. Her French manicure was making teasing little scratches against his flesh as she continued to shake.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you say that? That you\u2019d messed up?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cFigures you\u2019d latch on to that.\u201d He was relieved to feel her lips curve in a slight smile against him, but he tipped up her face, held her chin, made her see the serious reproof in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cA hardcore submissive like you, an inexperienced one, tends to go to extremes. You have to be trained to understand a Master\u2019s nature, to respond to it. You don\u2019t know the difference between anticipatory service to a Master and destructive overcompensation. Part of being a Master is knowing how far to push a sub, uncovering what they really need. It\u2019s never about causing them true, lasting physical harm. You were too green for me to leave you unsupervised like that. I knew better.</p> <p>\u201cNow, that said, there\u2019s your side of things.\u201d He gave her delicate jaw a firm squeeze. \u201cA sub\u2019s devotion is shown through obedience, not pushing past the edges of good sense. You have a responsibility to care for yourself. How can you serve a Master if he\u2019s forever having to tend to your injuries?\u201d</p><p>He was angry. Marcie knew his logic was sound, and more than that, she could tell he was angrier with himself than with her. It shamed her, that she\u2019d caused that, but it also revealed a side of him she\u2019d never seen before. It mattered to him, deeply, that she\u2019d hurt herself. She wanted to tell him she understood what he was telling her, that she wouldn\u2019t make the same error twice, but there was something reckless in her when it came to him. She wanted to give him everything. She wanted him to know her soul was his, every part of her. The more it had hurt, the more determined she\u2019d become, until the agony and the yearning were the same thing.</p><p>He tightened his arms around her, letting out a sigh as if he could read her thoughts. \u201cIt was stupid of me to leave you alone. You\u2019re too deep in your head on it. It\u2019s irresistible, but it also means a Master really has to be on his toes with you, to make sure you don\u2019t go overboard.\u201d</p><p>No other Master would ever have to worry about that, because she didn\u2019t feel that way about any other one. She wisely held that thought to herself. For now.</p><p>He told her they were leaving, but not where they were going. He didn\u2019t let her take her laptop with her, making it clear she wasn\u2019t going to be permitted to do any work tonight. Thank goodness she\u2019d finished most of his task list, though it bugged her she hadn\u2019t completed it all, as he\u2019d demanded.</p><p>He had her step out of her shoes and picked them up, looping them over his wrist as they walked to the elevator. He kept his arm around her, holding her steady. They didn\u2019t take his car, the small sports car whose bucket seat she was sure would have been agony to her. Instead, they took a limo from the limo pool. Fortunately, the driver stayed in the car, Ben holding the door for her. When she got in, she saw the privacy screen was raised.</p><p>As she tried to determine how not to sit on her ass, Ben curled his fingers around her upper arm and guided her down onto her stomach on the comfortably long seat. Fortunately, he sat next to her, so she could put her cheek on his thigh and slide one hand under his knee. He smelled good. Heated male, aftershave, soap, dry cleaning for his suit.</p><p>He stroked her back, playing with her bra strap through the thin turtleneck. That intimate touch made her hold her breath. It also stirred things up inside her, crazy as that was in her current condition. But doing what he\u2019d ordered her to do, having that vibrator inside her, had kept arousal a big part of the equation. She could imagine going to her knees in this limo, wrapping her hands around him, putting her mouth on his cock.</p> <p>Her fingers inched up his leg, doing a circle on his inner thigh. She\u2019d give so much to serve him that way, feel him climax, know she\u2019d given him pleasure. It\u2019s irresistible, but it also means a Master really has to be on his toes with you... She wanted to work harder on the irresistible part.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d A soft reproof as he laid his hand over hers. \u201cBe still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to. I want to touch you.\u201d This time she was merely telling him what was in her head, not sassing him. When she stopped, he stroked her hair, a reward for her obedience. She let that be enough, though her body was running hot and cold. It was like being in shock, floating and yet so wired, everything out of control. She couldn\u2019t get her mind around it, but it was okay. He was her Master. He was in control.</p><p>At length, she realized they were outside the city. When they turned off a quiet rural road into a private driveway, she realized where they were. Jon\u2019s house. It was a lot like his second home in Baton Rouge. His driveway was a quarter mile long, winding through a hushed pine forest skirted with thick foliage, so it was never unusual to see wildlife crossing a car\u2019s path. Deer, possum, raccoons, armadillo. The occasional alligator or long, slithering snake.</p><p>While she loved visiting Jon\u2019s, being here now alarmed her. Not as much as if Ben had brought her back to Cass\u2019, but still. She wasn\u2019t sure of his intent. Easing gingerly to her hip, she propped her elbow on his leg to peer through the windows. His face had a set expression, the solid planes shadowed by the night closing in outside and the dim light thrown by the limo\u2019s interior. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to use sir? And do you have permission to ask me a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell when you\u2019re being...Ben and when you\u2019re being a Master.\u201d But that question had its own answer, and she knew it. In her mind, he was always a Master. She treated him as Ben when she was trying to direct things, control them. His sidelong glance told her he already knew that, but it was the first time she\u2019d figured it out. So she wasn\u2019t surprised that he didn\u2019t answer, only waited on her. It was more difficult than she expected. She\u2019d engineered so much of everything that had happened until now. She was afraid if she stopped fighting for what she wanted, let go of the reins, he wouldn\u2019t pick them up. He\u2019d just walk away and she\u2019d lose ground.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask...why are we at Jon\u2019s, sir?\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed together. When he shifted, that heat in her lower belly kindled further. Whether or not he wanted it to happen, her subservience had pleased him. She could tell. \u201cRachel has nurse training in addition to her physical therapy certification. I want her to check you over, make sure you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2014\u201d She bit her lip as he shifted that steady stare to her. She nodded, laid her cheek back down on his leg.</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d But her fingers curled into balls, uncertain.</p><p>The porch light was turned on as they pulled up. Ben had probably told the limo driver to call ahead. She was hoping he\u2019d let her walk, because she\u2019d feel utterly foolish if he carried her. He did let her walk up the stairs, though he carried her to the deck steps since he wouldn\u2019t let her put her shoes back on.</p><p>As she ascended, he was right behind her, hand on the small of her back, fingers grazing the upper rise of her ass until she reached the door. Fortunately, it was Rachel who met them there, her expression warm and welcoming. Though Jon was the most deceptively gentle of the K&amp;A men, she wasn\u2019t sure she could handle the intense scrutiny of two Doms right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMarcie, it\u2019s so good to see you again. Come on in, dearest.\u201d</p><p>Why the affection made tears spring to her eyes, she didn\u2019t know, but Marcie pushed them back, with effort. Rachel\u2019s eyes held so much understanding, a kinship, as if she understood that Marcie was pure chaos right now, emotionally, physically. She and Jon were both into the spiritual chakra stuff. If Rachel read auras, Marcie expected hers probably looked like an LSD-induced kaleidoscope.</p><p>Ben withdrew his hand, a loss she felt everywhere, not just at the small of her back. When her gaze turned to him, he nodded. \u201cYou do as Rachel tells you,\u201d he said. Then he was moving across the spacious living area to Jon. Rachel\u2019s husband and Master was sitting at the kitchen island with the parts of what looked like an old phonograph machine laid out before him, complete with large conical-shaped speaker. A half-eaten dinner was on a plate at his elbow, next to a glass of wine. As Ben was approaching, he was already opening him a beer.</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t speak to Marcie, just glanced at her with that familiar measuring look. She wouldn\u2019t be acknowledged yet. Jon had turned her over to his submissive\u2019s care and would determine her well-being from Ben. Her Master.</p><p>Or at least the one she wanted to call Master, so much she knew it was going to eventually slip from her lips. When she was feeling less vulnerable, she\u2019d do it deliberately. Master, Master. Master. She wasn\u2019t going to let him\u2014</p><p>God, she was doing it again. But she couldn\u2019t help it, damn it. She was unwilling to back down or give up, no matter if she had to sit on that pillow for the rest of her life. Except she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that, because if she had to sit on it right now she might cry like a kindergartener.</p><p>\u201cMarcie.\u201d Rachel brought her back with a warm squeeze on her arm. \u201cCome on. You\u2019re caught in the zone. We need to get you grounded a bit better. Let\u2019s check you out, all right?\u201d</p><p>Rachel guided her up the open staircase, to the second level that held bedroom, home office, and a room with a massage table. In that room, there were clusters of lit candles that threw flickering light onto a tall stained-glass window with the design of a lotus blossom vine. A light installed behind it allowed the vibrant greens and browns to glow, even at night. Somewhere behind the array of delicate Japanese maples in the room, a flute piece was coming through a speaker system.</p><p>Okay, she\u2019d definitely been expected. It embarrassed her, but Rachel was being her usual gentle but firm self, not allowing any of that nonsense.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get your clothes off. No, honey, let me help. Your fingers are so cold and shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Ben, I\u2019m fine. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine, but you need some help to stay that way.\u201d She removed the sleeveless snug turtleneck. Marcie tried to help, to prove she didn\u2019t need to be undressed like a child, but Rachel was right, because she fumbled over the zipper of the skirt. Rachel made a soft sound, brushed her hands away. As she stepped closer to reach around her to do that, her breasts pressed against Marcie\u2019s.</p><p>She was wearing one of Jon\u2019s soft worn T-shirts, jeans pulled on beneath it, suggesting the shirt had been a nightshirt until they received Ben\u2019s call. It seemed a little early for wearing night clothes, but then she remembered Rachel was a 24/7. It was entirely possible that Jon preferred her naked in the house when it was just the two of them. The temperature in the house was more than comfortable for it.</p><p>The shirt smelled like a pleasing combination of Jon and his wife, and Rachel wore no bra under it. As a result, when Marcie felt the give of her generous breasts against her own, her nipples got hard again. Though her mind was logy, her body was still in an alert state, prepped for physical intimacy. Turning her face into Rachel\u2019s thick blonde hair, she smelled her fragrant shampoo, the heat of her skin. She wanted to press her lips to the woman\u2019s neck, taste her. Insanely enough, she did.</p><p>Rachel let out a sensual chuckle, pressed her hand to the side of Marcie\u2019s face, allowing it a moment before she unhooked her bra, stepped back to slide it off Marcie\u2019s arms, then turned her toward the massage table. \u201cYou are spinning, love. Let\u2019s check your vitals first. Sit here on the table.\u201d</p><p>She was vaguely aware of Rachel taking her pulse, checking her heart, making her breathe deep and then shallow as she did so. The woman wrapped a blood-pressure cuff on her, pumping it tight with calm efficiency. Marcie didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d zoned out until Rachel\u2019s voice called her out of the fog. \u201cGood. Vital signs are fine. I\u2019m going to have you lie down now, check some other things, but I want you to start sipping on this.\u201d She drew Marcie\u2019s attention to a bottle with a flexible straw by the massage table. \u201cIt\u2019ll taste a little odd, but it\u2019s just a hydration mix. Salt, sugar, water and a little mint and some other things I put in to soothe the stomach and nerves.\u201d</p><p>When she assumed that state, Rachel\u2019s capable hands adjusted her legs so they were slightly spread. Marcie was completely naked now. The air touched her skin, made her shiver, though she knew it was warm in the room. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a blanket on you in just a second. Oh love. You really pushed yourself over the limit, didn\u2019t you? Let\u2019s put an antiseptic salve on that broken and irritated skin right now, because we don\u2019t want infection. Keep drinking now, small sips.\u201d</p><p>When Jon\u2019s wife rolled her over, she\u2019d put a blissfully damp towel over a soft pad right under her backside so it wasn\u2019t as uncomfortable as Marcie had anticipated. She smelled something fragrant and chemical at once, suggesting the damp pad was soaked with the salve.</p><p>\u201cThat will help for now. An additional healing balm will be added later. One of my own mixes. It has beeswax, aloe, some different extracts. Mixed with a bit of talcum.\u201d Marcie heard the smile in the woman\u2019s voice. \u201cSmells wonderful and makes you feel like a pampered baby.\u201d</p><p>Marcie floated. The smell of the antiseptic, the way Rachel had her laid out on the table, made her remember getting her nipples and her clit hood pierced. The pain had been excruciating, but throughout it, she\u2019d imagined Ben there as if he\u2019d ordered it, decorating the body that was his. That night, she\u2019d gone home and looked in the mirror at the silver clit ring. Eventually, she\u2019d bought two emerald beads for it, the color of Ben\u2019s eyes. She\u2019d worn them today, beads that teased her clit and labia when she moved. She wondered if Ben had noticed when he was caning her over his desk.</p><p>The night she\u2019d purchased those beads, she\u2019d fantasized about Ben tugging on the ring, attaching a tether to it. Her pussy had been so wet, making the ring and beads glisten even more.</p><p>Remembering, past and present coming together, her body reacted with a shocking contraction of arousal as she heard Ben\u2019s voice. She cracked her eyelids to see him at the door. Rachel had covered her with a warm blanket, now that she was on her back, but his gaze still covered every exposed inch of skin with careful precision. \u201cI called Cass, let her know she\u2019s here for the night. How is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine. Dehydration was the main worry, but she\u2019s working on fluids now. The antiseptic will prevent infection, if she tends the area according to my instructions. In a little while she\u2019ll feel much steadier. Then she\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>She wished. Oh how she wished for that. On her side of things, it was already the truth.</p><p>She must have dozed off for a while, or floated around in that weird trance state, because when she focused again, she thought quite a bit of time had passed. She did feel steadier, but when she shifted, she winced. Sheesh, her muscles were sore. She probably needed to take a hot shower at some point.</p><p>Of course, with lucidity came a bunch of nervous feelings that compounded tenfold when she saw Ben sitting where she last remembered Rachel being. The woman had watched over her as she dozed, reading at one point, then peeling some carrots, a rhythmic, comforting clink-clink of noise from the peeler. Probably preparation for some meal she\u2019d be cooking for Jon later. Though Jon could cook and sometimes did, Marcie had noticed at the group get-togethers it was always Rachel who brought Jon his plate or a refill on his drink, unless he specifically told her to stay seated so he or another could tend to it. Another of those many little clues she\u2019d put together.</p><p>Rachel was an anticipatory sub, one who anticipated what her Master or his guests would need and took great pleasure in meeting those needs before they even voiced them. Some Masters allowed that; others required that a sub follow their direction exactly. She had a feeling Ben was a mix, depending on the situation, but she was a hundred percent certain what he truly wanted was a 24/7 relationship, no matter that he\u2019d never committed to a woman in all the time she\u2019d known him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t pursued a woman outside a club setting in the past couple years, but that only confirmed her opinion. All the intel she\u2019d gathered said that Ben O\u2019Callahan didn\u2019t settle for anything less than exactly what he wanted. 24/7 subs\u2014and the Doms who not only wanted them, but knew how to manage that type of relationship\u2014were rare. Even those who said they wanted it often really didn\u2019t, because the reality of 24/7 was a whole different thing. But like Ben, she didn\u2019t want anything less. Further, she didn\u2019t want it from any Dom in the world except Ben. He could call it youthful idealism or fantasy all he wanted. She knew differently.</p><p>She met his gaze, couldn\u2019t tell what was going on there, but she didn\u2019t have to figure out how to ask. When he saw she was awake, he rose. As he drew back the blanket, exposing her body to him without any preamble, the air now felt warm.</p><p>\u201cOn the floor, on this mat here. Obeisance pose.\u201d His voice was firm, but like the air, no longer cold. She hoped her hair looked okay. Her makeup had been ruined, but Rachel had cleaned her face with a warm cloth, so hopefully it wasn\u2019t too bad. Personal appearance aside, he\u2019d just given her a direct command. She found her limbs a little logy, but he gripped her elbow, helping her off the cot and into a kneeling position.</p><p>Knees folded, body leaning forward, elbows to the padded yoga mat, forehead down. Ass lifted off the heels, pushed into the air against the elbows so she was balanced. He made an approving noise at her understanding of the pose. She wished she could tell him she\u2019d masturbated in this pose, imagining that it was his hand that had pushed a vibrator into her ass and pussy, commanding her to hold the pose until she came, shuddering and screaming into the pillow she put on her dorm room floor so her neighbors didn\u2019t hear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took a seat on a short stool next to her, one knee crooked, the other leg stretched out comfortably alongside of her body. He was still wearing his slacks and dress shirt, but he\u2019d rolled up the shirtsleeves. Before she went all the way down, her gaze had slid down his throat, over the light mat of dark hair revealed by the open collar. He had a cart next to him with cotton balls, gauze and an open jar of something that smelled wonderful. Rachel\u2019s balm.</p><p>Marcie had assumed she\u2019d be doing the care, but in thinking about it now, Rachel had never said that. Instead, Ben was handling it personally. Tears pressed against the back of her eyes once more. She wasn\u2019t a crier, never had been, but for some reason, a whole backlog of the pesky things seemed to keep swelling up like a creek after a rainstorm. Shutting her eyes, she swallowed against the lump in her throat.</p><p>He had powerful hands, hands that were probably half again the size of hers. As he stroked her hair off her neck, spreading it forward on the floor around her shoulders, she made a questioning noise in her throat. He stilled. \u201cWhat is it, Marcie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I...would you put your hand under mine...sir?\u201d Master was there, on the tip of her tongue, but she wanted this, wouldn\u2019t provoke him right now.</p><p>Blissfully, he complied. Hers was flat on the mat, and he knelt beside her to slide his palm down, beneath hers. She curved her fingers over his knuckles, aligning them so she saw she\u2019d been mostly right. Not half a size larger, but still much larger than her own. When cupping her breast, a hand like that would almost cover it, though not quite. Thank God she and Cass had inherited their mother\u2019s generous bosom. Ben might be an ass man, but he had a healthy appreciation for breasts too. In those few days they\u2019d shared office space, she\u2019d seen him perusing hers more than once. Those demi-bras allowed a lot of attractive movement.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>He removed his hand without comment, but he gave her hair another stroke. Then he started tending to her. The balm stung a bit, telling her there was still antiseptic in the mix. However, she wasn\u2019t sorry about that at all, because it had the benefit of him leaning forward, blowing gently on her buttocks where he applied it, soothing that burn and sending an erotic ripple through her, thinking of his mouth so close. Then came a light stroke of his fingers as he massaged it into her skin. It was uncomfortable, but bearable, as long as his touch was part of it.</p><p>Fluids had helped restore her, made her feel less thick-tongued and dizzy, and the shifting waves of arousal came back fast under his touch. The obeisance pose underscored complete submission to a Master\u2019s desires, the genitals and anus open to whatever he wanted to do, the forehead to the ground making surrender clear.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t help twitching, the slight lifts of her backside begging for more of that touch, for more, period. She was getting wet, she could feel it, and while she knew he\u2019d call her a slut, it was how she reacted to him. She couldn\u2019t bear it if he thought she was this way with everyone. But there was nothing she could say to prove otherwise. She had to show him, and in this moment, being still and letting him register the arousal was all she could do.</p><p>She thought she heard a muttered oath. But then his touch slid down the seam of her buttocks, and his thumb probed the lips of her pussy, coming away wet. She whimpered.</p><p>Candlelight, heat, silence. She wondered if Rachel and Jon had gone to bed, because she heard no noise at all beyond Ben\u2019s breath and her own. Though she had no idea how long she\u2019d been out of it, it had to be late.</p><p>Now both hands were cradling her buttocks, his thumbs parting them. His breath was there, a heated balm even better than the salve on the abraded parts. Then she nearly swallowed her leaping heart.</p><p>He put his mouth to the tight, puckered opening.</p><p>It should get better. It\u2019s always a little harder for girls, at first. Find a guy who will take the time to make it good for you. Don\u2019t settle for just lying there while he gets off in five minutes. The right guy will want you to feel pleasure as well, and even if he doesn\u2019t know how to go about it, he\u2019ll want to learn. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell him and show him. He\u2019s supposed to take care of you. Otherwise he deserves to have his dick tied in a knot.\u201d</p> <p>Ben, answer to Marcie when she told him about her first time</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Holy Mother of God, fuck, please, oooohhhh. Though she\u2019d surely fantasized about this, there were some things electronics couldn\u2019t duplicate. A heated, firm tongue licking around that rim, teasing the ultra-sensitive center, which contracted under the pressure, welcoming him in. But he taunted her with it, kept his tongue on the outside, tickling and stroking that ring of nerves. His fingers tightened just enough on her abused buttocks, making her flinch and convulse at once. Yes. More pain, more pleasure. She could take it all from him.</p><p>She tried her best to stay still, to be a good girl, but it really wasn\u2019t her nature. She wanted to wiggle against his face, rub and squirm. She wanted that tongue. Those powerful fingers dug in, a warning, hard enough that a true lance of pain went through those broken areas.</p><p>\u201cKeep still, or I\u2019ll stop.\u201d He spoke against her flesh. That combined threat and command stilled her more effectively than any physical pain.</p><p>But oh God, it was intense. She bit into the mat, her fingernails digging into the foam as that agile tongue made small circles among the tiny creases of her anus, touched that center point again and again. He put pressure there several times, making her think he was going to penetrate, but then he\u2019d withdraw. Her whimpers became pleading cries. Her pussy was convulsing, warning her the very friction of the air could make her orgasm, his very proximity enough to push her over the edge.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t come.\u201d Reading her body so well, he spoke sternly.</p><p>She nodded frantically, agreeing, though she had no idea how she could stop herself. He made her helpless. She knew he exulted in it, that this was his drug, making her every action and reaction a mindless, instinctive response to him.</p> <p>His tongue pushed slowly inside that opening, going deep, moving, swirling, teasing, and she came apart. She didn\u2019t come, but it was more intense than any climax she\u2019d given herself. She screamed into the mat, her nails puncturing the foam and taking chunks out of it. Her thighs trembled, her toes curling hard as she struggled to stay still. His fingers bit into those welts, and the mixed sensations were so overwhelming she thought she might black out. She fought to stay in this moment forever.</p><p>He withdrew, then penetrated again, fucking her ass with his tongue. When it became too much, he would tease and play on the outside, then thrust back in again. Every time it was more overwhelming than the last. She knew there were other people in the house, but she couldn\u2019t stop making those wailing, crazed shrieks.</p><p>When he pulled back at last, sat on his heels, she was holding on to that cliff edge with every tense, quivering muscle. Those strong hands curled around her upper arms, lifted her onto her knees, turned her toward him. \u201cLook at me, Marcie.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were green fire, the flickering candles making love to the planes of his strong face. \u201cArms boxed at the small of your back, ass on your heels.\u201d</p><p>She complied immediately. He took a seat on the stool, caging her between his thighs and the massage table. Taking her shoulders, he slid her closer with an effortless move that kept her in the same position. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Oh the hell with that. She wanted to see, wanted to see him. But he wasn\u2019t going to do anything else unless she obeyed. She shut them, swallowing back the petulant protest that came to her lips.</p><p>\u201cBehave, little slut.\u201d When she was in her teens, he\u2019d called her brat, and now she heard a similar note of affection, though it had a new element to it, one that made hope bloom in her heart.</p><p>She heard him opening the slacks, adjusting himself, imagined his cock stretching out hard and thick so close to her face. She smelled him, heated skin, aroused male. She wondered if pre-cum was glistening on the slit. He wasn\u2019t covering himself, because she didn\u2019t detect the latex smell, hadn\u2019t heard the crinkle of a foil package. Once she was old enough for Cass to answer her more brazen questions about Ben, she\u2019d told Marcie how adamant he was about wearing protection with his club subs, and even then it was always ass fucking or blowjobs with them\u2014if he allowed them to touch him at all.</p><p>The fact he was going bareback now said that he was sure he was clean and wanted to feel her lips on his skin. It didn\u2019t matter how irritated Ben might get with her, or the volatile quicksand she was walking to get him to be her Master; she knew he would never risk harming her for the pleasure of the moment.</p><p>Though that wasn\u2019t wishful thinking, her hope that she was the first to touch her mouth to his cock without that thin barrier probably was. But she\u2019d let herself have that fantasy. Especially since he was about to grant one of her deepest wishes.</p><p>Her lips parted, tongue darting out as the broad head touched them. He withdrew before she could taste. \u201cKeep them closed,\u201d he ordered in that firm, no-arguments-tolerated voice. She did, making small needy noises in her throat as he came close again, pressed velvet flesh against her sealed mouth. He painted that pre-cum along her lips, making her want to lick them so badly it was almost an involuntary reflex.</p><p>\u201cAll right now. Part them, but you wait for me to push forward. No reaching, no movement of your mouth except for how my cock stretches it. All movement comes from me, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d She did it deliberately or instinctively, she didn\u2019t care. Would he let her get away with it? As he continued to hold himself from her, her heart twinged in disappointment. She relented. \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>He punished her by making her wait another full minute. When that rigid cock finally pressed against her lips, demanding entry, she let out a mental sigh of joy and relief. An emotion that turned to alarm and incredulity. Holy God. She knew, of course she knew, because she\u2019d heard about it in bits and pieces and touched him through his clothes, but as her mouth opened to take him, it kept being pushed open farther, the hinge of her jaw stretching, straining harder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her dentist had always said she had a small mouth, such that her jaw hurt from opening wide enough for him to do his annual cleanings. But that was good, because she knew Ben would like a tight, wet mouth, one that would clamp around him like a snug pussy. She had a moment of panic, though, thinking she wouldn\u2019t be able to take his full girth. He kept pushing forward, slow, deliberate. It was a little scary to have something that large pushing toward the back of her throat, the steel and meat of him against her teeth.</p><p>How long was he? Was he mostly diameter, or did he have the length as well? She\u2019d practiced this with a large dildo, first using benzocaine, and then learning to do it without it, relaxing those throat muscles. Now that it was truly happening, she had to force her crazy emotional and physical reactions to settle, focus enough to do what she\u2019d prepared herself to do. She wasn\u2019t going to fail in this. A man with a cock this size needed a woman who could service him well.</p><p>There were other things she could do, teasing the ridge around the head, sucking on the tip and, if he\u2019d let her use her hands, please God, she could let them help the work of her mouth. However, she understood this moment wasn\u2019t about technique.</p><p>He was taking his time, which made her chest constrict with a more emotional reaction. While he was ruthless, he really wasn\u2019t cruel. He\u2019d brought her here for aftercare, and now that he was making a Master\u2019s demands on her, he was being patient. He was hard and hot, like steel pulled right from the fire. She\u2019d had a taste of him and now she wanted his climax, wanted to swallow him down. His fingers were tight in her hair, conveying his reaction and holding her steady as well.</p><p>She got him past her gag reflex, and counted it down in her mind, a meditative thing Jon had taught her long ago. At the time, it had been to deal with family and school stress, but she\u2019d discovered the exercise not only kept her body relaxed but those all-important throat muscles as well.</p><p>There. He\u2019d stopped. She wasn\u2019t all the way to the base, but she had a sense she was close. She breathed fast through her nose, trying to slow it down. Easy, easy. Her body was trembling, her pussy leaking arousal on her calves. Her nipples were so tight they ached, the barbells adding to that sensation. She vibrated in guttural sound as he noticed, one hand cupping her right breast, thumb passing over the nipple and tweaking the piercing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my good girl. Hold steady, there.\u201d</p><p>As he began to withdraw, he gave her a gift. \u201cStart sucking me. Show me what else that smart-ass tongue of yours can do.\u201d</p><p>She drew in her cheeks, ecstatic at the sensation when his shaft returned, a deep, slow thrust. She used her tongue and a little bit of her teeth. Teasing the sensitive, throbbing vein under the shaft, flicking against it like plucking a taut violin string, she won an approving grunt, a flex of his fingers.</p><p>He kept it a torturous glide back and forward. As he went out, she nipped and sucked the corona, the broad head, and when he came back in she stroked that vein beneath anew. As she started to make unintelligible noises of pleasure in the back of her throat, he began to pick up speed. It increased the strain on her jaw, but it was all about pleasuring him, serving him. Her every nerve, every brain cell was attuned to it. For him, she could go into subspace with the least provocation. During this, during pain...even listening to the sound of his voice urging her on was enough.</p><p>\u201cThere you go. Suck me harder. Fuck...\u201d</p><p>Her fingers, clasping her forearms in that box position at the middle of her back, clenched at the hoarse note. She knew he had awesome control. He\u2019d fucked those three subs to completion before he came for the first time. But she wanted to believe the past couple days had been the continuous teasing foreplay for him it had been for her. She wanted him to lose control, use her hard, leave her jaw aching so badly she\u2019d have trouble speaking the next few days. She wanted to be marked by him in every way.</p><p>She was so deep in that zone she was confused when he pulled out. She reached for him with her mouth, making a noise of protest. In answer, he turned her roughly, pushed her back down into obeisance pose, her arms still boxed so she had to depend on him to guide her face to the mat without harm. He pressed her forehead to it, his hand on the back of her neck. She quivered, her stomach flip-flopping as a plastic tip pushed against her anus. At the squirt of heated lubricant going in, her fingers flexed. Oh God, yes.</p><p>He tossed it aside so she heard the little plastic tube roll out beside her. Then his cock head was at her entrance. \u201cBreath deep and push out against me, Marcie.\u201d</p><p>No one had ever been inside her there. She\u2019d saved it for him, though she\u2019d practiced with various-sized toys to be sure she could handle him. She wasn\u2019t so sure of that now, because the largest toy she\u2019d used had been about two-thirds of his actual girth, and it had been a difficult entry. But she was so wildly aroused she thought she could take him if he was big as a tree trunk.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t tell him he was her first anal sex. That would change things, give it a significance that could make him withdraw, physically and emotionally. She couldn\u2019t handle that. So she obeyed, breathing deep, pushing out and hoping she could do it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to worry. He would care for her, help her, even while demanding she comply, submit, yield to his intent to fuck her. But she still made a female noise of distress as he entered. The lube helped him slide into the opening, but there was so much of him to take. He braced himself over her then, one hand guiding his cock, his dress shirt pressed into her bare back. Reaching beneath her, he closed his other hand over her breast. She was right, it pressed into his palm just right, his fingers spreading over the curve. When he pinched her nipple around the barbell, her hips jerked up against him, taking him an inch deeper. She moaned, undulating in reaction as he stayed still but kept teasing her breast, squeezing and playing with the nipple. God, she was so sensitive around her piercings, and as she got more violent, so did he, pinching harder, tugging.</p><p>She didn\u2019t recognize the sounds coming from her throat in rapid succession, because every touch brought something new from within her. Her hips were pumping, pushing, working against him. She realized he wasn\u2019t moving at all. She was. Taking him deep, deeper. Burning, raging fire, but she could handle it, no matter that her eyes were watering. She could handle him. She belonged to him.</p><p>She was panting in distress, pressing her forehead hard into that mat. \u201cPlease...\u201d She was begging, she didn\u2019t know for what, but he did. His hand left her breast, slid up the slope of her belly. Her clit was already contracting when he hooked his finger in the ring, played with the beads, then tugged on it to pull back the hood. Brushing the calloused tip of his finger over that ultrasensitive bundle of nerve endings, he set off a rocket of sensation.</p><p>She screamed like a wild panther in the dead of night, being mounted in the dark by a rough and uncompromising male. He slid home, down to the hilt, his testicles pressed against her pussy, and she made another harsh cry, pleasure and distress at once.</p><p>\u201cHold me there, baby,\u201d he murmured against her ear. \u201cJust hold me. You can do it. Relax. Just rock with me.\u201d</p><p>He was moving against her hips, but not to pull in or out. He held them fast together, moving their bodies in one smooth roll of motion, a soothing lift and fall like waves in the ocean. It created incremental adjustments of his cock in her ass, which felt wildly good in a concentrated, compressed way. Her pussy was so wet the fluid was sliding down her inner thighs. His testicles were against her labia, so she knew her arousal would mark his ball sac as well. He was still playing with that ring, teasing the beads, brushing his thumb more gently around her clit, keeping those waves of feeling rushing up into her lower belly, the precursor to a violent, overwhelming climax.</p> <p>Oh God, oh God, oh God. He felt better than anything had ever felt. She wished he was as naked as she was, that she could feel every inch of bare flesh, but Ben kept control, she knew that. Kept his distance. Only this didn\u2019t feel like distance. It felt like intimacy at a level she\u2019d never expected. He was at the threshold of her soul, and she was terrified, realizing that as they progressed forward, if he did as she wanted, he\u2019d be deep in that soul, leaving her no secrets, every part of her stripped bare for him. That was what he demanded. After he won it, he walked away.</p><p>She was his slave, but more than that, she\u2019d always been his. She had to believe that, believe she would be different, no matter how many times women deluded themselves into thinking they would be the one to get into the heart of an emotionally closed, scarred man. Because Ben was exactly that. She\u2019d realized it to a depth she suspected few others did, except maybe Matt. Or Jon, because Jon always knew things like that, whether you told him or not.</p><p>She had to get into Ben\u2019s soul. She didn\u2019t know how except like this, through utter surrender, something he\u2019d won from countless women a hundred times before. Those women hadn\u2019t given him their heart when they were teenagers though. She had, and she\u2019d never gotten it back. He still had it, whether he knew it or not. That made her different.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to come for me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease...you...first. Master.\u201d She was insane, because there was no way she could hold out a millisecond more.</p><p>He pinched her clit, tugged on that ring, began to rub her the wrong way with knowledgeable fingers, holding her climax out of reach. His voice, a growl against her ear, shivered over her nerve endings. \u201cAddress me correctly, or nothing is going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...did.\u201d She gritted her teeth. \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><p>He could pull out, leave her there. He had enough will to do it. But she squeezed down on him with all she had, eliciting an expulsion of breath against her ear, another of those muttered oaths that gave her such ferocious satisfaction.</p><p>Wrapping his fingers in her hair, he jerked her head back. It was an implicit command to open her eyes, such that she was meeting his gaze full on. His eyes blazed like hellfire, his mouth set in an implacable line. \u201cThree seconds, and I pull out, Marcie. I\u2019ll slap ice on that hot cunt of yours until you\u2019re writhing and begging from the agony of it, and you won\u2019t come.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want you more...than I want that.\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed in his jaw. Something violent passed through him, something that almost lifted the hair on her neck, instinctive self-preservation. But when he spoke in that savage rumble, his tone was even. \u201cProve you can obey me. If you can\u2019t do that, I give you nothing.\u201d</p><p>He meant it, she could see he did. Once again she had to concede a battle for the hope of winning the war. Closing her eyes again so he wouldn\u2019t see the tears of frustration, she relented. \u201cPlease, sir. You come first. Let me serve you.\u201d</p> <p>Just like that, he released her hair, put his hand back on her nape so she was forced to look at the floor. When he started thrusting again, she began to come within three strokes.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t resist him, the internal muscles in her pussy and ass clenching down so hard, the one on empty space, the other on the massive size of him. It was indescribable, how it felt to have him there. The toys she used, they\u2019d been rigid, unyielding, no matter how lifelike. He was living, pulsing, heated flesh, and it galvanized her reaction to a level she\u2019d never experienced before. A long, never-ending wail tore out of her throat. She couldn\u2019t bite it back, even if she\u2019d wanted to do so, her vocal cords pushed to the max, the same way he was pushing all of her body. She convulsed against him, completely lost.</p><p>Still massaging her clit, he slid two of his fingers into her pussy. It shot her over another edge. He thrust into her ass, then slid almost all the way out. Back in, each pass ripping another sound from her throat, another wave of her climax. She clamped down on him, working for her Master, wanting to give him pleasure. She was forming words among the screams, single words that meant so much to her. \u201cMaster...fuck...yours...God...\u201d</p><p>Then words weren\u2019t possible. With an expulsion of harsh breath, a primal grunt, he began to release. His hips were slamming against her abused ass, driving her forehead harder into the mat, his other hand now clamped around her boxed forearms to keep from putting additional duress on her neck, an amazing awareness of her even when he was obviously letting go, pushing them both to their limits. She reveled in his groan of pleasure, the way his fingers convulsed on her, the heat that she knew had to be his seed. The flood of his semen was enough to make her cry out anew, and he muttered a savage, gasping oath, responding to her.</p><p>He kept going for quite awhile, long past his completion, as if he was savoring the clench of her muscles over his still-hard cock, prolonging and underscoring her surrender to him. For her, time slowed to a dreamy haze. Her climax spiraled down to intense aftershocks, but her body kept jerking from his thrusts. He didn\u2019t pull out until long after all those aftershocks had faded to a low tide of pleasurable ripples through her stomach. When he did finally withdraw, a soft noise of discomfort broke from her lips, that tight ring of muscles contracting, burning. Suddenly she was aware of just how sore she was. Inside and out. It almost made her smile, but she was too exhausted.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t lie down with her, but he did lift her back onto the massage table, laying her on her stomach. One palm settled on her buttock, holding her in place. She heard Rachel\u2019s quiet voice at the door a moment later, and his touch slipped away. He was leaving her aftercare to Jon\u2019s wife. She\u2019d called him Master again, and he was punishing her for that.</p><p>\u201cYou promised,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben squatted near her head, his hand gentle on her hair, thumb stroking her temple. His other hand rested on the edge of the table and she let hers creep up, cover two of his fingers. His glance went to the touch, then back to her face. Leaning forward, he pressed his lips to the corner of her eye, and she realized he was kissing away the track of a tear. She trembled beneath his mouth, but when he drew back, those eyes still so close, she swallowed, spoke.</p><p>\u201cThe club. You said you\u2019d take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d think about it,\u201d he corrected, giving her that sexy stern schoolmaster look.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer are you going to think about it?\u201d</p> <p>His gaze narrowed, but her stomach eased, seeing a flicker of humor. She lifted her hand, traced the serious mouth. Too serious. Too stern. \u201cYou don\u2019t smile as much as you used to.\u201d</p><p>She knew she was floating, but that was the way it was after something like that. At least she\u2019d read it was this way, overheard discussions about it. Savannah, Rachel, Dana and Cass, having their monthly tea parties on the back deck, underneath her bedroom window. It had been easy enough to crack the window that tiny amount needed and sit below the sill to listen. It became an irresistible regular habit, particularly when she finally heard the words that told her what her feelings were. Submissive cravings. They had access to a whole candy shop outside her reach, but at least she\u2019d been able to press her nose to the glass, learn what was waiting for her there. She\u2019d dreamed of the day she could join them.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot more annoyances than I used to have.\u201d He tugged on a lock of her hair.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. Your heart...it\u2019s all closed up. But it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here. When are you taking me to the club?\u201d</p><p>His glance shifted, as if her comments had elicited some type of reaction from Rachel, but then he was back to studying her face. His thumb traced over that tear track. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later. Rachel is going to take care of you now. You rest. That\u2019s an order. You\u2019re not going to work tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She had another contract to finish. She didn\u2019t want him to have to cover her work. Plus, there was something else she owed him. But he was too good at reading her.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to mentor you, from this moment on, you obey my orders. Got it? No work tomorrow. Say it.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip in frustration, but he had that look on his face, and she knew she couldn\u2019t refuse it. \u201cNo work tomorrow, sir.\u201d</p> <p>He made a point of looking toward her hands, making sure nothing was crossed, and it almost made her smile. Of course, he didn\u2019t look toward her toes.</p><p>Disentangling his fingers, he gave hers a quick squeeze before nodding to Rachel. \u201cTake care of her.\u201d</p><p>Ben cleaned up in the bathroom. He wanted to go back in to see her, but he didn\u2019t, just glanced in to confirm Rachel was still working over her. She had an herbal wash that would soothe the tissues he\u2019d stretched so cruelly, make that afterburn hurt way less. He\u2019d liked cosseting her, taking care of the welts on her ass, hearing her sexy little whimpers. He wouldn\u2019t mind being the one to put her in the tub, rinse out that tight passage, make her comfortable again.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t. It was too personal, too intimate. He had to question his sanity, though, cutting out before Rachel gave her a full-body massage. Under different circumstances, he could probably talk Jon into ordering his wife to strip so they could have the pleasure of both women naked during the massage. With warming oil involved on lots of silken skin. Marcie\u2019s skin.</p><p>Jesus, he had to get out of here.</p><p>As he walked into the main room, Jon looked up. He was stretched out on the couch, a cup of tea in hand, reading a massive book about the wisdom of ancient civilizations or some bullshit like that. He looked entirely too calm. Ben shook his head, lifting a hand before he could speak. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be back for her tomorrow. I owe Rachel a yoga mat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d He stopped at the door, looked back at the man. \u201cThanks for your help, yours and Rachel\u2019s. I just don\u2019t want to talk it out right now, all right?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll call if she needs anything we can\u2019t provide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He slid out the door, relieved to breathe the open air. Though the limo was waiting, he would have preferred his own car, so he could open it up on the quiet rural roads around Jon\u2019s house, feel the blast of wind and cathartic roar that came with pushing it, feeling the lift over the few hills as if the car was about to take off like a plane.</p><p>He told the driver to drop him off in the French Quarter. This time of night, Bourbon Street was revving up, but he bypassed the traffic and noise, getting out at Royal Street to head for the place where the night sky was close and there was full dark.</p><p>The St. Louis cemetery, the oldest one. His childhood haunting ground.</p><p>Fortunately it seemed pretty quiet tonight. A homeless person or two were probably settled into the shadows, which was fine. He slipped along the maze of vaults, the various sizes that housed whole families. As a kid, he\u2019d come through here plenty times. Hiding from other predators, the cops, or just to be by himself. Out of habit, he traced one of the many trios of sideways crosses etched on Marie LaVeau\u2019s tomb. Didn\u2019t really know why he did it; just always had. Sometimes he left a few pennies there, because the shrewd voodoo queen liked copper. Never hurt to network and make friends where you could.</p><p>When he reached the Italian Society vault, he glanced around, verifying he was alone and unobserved. Taking off his shoes, he held the laces in his teeth, then used handholds on the sealed drawers to climb to the top, take a seat amid the tufts of grass that grew untended there. Putting his back against the cross that crowned the area, he looked out over the acres of the dead and gone.</p><p>He wished he had a bottle of whiskey or a six-pack of Guinness, but then again he didn\u2019t. He knew he shouldn\u2019t drink in this kind of mood, but lately it hadn\u2019t stopped him. Closing his eyes, he rested his head against the cross. Mistake. Marcie was beneath him again, all that pale cream skin, her hair brushing her shoulders. She was biting her lips, tears in her eyes as she concentrated on taking him inside of her, managing the pain, her cheeks flushed with arousal. Her pussy had been soaked, sucking eagerly on his fingers. When she took his dick in her mouth, she took him like an experienced hooker. How the hell had she learned to do that? When? With who?</p><p>He recalled again the letters about her losing her virginity. She\u2019d liked the boy, but with her penchant for strategic planning, it was kind of a \u201cto-do\u201d\u2014getting it out of the way. At the time it had bugged him, though he couldn\u2019t put his finger on why. It was the way most guys were about it, after all. Get it done, the sooner the better. But maybe that was why it bugged him. Marcie wasn\u2019t a guy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d asked why she hadn\u2019t climaxed, and whether it would get better. Recalling the advice he\u2019d given her, he winced. That poor guy. With the practical streak Marcie had, she probably used him as a guinea pig, exploring every possible thing and asking a million questions about male anatomy until the kid was clawing and screaming, trying to get out of her room. Was that where she\u2019d learned about the throat thing? She knew how to take a larger-than-usual cock, in both her ass and mouth. She\u2019d known how to work with him.</p><p>It pissed him off. He told himself it had nothing to do with her experience or lack thereof. He was pissed because he wasn\u2019t supposed to have fucked her at all. When he\u2019d made her call him \u201csir\u201d, she thought she\u2019d lost. She didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been scrambling to regain the upper ground, which was a fucking joke since he\u2019d already lost it. In Jon\u2019s house, no less. Jesus.</p><p>Rising, he crossed his arms and stared down into the cemetery like one of the stern angel statues. One clothed in a custom-tailored charcoal suit. He wanted her back at his place tonight, in his bed, so he could turn to her during the night and do whatever he wanted to do to her, make her sob with pleasure, wear her out. Give her the rest of those cane licks to make her behave.</p><p>His idea of a leisurely Sunday at home would be to tie her over a spanking bench, totally naked and legs spread. He\u2019d keep her there through most of the day, her pretty mouth sucking his cock before he fucked her with it. He\u2019d make her beg for food, water, trips to the bathroom. He\u2019d blindfold her and paddle her ass at unpredictable intervals, keeping her on edge. One evening at the club, he\u2019d done that to a seasoned sub for five hours, until she was so deeply mired in subspace she was speaking in tongues, begging to be fucked, for pain, for anything he wanted. The memory sent a shimmer of heat through his blood, especially with Marcie overlaying that picture.</p><p>Fine line between fucking sadist and a Dom, asshole.</p><p>There was no doubt he was a sadist. He needed to give pain to release something inside of him, and a sub craving it, willing to take higher and higher levels of duress just to please him and because she herself got off on it, she was a drug.</p><p>How did Marcie know that about him? How did she know so damn much? He thought of her body stretched out on the car hood, her glistening pussy lips. He\u2019d like to taste what was there. Yeah, he might like assfucking, but he liked diversity, would take full advantage of the other pleasures a woman\u2019s body could offer. Those piercings made him hot as hell. He liked that she didn\u2019t have tattoos, all that creamy skin unmarred. He could mark it with his teeth, the suction of his mouth, the touch of a whip or paddle. He grinned like a feral animal, thinking of the play paddles he\u2019d seen with words cut out of the wood so they\u2019d imprint on the flesh. Slut. That would be hers, for sure. She wore the name like a badge of honor.</p><p>He sobered. It was a puzzle, how innocent she truly was, how inexperienced as a submissive, all of it bravado, and yet she sassed and defied him, begging for the worst punishment he could inflict. As if she\u2019d known him as her Master for far longer than this one day.</p><p>Because she trusts you, asshole. It was like Matt had said. She followed her natural cravings because the environment told her she was safe, that she could make that leap and someone would catch her. Either that or she was just that damn brave. Fuck.</p><p>She\u2019d followed him to Surreal. How long before that had she been studying him? What he wanted, what he liked. Jesus. She wanted to be an investigator, was top of her class...</p><p>He shook his head, climbed down off the top of the vault. Hearing a poignant ballad being wailed out on a sax, he followed a familiar track to its source. Sticking to the shadows, he watched Marvin Troxler stand before the grave simply marked \u201cBernie, Musician\u201d and play his latest composition. Best fingers on a sax Ben had ever heard locally, but Marvin only shared with Bernie. If anyone appeared while he was playing, he stopped, walked away. His communication skills weren\u2019t the greatest, but there was a pain burning in his eyes Ben recognized too well.</p><p>Ben had first heard him a year or so ago. Figuring out his habits, he\u2019d tailed him home, figured out that he was a low-paid dock worker. He\u2019d arranged an accidental meet one day at the docks, and offered the man a different job. He worked in one of Kensington\u2019s warehouses now, earned better pay and had a decent apartment, but as far as Ben knew, he never sought gigs or any public outlet for his music. Ben never asked him about it, never revealed that he knew about Marvin\u2019s midnight serenades. There were wounds that were private. That no one should touch.</p><p>Turning away, he slipped back through the vaults. Stopping at one that had fallen to ruin, he readjusted the broken head plate to make sure it stayed upright. To show someone remembered. Swallowing, he moved away. Couldn\u2019t get into that shit. He had a damn good life. Friends who cared about him. The only reason one of them hadn\u2019t tracked him tonight was because he\u2019d deliberately had the limo drop him at Bourbon. If they checked, they\u2019d think he\u2019d gone to Progeny or one of his favorite watering holes.</p><p>They all had families who needed them. They didn\u2019t need to be chasing after him. He knew the fact he was alone bugged them, but that was his choice. Marcie might think she knew what he needed and that she could handle it, but he\u2019d decided long ago that was too much to ask of any woman.</p><p>Yet he remembered the way her fingers had covered his, the way her beautiful brown eyes had studied his face, seeing things she shouldn\u2019t be old or wise enough to see or understand. \u201cYour heart is closed. But it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered. He was way too aware she was here. That was the problem. He\u2019d agreed to mentor her, and he needed to live up to that, but he was also way too aware that he wanted more than that. He wanted to take her over, Master her, show her the ropes literally and figuratively.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to go back for her in the morning. He\u2019d send the limo, have her taken home, and that was the end of it.</p><p>Marcie slept restlessly, even though Rachel had done a good job. She was only sore in the right ways when she rose, but her nerves felt all raw and exposed. He\u2019d been inside her, around her, surrounding her. It made her twitch or shudder at odd moments as she was getting cleaned up and dressed. Rachel had hung up the clothes Ben had taken off her, a vision she couldn\u2019t forget. Her nipples became erect at the least brush of contact.</p><p>He must have found her panties in the drawer and brought them along last night, because they were part of what Rachel had included with the clothes. Along with a silk blouse of Rachel\u2019s, a pretty pale pink that went well with the skirt and was thick enough the tan bra with its mesh top, though faintly visible, didn\u2019t look out of place beneath it</p><p>Ben had told Marcie she wasn\u2019t going to work, in front of Rachel, but Rachel had provided her a new blouse. If Marcie decided to go into work, she wouldn\u2019t be wearing the same top she\u2019d worn yesterday. Did Rachel understand her that well? Probably.</p><p>Marcie\u2019s lips twisted. Should she do it, go on in to the office, even though he\u2019d forbidden her to do it? He had hard limits, but she hadn\u2019t quite figured out the shape of that line. He\u2019d committed himself to mentoring, so that was progress. However, if she broke the rules too stringently, would he use that as an out? The mentoring was the only true foothold she had right now.</p><p>Sighing, she left the guest bedroom and headed to the main floor. Jon was still here, sitting at the kitchen island, working his way through scrambled eggs, tomatoes and toast. He had one foot propped on the opposite chair, elbow resting on the counter as he held a piece of toast in that hand and an engineering drawing in the other. Though he was wearing slacks, his dress shirt had been shrugged on but not yet buttoned, the tie draped over the back of the chair where his foot was propped.</p> <p>As a woman, she was obligated to pause, appreciate that view. Every one of the K&amp;A men was an utterly edible male and Jon was no exception, with his jewel-blue eyes, dark hair to his shoulders and his lean grace. His current pose demonstrated the casual flexibility that came from advanced yoga, something he and Rachel did together. The smooth pecs and ridged abdomen, the shape of his tight ass in the slacks, made her an absolute fan of the ancient practice to sculpt the male form.</p><p>Rachel was dressed for her work as a physical therapist, in attractive black slacks and a shirt that clung to her curves in a sexy but professional way. As Marcie came down the stairs, Jon glanced up. It was unsettling, how he assessed her physical and emotional state in a series of steady blinks.</p><p>But Jon was a Dom, and this was the world she wanted to inhabit. So she kept her chin up, her walk steady. When she met his gaze, she lowered her eyes, nodded, acknowledging what he was before she lifted them again.</p><p>He was a Master, but not her Master.</p><p>\u201cToast and eggs, love,\u201d Rachel said, sliding another plate next to Jon\u2019s. \u201cThe jelly is fresh, from the berries in our garden. I need to get to an early PT appointment, but Jon said he\u2019ll stay here with you until Ben arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen\u2019s coming here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he left last night, he said he\u2019d be back for you in the morning.\u201d Jon caught Rachel\u2019s hand when she was picking up his orange juice glass to top it off. He held her there as he dipped his knife in the jelly, put a bit of it on her wrist. Bringing it to his mouth, he licked it off, considered the taste thoughtfully. Rachel held still, and Marcie saw the pulse leap in her throat, her gaze riveted on her Master.</p><p>\u201cHmm. It\u2019s good on toast, but better on you. Leave some of that out so it can get room temperature. I\u2019ll want to see what else I can spread it on tonight.\u201d</p><p>Rachel gave him a smile, then glanced at Marcie. \u201cDo you want some juice, love?\u201d</p><p>Wow. Just like that. She\u2019d wanted to be at the adults\u2019 table, and suddenly they were doing things in front of her they never would have done before. Of course, she had nearly shattered their glassware with her screaming last night. Regardless, the change was both exhilarating and a bit unnerving.</p><p>\u201cYes. I can get it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you sit.\u201d Rachel gestured to the stool next to the one Jon was using as a prop for his foot. \u201cRelax a little bit, since you have the day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d Marcie pressed her lips together, glanced at Jon. \u201cI\u2019m sure Ben will go to the office first before he comes here. It\u2019s silly for you to be late. Just take me to the office. I can meet him there, and if he\u2019s not quite ready to leave, I can finish up a few details I left yesterday.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she was disobeying him. She was just making it easier for him to find her. Or less easy to change his mind about coming for her personally.</p><p>Jon gave her a level glance. \u201cYou sure you want to do that, Marcie?\u201d</p><p>Busted. She didn\u2019t flinch though. \u201cI won\u2019t let him avoid me, Jon. Last night, he told you he\u2019d pick me up today. But he\u2019s going to just send a car, and the driver of that car will be instructed to drop me at Cass\u2019. Then I\u2019ll go back into work tomorrow, and he\u2019ll be on a flight halfway across the world, dealing with some unexpected legal problem. By the time he returns, my two-week internship will be over.\u201d</p><p>Rachel made a noise that sounded suspiciously like a dry chuckle, an I-told-you-so. Jon gave her a fond and amused glance, but when he looked back at Marcie, he\u2019d sobered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his decision. You need to accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his decision if he\u2019s making it for the right reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cNot because he thinks I can\u2019t handle what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you handle what he wants? Stop.\u201d Jon\u2019s tone sharpened enough to startle her, make her hold her tongue. \u201cDon\u2019t simply react. Think it through.\u201d</p><p>Marcie glanced at Rachel. She was standing at the sink, watching the two of them, but her calm look bolstered Marcie.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said at last. \u201cEach of you found the one woman who was...everything for you. You knew it pretty much from the first moment. You and Rachel, Peter and Dana, Lucas and Cass, Matt and Savannah. That\u2019s the way you guys work. Ben might think he\u2019s different, but in my heart, I know he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jon considered her. \u201cYou believe you\u2019re that one for Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I feel it.\u201d She braced herself for that look people adopted when a younger person said something incredibly na\u00efve. But Jon merely looked toward Rachel.</p><p>\u201cHead on to your appointment. I\u2019ll decide what to do after I talk to Marcie awhile.\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded. When she came around the counter, she put her arms around Marcie and hugged her. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>In high school, Marcie had called Rachel\u2019s embraces \u201cEarth Mother hugs\u201d because they brought comfort and warmth, this amazing desire to stay inside of her armspan forever. It was amusingly similar to the tranquility that Jon emanated the moment he stepped into a room.</p><p>However, Rachel\u2019s lips touching her temple was a different kind of caress. Marcie was still worked up enough from last night to respond to it. When the woman turned her head, Marcie couldn\u2019t resist brushing her lips across hers, stroking her fingertips over the strands of Rachel\u2019s beautiful blonde hair. She was careful not to muss it, but she wanted to dig her fingers deep into that luxurious softness.</p><p>She imagined the two of them intertwined and naked, engaged in a full girl-on-girl kiss, driving Ben and Jon crazy hot. She knew Rachel was sometimes self-conscious about her age, almost fifty, but all she saw when she looked at the woman was a loving female submissive with a smoking body and a warmth anyone would crave to share.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d she said, meeting Rachel\u2019s amused eyes.</p><p>Jon raised a brow, but stood when Rachel came to him. Apparently, he could pick a woman\u2019s thoughts right out of her brain just like Ben, because everything Marcie had stolen in her fantasy, he now took as his undeniable right. He kissed his wife deep, strong, tangling his fingers into her hair. He didn\u2019t care that he mussed it. In fact, he unclipped the barrette, pocketed it, and then let that hand wander around her hip to rest on her buttock. Her kiss was no brush of lips either. When he lifted his head, his blue eyes full of his wife, Rachel was clinging to his forearms for support. Marcie didn\u2019t blame her. She was sitting, but her knees were just as weak. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you at lunch. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded, left them with another smile at Marcie, her lips moist and somewhat swollen from the demand of that kiss. While it had aroused her, Marcie found it had done something less pleasant to her emotionally. The desire for physical demand and intimacy together was overwhelming, and came with a quiet sense of despair. She\u2019d started the ball rolling, and though she had no idea if it would get to its destination, if it did, that would bring a whole set of problems, problems that might prevent her from ever being on Jon and Rachel\u2019s kind of stage.</p><p>Jon sat back down, pushed her plate closer to her. \u201cEat and keep talking,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me what\u2019s bugging you.\u201d</p> <p>There was a different tone to his voice now, reminding her Jon was a good listener. It probably seemed odd that she\u2019d gravitated toward Ben as her confidante as a teen, but once she\u2019d understood why, it hadn\u2019t been much of a surprise to her. Still, Jon provided perspective, a calm she needed desperately right now. She was going on gut feeling, recklessly daring the fates to strike her down, and Jon had prompted her to rein it back a notch, think about it. Which was exactly why she preferred the steamroller approach. She had to have superhero confidence to do this. Pausing for reflection invited doubts, and a whole wealth of them crowded forward into this moment.</p><p>\u201cI went to watch him...at Surreal. He didn\u2019t know I was there, watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d She remembered how he\u2019d kept looking toward her that night, noting the mask she\u2019d later used on his car.</p><p>\u201cI expect he wasn\u2019t entirely pleased to know he was being stalked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t stalking.\u201d She wrinkled her nose at him, reassured when he gave her a smile. \u201cHe was with three women, Jon. I don\u2019t like seeing him with others, but in some weird way, I guess that made me feel better about it, because it\u2019s so...impersonal. I don\u2019t know if I can keep up with him though. The stamina he showed, how much each of them took...\u201d Last night, when he pulled out of her, he was still hard. She\u2019d seen it when he\u2019d adjusted his clothing. \u201cIf I can\u2019t be all he needs in that department, no matter how much I want him, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll feel if he wants me to be one of many, versus just...the one.\u201d</p><p>She was smart enough to know last night was his relatively gentle side, yet it had pushed her to her limits, physically and emotionally. Of course, it was the first time she\u2019d actually experienced something like that. She could learn, get better, get stronger. \u201cIs that what he wants, Jon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Jon slathered more jelly on another piece of toast, handed it to her. \u201cThe word want is a tricky thing. It\u2019s far more subjective and unstable than need. Nature aligns us, Marcie. We may differ in our physical capabilities, but nothing overrides what our hearts really desire. Think about extreme adrenaline junkies, the things they do that can get them killed. What are your thoughts about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re running. Trying to outrun death or fear, or something else. They push their limits so they don\u2019t have to stop, be still and face that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He chewed on his own toast, studied her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re going all Yoda on me. Giving me the \u2018Luke, you dumbass\u2014figure it out\u2019 look.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, appreciating her, but then he sobered. \u201cBen is a very demanding Master. However, if you\u2019re right, if you are what his heart truly desires, you won\u2019t have to worry about keeping up with him, or being one of many women. When each of us found the woman we knew was the one for us forever, that was it. She could have been an invalid, and she\u2019d have been plenty for us physically. You\u2019ve said you believe Ben is no different from the rest of us in that regard, so that\u2019s your answer.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, looking down at her plate. \u201cFinding that one person,\u201d he added, touching her hand to bring her gaze back to him, \u201cit\u2019s a shift of paradigm that changes everything. What we always thought we wanted, what we know, what we don\u2019t. But when it clicks into place, that\u2019s also when everything makes sense, often for the very first time in our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scary,\u201d she decided. Picking up the toast, she took a bite. \u201cThis is fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think how it will taste on Rachel\u2019s skin.\u201d Those blue eyes gave a wicked flash that made her toes curl.</p><p>\u201cAnother important point.\u201d He pointed at her with his piece of bread. \u201cYou have to be who you are, Marcie. If you believe deeply you belong together, then you must do it on your own terms, as who you are, because you can\u2019t pretend to be someone else. Not for a lifetime. Don\u2019t sell yourself short. He\u2019d know anyway. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s a very good lawyer. He can scent a lie like a bloodhound.\u201d</p><p>He rose. \u201cI\u2019m going to finish getting dressed. You can stay here or I can take you into the office. The choice is yours. But remember this. You\u2019re pushing a Master pretty hard. For everything he\u2019s done so far, I can tell you that Ben has showed a great deal of restraint, given what he\u2019s capable of doing.\u201d</p><p>There went that shiver again, part fear, part...longing. She wasn\u2019t brave enough to share with Jon some of the things she\u2019d imagined Ben doing to her. She would stand in a stock like those women, her neck and wrists bound, body bent over in servitude. Ben could put her on display in the center of his living room and she\u2019d stay that way all day while he went about his routine, enjoying his Sunday coffee, reading his paper, working out, whatever.</p><p>He\u2019d gag her of course, so she\u2019d be unable to do anything but await his pleasure. Whether it was fucking her in that helpless position, smacking her ass, clamping and weighting her nipples, whatever. He could punish her endlessly for her defiance, because she knew he wanted to be pushed. He wanted someone who wasn\u2019t afraid of his form of Mastery. At least not in the wrong kind of way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As much as she craved that, she also hungered for the other side of that mountain. Him removing the restraints, bathing her, brushing her hair, holding her against his body at night. Laughing with her, dancing with her. Sharing everything with her. He was the two sides of that coin, and she just wanted to spin with him, taking either side, whenever, however she could get them.</p><p>\u201cMarcie? One more thing.\u201d Jon stepped closer, tipped up her chin with two fingers. He held her in place with a firm, unexpected touch, pulling her out of her reverie. \u201cHugging my wife, affection, is one thing. But you want to touch her other ways, you need my permission. She\u2019s mine. You understand?\u201d</p><p>Wow. His unyielding tone was in direct contrast to the mild conversational attitude from before. It was potent, seeing the Master inside him up close and personal.</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, stepped back. When he retrieved his plate, took it to the sink, other things rose inside her, demanding to be said. \u201cI know I\u2019m out of control, irrational about some of this. I\u2019ve planned this for a while, Jon, and now that the reality has kicked in, I\u2019m following this feeling inside me. The more he tries to push me away, the more it tells me to push back. I know a lot of what I\u2019m doing is wrong, but I can\u2019t seem to calm myself down, make myself take it slower, especially now that I\u2019ve opened the door.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d raised a forkful of eggs, but the more she talked, the more her fingers shook, such that she put it back down, uneaten. That raw feeling was back.</p><p>Jon\u2019s brow creased in concern. Coming back around the counter, he slid his stool closer. Picking up her fork, he nodded. \u201cOpen up.\u201d</p><p>She gave a nervous laugh. \u201cI can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo arguments. Open up.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, opened her mouth. As she chewed the first mouthful, he scooped up another, patiently waiting on her. \u201cBreathe, and eat. No talking.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, because his calm command steadied her nerves. It was odd to have Jon feeding her, his thigh pressed alongside hers on the outside of the stool. As she ate, the knot in her stomach loosened. She realized suddenly, with mortification, that tears were trickling down her face. Putting aside the fork, Jon patted at them with the napkin, and then slid his arms around her. Before she realized it, he was lifting her, taking her to the couch to sit her down in his lap.</p><p>\u201cCry now,\u201d he murmured. \u201cJust cry.\u201d</p><p>As if a dam broke loose, she did. Nerves and stress, pleasure and pain, all the memories of the previous night, good and bad, were rolled up into her sobs. She buried her face in Jon\u2019s bare chest, held onto his dress shirt and wept. She wasn\u2019t a crier. She really wasn\u2019t. It astounded her, even as she couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><p>Jon stroked her hair, her back, the line of her hip. He wasn\u2019t infringing on what was Ben\u2019s, but they all understood this. Ben should be sitting where he was sitting. When a Dom broke a submissive wide open for her very first time, it made her impossibly vulnerable. For a short period, she would be overcome by vacillating emotions, her body hot and cold, aroused and calm, completely unpredictable. The wilder and stronger the sub, the wider that pendulum could swing.</p><p>Her Master was the touchstone for keeping a handle on that, helping her find the center, calm down again. Since her Master wasn\u2019t here, Jon would take care of it, at least in this moment. But he thought Ben was going to regret not doing it himself, because Marcie was as wild and strong as they came, fueled by the idealism of youth and the determination of an old soul, a lethal combination.</p><p>Faced with the choice of leaving her alone here, waiting for Ben to never show, or taking her to the office and letting her throw the gauntlet down, Jon decided he was taking her to the office. He hoped he wouldn\u2019t regret it.</p><p>I\u2019m going to fail sociology. The professor blames everything from cockroach infestation to pimples on corporate greed. I\u2019ve explained to him that corporations are run by people, which means they\u2019re as diverse and generous as whoever is managing them. I also pointed out that since individuals are the largest source of donations in the country, if they don\u2019t have jobs, which corporations provide, they can\u2019t donate. He said I was a corporate drone. He was probably sitting on his ass in his office when you guys were trucking in supplies to Gulfport, MS, after Katrina. Do you still make that industrial spray foam at the Costa Rican plant? I want to fill up his Prius like a cream horn.</p><p>Letter from Marcie, sophomore year</p><p>I\u2019ll ship you a case of it. Remember to wear gloves and don\u2019t leave fingerprints. And burn this letter. Morons like that don\u2019t realize a good teacher teaches you how to think for yourself. Their job isn\u2019t to impose their own agenda.</p><p>Ben\u2019s reply</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>When Marcie walked past Janet\u2019s desk, she could tell from her expression that the admin was surprised to see her. So he\u2019d told Janet she wasn\u2019t coming in.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just checking on a few things.\u201d</p><p>Janet gave her a handful of pink message slips. \u201cHe\u2019s on a conference call right now in Matt\u2019s office. They\u2019ll probably be in there for an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>Good. Maybe her stomach would move down from her throat and back into its proper area by then. All she\u2019d been able to handle were those eggs. Jon had packed up the leftover toast, tucking it into a sandwich bag with a small jar of the jam. He\u2019d suggested she eat some of that later. A nurturing Dom. He and Rachel were perfect for one another.</p><p>Marcie pulled out the document she\u2019d been unable to finish yesterday and got to work. Her concentration was for shit, though, so she stopped to return some of the messages. She answered the calls on her feet because her ass still hurt enough to make sitting uncomfortable. But other symptoms concerned her more. Remembering the concern in Jon\u2019s eyes as he held her, she wondered at it herself, how shaky she felt today. Her nerves were on high alert, her body vibrating like a hummingbird. She did carry a personal massager in her purse. Maybe she should take the edge off?</p><p>That vibrator stays in the nightstand drawer until I say otherwise. She shivered deliciously at the memory, the look on his face as he issued the order. He kept switching between taking over all her decisions, and wanting to cut her loose. It gave her hope and drove her crazy at once.</p><p>Her intercom buzzed. Janet. \u201cYes?\u201d Marcie asked.</p><p>\u201cMr. O\u2019Callahan says to use the pillow on the top shelf of his closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Forte isn\u2019t in the meeting.\u201d Janet\u2019s tone suggested she would very quickly tire of twenty questions. Truth, the woman was kind of scary, so Marcie thanked her and clicked off. How had he known? Was he pissed? Had she messed things up?</p><p>\u201cStop it, Marcie,\u201d she muttered. \u201cGet a grip.\u201d</p><p>Going into his office, she found the pillow on the top shelf. When she brought it down, she couldn\u2019t help herself. She pressed it to her face, inhaling his scent. She imagined him using it, the long, powerful body stretched out on the office couch. He\u2019d kick off his shoes, probably shrug out of his shirt, and then flop down, one arm casually hooked over his head, studying the ceiling as he ran through the details of whatever had kept him late enough to decide to sleep here.</p><p>Now she visualized herself curled against his body, her head propped into the valley created by that raised arm. Her fingers would play with the light mat of hair across his chest as she gazed up into that strong face. Those beautiful green eyes would shift to her, studying her from such a relaxed position. She imagined waking up together. They could pull all-nighters together, because of course she\u2019d love to work as part of his staff, his investigator.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around the pillow, hugging it to her. Folding herself down on the couch, she rested on her hip so she didn\u2019t aggravate her abused buttocks. Just a quick second to lie here, where he had been. He didn\u2019t sleep long hours, she was sure. There was such incredible energy to him.</p><p>She remembered the way he\u2019d played with the younger kids on the evenings or weekends when they all got together. He was tireless, wrestling with Nate, racing the girls on their bikes, hauling the younger ones around on his shoulders in the pool. Some of her most intense early masturbating fantasies had to do with the way his broad chest and shoulders looked with beads of water rolling down them. The way the sun played across the dark silken hair that arrowed down to his waist.</p><p>He wore those modest oversized shorts that most guys did for a swimsuit, but she preferred to imagine him in far more fitted swim trunks. Ones that would cling to his ass and groin like a second skin when he hefted himself easily out of the pool on strong arms, one of her siblings clinging to his back.</p><p>If he was lying behind her now, she\u2019d feel the hard planes of his body, that impressive groin pressed up against her ass. He\u2019d cup her breast, play with the piercing jewelry as he dozed and she got more aroused, until she was squirming against him, rubbing against his cock, waking him up on several levels. Of course he\u2019d probably grumble at her for disturbing his rest, threaten to punish her. Push her down under the blanket so she had to service his morning erection. Maybe he\u2019d let her use her hands, to cup his muscular ass, stroke the taut lines of his thighs.</p><p>Her lids were drooping. She really had slept poorly last night. She needed to get up, finish that work. Hold it all together, even though she was afraid everything was falling apart. She was just so tired... If she had a nap, she\u2019d be better off. She wasn\u2019t going to give up, even if she had to go through a hundred days like the last two. Which would technically be two hundred days...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, bitch, bitch. Stop being such a little girl about it. Think how much better production will be after the turnover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll lose about a million during the outage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could pull a million out of your ass right now. This will triple our investment in two years.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slowly, she surfaced. Where was... Oh holy hell, she\u2019d fallen asleep on the couch, apparently some time ago, because Ben was back in his office. With at least Peter and Matt, the two who\u2019d been arguing with him. Was Lucas in here? She froze, wondering if she should just keep her eyes shut and hope they hadn\u2019t noticed her. Yeah, that was likely. From the direction of Peter\u2019s voice, he was in the chair that faced the couch.</p><p>She\u2019d fallen asleep like a sleepy, trusting child, her nose nestled in his pillow, arms wrapped around it like she\u2019d wrap them around him, never wanting to let him go. God, she was like a Taylor Swift song, probably not the picture of mature woman at the moment. If they were looking at her, they\u2019d know she was awake, because she was turning the color of a tomato.</p><p>The hell with it. She opened her eyes. Peter was actually standing, leaning on the wall behind the chair, all that restless energy too out front to be contained for long in a chair. Though he\u2019d retired from the National Guard to be here for Dana, he still looked like he should be carrying an assault rifle, ready to lead a unit into a firefight. He was built like a muscular tank, and to the delight of every woman who met him, he was the one K&amp;A man who usually wore khakis or dress jeans and form-fitting heavy weight tees that emphasized that physique. Since he oversaw a lot of the plant operations, the casual look was more appropriate for him.</p><p>Matt was as intimidating and riveting as ever in his dark suit, polished shoes. He was in what Marcie privately called his raptor pose. Though he appeared relaxed, ankle on the opposite knee, hands loose on the chair arms, there was something about the position of his head, the focus of the dark eyes, that suggested he was about to swoop down five hundred feet and pluck a hapless field mouse out of a dense meadow.</p><p>Ben had his chair pushed back with one foot against the edge of the desk. He was tapping a pen against the arm. None of them were looking toward her, but they all realized she was here. They hadn\u2019t woken her. It was as if her being in Ben\u2019s office made her part of his other belongings. She wondered how Lucas would feel about that. Had he already been here? Seen her?</p><p>\u201cI have something else to handle now,\u201d Ben said, tilting his head in her direction. \u201cAre we done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hey, don\u2019t forget next Friday\u2019s benefit.\u201d Peter pushed off the wall. \u201cBlack tie. Stale finger foods, open checkbook. The girls are really looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Today was Thursday. Were they anticipating him being gone for the next seven days, such that Peter was mentioning it now? She held her tongue, though cold dread filled her stomach. Had she known him well enough to anticipate his escape out of town?</p><p>Then Peter gave him a grin. \u201cIt will take you that long to get some unlucky woman to agree to be your date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask your wife,\u201d Ben said dryly. \u201cYou know she\u2019ll choose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Keep it up, I\u2019ll wrap your oversized appendage around your throat and choke you with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you wish yours was long enough to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Matt warned in a mild voice. She knew he was a stickler about talking crude around women, at least in normal conversation. The others followed the same code, though she\u2019d always noticed Ben strayed outside the lines more than the rest.</p><p>Through Cass, she knew he\u2019d lived on the streets as a kid. Maybe that was why he slipped in the manners department more often, though she\u2019d never seen Ben treat the K&amp;A women with anything but the greatest respect. That street experience probably contributed to his versatility as a lawyer, but he\u2019d have made a good investigator as well, because he could easily adopt different personas. He\u2019d delighted her siblings with his command of accents. Cajun, Irish, Midwestern, New England. What she found interesting was how the accents would show up unconsciously when his moods changed, as if the situation called forth that particular personality.</p><p>When Matt rose and he and Peter headed toward the door, neither of them looked toward her, even though she pushed up on one elbow. Same situation as at Jon\u2019s. She was Ben\u2019s, a submissive waiting on a Master\u2019s attention, and therefore not to be acknowledged by the other Doms in the room unless it was part of the plan. Given her immediate reaction to that thought, a nap hadn\u2019t helped settle her as much as she expected.</p><p>\u201cRemember what we talked about.\u201d</p><p>Jon was in the room, standing by the door. He was addressing Ben, holding his gaze. Ben inclined his head, his mouth tight. \u201cI\u2019ll handle it the way I see fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be sure you handle it.\u201d</p><p>Okay, she\u2019d never heard Jon with that edge. Ben registered the challenge, eyes turning into shards of glass. \u201cI said I would. Back off.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded, his blue eyes just as cool. Then he turned, pulling the door closed after him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what to say. She was pretty sure that had to do with her, but she didn\u2019t know what corner of the sheet to grasp to straighten it out. Surely Jon wouldn\u2019t have told Ben what they talked about? Yes, of course he would. From her tea-party eavesdropping, she knew it caused Cass, Dana, Savannah and Rachel various levels of frustration. The well-being of their women came first, over and above issues of privacy, and all of the guys were hugely overprotective.</p><p>The Knights of the Board Room was what they\u2019d been dubbed by a columnist, years ago, and though the guys would roll their eyes if anyone brought it up, it fit. It was as much about their old-fashioned code of chivalry as it was about their behavior in business and charitable circles.</p> <p>Ben turned his chair then. She couldn\u2019t read his countenance, but he rose, came to the couch, dropped to his heels next to it. His gaze covered her face, the open neck of the pink blouse, following the lines of her body down to the tailored skirt. As his gaze came back to hers, she was warmer all over, and more flustered.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to come here today. Why did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you told me I had twenty strikes coming, and you only gave me eleven. So I still owe you nine.\u201d</p><p>His lips tugged, a sexy half-smile, but as he studied her, the smile thinned. \u201cThat was what you meant by unfinished work.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat, and that last document I didn\u2019t complete.\u201d</p><p>Ben sighed. He put his hand on her hip, and before she could anticipate him, he\u2019d slid those capable fingers to her right buttock, cupping it firmly. When she flinched, his eyes darkened. \u201cI\u2019m a sadist, Marcie,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut not that kind.\u201d His touch eased and he stroked her curves, giving her body another glance. \u201cYou have no idea what you look like, sleeping on my couch, your neckline showing that lace edge of your bra, your killer legs curved up. All this beautiful hair.\u201d His other hand threaded through it, cupping her face. \u201cCome on, get up. I\u2019m taking you out for a beignet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaf\u00e9 du Monde?\u201d Her expression brightened. She loved the view of Jackson Square, the artists, the musicians and impromptu performances.</p><p>\u201cMaybe another day. I want a good beignet, one where the dough is still handmade each day, not squirted out of a mass-production tube and served in a corral with a dirty floor and wall-to-wall tourists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. I love it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re young and stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than old and grumpy.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a pinch that made her yelp. \u201cOn your feet and leave your purse. I\u2019m paying.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou never let anyone treat you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe split the check all the time. Just not with women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexist pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOink, oink.\u201d</p><p>He took her to Caf\u00e9 Beignet, which was a few blocks off Jackson Square, but she had to admit it was more intimate and relaxed, and the beignets melted in the mouth. They enjoyed them first, though he made her order a lunch she was sure she wouldn\u2019t finish. Everyone seemed determined to make her eat.</p><p>As she finished off the last of the beignet, she was aware of his silent regard. She was licking the sugar off her fingers, because no one could resist doing that with a good beignet. She wished he\u2019d let her clean his fingers with her mouth. She\u2019d take them in deep, a clear reminder of what he\u2019d let her do for him last night. The hinge of her jaw was sore and all she wanted was to do it for him again.</p><p>Reaching across the table, he caught her wrist. Bringing her fingers to his mouth, he sucked the remaining sugar off, sending electricity crackling all the way from her wrist pulse to her toes, awakening every major erogenous center in between.</p><p>When he was done, she had that queer little shake happening again. She couldn\u2019t stop it. \u201cBen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsshh.\u201d He reached out, slid his knuckles over her temple. \u201cEasy. Just breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know why I k-keep doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Last night was your first time, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>When she would have looked away, his grip tightened. \u201cMarcie, any question I ask, you\u2019ll answer, and you won\u2019t lie to me. Not now, not ever. You understand?\u201d</p><p>She managed a nod, though her teeth started to chatter. \u201cDamn it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus on me, what I want. Answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She met his eyes, gripped their steadying influence, so her voice could stop quivering as much. \u201cI\u2019ve been to clubs, like I said. I just watched. I did a lot of Internet surfing.\u201d Plus enough fantasizing to launch an adult Disney World.</p><p>\u201cDid you go to the clubs alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took one of my friends with me the first time. She isn\u2019t into the scene, but I thought she was okay with me being that way, and would go with me to make it safer. She didn\u2019t like how...mesmerized I was by it. It kind of freaked her out. After that, she pulled away from me, and I became more careful about who saw that side of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went alone after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a few times. They were safe places, classy clubs. Then when I was in New York, Lucas\u2019 friend, Marcus Stanton, took me fairly often. He went as a chaperone,\u201d she added. \u201cHe\u2019s a great Master, but he\u2019s utterly devoted to Thomas. I got to watch them have a session, hand him things. I\u2019m not stupid, Ben.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His jaw eased a fraction. \u201cNo, but you\u2019re reckless as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the pot calling the kettle black. What do you call that death trap you drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA high-performance driving machine, an engineering piece of art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn expensive metal phallus.\u201d She snorted. He was still holding her wrist, playing with her fingers, and it was extremely distracting. She hoped he never stopped. \u201cSo are you going to take me to a club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNag, nag, nag.\u201d He sighed, sat back.</p><p>\u201cAs my mentor,\u201d she persisted. \u201cYou can show me how the deeper stuff works. We\u2019re already...I mean, I could go as your sub-in-training. You could help me.\u201d</p><p>Ben regarded her with those sharp green eyes. \u201cMarcie, do you think you can con me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Just that steady look, an unspoken correction, and butterflies swarmed. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cI\u2019m willing to give you a short mentoring period. If you\u2019re using it to get something more from me, you\u2019re setting yourself up for heartbreak. I\u2019ve no intention of taking things beyond that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She met that stare dead on now. \u201cAm I not good enough for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for that. Not with you.\u201d</p><p>In her lap, her hands curled into fists. \u201cBen, do you think you can con me?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. Something dark moved in his expression, something more than a little bit scary, but there were things that scared her far worse than pissing Ben off.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to rip your fucking heart from your chest to prove my point, Marcie? Do I have to break you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. You won\u2019t. Give it your best shot.\u201d He could probably hear the rabbit thumping of her heart, but she\u2019d have a full-scale cardiac arrest before she\u2019d back down. \u201cIt\u2019s all bullshit,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s looking for that. You\u2019d walk through Hell for me, for Cassandra, for every member of your family. But I\u2019m not the one afraid of surrendering myself fully. You are.\u201d</p><p>That darkness became something full blown, something ugly, lonely and violent. Then it was gone, the smooth lawyer back in place. It was a startling transformation, one that made her more uncomfortable than she wanted to admit.</p><p>He sat back now, picked up his beer. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d he said casually. \u201cBecause if you want me to mentor you, full surrender is what I\u2019m going to demand. As well as full honesty. How did you know how to do what you did last night? You weren\u2019t new to it.\u201d Something deadly entered his gaze again, only this time it had an erotic edge to it. \u201cWho taught you to take a dick that size down your throat, in your ass?\u201d</p><p>Thank God they were in a quiet corner. He\u2019d spoken in a low voice, but some words just had a way of carrying. She kept her gaze fastened on his, sure she\u2019d be mortified into speechlessness if any heads turned.</p><p>\u201cThere was no who, not exactly. I went to chat rooms, asked questions. Talked to Thomas because...\u201d She stopped. She was pretty forward, but she wasn\u2019t sure she could finish that statement.</p><p>\u201cBecause when you were in the club you noticed Marcus is pretty good sized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She pressed her lips into a line. \u201cI also talked to Dana.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Dana...she\u2019s seen you. I mean, not seen you, since she\u2019s blind, but her tactile senses...\u201d</p><p>Despite Ben\u2019s black cloud expression, she suddenly had to fight against a laugh, remembering some of Dana\u2019s more colorful descriptions. \u201cBefore that, I eavesdropped a lot. All of them\u2014Dana, Rachel, Cass and Savannah\u2014have been meeting for third Sunday tea at Cassandra\u2019s house since they came into your lives.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks colored. \u201cSo I practiced. Mostly on inanimate objects.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was best if he didn\u2019t ask further questions. If CSI had seen the back of her dorm closet they would have profiled her as a full-blown stalker. That was where she hid all her notes, pictures, articles and other data on him\u2014particularly those letters. She\u2019d run copies of them so she could make notes, underline certain parts. Yeah, that would seem a little stalker-crazy.</p><p>Except she knew her prey. If she wanted him, she had to come prepared. He was the first investigation she\u2019d ever undertaken, and the longest she\u2019d pursued. She knew how wrong it was, a submissive stalking a Master, but she hadn\u2019t known how else to go about it.</p><p>If she could crack Ben O\u2019Callahan, get him to claim her for his own, everything else would be a cinch. She could uncover secrets that would bring down governments. Or build new ones.</p><p>He could look at her like she was a stalker\u2014which was sort of what he was doing now\u2014but she knew she wasn\u2019t. The letters gave her confidence, the full picture. At a key point, she\u2019d known she had his heart, no matter that he was trying to convince her that its weight in her hands was an illusion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay at my Garden District place tonight,\u201d he said, startling her. \u201cI\u2019m taking the day off tomorrow. We\u2019ll spend the day preparing you, then we\u2019ll go to Progeny in the evening. And that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Her mind raced over the possibilities. She couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d agreed to the club, let alone an overnight at his house. \u201cYou want me to stay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t read too much into it,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cI\u2019ve decided you can\u2019t be trusted on your own until this is resolved.\u201d</p><p>That pricked her ire a little, but she pushed it down. \u201cI think I can probably handle one night at your place,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>In point of fact, she could cartwheel from Royal Street all the way to his house. Or, more appropriately, walk on her knees...if he required that.</p><p>They returned to work and finished out the day, though Ben made her use that pillow while she completed the paperwork for him. While she was on her best behavior, infallibly professional, her blood was simmering below the surface every time she stole a look at him. Working at his desk, moving around the office talking on his hands-free, interacting with the others as they came in and out for different things. She would be spending the night at Ben\u2019s. The idea of it, of what might happen, made her flushed and high strung, though she did her best to cover it.</p><p>When the day was over, instead of taking his car, they took the trolley. Marcie had never appreciated how narrow the wooden two-seat bench was. Ben necessarily stretched a long arm across the back, pressing her against his side, his thigh against her leg as they clattered along the track from downtown. Though she\u2019d grown up in Baton Rouge, she was well acquainted with New Orleans. Still, it had been awhile since she was here.</p><p>She enjoyed recalling the landmarks as they went along, the crush of people wandering Canal Street, that view streamlining into St. Charles\u2019 never-ending offering of restaurants. Each had a unique flair, like bohemian middle-aged women, old enough to be comfortable and confident in their skin, yet young enough to exude color and style. As they passed through the religious school district, she saw a few students still on the grounds in their uniforms of crisp white shirts and navy pants or skirts.</p><p>Ben had them get off at Audubon Park to join the joggers and cyclists along the walkways there. In the quiet nooks where statues and gazebos sat by the water, they occasionally glimpsed homeless people camped, absorbing the tranquility the way they were. Ben guided her hand into the crook of his elbow, and they strolled that way. She imagined them doing it a hundred years ago, her in petticoats and a stylish hat, him in a suit that wouldn\u2019t differ too much from what he wore now, at least in cut and style. The man did know how to dress.</p><p>\u201cYour work today impressed me,\u201d Ben said. \u201cThe Kelly-Bergerson brief was pretty much perfect. I\u2019ve had rookie lawyers serving under me who don\u2019t have your command of the terminology.\u201d</p><p>She warmed to the praise. \u201cI\u2019m good at business languages. My roommate at college was pre-med. To help her memorize, I\u2019d string together her medical terms in a dirty way. Want to hear?\u201d</p><p>Ben quirked a brow at her. \u201cIs your mind always in the gutter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than yours. Besides, it was for a good cause, to help her become a better doctor.\u201d Marcie nodded to a shirtless jogger who passed them. \u201cHis rectus abdominis is well defined, but his external obliques still need work. Though his rectus femoris just invites the tongue.\u201d</p><p>His gaze glinted. \u201cCareful, there.\u201d</p><p>Marcie freed her hands to clasp them together, sighing with dramatic effect. \u201cHis phalanges gripped her pes anserinus to pry them apart. Pushing his rectus femoris into her gluetus maximus, her pubic symphysis was pinned against the bed. He forced his pollicis into her suboccipitals, pressing her frontal bone into the mattress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think romance fiction has anything to worry about from you.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cI might open up a whole new field. Doctors reading romance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019d prefer the layman terms. Otherwise, it would be a busman\u2019s holiday.\u201d</p><p>When they left the park, they strolled along the broken sidewalks that led them into the residential areas. Tilting her head back, she studied the thick waterfall of colorful beads hanging from the oaks, competing with the Spanish moss. \u201cI love that they let these stay in the trees.\u201d Reaching up, she tried to snag a pretty silver strand, but she was too short. She gave a valiant hop, putting all her effort into it, and her fingertips brushed it. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, brat. Little tease.\u201d He bent, wrapped his arms beneath her buttocks and boosted her up his body to give her the extra head of height she needed. Marcie caught the beads, untangled them and drew down two, a silver and a shiny green. She was hyper-conscious of his arms around her, the way her mound pressed into his abdomen. When she looked down, bracing her hands on his shoulders, she could tell he wasn\u2019t unaffected either. He let her slide down his body but kept her close until she rested between his feet. His hands adjusted downward, way low on her waist, curling over the tops of her buttocks, pinching the folds of her skirt between his fingertips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI could have done it with a few more jumps,\u201d she defended herself. \u201cIt\u2019s just about building momentum. But your help was appreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He stared down at her, and the unfathomable look quieted her. Dropping the silver strand over her head, she put the green on him. Her fingers slipped over his hair, touched his neck and ears, rested on his shoulders when she was done, her thumbs touching his throat because he\u2019d loosened his tie, unbuttoned the collar. Because he didn\u2019t say not to do it, she stroked that small expanse of skin, scratched it with her nail.</p><p>His gaze heated, his hands dropping to take a firm hold of her ass, kneading, no matter the passing cars or sidewalk pedestrians. There weren\u2019t so many of those here, but the occasional matronly dog walker could make her more self-conscious than the anonymity and colorful nature of a big Canal Street crowd.</p> <p>It was exactly why he did it. She knew it was a test. So she didn\u2019t look around, didn\u2019t squirm away. Fortunately, the passing hours and his and Rachel\u2019s combined tending had made her buttocks far less sore. \u201cI\u2019m going to do something now,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I\u2019m doing it, you tell me what goes through that imaginative brain of yours.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his head, he nudged hers to the side with the touch of his mouth on her temple. Turning her face toward his broad shoulder, pressing her nose into the smooth line of his dress shirt over his pectoral, she shuddered as his mouth landed on the juncture of her throat and shoulder. He bit her there, a controlled motion, teeth slowly depressing as his tongue stroked her. Her breath shortened, and she almost forgot to do what he\u2019d told her to do.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re winding a rope wrap from below my knees to my ankles.\u201d Her trembling increased as the pressure did, the clamp of the bite. \u201cYou do the same to my arms, from wrists to elbows, behind my back. My breasts...they\u2019re thrust way out because of that. So you do a binding there as well, one rope above, one below, a crossed knot in the middle, and then you attach that to the arm wrap. You put me over your shoulder, completely helpless. You take me to a sofa, bend me over the arm and...\u201d</p><p>He relaxed his jaw, then started that depression again, interfering with her ability to think. His fingers were kneading her ass in rhythmic squeezes, and she was leaned into him, pressing her mound harder against him, sensation clenching in her pussy.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Marcie. Say it the way you know I want to hear it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d fuck me in the ass until I was screaming to come, biting the cushions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I let you, or make you suffer? Make you beg?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, though her fingers were digging into his biceps, holding on. God, how did he do this so well? \u201cI\u2019d come at your command, right now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt takes awhile for a sub to learn how to do that. Come at her Master\u2019s command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if she\u2019s been practicing for seven years.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. She cursed herself for reminding him of that time when she was too young for him, since it underlined his belief that she was still too young for him. But it was true. In her fantasies, she\u2019d work herself up with fingers or vibrator, but she wouldn\u2019t come, not until he was standing in her mind, real and strong and tall, commanding her to do so.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll test that.\u201d He lifted his head then, brushing the abused area with his mouth before he adjusted her blouse back over it. He tweaked the green beads on his neck. \u201cWhy green?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey match your eyes. Sort of. They\u2019re sparkly and your eyes have fire, especially right now.\u201d She looked up into his face, her own flushed, and her eyes pretty much on fire as well, she was sure. \u201cI want to do that for you. I want to come for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me what you want, Marcie, but I run things, not you. You understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ma\u2014sir.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t mess it up, would play the game the way he wanted to play it, even if that made her dishonest.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, but he slid an arm around her, resuming their walk.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve become a homeowner since I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d she teased him. \u201cAn apartment in the Warehouse District and a house in the Garden District. When I was in high school, you were living in hotels.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cA hotel has concierge and maid service, dry cleaning. Choose one within walking distance to a good breakfast and dinner place, and you\u2019re all set. But property is a good investment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why not rent them out and keep living in the hotels?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are times I have the desire for privacy.\u201d He gave her an appraising look that sent heat washing over her.</p><p>\u201cI figured you bought them so you could have a fully stocked kitchen.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNot as important as it used to be.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said he still brought a dish to the monthly dinners with the whole K&amp;A family. But when she was in high school, he\u2019d made her family meals all the time, taught any of the kids to cook who wanted to learn. Since Marcie had a driver\u2019s license, she was in charge of grocery shopping after school. He\u2019d text her cell, instructing her on what he needed and expecting her to have it waiting for him at the house when he arrived after work.</p><p>Watching him cook was like everything else about him. A visual feast. He\u2019d go through the groceries she bought, examine all of them carefully. He\u2019d taught her how to pick out something at the right freshness, the brands that were better quality than others. He teased her, giving her a hard time if she brought him the wrong stuff. He\u2019d affect a French accent, throwing up his hands and exclaiming, \u201cI cannot work in theez coundiseeons...\u201d In truth, the man could make an awesome meal out of a bag of flour and a tin can of sardines.</p><p>He\u2019d taught her to cook the basics, but she\u2019d been hopeless when it came to anything more complex. A truly great cook had an intimate relationship with the ingredients, understanding flavors and textures in a wandering, intuitive way she was far too literal and goal-oriented to ever comprehend. She preferred to provide the artist the supplies, watch him work and enjoy the fruits of his labor.</p><p>Now he said a kitchen \u201cwasn\u2019t as important as it used to be\u201d. From that tightening around his mouth, she could tell they were getting into a tricky area. Not wanting to lose ground, she changed direction. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive, eating out all the time. Until Lucas married Cass, we only did it on really special occasions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, taking all of you out for a meal was like taking out an army of meerkats. You can hardly blame her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were very good,\u201d she protested. \u201cYou were the one asked to leave the McDonald\u2019s play area for getting too aggressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my fault those five-year-olds couldn\u2019t handle a little competition. That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with America these days. Raising a bunch of pansies who don\u2019t want to win.\u201d</p><p>She pinched his side, but was gratified when he brought her closer. She threaded her arm around his waist, under his jacket, and he didn\u2019t discourage her. It was easier to walk that way, after all. His body was a sinuous ripple of motion under the shirt as he walked. She curled her fingers over his belt, held on.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of dinner, let\u2019s get some before we head for the house.\u201d He gestured to a restaurant across the street. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He kept pressure on her waist, holding her still until he was okay with their clearance, then they crossed the street. She\u2019d known how to cross the street on her own for some time, of course, but it didn\u2019t offend her. In truth, such gestures could be devastating to a woman\u2019s senses. All the more because Ben was oblivious to their potency. From watching Cass and the others, she\u2019d learned it wasn\u2019t about denigrating a woman\u2019s independence. It had nothing to do with the men\u2019s opinion of female capability, but everything to do with their absolute conviction that a man\u2019s role was to protect and cherish.</p><p>The restaurant was one she hadn\u2019t tried before, an elegant place with full-length white table cloths, candlelight. The walls were pre-twentieth-century brick covered with artwork by local talent, and the place had the smell that the old, historic buildings did. A jazz band was jamming in the corner, filling the place with music. Ben had the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 show them to the upstairs level and a corner table on the balcony, though the round table could seat six. They could hear the music vibrating through their feet and drifting up the wide staircase, without their conversation being overpowered by it.</p><p>\u201cIf Noah\u2019s working tonight, I want him as our server,\u201d Ben told the ma\u00eetre d\u2019.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mr. O\u2019Callahan.\u201d</p><p>Ben held out the chair that was tucked in the corner, touching her shoulders briefly before he took his own seat next to her. \u201cAny allergies?\u201d he asked as the man disappeared down the stairs.</p><p>She shook her head. When she would have opened her menu, Ben took it away, sliding it under his own. \u201cTake off your panties,\u201d he said.</p><p>Just like that, he took the reins, told her they were now Master and slave. Or Mentor and sub-in-training\u2014to him. Either way, her body responded accordingly, with aching need and anxiety fluttering in her belly. Though it was difficult to do without rising, she worked the panties off under the snug skirt.</p><p>\u201cHand them to me. No balling them up.\u201d</p><p>No one was up here, but he\u2019d anticipated her self-consciousness. There were people wandering the street below the balcony, looking up to study the diners. As attractive as Ben was, he\u2019d probably get his share of looks. He wanted to see if she\u2019d quake. Instead, steeling herself to be whatever he required, she hung them on one finger, let them dangle provocatively and extended them to him. His lips twisted, and he took them from her. Her face colored as he raised them to his lips, his nostrils flaring, taking in her heated scent. \u201cThese are wet. Who\u2019s been making you wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Only you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure that jogger\u2019s femoris didn\u2019t do it for you?\u201d His tone was serious, despite the flash of humor. But either way, she\u2019d give him no less than honesty. Not when he was completely in command like this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes sir. You made me wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I want your skirt up around your waist, your bare ass on the chair. Spread your knees out and hook your ankles around the chair legs to keep them that way. Tell me if the position becomes physically uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>The reason he\u2019d put her in the corner seat became obvious, since he was flanking her on one side, and the balcony rail and a profusion of potted plants were on the other. The table cloth was floor length, so it was pooled over her lap. But if the waiter moved around the table to grate pepper over her salad or refill her drink, he might see her skirt up, bare ass pressed to the chair\u2019s wooden surface.</p><p>Ben watched her follow his direction. \u201cMight teach you to wear a looser skirt to work next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen whose ass would you stare at? Janet\u2019s? Even you\u2019re not that brave.\u201d She scraped the chair legs across the metal floor as she wiggled and managed it. The wooden seat reminded her of last night\u2019s punishment but, thanks to Rachel\u2019s balm, she could make full contact with it.</p><p>\u201cCenter yourself between two of the chair slats. I want your cunt right over an opening so you can feel the air flow.\u201d It was impossible to discern what he was thinking, his face impassive, voice even. Whereas she was getting more flustered with every word he spoke.</p><p>When she was in the proscribed position, her legs were spread, ankles hooked on the chair legs as he required, pussy exposed to the cool night air. Reaching out, he slipped the next button of her blouse so he had a better view of her breasts, cradled in lace. He stroked a finger over the top of the right one. Oh God. She had a feeling those two words were going to go through her mind quite a bit tonight, no matter how much trouble it gave her with the Higher Power. Hopefully, He understood. He\u2019d made Ben, after all.</p><p>\u201cHold the chair sides by your thighs unless I tell you otherwise.\u201d He tucked the panties into his pocket, unhurried, even as their waiter topped the stairs. Another second and he would have seen what Ben held.</p><p>Noah was a Goth, complete with eyeliner and tongue stud. He wore the white shirt and slacks the restaurant required, but the tie was a pencil-thin black silk, the tack a tiny skull and crossbones. His hair was long and smooth, tied back from a slim, well-sculpted face. With all that and his thin, sensual lips, he made her think of a young vampire.</p><p>When he saw Ben, he smiled with genuine pleasure. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you, Mr. O\u2019Callahan.\u201d He gave Marcie a courteous nod, a quick appraisal that was flattering but not insulting, then cocked a brow at Ben. \u201cYou\u2019re not classy enough for this one. Is she slumming tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere goes your tip,\u201d Ben said dryly. \u201cI\u2019ll take the grilled porterhouse. She\u2019ll have the seared shrimp, and start us off with the goat-cheese salads.\u201d He added a few more instructions related to the cooking of the meat and the spices that would be used. He didn\u2019t ask Marcie her preferences, and of course she wasn\u2019t sure she could have made an intelligent response, regardless.</p><p>Her exposed sex was being teased by a rippling breeze moving over the balcony and coming up from the first level, filtering through the slim seams of the metal flooring, which allowed rainwater to flow out. Her breasts weren\u2019t graphically exposed, but as he bent to retrieve the menus, Noah\u2019s gaze slid briefly over the curves.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have those drinks and salads brought right back up, Mr. O\u2019Callahan.\u201d</p><p>Ben nodded. As the waiter headed back down the stairs, he stretched his arm over the back of her chair, touched her nape. \u201cKeep your back straight, Marcie.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d hunched a little under Noah\u2019s perusal. She sent herself a mental slap for that one, tossing her hair back and giving Ben a smile as she made sure those breasts stood out high and proud for her Master. Then she almost swallowed her tongue as he put his other elbow on the table and traced a finger along the bra edge again, only this time he dipped into the cup, rubbed over her nipple. It was already puckered and eager. She pushed her ass harder into the chair, against the dull cut of those slats. It wanted to rise up, to communicate the throbbing desire from her pussy with a shameless undulation.</p><p>\u201cStay still. I expect you to behave, act like a good girl, even if you are a brazen slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me into one.\u201d She locked everything down, trying to obey. \u201cLike Lucas said, you\u2019re a corrupting influence.\u201d</p><p>His heavy-lidded green eyes were close, his firm mouth. \u201cBullshit. That pussy of yours is greedy for cock.\u201d</p><p>Your cock. But she didn\u2019t say it, knowing not to spar with him in this realm. When his hand dropped beneath the table\u2019s edge, she almost came off the chair as he calmly fingered her clit, slipping down to stroke the wetness of the labia. \u201cTilt your hips so I can reach your cunt.\u201d</p><p>She did, clenching the sides of the chair as he slid a finger in her, then two, then\u2014holy God\u2014three.</p><p>\u201cSo fucking wet,\u201d he rumbled in her ear, brushing his mouth beneath it, against her pounding pulse. \u201cTonight I\u2019m going to put you on your knees. You\u2019re going to suck me off, and when I\u2019m about to come, you\u2019re going to turn around, put your forehead to the floor, and I\u2019ll fuck your ass. I may not ever let you come. Keep you this fucking desperate to please me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d She whispered it, closing her eyes as he withdrew his touch, then pushed in again, emulating what his cock could do there. Because she was tight and it was a narrow angle, it made it all the more excruciating.</p> <p>Sliding his fingers free, he brought them to her mouth. She licked herself off them. Without prompting, she picked up her napkin, finished wiping them off using some of the water from her water glass. It wouldn\u2019t do for her Master to have sticky fingers while he tried to eat.</p><p>\u201cAn anticipatory sub. Sometimes that can get you into trouble.\u201d</p><p>She paused, remembering her thoughts about that last night. Her fingers lay on his. \u201cDoes taking care of you when you need it get me in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not right now.\u201d As his eyes flickered with some unfathomable emotion, she returned her hands to the sides of her chair. Noah came back with their goat-cheese salads, arranged on attractive teal-blue square plates. When he poured their wine, she noted Ben stopped him when her glass was no more than a third full. She didn\u2019t hold alcohol well, was pretty much loose as a sun-warmed snake after two glasses. Given the night that was ahead of her, that might not be a bad idea, but with Ben and their battle of wills, she needed all her wits around her. And it was obvious Ben intended her to feel the full edge of anything he did to her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Noah.\u201d Ben nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like an extra service, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, Mr. O\u2019Callahan.\u201d</p><p>Ben turned his attention to Marcie. Instinct had her lowering her gaze instead of locking with his. When his next words came, she was glad for it.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go down on my companion here, under the tablecloth. If she comes within three minutes, there\u2019s a hundred-dollar tip in it for you.\u201d</p><p>She was pretty certain she paled and flushed at once, a medical impossibility, but Ben leaned in, his hand sliding under her hair to tighten on her neck. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if you come on a Master\u2019s command, or if you\u2019re a mindless slut, just as I suspect. And when you come,\u201d he drew closer, his breath teasing her lips, her cheek, \u201cI expect you to scream. Hold nothing back. The fact we\u2019re in public doesn\u2019t matter. Only what I desire does.\u201d</p><p>Okay, she\u2019d never done anything like this. Sure, she\u2019d fantasized about exhibitionism, but the reality was way different. As it moved into evening, the people on the sidewalks below were turning into larger groups. More patrons would eventually be brought out onto the balcony, given that it was a really nice night. If she wanted to stop, if it was too much, she was pretty sure Ben would stop, but that would mean she\u2019d backed down. His usual subs would do a strip tease in the middle of Jackson Square if he commanded it.</p><p>Her throat was dry, so it came out as a whisper. \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>When Ben gave him a nod, Noah put the tray on the adjacent table. With a graceful movement of lean male strength, he squatted and disappeared fully beneath their round table. When his hands touched her spread knees, Marcie tensed, she couldn\u2019t help it. She heard a muttered, reverent, \u201cJesus, she\u2019s got a gorgeous pussy,\u201d and clutched the chair, a tiny sound of protest coming from her throat.</p><p>\u201cBen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, Noah.\u201d Ben was studying her face. His fingers on her nape were stroking. \u201cGive her a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d Noah\u2019s voice was muffled as his mouth brushed her inner thigh, a gentle reassurance. His fingers slid down her calf, more calming caresses.</p><p>Unless this was a hard limit for her, it was obvious Ben was going to proceed with it, but he was giving her time. Plus an unexpected reassurance. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to touch you whom I didn\u2019t trust,\u201d he said, his fingers tightening on the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d It was just so much, so fast. But she could handle it. She leaned her face into his hand, wished he would keep touching her. But Ben was a ruthless Master, she knew that. As soon as he could tell she was ready, he settled back in his chair, picking up his wine. Ready for the show he\u2019d orchestrated.</p><p>\u201cProceed, Noah. Three minutes.\u201d</p><p>It took everything she had not to whip her legs out from behind the chair legs and close them, but Noah helped. He settled his grip on her quivering thighs, steadying and holding them open at once, and then he went right to the heart of the matter. She sucked in a breath, biting down on her lip. Holy God...the tongue stud vibrated. He played over her pussy lips with it, letting her get used to the feel of it, tickling her a little so she had to work hard not to squirm, and then he brought it right to her clit.</p><p>She sucked in a breath. He knew his business, working it against her in tiny movements that had her already aroused body rocketing up a ramp, set to take off and explode. She saw Ben\u2019s attention on her exposed breasts, the way they were vibrating with that compressed movement. She couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t move, but oh God, she wanted to rise up, grind her pussy in Noah\u2019s face, throw her head back against the chair. But her Master didn\u2019t tell her she could come. Three minutes, three minutes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Three minutes was an eternity when she couldn\u2019t count the seconds. Ben had a watch but it was under the cuff of his sleeve. She had no doubt he was counting it down in his head like a freaking NASA computer.</p><p>I serve my Master, I serve him, I serve you...</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she was whispering it until she saw Ben\u2019s eyes darken, his mouth tighten. She was fighting with all she had against the orgasm. Noah was incredibly insistent. It was a battle of mind over matter. She imagined her clit encased in stone, all those sensations ricocheting against the inside, unable to be released, so she was imprisoned in this frenzy of need. Her fingernails cut into the chair, her thighs shaking under Noah\u2019s hands so that the chair made staccato noises on the metal balcony floor.</p><p>\u201cI serve you...please, Master...let me come for you...\u201d</p><p>Ben set down his wine, picked up his fork, took a bite of the salad, chewed. He necessarily took his eyes from her for the moment he had to do that, but then he studied her with a detachment that was anything but. His whole focus was on her, a heated intensity coming from him that vibrated against her body like that tongue stud. He continued to eat the salad, obviously considering the taste and texture as he monitored her reactions. The Knights were the only men in the world she knew who could multi-task, and they did it as if Lucifer himself had given them the ability.</p><p>She was whimpering, her whole body making tiny little jerks. Her nipples were so hard she could feel the way they stabbed the inside of her bra, constricting the barbell piercings so they added to the sensation.</p><p>Noah got creative, doing swirls and flicks, kneading the inside of her thighs, his thumbs tracing the crease of her buttocks beneath her pussy. It was too much...she couldn\u2019t hold on, yes she could. She would. She fiercely concentrated on all those masturbating fantasies, where she\u2019d made herself wait longer and longer, until Ben\u2019s imagined command to release.</p><p>Ben slid the fork from his lips. His mouth was glistening from the oil of the salad, and she wanted to suck on that. Instead, he shifted forward. Plucking the blouse away from her body, he eased the fork into the bra cup, brought it over the nipple and pressed down, caging it behind those tines. She couldn\u2019t hold on any more. Fuck...</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Marcie. Come now.\u201d</p><p>She would have screamed to raise the dead throughout New Orleans, she trusted him that much, wanted to surrender to him that much, but as she opened her mouth to do so, Ben covered it with his. He dropped the fork, cupped her head in one hand, his tight hold making her keep her position, bound by his will. She screamed into his mouth, shuddering, convulsing as Noah kept working her, holding her open with those surprisingly strong hands. Involuntary reaction took over and she struggled against their combined hold like a wild animal.</p><p>She came down in fits and starts, pleading nonsense in Ben\u2019s mouth, which he answered with unintelligible rumbles of response. Noah cleaned her up with strong licks of his now non-vibrating tongue, and then she felt the gentle pat of the wine towel he\u2019d had. When he came back up, as graceful as he\u2019d gone down, his hair was a tad rumpled and his face was flushed. He was also sporting a nice erection behind his slacks that didn\u2019t seem to discomfit him in the slightest. He nodded to her, turned his attention to Ben. \u201cI failed, sir. My apologies.\u201d</p><p>Ben palmed some money from his coat, handed it over. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a failure. My compliments on your perseverance. Tell the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 others can be seated up here now.\u201d</p><p>Marcie was too dazed to do more than watch Noah go, but when she looked toward Ben, she somehow found her voice. \u201cHow...did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix minutes, twelve seconds. You\u2019re still a slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I proved I\u2019m your slut, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Her voice had a rasp from the strain to her vocal cords.</p><p>\u201cTime to eat your salad,\u201d he said in quiet reproof, but he didn\u2019t deny it. Picking up his fork, he fed her. She needed that, because she was sure she wasn\u2019t steady enough to coordinate eating utensils. Her swollen folds were pressed against the wood, sending aftershocks rippling through her.</p><p>She wished she could stay mindless. As rationality returned, she was thinking of the seamless choreography of that scene. He\u2019d done this before. Brought another woman here, maybe had her perform the same way for him.</p><p>She stopped chewing, pulled her face away, ostensibly to get a drink of wine. He reached to steady the glass for her, but she shook her head. \u201cI can do it.\u201d She took it in about three swallows, but when she reached for the bottle to refill it, he moved it away.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll make yourself sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I do against the others?\u201d</p><p>Why did she say that aloud? She couldn\u2019t be petulant and jealous. He wasn\u2019t a monk. For heaven\u2019s sake, she\u2019d seen him fuck three women less than two weeks ago. It wasn\u2019t that. It was that he\u2019d done to her something he\u2019d done before, like she was some kind of mimeograph.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Sorry. Mentor-sub thing, no commitment. Forgot.\u201d She tried to keep the acid out of her tone, but of course she was unsuccessful. She was going to screw this up so badly if she couldn\u2019t sit on her mouth. Hell, she\u2019d held out six minutes against Noah\u2019s tongue. It shouldn\u2019t be harder to sit on her emotional reactions than her physical ones, right?</p> <p>\u201cNoah is a regular at Progeny. He has a couple Mistresses who favor him, but he doesn\u2019t belong exclusively to any of them yet. Occasionally he\u2019s assisted me with a session there. This is the first time I\u2019ve asked him to help me outside those walls, in this particular way, though I have come here for dinner before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She nodded. Picking up the napkin, she tried a quick dab at her eyes, to take care of the stress tears from the climax. She probably looked a sight.</p><p>\u201cMarcie, did I tell you that you could remove your hands from the chair?\u201d</p><p>Fuck, he hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d been so dazed by the past few minutes, she\u2019d just blanked on it. Setting aside the napkin, she returned her hands to the chair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let it pass, but only because you\u2019re still disoriented. I like it. Flushed and dazed, nipples still hard, and I can smell your cunt. Just the way I want you.\u201d He took his own napkin, dipped it in water as she\u2019d done for his fingers. While she trembled from an entirely different reaction this time, he dabbed at her mascara. He stroked the cloth over her cheeks, the corners of her mouth. Even swiped at her nose, teasing her as she started to giggle and tried to squirm away from him. Then he lifted one of her hands from the chair, tucked the napkin into it so she could do that part for herself.</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019ve handled the appetizer course,\u201d he said, \u201ceat the rest of your salad. You can lift both hands.\u201d</p><p>She had to get back on her game, but she remained unsettled, hyperaware that she was still exposed, open to him as he desired. In fact, as he was eating his salad, he settled his other hand on her thigh, stroking it up high. Her pussy was as attentive to him as if she hadn\u2019t just come. He was going to have her ready again in no time.</p><p>\u201cWhy anal sex?\u201d she asked, just as the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 topped the stairs with another couple. Marcie bit her lip, but fortunately, it didn\u2019t seem they\u2019d been paying attention. So she decided not to be deterred, particularly when the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 seated them at the other end of the balcony. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to ask. Will you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Finishing his salad, Ben leaned back, picked up his wine. She continued to eat, giving him time, but his silence was encouraging. Usually he said no right off if he had no intention of answering a question.</p><p>\u201cMost women have had sex by the time they reach legal age,\u201d he said at last, \u201cat least in the usual ways. A lot still haven\u2019t had anal sex. Or, if they have, the guy had no clue what he was doing, so it left the woman feeling pretty neutral or, worse, it hurt like hell. She\u2019s nervous about that region for that or a variety of other reasons, unaware of what a pleasure zone it can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also a lot of emotional reaction trapped in that area,\u201d Marcie observed. When Ben gave her a look, she shrugged. \u201cPenetration would unlock it. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s a big draw for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? How so?\u201d</p><p>She ignored the trace of sarcasm as he invited her to tell her about himself. Wiping her lips delicately, she raised her gaze to his. \u201cGetting a submissive to trust you, make herself vulnerable that way, challenges your ability as a Dom, and you like a challenge.\u201d</p><p>He flashed her that feral smile, a baring of teeth. \u201cActually, the main perk is not giving her a chance to claim I knocked her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Having a little Ben running around is a scary thought.\u201d She considered him. \u201cYou want her to trust you, but you don\u2019t trust her. Doing it face-to-face makes it more emotionally naked for both participants. With the anal, you\u2019re stripping her down, taking her to a more vulnerable place, but you\u2019re staying removed. Untouched.\u201d</p><p>His expression flickered. \u201cA fair point. But it\u2019s a conscious decision. I\u2019m not looking to be touched.\u201d</p><p>She knew it was an attempt to tease, but the edge to his voice made his play on words a mockery, a warning to back off. She should leave it there, but she wasn\u2019t one of his club subs, or some trainee groupie so overwhelmed by him she\u2019d be driven away by that formidable exterior. Be who you are. Jon\u2019s voice was in her ears, giving her enough courage to really fuck this up.</p><p>\u201cWhen my brothers and sisters were little, you acted like a clown with them, wrestling, playing games. Matt and all of you took us to carnivals, ren faires, things like that. They loved it. But in your own life, you don\u2019t really go for relaxed fun, do you? I mean, you go out with the K&amp;A guys, drink, do the male-bonding thing, but have you ever gone to a carnival and held your girlfriend\u2019s hand? You seem really focused on your career, the next goal, the next project. You play hard, but you don\u2019t play fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He raised a brow. \u201cIs this based on your burgeoning career as my stalker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not denying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a girlfriend, Marcie.\u201d</p> <p>Noah returned then to top off their wine, give them the status on their dinners. His hair was smoothed once again, his lips no longer glistening with her juices, but it was impossible not to remember what he\u2019d been doing to her during the appetizer course. He gave her a slow smile when their eyes met, but he deferred to Ben on whether they required anything else at the moment, not asking her preferences. He knew how this game was played as well, and it was as distracting as all the rest of it.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t be distracted from this. No girlfriend. Thirty-two and he\u2019d never sought a long-term relationship with anyone but the men with whom he worked. Even the women with whom the society column paired him for short durations were superficial, brief hook-ups with physical benefits for them both.</p><p>His mother had abandoned him in an alley outside a church when he was three, old enough to remember her. After that, he\u2019d been in and out of foster-care situations, most of them bad, as if he\u2019d been born with an unlucky star over his head. Before he hit puberty, he was on the street. It was then that star finally changed. He\u2019d picked Jonas Kensington\u2019s pocket and gotten caught in the act by Matt\u2019s savvy father.</p><p>Even though things got better for him after that, his childhood hadn\u2019t been the kind where he kissed the pretty girl in his third grade class by the monkey bars, or hoped someone would ask him to the Sadie Hawkins dance in middle school.</p><p>She cocked her head, making sure her face didn\u2019t reflect the compassion she felt toward that boy. The man before her didn\u2019t need pity, not like that. He\u2019d overcome, made something of himself, yet it had come at a cost. The cost was the wall she kept hitting, she knew that. She didn\u2019t have a psychology degree, only her intuition and her determination that she could love him like no one else\u2014if he would just let her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be your girlfriend then,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cYou can take me to a carnival. We can share a broken coin necklace, pass notes during work. I\u2019ll even take you to prom. If you promise to put out. Won\u2019t be worth my time otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Crossing his arms to lean on the table, he considered her at an intimate distance. The curve of those lips, the warmth that entered his gaze, eased some of her trepidation that she was treading dangerous waters. \u201cWhat kind of notes would you pass me at work? Ones with Xs and Os, a lipstick mark pressed to the paper?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an arch look. He hadn\u2019t let her bring her wallet, but she\u2019d balked at not bringing some toiletries. Fishing her lipstick out of her small bag, she freshened her lips, cognizant of the way he watched the soft give of her mouth against the color. Then she pressed it to one of the extra napkins Noah had left by the bread basket. Pulling out a pen, she put a couple Xs and Os around it with a flourish and pushed it over to him. \u201cThere. We\u2019ll have to do the coin thing another time.\u201d She paused. \u201cDo you still have the collar you took off me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want it back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but only if you\u2019re putting it on me.\u201d She raised her chin.</p><p>\u201cNot our agreement.\u201d His impassive expression returned and he sat back to sip his wine once more.</p> <p>She pressed her moist lips together. She couldn\u2019t make this dinner about that. So she looked over the potted plants to gaze at the mural painted on the building across the street. It was of a trio of black musicians, blue and white dogs dancing around them. As whimsical as it was, her eye was caught by something much closer, on the rail, screened by the fern. \u201cBen, look.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. She started to rise to shift out of his view, but his firm touch on her elbow kept her sitting, reminding her of her exposed state from the waist down. Instead, he stood to look over her shoulder as she twisted around for a better view.</p><p>It was a pair of bright green salamanders. They\u2019d been mating, or perhaps still were, because their lower bodies were connected. The much larger male was curled around the female in a tranquil, resting state, limbs and tails twined. Their tiny pulses rose and fell in their throats, and they seemed somnolent, relaxed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re spooning,\u201d Marcie said, keeping her tone quiet, not wanting to startle them. \u201cAren\u2019t they lovely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you would notice that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You would have too. I was just blocking your view of them.\u201d She was aware of his chest pressed against her shoulder blade, his lips close to her ear. When she turned her head, they were close to her own mouth. She glanced up. \u201cKiss me, Ben. Please?\u201d</p><p>Curling her hair around her ear, he studied her face. Then he bent, teasing her mouth with his own. When she sighed into his mouth, he turned it into a warm, lazy kiss that made everything settle, his tongue briefly caressing hers. When he sat back, though, she saw his face had that closed look once more.</p><p>\u201cAdjust your skirt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll eat our dinner, then head for the house.\u201d</p> <p>Marcie: What do you do when it becomes too much?</p><p>Ben: You take a breath, and make yourself a promise. The bastards aren\u2019t going to win.</p><p>Phone call between Ben and Marcie during final exam week</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>A Master stayed in control, particularly with a new sub, one experiencing that wild vacillation of emotional and physical reactions for the first time. He was entirely responsible for her well-being while under his dominance. Yet Marcie had a way of taking him off guard. He shouldn\u2019t have given her that kiss. It was too intimate and personal, contradicting what he\u2019d said only a few minutes earlier, that he was merely her mentor. Contradictions, inconsistencies. They would lead to real problems in an actual, intense session.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d told himself that, but it didn\u2019t seem to help much this time either. As they walked the few blocks to his place, she kept stopping to peer through the iron fences at the alley gardens, the hidden treasure trove of the Garden District. The gardens were as diverse as the people who lived there. One narrow space might look like a miniature English garden, right out of the pages of a home magazine; another was a chaotic design of homemade wire sculpture, English ivy and an old wooden chair painted to look like a cat\u2019s grinning face. Marcie was a sensual creature who noticed things like that, took pleasure in them. Like she had the salamanders.</p><p>Her attention to detail would make her an excellent corporate investigator. Hell, no \u201cwould\u201d about it. She apparently knew his life up one side and down the other. It was outrageous. He\u2019d noted her decision not to follow up on his statement that he hadn\u2019t ever had a girlfriend, which meant she knew why. She wasn\u2019t the type to hesitate over asking a question if she didn\u2019t know the answer, no matter how inappropriate the asking was. Yeah, he bet she was doing a bang-up job freelancing for Steve Pickard, impressing his veteran investigators.</p><p>When she turned to look at him, a small smile playing on her face, he reached out. She took his hand, that smile warming like a welcome touch of late afternoon sun on a winter day. As they kept walking down the street, her hand felt good in his, slim and restless, fingers tightening, little teasing strokes as she pointed out this or that, asked him questions about the neighborhood. The silver beads he\u2019d helped her acquire still swung on her neck. He\u2019d removed his, added them to hers, so the two colors sparkled together.</p><p>\u201cIs Cass happy running Pickard\u2019s satellite office here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? She loves it. She misses the Lakeshore house in Baton Rouge, but she and Lucas found such a nice place, she\u2019s feeling better about it. The Lakeshore house was one she bought with her own money, and after all she\u2019d been through to reach that point, it meant a lot to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter everything you\u2019d all been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was hardest on her. She was in charge of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were second oldest. When she was working, you were in charge of the kids. The nanny Pickard hired was only part-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I took over because I wanted extra spending money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that was your official story. Pickard paid you the money he was paying the nanny, and you turned around and used it to help out with expenses for the kids and the house.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged that off, but he wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cAll of you had to deal with what happened with your parents. Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was okay. We were okay.\u201d She didn\u2019t like where this was going. Plus, she didn\u2019t want the uncertainty and stress that had marked most of her teenage years to mar this moment.</p><p>\u201cMarcie.\u201d He stopped her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been goal-oriented since you were in puberty. You were planning to be a business major before you were out of middle school. Your whole life was about taking care of those kids, dealing with your parents\u2019 instability and planning for a career. You didn\u2019t walk through a carnival holding hands with a boyfriend either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can now. Given the company, it was worth the wait.\u201d She lifted their clasped hands, put her other one over it. Daring, she dropped her head, pressed her lips to his knuckles, rubbed her cheek against him. His hand fit his large frame, the fingers deliciously thick when they pushed inside her, but in appearance they had a masculine elegance, like a master artist\u2019s. She thought of his cooking again, as well as the other things he could do with those talented digits.</p><p>Sighing, he brushed his other palm over her hair, tugged until she lifted her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be goal-oriented in every aspect of your life anymore. You can still have your career, but enjoy dating, getting out and seeing the world. Having fun with friends.\u201d</p><p>She withdrew, went back to strolling. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how people say that. \u2018Put off getting married and having a family, because you need to live your life first\u2019. To me, loving someone is living.\u201d She stopped then. \u201cWhen you talk to someone who\u2019s done all that traveling, experiencing and \u2018living\u2019, you know what they say? That they wish they\u2019d had someone special in their life, sharing it with them. Marriage isn\u2019t a prison sentence\u2014it\u2019s an invitation for someone else to join you on your journey, experience all those things together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She left it at that, only because she knew the dangers of getting too personal with him, too fast. Did he know he looked at the others with their wives like the lone wolf? Still part of the pack but somehow not. She\u2019d seen it in his eyes at Jon and Rachel\u2019s wedding. It had frustrated the hell out of her, knowing she was still too young to help ease that for him. In the deepening lines on his face, the more serious set to his mouth, it was more obvious to her now than it had been even then.</p><p>He took her hand once more. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to argue with you if you\u2019re going to be unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>She slid her other hand around his elbow, so she could press her body against his. \u201cThat\u2019s your way of saying I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never say anything so foolish. Telling a woman she\u2019s right is like giving a terrorist a nuclear weapon. Widespread destruction is inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Pinching his arm, she tried not to linger over the hard biceps that she was sure barely felt the impact. God, the man was built. Even in his suits it was obvious, that powerful cat way he had of moving, the breadth of his shoulders, the way his shirts fit across his chest. She remembered him in jeans, how he\u2019d looked playing with the kids. If she was mayor of New Orleans, she\u2019d pass a law that said he had to wear those all the time and nothing else.</p><p>He stopped in front of a row of townhouses that had obviously once been a large estate. It now continued its life of graceful historic beauty in three partitions, with the narrow dividing lines of more scenic alley nooks. \u201cSince you know everything about me, I assume you know this is where I live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was tough, because you\u2019ve moved around a lot. In fact, you only bought this in the past year, and negotiated a price Satan would envy. Your place in the Warehouse District is close to the office, and you stay there most times.\u201d In fact, she thought it odd\u2014and hopeful\u2014he\u2019d decided to bring her here instead, because of the two, the Garden District was more like a home.</p><p>He arched a brow at her. \u201cHave pictures of me in the shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to perch in an oak tree with my extended lens, but I\u2019m not a great climber and didn\u2019t want to risk damaging the equipment.\u201d</p><p>She made an indignant noise when he swatted her ass, but she caught his quick grin as well. His hand came back to stroke, reminding them both she wore no panties beneath the skirt. Those butterflies swirled in Marcie\u2019s stomach again, excitement and apprehension.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m staying overnight,\u201d she ventured, \u201cI should pick up a toothbrush or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCass is sending an overnight bag for you via one of the K&amp;A drivers. It\u2019s probably already been dropped it off.\u201d He approached the security grate that blocked the alcove of his front door and peered in. She saw the duffel as well as a garment bag hung on the outdoor light fixture. \u201cThere we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are scary. Like Boy Scouts on steroids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays my stalker.\u201d Opening the outer gate, he gestured her in underneath his arm. She let her fingers slide against his side as she did, under the pretense of the close quarters, but was surprised when he abruptly turned, lifted her up and pressed her against the shadowed wall of the alcove. Her eyes closed as his mouth took hers, his body pressing her hard against the oyster-shell stucco. Her legs wrapped around his hips instinctively, heels digging into the back of his thighs as he plundered her mouth. Digging his fingers into her hair, he tugged against her scalp mercilessly. She was gasping as he lifted his head.</p><p>\u201cWhen we go through that door, you are a slave. You understand, Marcie?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then found her voice. \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look at me unless I tell you to do so. The second you step over that threshold, you strip. Everything. Jewelry, hairpins, rings, all of it. You leave the clothes folded neatly by the door. Then you sit down on the floor. Legs tucked underneath you, knees spread so I have access to your pussy. Fingers laced behind your head, tits thrust out. You hold that posture, and you stay silent, unless you get physically uncomfortable or I ask you a question. If you start to get uncomfortable, you ask for permission to speak.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her nod, then let her down. Turning away, he unlocked the interior door. Once again, he held it open, gestured her to precede him. When she stepped across the threshold, he moved past her without a glance, a dismissal, as he went down the hallway into what looked like the kitchen area.</p><p>She took off skirt, bra, shirt, heels. Earrings and bracelets, the ring Cass had given her that belonged to their mother. She put those things in a small dish on the hallway tree, then folded up her clothes beside them. Unclipping her barrette, she took out the couple of pins that held back the more unruly strands, put them with the rest. Then she followed his direction, folding herself down to the polished wood floor. She laced her fingers behind her head, spread her knees, thrust out her breasts.</p><p>It was a posture that made her instantly, shamelessly wet. Unlike the obeisance pose, which was a position of humble vulnerability, this one showed pride in her surrender, fully displaying what was her Master\u2019s. Her nipples were drawn up so that the barbells were a tingling burn in the piercings. Her clit piercing was the same.</p><p>She could see him through the opening to the kitchen, just a piece of him. He was flipping through his mail. He set something down, was reading it as he stripped off his tie, pulled open a couple buttons of his shirt. It made her mouth dry. She had no doubt he was completely aware of every move she made, yet he was also so...detached. It was heating her blood. Her pussy would be making her calves slippery in no time.</p><p>Stepping away from the table, he disappeared into another room of the house. She took the moment to look around. The floors were all hardwood, with that wonderful old wood smell. The narrow staircase probably led to a bedroom area, with a spacious window on the way up that let in afternoon sunlight. The kitchen looked modern and also full of sunlight. The house had obviously been remodeled inside, keeping the best of the old and integrating the new. It was tastefully decorated, but not female in the slightest. The walls were pale yellow with touches of bold earth-toned artwork here and there. No photos she could see.</p> <p>Directly in front of her was the archway into a living area with a sectional sofa and wide-screen TV, as well as more artwork. A copper glaze vase was under a separate spotlight, obviously a gallery piece. A couple Japanese maples flanked it. Gifts from Jon, she was sure, since he said the delicate five-point leaf trees brought tranquility and blessings to a home. Cass had a few as well.</p><p>Though Ben had probably employed a decorator to reflect his tastes, the house had a good feel to it, like it was merely waiting for Ben to accept it as his home. She wondered what it would take for him to do that. He\u2019d called the house a good investment, and the Warehouse District place was convenient to work. But this place felt like him. If he put down roots, staked his claim, this would be the place he\u2019d do it.</p><p>And he\u2019d brought her here.</p><p>She returned her gaze to the floor, everything within her coiling up in anticipation as his shoes tapped down the hall. She was completely naked. Naked in Ben\u2019s home, waiting for his demands. She had that shaking thing going on, just beneath the skin, little thrills of sensation running along the insides of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes. Clasp your hands at the small of your back.\u201d</p><p>She did, and then he was touching her hair, gathering it up. He retrieved her barrette, used it to hold a flat twist on the back of her head.</p><p>\u201cSince you have trouble obeying something as simple as not looking at me unless you have permission...\u201d</p><p>She clutched her fingers hard as he fitted the head mask to her face. When her lashes fluttered, she found it had no eye holes, and then... She pushed down panic as he put ear plugs in those orifices before he brought the mask over them. The mask laced in the back, and he took his time, adjusting it and touching her face to ensure the opening for her nostrils was positioned properly. As he got the mask set, it constricted over her nose, cheekbones, forehead. The mouth opening was a mere slit, pressing against her lips.</p><p>When he was done with the lacing, she felt cool metal at her nape, a brief pressure, then a small weight. \u201cI\u2019ve inserted a small padlock in the last eyeholes of the lacing. Only I can remove this mask, Marcie.\u201d</p><p>He was speaking right against her ear, but any other sounds were muted. He\u2019d just blinded her, taken away most of her hearing.</p><p>Now he was putting a collar on her. As he buckled it, he tested the constriction by sliding two fingers beneath it to caress her chin. It was a serviceable collar, wide and solid. Not a formal collaring, but still. Her quivering increased. She felt a tug. A tether.</p><p>\u201cOn your feet. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>He moved as soon as she rose, and he didn\u2019t set a slow pace, giving her time to feel her way or figure out where they were going. He was expecting her to trust him, to follow at a normal walk. She managed it, but she couldn\u2019t help some small flutters of panic. When he stopped, his hand touching her bare abdomen to bring her to a halt before she ran into him, she thought they were in the kitchen, but then he made a turn into a room she hadn\u2019t yet seen. It was warm, maybe a sunroom, which meant lots of windows. Was she on display to his neighbors?</p><p>\u201cOn your knees, forehead to the floor, arms out front, wrists crossed. Ass in the air. Thighs spread.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed. She wanted to talk, needed to speak, but it wasn\u2019t to ask a question. She needed to interact for reassurance. Imagining this and doing it were very different. She bit down on her tongue, stayed silent. He\u2019d gag her with the least provocation, she was sure, and she definitely wasn\u2019t ready to lose the ability to speak.</p><p>Straps wrapped just beneath each of her knees, buckled snug so they wouldn\u2019t slip down her calves. Then something else, something that pushed her out a little wider, made her have to rest more of her weight on her elbows and forehead. A spreader bar, one that would hold her thighs open no matter what. She could hear her rasping breath in her head. He wasn\u2019t done yet, God help her. Cuffs around her ankles, and this time a light chain was run between them, a hobble. Moving around to her front, he cuffed her wrists together, and then she heard another chain run from them to something that anchored her there, perhaps the leg of a heavy piece of furniture, or a column in the sunroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rose and was gone. No, not gone. She could barely hear him, but it sounded like...a chair scraping? A laptop turning on? Yes, the piercing chime of a boot-up filtered through the plugs. He was going to leave her in this position while he worked?</p><p>Not immediately, no. She drew in a breath as he touched her bare ass. Something rigid and small was inserted into her anus, followed by a feeling of warmth. Lube. He was lubing her up to fuck her, use her as he\u2019d use a slave. More thick arousal trickled out onto her thighs. When she tied herself up, she always felt that peculiar stillness enter her, a dense type of arousal. This was ten times more intense, the volatility of an atom waiting to be split. She wanted to whimper, to moan, to cry a little. And she wanted him to keep wrapping her up in restraint after restraint until she couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>Shifting in front of her again, he curled his fingers into the strap on the top of the head mask, a replacement handhold with the hair trapped beneath it. Releasing the chain, he brought her up to her knees, wobbling precariously with that spreader between them, but he held her upright. Unhooking her wrist restraints to bring her arms behind her, he arched her back to attach them that to the spreader bar between her knees. Now she was dependent on her stomach muscles, her own unsteady balance and his hand to stay upright. But in another second that didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Her lips parted as she smelled the heat and musk of his cock. She hadn\u2019t heard him remove any clothes, but she had a feeling he was still fully dressed, had just opened his slacks to have her service him.</p><p>He pushed against her mouth, and she had to adjust fast, because he didn\u2019t take his time as he had before. He was already hard and huge, sliding into the back of her throat. She reveled in it, knowing her submission, having her so helpless, was making him hot. So hot he stretched her lips cruelly, bumped against her throat. She flicked her tongue on him, sucked, teased, stroked, doing everything to convey how much she loved doing this for him. With her standing on her knees, that arousal was rolling down the insides of her legs.</p><p>She could come just from doing this. His other hand captured her breast, tugged on the nipple piercing, a sharp pain that made her cry out against him. He slapped the breast in reproof, making her gasp again. He did it to the other breast, a rough tweak and pull, followed by that sharp slap that made the breast wobble in reaction.</p><p>He was tearing her up inside, pulling her between cruel pain and pleasure, training her to respond to both the same way. She might know that rationally, but it was like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced. It was frightening, feeling it all spin out of control, but at some visceral level, she understood. He wanted her to let go of everything. Identity, mind, everything but being his slave, because anything else was an attempt to control, and he wouldn\u2019t tolerate that. He held all the control. Whatever she\u2019d imagined, it hadn\u2019t gone this far, but if she wanted him, she had to be willing to fall out of the boat and watch it float away, sink to the bottom of his ocean.</p><p>Now he\u2019d let go of her head, leaving her to work him with her mouth while he grasped both breasts, pinched the nipples, rolled the barbells until she was trying so hard to focus, caught between ecstasy and flinching as he mixed pleasurable squeezes with sudden flicks that sent shards of pain through her nipples. Her back was starting to ache from her position, her jaw screaming, but she didn\u2019t care. He held her up with his cock impaling her mouth and his hands holding her breasts. As far as she was concerned, it was exactly where she wanted to be.</p><p>Taking hold of the headmask strap, he pulled her off him. Moving behind her, he freed her bound wrists from the spreader bar, and each other, but held onto them as he shifted his other hand to the back of her neck, pushed her face to the floor again. Her arms were brought back above her again so her elbows pressed into the wood. The way he took her to the floor was swift, a harrowing descent, blind and with nothing to control her speed but him, but again, she got the message. He was demanding her absolute trust. That was the kind of Dom he was, but she knew it was more than that as well.</p><p>She\u2019d told him he sought his sub\u2019s vulnerability but withheld his own. He always played on the edge, but because he didn\u2019t like the truth she\u2019d put in front of him, he\u2019d take it even closer to that perilous drop because he wanted to scare the shit out of her, send her running back to her playground.</p><p>He was in for a surprise. She was scared, but she was also totally-out-of-control immersed in the world he was creating, and she\u2019d never been so sexually stimulated in her life. They probably weren\u2019t even a fourth of the way through Ben\u2019s version of foreplay. A prayer for strength would probably not be out of line at this point, with an additional caveat for forgiveness for all the sins she was willing to commit for her Master.</p><p>He was being rough, but not violent. His touch was firm, strong, implacable. This wasn\u2019t romance. This was a hardcore Master out and out driving her to the upper level of madness, where her body was going to come completely to pieces before he was done. Cruel, but she craved his brand of cruelty.</p><p>She was moved forward, his arms briefly wrapped around her waist and chest. He pulled her arms out straighter, and directed her to wrap her fingers around what felt like the leg of that heavy piece of furniture before he chained her there, the links winding over her knuckles. Her forehead stayed pressed to the floor until he gripped her hips, bringing her to her feet, her head still down toward the ground, arms low and stretched before her, a modified Down Dog yoga position.</p><p>It strained her muscles in a new way. He wasn\u2019t keeping her in any pose long enough to become painful; just enough to stress the body, like a particularly stringent workout. Maybe he\u2019d been going to Rachel\u2019s classes.</p><p>The desperate humor was gone in an instant as his hand made contact with her ass, a powerful slap. He followed it up with several more, warming her flesh. She was making soft cries in her throat, pleas of alarm, because if he so much as touched her pussy, she was going to come.</p><p>\u201cNone of that.\u201d She sensed the loss of his heat as he moved away from her, came back. Something cool and hard entered her pussy, sliding in like a knife into a peach, a scary thought when associated with her tender regions. Then she felt the discomfort of being stretched, and though she didn\u2019t hear the telltale clicks, a cold feeling ran through her belly as she realized he\u2019d used a speculum, like the doctor used for pelvic exams. It held her wide open, reduced the ability of the pussy to spasm and create its own orgasm.</p><p>She cried out as something else closed over her clit, something ice cold. \u201cJon\u2019s version of the ice pack,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will feel like ice, at least for several moments. Until that hot pussy of yours warms it up.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible to stay still, but he\u2019d anticipated that, with the way he\u2019d bound her. She was twitching, convulsing, but he had her arms stretched out to that anchor point, her head toward the floor, her legs straight up and spread. Her range of movement was severely restricted. Then he went to work on her with two other tools.</p><p>The first was a flogger with thin straps that stung, eliciting tiny cries. He alternated that with the solid thunk of a weighted slapper, which had more impact. Back and forth, back and forth, and each time her pussy spasmed from the blow, she felt that speculum holding her open. He awoke the still-sensitive nerve endings from yesterday\u2019s caning and it became part of the spiraling agony.</p><p>Ben... Something was tearing open inside of her, something important and vital, and dark. Every fear, every childhood pain was swelling up inside of her, twining with this out-of-control lust in a macabre way, a parade of pleasure and agony that was going to drown her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop crying out even as he stopped using the weapons. She had no control over any of her reactions, verbal or physical. As his broad head pushed against her lubricated ass, she made a keening note. She was tight, but he worked against her, spurring her on with the words that filtered through the mask\u2019s cover.</p><p>\u201cYou can take me. You\u2019re soaking wet, you want my cock so much. Concentrate and take it. You were born to serve a Master who works you over until that smart mouth and far-too-clever mind of yours gives out and you just become mindless, serving him with everything you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou... Born to serve...you.\u201d She didn\u2019t give a damn if he\u2019d told her not to talk, she wouldn\u2019t let that one pass.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t used you hard enough, apparently.\u201d His cock withdrew, and she snarled in protest. Said some things she\u2019d never thought would come from her mouth. Did she just call him a fucking bastard? In response, she got a diabolical chuckle and her mouth was forced open. She gagged as a thick rubber dildo was pushed in, so wide it held her tongue down and stretched the mask around her lips. When he buckled it tight around her head, he\u2019d taken away her sight, most of her hearing, and now her ability to speak. She thought she\u2019d been coming apart before. She realized then he wasn\u2019t going to stop until he\u2019d shattered her into a million pieces.</p><p>\u201cFucking bastard, hmm? Baby, you don\u2019t know how much of a bastard I can be.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers dug into the floor but she screamed against the gag as something slapped against her ass. Rubber...flat...like a spatula. Fuck. The danger of a Master who cooked\u2014he had a whole inventory of tools with more than one use.</p><p>Each time he hit her with it, the pain screamed through her nerve endings, made her shriek against the gag. But right after, he\u2019d pause, his palm passing over her buttock. The throbbing would turn warm...and she\u2019d want more. Until the next hit. It was crazy. She knew the type of person she was, that she craved pain as much as pleasure at his hand, but she\u2019d had no ability to prove it other than her own experiments in the privacy of a dorm room or co-op apartment. Though the levels of pain she\u2019d tried on her own might be similar, it was a hell of a lot different from the psychology of being helpless to whatever he wanted to do to her.</p><p>The cold on her clit was becoming an aching pain, it was all becoming agony and excruciating stimulation at once. He gave her four more hard strokes, alternating with stinging taps on the inside of her thighs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou ready to behave now? Don\u2019t bother to nod. I know you\u2019re a little liar.\u201d</p><p>He came back at her with his cock. She focused with all she had, and he worked himself against her sphincter muscles. She pushed against him, wanting him, wanting him now, and the muscles gave, letting him slide in deep, ruthless, irresistible. She wished she could flex the muscles inside her pussy. It was distressing to have him sunk deep in her while her pussy was held open, rendered as helpless to his will as any other part of her.</p><p>She was lost, just lost. All she had in this silent darkness was him. He began to thrust, shoving her forward so she had to brace her straining, trembling muscles against the onslaught. His fingers reached beneath, pinched that cold thing off her clit, slid the speculum free. There was a muffled clatter as he tossed it away, replaced it with his own fingers, sliding them into her cunt as his thumb and forefinger went to work on restoring the life to her frozen clit.</p> <p>It swelled up in her like a finger-of-God cat-five tornado. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d She was wailing against the gag. This orgasm was going to tear her apart, take her into places she hadn\u2019t known existed. He was beyond what she could handle, no matter how much she loved him. But he wasn\u2019t leaving her a choice. Hadn\u2019t even given her a safe word. He\u2019d simply taken, because she\u2019d told him that was what she wanted and because he was bound and damn determined to prove her wrong.</p><p>I love you, I love you... I want to serve you. You\u2019re my Master. She realized then there was a struggle happening inside her mind, and that struggle said she was still trying to hold onto control. She couldn\u2019t totally trust him because he was resisting the idea that she was the one meant for him. But she had to have faith for both of them, had to let go.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. Oh God, she needed his tenderness, his heart, and this was a ruthless Master who was demanding she surrender everything while he gave her nothing.</p><p>But those were the terms. That was the risk she was taking. It didn\u2019t matter anyway. She was being dragged to the edge of the cliff by that punishing cock, those knowledgeable fingers, his heated breath on her spine. But what would happen if she stopped pushing back, if she just gave him a smile, her heart in her tear-filled eyes, and took the leap joyously?</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Marcie. Come now. Obey me.\u201d</p> <p>Heart, lungs, every major organ, were gripped in the squeezing moment of decision, then the orgasm crashed over her. He was pumping into her, the fingers at her clit working her like a maestro. Her nostrils flared, lips stretching to allow as much air past the dildo as possible. Her breasts wobbled beneath her with the motion of his thrusts, her fists in their cuffs and chains gripping that anchor point, her whole body chained and subjected to his will. His slave, in every way.</p><p>She screamed against the gag until her vocal cords gave out. Even then, she continued to convulse and buck as if gripped in a full epileptic seizure. Tears were on her lips. Her orgasm gushed forth so strong she spurted over his cock. Her legs buckled, but he had her by the waist, kept lifting her with his thrusts. He released then, taking her up once more with the heat of his seed. She shrieked as he kept massaging her clit, milking every last sensation from her. She strained to hear his release, a grunt, a moan, but the mask was too damn effective.</p><p>Still, he kept going even after she rode that tide to the end. He would fuck her as long as he wished, until her tissues were sore and begging for relief. Did he do it because he knew it was the key to his and her pleasure both, underscoring that she was his to do with as he desired?</p><p>With a mix of terror and other, less sensible, emotions, she realized he was still hard. She couldn\u2019t keep up. She couldn\u2019t be enough for him. No, she would be. She had to be.</p><p>At last, he was slowing down. She was panting. Easing her back to the ground, to her knees, he removed the spreader bar and the hobble chain, but he cuffed her ankles together. He adjusted her so she was lying on her back, her arms up above her head, for he left her attached to whatever furniture leg he\u2019d chosen. When something silky touched her ankles, she realized he was binding her legs with nylon rope. He did a wrap from ankles to her thighs, tied off there. Then he took her arms down, unchained them.</p><p>For a moment her wrists were held in his hands, and she stretched out her fingers, seeking his face. Please, please let me touch you.</p> <p>His mouth touched her palms, making her sob. She touched his jaw, his cheeks, stroking, desperate, needy. But then he was wrapping nylon rope between her forefinger and thumb, moving to the other fingers to lace them together so she was palm to palm before he did a similar snug rope wrap from her wrists to her elbows. Oh God. It was like her fantasy when he was biting her neck.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t follow what was going on anymore, floating in sensation. He slid his arms beneath her, lifted her. He smelled so good, heat and sweat, aroused male. Moving through a spiraling darkness, she focused on the way it felt to be held in his arms until he laid her face down over what felt like a sofa arm. He adjusted her arms before her, so her fingers gripped a cushion and there was space between her face and the couch surface, protecting air passage. Straddling her bound legs, he put his hands on her hips, thumbs on her buttocks, spreading them open. The opening was sore as hell, but then she made a dove\u2019s cry as he knelt and put his mouth there.</p><p>\u201cAhkh...\u201d She was losing track of all the involuntary sounds he was wresting from her. God, that felt so good. His clever tongue was licking her rim, swirling inside, soothing and stimulating at once, setting off small contractions in her pussy, compressed by that rope wrap. His hands stroked her buttocks, reminding her of the punishing strokes he\u2019d put there, but soothing them as well.</p><p>Then he rose. She couldn\u2019t help it; she made an apprehensive noise as he fitted his cock to that opening once more. She couldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t possibly.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby. Real, real, easy. Let me do all the work. You just feel.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t thrust in hard this time. He worked his way slow. She whimpered throughout, because it was uncomfortable, but it was more than that as well. The desire to serve him, to give him whatever he wanted, superseded everything, made her pussy keep doing those little clenches. It was impossible that she could be getting aroused again so soon. But her nipples were brushing the stiff sofa material, hardening anew. He slid a hand between their bodies, petted her slick and compressed pussy with little strokes that had her mewling like a cat.</p><p>When he was all the way in, he leaned over her back, dropped a kiss on her nape, catching that padlock in his teeth and tugging, reminding her she was his prisoner. \u201cSqueeze down on me.\u201d</p><p>She did, and earned a rasp of his breath against her neck, a reward that warmed her like the teacher giving her an A in front of the whole class. That squeezing motion made sensation ripple through her cunt and lower belly. She did it harder.</p> <p>\u201cFuck. Keep doing that.\u201d He was close enough to her she could hear the rumble of his voice against her neck, through her back where his chest pressed against her. She\u2019d been right. He still wore his dress shirt, though the tie was gone. She\u2019d felt his open slacks against her ass and thighs when he was fucking her before, and now she felt them again. Somehow it just underscored her subjugation, him remaining in his work clothes. She imagined how it would feel to have him completely naked against her, hard muscle and curling male chest hair rough against her skin.</p><p>\u201cLift your tits off the couch.\u201d</p><p>His hands reached beneath her. No unkind pinches and tugs this time. Something far more devastating. He started brushing his palms over just the tips in a way that had her making little moans, increasing the rate of those constrictions in her ass. She could feel him swelling larger. They probably made Viagra out of whatever special hormone Ben carried in his DNA.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Good girl. Keep working it.\u201d He laid another kiss on her nape, brought his other hand down beneath her to tease her clit with one finger, more light brushes. In a matter of minutes, she wanted to spread her legs with everything she had, open herself wide to him, but of course the rope wrap prevented her. What the hell was he doing to her?</p><p>\u201cMy sweet, sweet slut,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re so hot for it. I\u2019m going to keep working you like this all night. We won\u2019t be stopping until my cock\u2019s had enough.\u201d His voice dropped to a whisper, right against her ear. \u201cAnd baby, my cock never has enough of a sweet ass like yours.\u201d</p><p>Despite that thrilling threat, he surprised her. She expected him to take her to another completion, at least for him, but instead, after a few moments, he lifted her again. She was carried down a hallway, and then she was in another room, though she couldn\u2019t tell what function it served. Until he laid her down on what felt like a padded massage table.</p><p>\u201cLie still. No speaking unless I give you permission.\u201d</p><p>Unwrapping her legs and arms, he removed the phallic gag. Then he began to rub her limbs, back, shoulders and hips with firm, capable hands that knew exactly what they were doing. She had to bite back a moan as he worked over the sore muscles and strained joints.</p><p>\u201cYour color\u2019s good. Wiggle your toes for me. Now your fingers. Any numbness anywhere? Yes or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t lying, not exactly, because she knew what kind of numbness he meant. He didn\u2019t mean the fact her lips could barely move because her body was trapped in a logy place where everything moved through molasses, even her thoughts. She felt like she was in a permanent world of hushed darkness.</p><p>When he was done with that, he turned her over, did the front. He cupped her breasts, passed his thumbs over her nipples, an idle caress as he checked her over. She knew he was looking for any discolorations or dangerous levels of tenderness. She\u2019d learned that from watching Marcus do sessions with Thomas at their favorite New York club, and later she\u2019d seen Ben do the same with the three women at Surreal. Only Ben was like a torturer who knew the limits of the human body exactly, straddling that border of pleasure and terror. A zone far wider for her than she\u2019d realized, until she was under his command.</p><p>He slid his arms underneath her. \u201cC\u2019mon, brat.\u201d Was there tenderness in that murmur? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As he took a seat in what felt like a nearby recliner, he cradled her against his body. She turned her face into his neck. She wanted the mask off, wanted to feel him against her face. He must have known, because he removed the lock and unlaced it, pulled it off. She kept her eyes closed, fearing any brightness. He used what smelled like aloe wipes to clean her face, the mucus from her running nose, her tears, the sweat. He combed her hair with his fingers.</p><p>She\u2019d bitten her lip, and he smeared something that smelled like coconut lip balm there. He leaned away from her and she heard the sound of a mini-fridge. Then he was plying her with sips of water. Fed her peanut butter crackers as he had at the office, gave her some juice. With a near giggle, she wondered if he kept supplies in every room of the house, like a Red Cross station after a bloodletting.</p><p>\u201cMaster...\u201d She wanted to say it, wanted to call him that. He kept stroking her head, but said nothing. \u201cBen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby. Just relax and get your strength back. We\u2019re not done. Not by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t...made out a will. Tell Cass that Jess can have my clothes. But she gets...my birthday stilettos.\u201d</p><p>His lips pulled into a curve against her temple. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you in those stilettos, and nothing else. I\u2019d cross your ankles, tie them together, run the rope under the soles of the shoes so it keeps them on, part of the binding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear them...in my casket.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her neck then, bit, earning a quiet sigh from her, a shudder as he clasped her breasts, gently massaged, pinched, toyed with the piercings. \u201cQuiet now. Just feel. You\u2019re a slave. You don\u2019t speak unless your Master requires you to speak. You serve. Let everything else go.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to obey him, but her mind was in such an odd place. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry. About Jeremy. About the things... I was so lonely in college.\u201d She was sorry for everything she\u2019d ever done wrong in her whole life. It was so strange, the desire to confess everything without choosing any one specific thing, just an overall purging.</p><p>He was silent a moment. \u201cJeremy wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt felt like it was. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause women are stupid about things like that.\u201d But he said it without rancor. Closing his arms around her, he held her tight. \u201cI forgive you for everything, you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the things I might do tomorrow? Or the next day?\u201d</p><p>He snorted, not unkindly. \u201cI should know you\u2019d try to hedge your bets. Whatever you do tomorrow, I\u2019ll devise the appropriate punishment. But first, we get through today.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes at last, looked at him. The top three buttons of the shirt were open, so she could lay her hand on his chest. She didn\u2019t though. She kept her hands limp along her hipbones, out of his way so he could touch whatever he wished. There was simmering lust in his gaze, the banked embers of what they\u2019d just done. He was hard beneath her ass, the size of him making a substantial impression in her buttock.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t change a thing, but she wished there were two of her, one who could stand to the side and watch those green eyes go to pure emerald fire, watch him grip that large cock and push it inside her. See that strong jaw tighten, flex, his lips stretch back as he released, spent his seed inside her ass.</p><p>\u201cIf you want, we can stop now, Marcie.\u201d He drew her eyes back to his face. \u201cYou can clean up and go home.\u201d</p><p>She was home. He was home to her. It was so difficult not to say it, an ache in her heart. A submissive\u2019s honesty, her pure emotion, was what a Master demanded, a gift she could give him. But this Master wasn\u2019t ready for that kind of truth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go. I want you to do everything you want to do to me. I\u2019m yours.\u201d Laying her head back against his biceps, she lifted her gaze to the pressed tin ceiling. There was an elegant black and gold fixture, a slowly oscillating ceiling fan. \u201cYou remember when we all went to the state fair? You won me that giant bear, at the knife-throwing booth.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d expected Peter to have that skill, thanks to his military training, but Ben didn\u2019t miss. Ten balloons, ten knife throws, his movements smooth and certain. Thunk, thunk, thunk. She remembered the steady focus of Ben\u2019s eyes, the widening of the vendor\u2019s. He\u2019d won her the largest bear in the kiosk, a black bear with green eyes. The furry taloned paws had bumped her knees as she carried him.</p><p>The other children already had prizes. She\u2019d been the only one without, because of course she and Cass made sure the younger children got any winnings that day. But when Cherry and Nate were going to fight over that bear, Ben shook his head, spoke firmly.</p><p>\u201cThis one is Marcie\u2019s,\u201d he said. He\u2019d handed it over to her with a smile, and a tug of her ponytail. \u201cHe\u2019s the safest boyfriend you can have in college. Keep that in mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I remember.\u201d He spoke, bringing her back to the present.</p><p>\u201cI did unspeakable things to that bear.\u201d With her legs and one arm wrapped around it, she\u2019d held it on top of her while she slipped a hand between them, masturbating, imagining someone else\u2019s weight pressing her body into her mattress. Now she brought her gaze back to Ben. \u201cI want you do unspeakable things to me. Please.\u201d</p><p>That jaw flexed, gaze heating. When she reached up to touch his mouth, he grasped her wrist before she made contact, held it between them. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to speak without permission,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to bind these hands again. Your ass was a pretty color from the spatula, but a red blush like that needs some caning marks.\u201d</p><p>She trembled under his intent scrutiny. \u201cYes sir,\u201d she said.</p><p>He was as good as his word. During the long hours of the night, she lost count of how many times she thought, This is exactly as I imagined it, fantasized about it.</p><p>Physically.</p><p>She\u2019d had no idea what it would do to her emotionally. Her strange desire for confession was just the tip of the iceberg. She cried, she sobbed, she came, she pleaded, she said things against the replaced gag that were visceral, animal-like. Time and again, she thought she couldn\u2019t bear more, that the strain on mind and body had become too much, but then he\u2019d wring another sensation out of her she couldn\u2019t resist. He\u2019d murmur, \u201cOne more minute,\u201d and she could do another minute. The craving to be the most perfect slave he could ever want would rise to the top again.</p><p>She let go of things in those dark hours she couldn\u2019t give to anyone else. She wanted to tell him everything, things she couldn\u2019t even tell herself. He had her soul chained down with her body, helpless to him. As he tormented her, a sensual, ruthless inquisitor, she gave it all to him. He was so much more than she\u2019d realized. She wasn\u2019t just in over her head, out in the middle of the ocean. Her life was literally in his hands, her right to breathe, to exist. All of it was at his mercy, and she would gladly stop breathing if that was what he wanted. She\u2019d do anything to please him.</p><p>It was crazy, irrational. It scared her to death, because she couldn\u2019t stop feeling any of it. And he made it worse with every new thing he did to her. After her brief respite, he\u2019d replaced the mask, put her over what felt like a spanking bench. Her nipple barbells were attached to a chain he threaded through a ratcheted buckle on the back of the collar. Each time he pushed that metal hasp left then right, it cinched in the chain another inch, increasing the pull on her nipples. He put her chin in a metal rest directly before her that he raised up until she felt the strain in her neck and more pull on the barbells.</p><p>Placing a slim dildo in her ass that was covered with a blissfully heated balm, he\u2019d then slid a vibrator in her pussy with a clit attachment. Since that part of her had been achingly empty throughout their first session, it sucked on the vibrator greedily, earning a fervent expletive from him she treasured for the fascinated expression of male lust it was. As he changed the settings on that vibrator, he commanded her to clench her ass rhythmically over the dildo, working out those muscles, until she came again.</p><p>Next she was on her back. He strapped her to a table, buckled her calves in stirrups that kept her legs upright at a ninety-degree angle, increasing her sense of vulnerability. Her hands and waist were cuffed to the table, and then he positioned a thick dildo in her pussy. One that was connected to a fucking machine. She heard the muted whir of it as he started it. The dildo had a clit piece that hit her there with each slow thrust and retreat. That wasn\u2019t enough, however.</p><p>He fitted electrode pads on her areolas, holes to allow room for her nipples, and then those pads unpredictably sent low-voltage stimulus to them as the fucking machine did its thing. \u201cI have some email to check,\u201d he\u2019d said, as he teasingly brushed her lips stretched around the phallus gag. \u201cI\u2019m going to sit over there and answer it, rub my cock and enjoy watching my toy being fucked.\u201d</p><p>He had a remote control for both electric devices, a convenient addition provided by Jon, she was sure, since he was their mechanical genius. The electrodes were activated at unpredictable moments, and the fucking machine increased or decreased its rate without any rhyme or reason. It didn\u2019t matter. By the end, she was writhing and screaming at every level of stimulus. Then he let the machine pump into her like a jack hammer, and she came and came and came.</p><p>After that, he decided they both needed a late-night meal. He put her on all fours on his dining room table, with the mask still in place, but he removed the gag. He used a rope suspension system to bind her above and below her breasts, at the waist and curve of her hip.</p><p>\u201cNot only for support,\u201d he told her. \u201cI want you displayed the way I\u2019d do it if I was entertaining business associates and wanted you as the centerpiece. I\u2019d put the serving dishes around your knees and hands, let them decorate you if they\u2019d like. Eat the food off your body.\u201d</p><p>As he told her that, he attached an additional hook to the crown of the hood mask. A tether attached to it tightened, forcing her head to be held up. She couldn\u2019t stop making noises at all now, so the guttural moan as he inserted the steel bulb of an anal hook into her rectum was just par for the course. He fastened a line to the eye hole of the anal hook and to the two lines that crossed her shoulder blades from the breast bondage. When he drew all of it taut from a ceiling hook, her head, shoulders and ass were held up at pert angles from the diabolical joining point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He fed her then, a creamy soup with lots of protein, had her drink more fluids. Then he worked his fingers into her cunt, telling her to squeeze down on the steel bulb, and turned her into a screaming, mindless slut once more.</p><p>She lost track of how many hours, days, millennia passed as he was catapulting her into an alternative universe. He\u2019d messed with her reality, her sense of time, spatial relationships. The only fixed point, the only anchor, was him.</p><p>Since time had no meaning, she measured it by climaxes, and of course eventually her mind even stumbled over that\u2014was it fifth, seventh...tenth? They became increasingly more intense, rigid like an implosion, because her body had no energy to handle a more externally demonstrative response. It didn\u2019t matter. She was responding to his demands now, not her brain\u2019s limitations.</p><p>Now he had her kneeling on the floor, her body curled, her head pressed to the carpet between his feet, like the Child\u2019s Pose in yoga...or a position of utter subjugation before a Master. He\u2019d kept her that way for a while. She smelled whiskey, knew he\u2019d poured himself a glass and must be sitting in a comfortable chair before her, just watching her. She was shaking. She\u2019d of course been shaking intermittently since the beginning, but somewhere during the past hour or so, it had become continuous. Her throat was hoarse, so screams were now weak gasps, making those hard climaxes even more potent, all the energy focused between her exhausted legs.</p><p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d He\u2019d taken out the ear plugs after dinner, so she heard the glass being set on the side table. \u201cUp on your heels, arms out to your sides.\u201d</p><p>She tried, and found her arms were noodles. She was losing motor control. Shouldn\u2019t that alarm her?</p><p>\u201cPermission to speak, sir.\u201d She had to clear her voice, and it still came out a rough squeak.</p><p>\u201cYou have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lift them. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Gripping her wrist, he drew her arm out to her side to cuff it to cool steel. The bar was laid over her shoulders, attached to her collar with a clip, and he lifted the other wrist, attached it to the other side of the spreader bar. He moved behind her then, and she heard a drawer opening and closing. She\u2019d figured out that he kept a fairly well-stocked BDSM dungeon in this home, probably next to the room that held the massage cot.</p><p>She\u2019d tried not to think why he had equipment here, because of course the truth of that was obvious. But she was pretty sure he\u2019d been doing only club sessions for the past couple years. It might have been awhile since the dust had been knocked off this equipment, figuratively speaking. She\u2019d take what she could get, hold onto the hope she was right about that.</p><p>\u201cEasy now. Take this in.\u201d His arm wrapped around her waist, his fingers touching her well-used pussy, guiding in a dildo. She shuddered with the discomfort and yet the desire to please. He\u2019d lubricated it well, and when it pressed against her perineum, she realized it was a double dildo he strapped in place. Then he turned on the vibration feature. She cried out. When he came back around her, keeping his hand on the spreader bar to steady her, he was close, such that her cheek was briefly pressed against his hip. As she turned her face into the soft stuff of his slacks, the strap of his belt, she couldn\u2019t hold back the quiet sob. She was so tired.</p><p>\u201cWe finish as we start, sweet slave. You suck me off until I come, then I let you rest.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move her back, such that she felt him pull off the belt, unfasten the pants, take down the zipper and the boxers beneath. She parted her lips, reaching for him. When the broad head pushed into her mouth, she sucked on it like a favorite treat, and remarkably it was like that, a pacifier. Yet that thing inside of her, depleted as it was, came to life again. Her Master was ordering her to service him, make him come, and that was what she was going to do.</p><p>He didn\u2019t make it easy, but that was part of it, wasn\u2019t it? He held out a long, long time, until she was crying in frustration, her tears bathing her cheeks and his cock, but it also made her even more determined, licking, swirling, sucking, biting. She made a triumphant noise in her throat when she felt the telltale convulsion of the shaft beneath her tongue, felt that first spurt against her throat. With a growl, he pulled out of her mouth, jacked his semen over her breasts. She welcomed the heat of it, the marking, keeping her lips parted to catch the stray drop splashed by the force of it.</p><p>She\u2019d lost count of how many times he\u2019d come, but what male could do that and not need IV fluids?</p><p>He was tucking himself back into the slacks. The rustle of clothing, a zipper, the clink of the belt being refastened. Dropping to a knee in front of her, he closed his hand over the spreader bar beside her right wrist. His other fingers touched her swollen clit, her cunt lips stretched over that dildo.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. There was no way. But of course Ben didn\u2019t take no for an answer. She made a plea as his mouth closed over her left nipple, began to slowly suck. On their periodic breaks, he\u2019d used different oils and balms to soothe the tissues of her ass and pussy, but she couldn\u2019t come. She just couldn\u2019t, she was so tired.</p><p>He was determined, though, teaching her that her mind could make impossible things possible when she surrendered her will to him. From somewhere low in her womb, that spiraling sensation was resurrected, leading to a quiet, shuddering detonation that had her bleating like a lost lamb as he continued to tease and suckle her nipples, squeezing her breasts throughout.</p><p>When she was done, he removed the spreader bar, eased her down to the floor, letting her lie on her hip. She was unable to do anything while he removed the double dildo, her mask and collar, the chains, all of it. When she opened her eyes, she couldn\u2019t do more than look up at him from the floor. Straightening, he had turned to pick up wipes and balm from a side table, the things he\u2019d use to care for her, clean her. The shirt was all the way open, pulled free of the belted slacks so she could see the appealing ridges of muscle along his upper torso. External obliques...down to the iliac furrow, that lovely V-cut of muscles that arrowed down into the groin.</p><p>Emotions coiled up tight in her chest as she once again remembered her playful teasing with her pre-med roommate. Also known as the Adonis belt, a result of low body fat and tight internal obliques pulling on their origin, the inguinal ligaments highlighted the lower rectus abdominis and external obliques. Tempting the female tongue to trace them down, down... God, she never stopped wanting him.</p><p>She managed to roll to her elbow. If he moved back even a step, she wouldn\u2019t make it, but he didn\u2019t. She sensed him turning his attention to her, stilling. Waiting to see what she was about to do. Pulling herself over those few inches, she pressed her mouth to his foot, a hard, fervent gesture. She forced herself back up onto her wobbling knees, slid back into a slave\u2019s posture, hands behind her back, head bowed, breasts thrust out, knees spread. The way she\u2019d begun.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Master,\u201d she said.</p><p>I saw your society date for the Spring charity ball on the NOLA online edition. The only thing made in nature on that woman was her cotton underwear.</p><p>Don\u2019t be too harsh, brat. We all start out made by nature, but we have to build other faces to survive in this world. Plus, I\u2019m pretty sure she wasn\u2019t wearing underwear. At least, that\u2019s what I heard.</p><p>Letter exchange between Ben and Marcie, her sophomore year</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Having broken subs down to the deepest level, Ben had seen them do a lot of very emotional things, things which fed his need to make them that vulnerable, to prove, at least in that moment, that they trusted him utterly with their naked, shivering souls. He cherished those times, even as he didn\u2019t hold onto them. The point was getting them there, a catharsis for them and pure, undiluted satisfaction for him as a Dominant.</p><p>He\u2019d given Marcie an incredibly intense workout, fueled as much by his own lust as her desire to learn what it was to serve a Master. Somewhere along the way, he\u2019d gotten immersed in it, so he was no longer teaching as much as he was actually striving to take her deeper and deeper into her head, have her give more and more of herself to him. Fuck, what had he been thinking?</p><p>She\u2019d told him he held himself away from his subs. He\u2019d told her that was the way he wanted it, that it was intentional. Then he\u2019d stepped across that line, gotten as deep into this as she had.</p><p>Watching her perform that remarkable act of obeisance, when she could barely sit up straight, when he knew every muscle in her body was shaking from stress, when her ass, pussy and nipples had to be sore as hell, it took the floor out from under him. For that one second, there was no rational thought. He wanted to fucking own her, make her follow him around naked, wearing nothing but those stilettos she\u2019d mentioned and a diamond and emerald collar and leash he\u2019d have made especially for her.</p><p>She\u2019d do it, would strut proudly, sweet sassy thing that she was, letting that ass swing and breasts jiggle, and give him that challenging smile that told him she could handle anything he could dish out...even if it killed her.</p><p>Though he always asked club subs for their safe word, he took them far past where they\u2019d have the sense to use it, so his intense scrutiny during a session had as much to do with their well-being as his own immersion in it. As he\u2019d told Lucas and Matt, she was the type of sub who\u2019d get so lost in her head she\u2019d happily allow a Master to kill or permanently injure her, and smile all the way to the last breath.</p><p>A lot of Masters wouldn\u2019t touch that kind of sub, because it was too damn much responsibility. Twisted bastard that he was, she was exactly the kind of sub he considered a treasure. She\u2019d trusted him more than any sub he\u2019d ever had, no hesitation in obeying anything he demanded.</p><p>Fuck. He went to one knee, caught her as she toppled. \u201cEasy,\u201d he murmured. She clutched his arms, opened her eyes to look at him. That hazy subspace disorientation was like crack to a Master. But her brown eyes were also full of devotion, care, a lot of things that made his chest tight.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d she said. Her voice was hoarse, words drunkenly slurred. \u201cStay with me? Sleep with me? Please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In answer, he lifted her in his arms. She bowed up against him like a baby, letting out a little sigh. \u201cFirst a bath,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cToo tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. You need to soak before you sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill drown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you drown. Unless you provoke me.\u201d</p><p>She let out a little snuffle at that, perhaps a chuckle. But she was in a half doze, completely dependent on him, no fight left...for the moment.</p><p>He set her on the padded wicker lounge in the master bath while he ran the Jacuzzi, added the salts. Then he turned to consider her. She was on her side, and her arm had fallen toward the floor, fingers half curled. She was boneless at this point. It would have made him smile, if it didn\u2019t make other things hurt, just looking at her. Taking off his clothes, he put a decanter of whiskey and a glass next to the tub. Then he lifted her once again, set them both down in it, putting the jets on a low boil. She didn\u2019t wake, merely shifting so her cheek was pillowed on his chest, her arms loosely around him. He slid his own arm around her back, resting his palm on her hip.</p><p>He\u2019d doused the lights, only a street light outside casting a dim illumination up into the bathroom. Laying his head back on the tile, holding her, he took a swallow of the whiskey, swirling it in the glass with his elbow propped on the side of the tub. Fucking hell.</p> <p>He passed his palm gently over her buttock under the water. Those marks would be there for a little while. He should be ashamed, but all the thought did was stir his cock back to life. Again.</p><p>No, he told it sternly. Give her a break, you sadistic son of a bitch. That one was directed at him, not his cock. His cock wasn\u2019t sadistic in the slightest. It just wanted pussy. Mindless beast. Actually, not quite so mindless, because right now he had no desire to turn his mind to any other woman available to him. Just the one in his arms.</p><p>He tried, thinking of some of the most beautiful, hardcore and willing subs he\u2019d had the pleasure of enjoying. As he did, his cock started to deflate. What the hell? He pointed his mind back to the abused ass pressed against his inner thigh, the feminine breath stirring his chest hair, and his cock rose again. Fuck.</p><p>It didn\u2019t mean anything. She was real and in his arms, while the others were pale visions in his head. Guys were simple that way. When he pressed his lips to the crown of her head, she made a sweet noise of contentment, her fingers sliding along the small of his back, resting limply against the upper rise of his buttocks.</p><p>He liked that noise, liked the way she felt in his arms. She\u2019d given his dungeon equipment a workout tonight, and it was about time. When he bought the townhouse, he\u2019d liked the way it felt, except it never seemed right when he was there by himself. He\u2019d cooked dinner for some of the guys and their wives a couple times, hosted a few business parties, but when he was alone, he preferred the Warehouse District apartment, which was really just an extension of his office with better kitchen facilities and a great flat-screen.</p><p>For a time, he\u2019d kept most of his high-end dungeon equipment there, but he\u2019d moved it here a couple years ago. There were two or three larger pieces at the other place, hidden behind a heavy plastic construction curtain he\u2019d covered with decorative dark wood screens, since the Warehouse apartment was an open loft. At this house, he kept the high-end equipment behind a closed door. Both measures were to prevent the uninitiated from wandering into those areas.</p> <p>That\u2019s what he told himself. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t like coming to either place and seeing the equipment waiting for something he didn\u2019t bring home to it anymore.</p><p>He had a discreet maintenance service that came in and kept everything cleaned and oiled, ready for use at any time. It was probably a waste of money, since he had access to Progeny\u2019s equipment and that was where he went now when his cock needed a workout. But questioning costs was Jon and Lucas\u2019 area, not his. He could wallpaper the house with Ben Franklins if he wanted. So he spent the money. Tonight he was glad he had, because he\u2019d put all of it through its paces, testing Marcie far beyond what he\u2019d expected her limits to be.</p><p>When it was all over, she\u2019d put her mouth on his foot, called him Master. And for one fucking insane moment, he\u2019d thought, You bet your sweet ass I am.</p><p>Jesus. He finished the whiskey, set it aside. Didn\u2019t let himself pour another. You\u2019re in charge of a beautiful girl tonight, buddy. No getting shit-faced. He\u2019d save that for sunrise, when she was going to hate his guts.</p><p>He got her out of the tub, summoning a tight smile at her sleepy grumbling. He made her stand while he dried her off one-handed, since the other arm had to stay around her waist to keep her from oozing back to the tile. Guiding her arm around his neck, he lifted her once more. It was ridiculous, how much he liked just carrying her.</p><p>He could put her in the guest bedroom, but he needed to watch over her until she was in control of her faculties again. It had been a long night. So he was going to put her in his bed, with him, no matter how bad an idea that was.</p><p>He\u2019d been fooling himself about this mentoring shit. He was a one-way track to nowhere, and Marcie was a bright, beautiful star who deserved the whole universe.</p><p>He took her into his bedroom, to the king-sized canopy bed that filled most of the room. The ceiling fan rotated slowly. Lowering her to the bed, he paused, studying her. He\u2019d laid her down facing away from him, so he was looking at his handiwork from that angle, every mark, bite, her ass still a brighter pink than the rest of her silky skin. The caning marks, those short lines and stippling, overlaid the faint square impression of the spatula strikes. She\u2019d loved it. Fought it, cried through it, embraced it, come like a damn nymphomaniac from it.</p> <p>He should put on sweats, a T-shirt. Fuck that. He wanted to feel her against his body, and she had passed out now, anyway. Sliding in behind her, he arranged the covers over her to keep her front warm while he pressed against her back. His cock had ignored him of course, and was hard and eager when it came in contact with the soft pillow of her buttocks. He wanted more, but he didn\u2019t want to cause her any pain.</p><p>Lifting her thigh, he slid just the head back into her ass. He\u2019d lubricated her frequently, so there was plenty of oil there to allow him entry. He slid in a few more inches than intended but she made a soft sound, closed her muscles on him, just as he\u2019d taught her, an automatic reflex. It made him growl, a satisfied predator. Cupping her breast, he murmured against her ear.</p><p>\u201cSleep, baby. You did well.\u201d What a fucking understatement.</p><p>Marcie woke to find herself comfortably nested in the covers. What she\u2019d hoped might be Ben behind her was instead a brace of pillows. It was about three a.m., the hour when restless spirits were most plentiful, explaining why she\u2019d woken to find herself alone.</p><p>Rising with caution, she found she was stiff and sore, but overall moving better than anticipated, since she hadn\u2019t expected to be able to move without undignified yowls of agony. She did yoga and MMA training, and those flexibility and strength workouts helped her, but she suspected the breaks Ben had taken between sessions had a great deal to do with it as well. He\u2019d massaged her muscles and joints with those clean-smelling salves, washed her out with soothing tonics, changed her position at appropriate intervals, double- and triple-checked her bindings. Vaguely, she remembered him putting two pills on her tongue after that hazy bath, telling her to swallow, then making her finish up the glass of water.</p><p>Aspirin, brat. That, and the bath, should make things move easier tomorrow.</p><p>He knew just how extreme he was, and did the maintenance to ensure he left a lasting impression but not lasting damage. At least on a woman\u2019s body. Her heart was a whole different matter.</p><p>His dress shirt was hanging on the armoire doorknob, above a bag of laundry with a dry-cleaning ticket. A reminder to him to drop it off today, she was sure. Things a single lawyer had to do for himself. Fingering the cloth, remembering it close to her face when he carried her up here, she pulled it from its perch, brought the collar to her nose. A combination of aftershave, soap, dry cleaning and what she really wanted to detect\u2014male sweat, earned from his sexual exertion with her.</p><p>Considering, she threaded her arms into the sleeves. Oh my. For all her teasing him about his expensive indulgences, the feel of tailored cotton was...luxurious. Particularly if it smelled like Ben. These fibers had the enviable job of stroking that superb upper body all day long.</p><p>When she moved out into the hallway, she saw the French doors on the second level open to a narrow balcony. There were several potted plants there, as well as a couple outdoor chairs to view the enclosed alley below. When they arrived, she\u2019d stolen a quick glimpse of it. She remembered a statue of a laughing child placed under the rush of water from a fountain. Thick greenery had swayed around it, a cobblestone path and a single chair suggesting a perfect nook to read and dream the lazy New Orleans day away. She wondered if he ever used it, or if it was his neighbor\u2019s space.</p><p>Ben was leaning against the rail, but he wasn\u2019t looking down at that scene. He had his head turned as if studying the nearby street, but there was a lack of focus in the green eyes that suggested his focus was internal. All he wore was a pair of faded jeans that rode low on his hips. It was so carelessly sexy it made her mouth water, despite the fact her body felt as if it had been through the sensual equivalent of being drop-kicked by the entire New Orleans Saints team.</p><p>There was also a loneliness to him. The moonlight gleamed on his hair, reflected the brooding look in his eyes, the wooden quality of his expression. It tightened her heart, made her go to him.</p><p>She stepped over the threshold. Since the balcony was so narrow, it brought her right up behind him. He tilted his head, aware of her, and she dared, laying her hand between his shoulder blades. She hadn\u2019t buttoned the shirt, so when he reached back, took her hand beneath his arm to bring her closer, she pressed her bare breasts against him, her mound against the firm flesh beneath denim.</p><p>Laying her cheek on his back, she heard the strong thump of his heart. He held her hand against his abdomen, stroking her fingers and studying the night sky in silence. She touched those ridged muscles, traced them, and when she angled for more, he let her hand descend. Teasing the arrow of silky hair, she pressed her lips to his spine. He didn\u2019t move, but she didn\u2019t feel rebuffed. She thought he might be holding his breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Earlier, he\u2019d clearly been Master to slave. It was what he\u2019d wanted, what she\u2019d wanted, and she\u2019d reveled in the fact he loosed that desire upon her, given her the chance to prove she could match it. But this was different, indefinable. Something moved between them now, something that was part of it and yet even deeper. Holding her breath now, she reached the waistband of the jeans. She traced that, back and forth, aroused by the beauty of his fit body, the power of it he\u2019d demonstrated so capably, again and again. Under her other palm, his heart was thumping a little faster. So was hers.</p><p>The jeans were loose, so she maneuvered beneath the waistband, found the trimmed pubic area, then lower, to the heated base of his cock. She was able to partly circle it with her thumb and forefinger. Her intent wasn\u2019t arousal, not exactly. She was gripping him, marveling at the heat and virility of the organ, at how much she could desire it inside her.</p><p>She explored the velvet skin stretched over the steel of it, because he was obviously hardening under her touch. His stomach muscles contracted as he shifted his hips, and she helped guide his shaft out of a folded position, letting it stretch up more comfortably beneath the zipper. It let her stroke her fingers more fully up and down its length, though the diminishing space was allowing less maneuvering room.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any photos,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJon, Matt, any of them. Not even of my brothers and sisters. Or of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t do photos.\u201d He sighed, looking up at the sky again as she let the other hand descend so she could use both. It required opening the jeans, but he didn\u2019t stop her as she did that, took a two-handed grip, started to explore more aggressively. Her nipples had tightened against his back, and she rubbed her mound against his ass. The jeans slipped a little lower. She wanted to go to her knees, kiss her way down his spine, tease that dip between his buttocks with the tip of her tongue, see if she could make him shiver as he\u2019d made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re messing me up, Marcie. You\u2019re just a baby.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, the rough quality of his voice bringing her heart into her throat. \u201cI\u2019m your baby,\u201d she said against his skin. \u201cAll yours. Love me, Ben. Love me in the dark, let me be whatever you want me to be. Stop worrying about me. Take what you need.\u201d</p><p>I am a baby. I\u2019m scared to death, because I rely on your strength and your knowledge, but if I have to, I\u2019ll lead.</p><p>He turned in her arms, dislodging her hands. Gripping her wrists, he studied her. His expression was brittle stone, those eyes measuring. Old. Ancient, even.</p><p>\u201cIf my Master is lost,\u201d she said, her voice shaking a little, \u201cI\u2019ll find him. I\u2019ll lead him back to himself, because to serve doesn\u2019t always mean to follow.\u201d</p><p>As he stared at her, she pushed against his hold. He didn\u2019t relent immediately, but she insisted, and then he let her put her hands on his face. Lifting on her toes, she brought her body up against him, laid her mouth softly on his. Teased his lips, touched them with her tongue, playing with him, coaxing him to respond. His head moved, his lips starting to answer her flirtation, and when he nipped at her, she smiled against his mouth.</p><p>He came to life then, summoning a pleased purr from her throat. His arms slid into the shirt and around her, one around her waist, the other dropping so his hand could grip her ass. He hiked her up in an effortless move that let her wrap her own arms around his shoulders. He didn\u2019t take her inside. Instead, he pushed her up against the balcony wall, his body pressed to the core of hers, and the kiss was suddenly much deeper, all consuming.</p><p>God, the man could kiss. Wet heat, just like what was gathering between her legs, rubbing against his cock. The cool teeth of the open zipper scratched against her inner thigh, where he\u2019d slapped her with the spatula earlier. He had his other hand on her nape now, fingers tangled in her hair, tugging in that hard way he did, a Master\u2019s grip, reminding a slave of her place. She fought him, fought to deepen the kiss from her end, because she wasn\u2019t going to miss the chance to savor it even more fully.</p><p>She wondered if he\u2019d take her here, under the night sky, where a neighbor might look out of the adjacent house and see their silhouettes mating among the flowers. Instead, he took a firmer grip on her, side-stepped over the threshold. He kissed her against that wall, and she moaned, telling him she wanted him.</p><p>\u201cInsatiable,\u201d he murmured against her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re insatiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to pretend otherwise, protected by the cloak of the night. He said nothing to that, just flexed his arm around her again, holding her to him to carry her down the dark hall, back into his bedroom.</p><p>She expected him to turn her over, bend her over the bed. Instead, he laid her down on her back in that nest he\u2019d left her in before, only now he was over her, his knee pressed between her legs.</p><p>\u201cArms above your head,\u201d he said quietly, those emerald eyes gleaming in the dim light from the windows.</p><p>She complied, though she hated letting go of him. His gaze coursed over her as he adjusted the shirt so it was fully open, so he could see all of her. He trailed a knuckle down her sternum, under the curve of her left breast. The nipple jewelry gleamed, and when he caught one, tugging, she gasped, arching up to his touch.</p><p>\u201cStay still, cher.\u201d</p><p>Cajun. Oh God. She really had to ask how he did that, switched to different accents according to his moods, as if he was a split personality. Maybe he was, because she knew it had taken a lot of different Bens to become the man she was with tonight.</p><p>He bent, kissed her breast to the right of the piercing. He nuzzled her nipple but didn\u2019t suckle. Instead he moved to her sternum, rubbed his jaw between her breasts, teasing the tender skin with his beard shadow. Then he moved down, his lips on her navel, catching the dangling silver rose there in his teeth, tugging on it and eliciting another gasp. Then lower. Marcie\u2019s hands curled into balls as his heated breath skated over her clit. When he pressed his open mouth high on her thigh, so close that his hair brushed her labia, she moaned.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to eat your cunt, sweet darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want...my Master to do...whatever he pleases.\u201d She let him see the absolute truth of it in her gaze. \u201cI\u2019m all yours.\u201d His pleasure was hers, one and the same.</p><p>\u201cWhen you told me about your fantasy with Lucas and Cass...if he was eating your cunt tonight, while I fucked you from behind, how would that feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d died and gone to heaven, as long as it was what you command of me.\u201d She could barely breathe. \u201cI want you, Master. It\u2019s all you.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head then, put his mouth on her. Oh holy...God. God. God. God. Lucas was known as the master of oral sex, but obviously he\u2019d shared his talents, or Ben\u2019s were nothing to be sneezed at. His tongue flicked her clit at just the right pace, with erratic movements that kept her crying out, struggling not to move when she wanted to buck against his mouth. He thrust his tongue into her when she was so wildly excited that it made her scream aloud at the sensation.</p><p>Lapping at her cream, he suckled her so she could hear it. When he sealed his heated mouth over all of it, her cunt and clit both, started swirling, flicking and teasing, she came to pieces. She came, period, no time to ask permission, but it was obvious his intent was to drive her over that edge.</p><p>Right in the middle of that peak, he raised up, taking his mouth away, but before she could wrap her mind around the sudden, shocking loss, he was there instead, sliding his full, turgid length into her slick pussy, so slick that even with his size, he worked in with barely a pause, her tissues still spasming around him. He was stroking inside her almost immediately, so the aborted climax wasn\u2019t aborted at all. It was like a hurricane that did a somersault and came screaming back to the same center eye again.</p><p>\u201cBe still, baby. Very, very still.\u201d</p><p>He slowed down, watched her frantic face as she fought not to move. She wanted to lift her hips, force him to continue the same pace or thrust. Instead, she made tiny pleas, caught in a string of spasms that drew out even further while he did those slow, dragging strokes. It became even more intense, so all her muscles locked, her lips stretched back from her teeth in a feral snarl.</p><p>Then he came to a full stop, lodged deep inside her. Marcie quaked, and when he framed her face with his hands, bringing his body down full on her, she bit his palm in ferocious need.</p><p>\u201cFierce kitten,\u201d he growled. \u201cTouch me now. Move all you want.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to buck like a rodeo bronc spurred from confinement, but even through that roaring need, she wanted something else. She slid her arms around his shoulders, locked her legs over his hips like a drowning swimmer. \u201cCan you take off the jeans without moving?\u201d She pressed the gasp to his ear. \u201cWill you let me feel you against me, nothing between us?\u201d</p><p>It occurred to him then, to both of them. His muscles tensed, and he tried to pull out, but she held on tight. While he could overpower her, she made a noise of such vehement protest he paused.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m protected from pregnancy. I have been for some time. I know you don\u2019t take risks. I know you\u2019re clean. You\u2019re my first...without wearing anything. Please don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>It startled him to the core that he\u2019d forgotten to don protection, she could see it. If he withdrew from her now, unsettled by that realization, she wouldn\u2019t survive it. She wasn\u2019t near as confident as she seemed. She just loved him enough to bluff him into believing she could handle anything, no matter how rough or cruel he was.</p><p>But there was no cruelty now, only earth-shattering tenderness as he cupped her face anew, brushed her lips, gave her a nod. A slight smile touched his mouth, a trace of unexpected humor in his eyes. \u201cIf you can get your heel into the back of my jeans, you can push them to my knees. We can probably work them off from there.\u201d</p><p>His jeans were already mostly off his gorgeous ass, and she took full advantage of the sensory input through the soles of her feet as she curved one over his buttock, hooked her toes into the seat and worked the denim down to his thighs, maneuvering her other foot to get them to his knees. He did manage to get them off, but unfortunately it pulled him out of her as he did it, the tip of his cock leaving a delicious wet trail down her inner thigh. But her hands were between them in an instant, gripping him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease, let me.\u201d</p><p>His jaw flexed as she guided him back to her empty pussy. She bit her lip, staring up at him so he saw every change in her expression as she pulled him deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cI love how big you are,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow it hurts and feels good at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>Like love itself. From the shadows in his face, she could tell this was new ground for him. It was for her as well. So she buried her face in his neck then, taking a sharp nip of his neck, winding her arms and legs around him again.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Master. Fuck me. Use me for your pleasure.\u201d All yours. She repeated that in her mind, and then her mind was completely lost as he began to move.</p><p>He started with those slow thrusts forward and deep, dragging withdrawals that just devastated her, physically and emotionally. She loved having him on top of her, pinning her down, joined so closely. It made tears come to her eyes, the perfection of it all. As he started to pick up in speed and force, she held on, willing to go on the ride with him, now to eternity.</p><p>Her climax rekindled, the delay only concentrating it. His cock bruised, stretched and demanded more and more of her, and she met the challenge, clamping down on him, rippling her muscles along his length, holding his body tighter with the strength of her own. He would outlast her, because he was just that bloody strong, but as her strength flagged, he cinched his arm low on her waist, the other around her back, and he took over, driving into her so her body arched up like a doll\u2019s, helpless to his power as he took her to the edge he desired.</p><p>Everything caught fire, so fast it took her by surprise, but then the overwhelming storm of it drove away everything. She\u2019d never had a climax like it, her heart, mind and soul fully pulled into the moment so she was almost sure the universe had stopped moving on this one fixed point. She was biting his shoulder, her fingers raking his back, finding blood. She exulted in his savage grunts as he released, spilling himself into her. The first time Ben O\u2019Callahan had given his seed to a woman rather than to a condom.</p> <p>She was sure of it.</p><p>It pushed her even higher, and he rode her to the finish, pulling every aftershock out of her until she was begging for mercy, a mercy she knew he would deny her, thank God.</p><p>Her Master was ruthless, demanding, all hers. At least for this one, perfect moment.</p><p>I went to a dance for the new freshmen tonight. Most of it was the usual loud techno-pop stuff, but then somebody played that Allison Krauss version of \u201cWhen You Say Nothing At All\u201d. It made me think of you. I danced with a few guys, but mostly I just danced with part of a big group. It was nice, even though this one girl said I looked so serious, like I was studying for a test, instead of dancing. It occurred to me then that I\u2019m used to you being the one who reminds me how to smile and laugh, and now I\u2019ll have to do that all on my own. I guess that\u2019s good. If I learn to do it on my own, I can remind you to smile and laugh when you get old and crotchety. Oh, forgot...you\u2019re already old and crotchety.</p><p>Letter from Marcie</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>Dawn came. Even though it was beautiful, the sunlight on her face waking her in a bedroom that smelled like him and the musky scent of their sex, she knew from the first second something wasn\u2019t quite right. It wasn\u2019t just that he was absent. Her clothes had been laid out on a chair, and it looked like someone had ironed them. Ben probably had a bevy of domestic servants chained in his basement. She wouldn\u2019t put it past him.</p><p>She held her breath, listening, then relaxed as she heard movement on the lower level. If he\u2019d bailed on her, gone on in to work, he would have at least left her a note and some coffee brewing. He might be an emotionally repressed bastard about certain things, but common courtesy wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>Pushing herself up, she saw he had left her a note, as well as a trio of Advil and a glass of water. A tiny wildflower lay on the note. Take the Advil, drink the water, and do another soak in a hot shower. Get dressed for work. Breakfast will be waiting downstairs.</p><p>He\u2019d said they\u2019d spend the day together, preparing to go to Progeny tonight. He\u2019d changed his mind. Or maybe something had come up. It was a weekday, after all, and K&amp;A sometimes needed their lawyer even on a planned day off. Yeah right. She picked up the wildflower, let it tickle her chin. It was a nice touch, but it still felt impersonal, removed. The type of thing a hotel might do. She\u2019d figured out how he dealt with the women in his life, the easy charm that was devastating to their senses but didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes.</p><p>Cass said he\u2019d worked up some awesome, elaborate dishes for Savannah during her pregnancy, when she didn\u2019t feel like eating anything else. For Nate\u2019s most recent birthday, he\u2019d arranged a paintball party a general would have admired for troop mobilization and attack strategy. When he extended true affection, love, he went all out with it. In the right mood, Ben was more...rough, natural.</p><p>He\u2019d have crushed flowers over her sleeping form, covered her in petals. Twined the stems around her wrists, a gentle bondage. But this...this was distance. Her stomach tightened into a cold ball. Surely after everything they\u2019d shared last night, he wouldn\u2019t...</p><p>Yes, he would. Exactly because of what they\u2019d shared last night.</p><p>She would take the shower, don the clothes because he\u2019d told her to do it. It was her Master\u2019s order and she wanted to be compliant. But if he wasn\u2019t pulling back, work or no work, he would have wanted her to come down completely naked, still smelling of his scent. He would have had her kneel at his feet, fed her bits of breakfast from his fingertips as he read the morning stock reports, glancing at the flat-screen for live business news. She could live on that kind of detached connection like a drug.</p> <p>Last night...there were no words for it. Until the reality, she hadn\u2019t known exactly what it was she craved, what she could take. Two walls of his shower were mirrored, and even with the steam, they showed her his marks.</p><p>She had bruises on the back of her legs from the slapper that had felt like a doubled-over fire extinguisher hose, weighted down inside to make the thud that much more significant. There was stippling on her ass cheeks from the rattan cane. When he went after her with his favorite tool, a flexible paddle, the burning and stinging sensations had come so close together she couldn\u2019t be still. At one point he\u2019d laid his upper body over her back, pinning her down as she squealed from the pain.</p><p>She loved those marks, loved seeing them. She only hoped they weren\u2019t the only things that would be around for the next couple days. Suppressing a sigh, she got out, dried off and picked up the bag that Cass had left. She wasn\u2019t going to be fatalistic. She knew what she wanted, and she was going to get it. Ben wanted her to think she was imagining things she craved and he didn\u2019t, but she had to believe she knew what she knew, or her courage would falter.</p><p>The convoluted nature of the thought gave her lips a wry twist. Opening the overnight bag, she saw the folded note, recognized Cass\u2019 handwriting.</p><p>Jon said to remind you of this: To thine own self be true. This one\u2019s from me: Be careful and know that I love you. I\u2019m here.</p><p>It made tears prick her eyelids, but she pushed them back. She was going to be less weepy today, no matter that Ben had torn open every shield she had last night. All but the one guarding her determination to have him as her permanent Master.</p><p>Fortified somewhat, she tucked that note inside her bra and went down the stairs. Sunshine was bathing the breakfast nook. Ben was wearing fresh work clothes, charcoal slacks and an open white shirt, green and black tie hanging off the back of the chair. He was barefoot, his shoes polished and waiting by the counter island with a folded pair of socks. He was going to work. He wasn\u2019t spending the day with her, at least not the way he\u2019d said. Which meant he was likely backing out of taking her to Progeny.</p><p>She firmed her jaw, came into the kitchen. She\u2019d stayed barefoot as well, but sat her heels down with a quiet click next to his shoes. He glanced up, though she expected he\u2019d known the minute her feet crossed the upper landing. \u201cGood morning. Have a seat and I\u2019ll bring you your breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind getting it.\u201d She had to clear her throat, since the hoarseness from last night remained. He gave her a look.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d His tone was congenial, but firm, so she sat. She would have moved toward him, tried for a kiss, a caress, but he\u2019d already moved away, gesturing to her chair with detached courtesy.</p><p>That cold ball in her stomach was getting worse. Removing a plate from the oven, he brought her an omelet so fluffy it was a couple inches thick. She could smell the mixture of appetizing cheeses, and it was scattered with half spheres of fresh garden cherry tomatoes. A long time ago, he\u2019d told her the key to good cooking wasn\u2019t fancy combinations and syrup drizzled artfully on the plate, but fresh ingredients.</p><p>\u201cThis looks marvelous. Like the last meal for a death-row inmate.\u201d She shifted her gaze to his face, kept her voice even. \u201cWhat is this, Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat your breakfast, then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the plate away. \u201cNo. If you were standing on the other side of the Grand Canyon, you\u2019d be closer to me than you are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being melodramatic.\u201d He crossed his arms, leaned against the counter, his expression tight. There was a warning simmering in those green eyes, but she didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m talking in a calm, reasonable tone, just like you are.\u201d The edge in her voice earned her a narrow glance, but she continued. \u201cI\u2019m not capable of enjoying a breakfast this good if there\u2019s a ton of bricks already in my digestive tract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pack it up for you then. Max will take you to work. Dana had a full schedule at the church and he was in the neighborhood. You can pick up the things you left in my office. I\u2019ve had you reassigned to K&amp;A\u2019s research department on the fifth floor. Given your career specialty, you\u2019ll learn more there. You\u2019re an exceptional investigator, Marcie. You shouldn\u2019t be wasting your time as my paralegal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Things were replaying in her head. Everything that had happened last night. The times she\u2019d cried and he\u2019d wiped those tears away. The screaming orgasms. The way he\u2019d completely taken her over, broken her open.</p><p>\u201cIs this the way you do it? Give a woman the experience of her life, and then it\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to know more about serving a Master. Last night, I gave you what I intended to give you at Progeny, so that\u2019s no longer necessary. Lesson over. At least with me. There are some Doms I\u2019ll recommend who can mentor you at the club until you find someone willing to pair up with you according to your desires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou agreed to mentor me.\u201d She would keep her voice level, not accusatory. She would not stamp her feet or cry. She was going to do this as an adult, make him fucking admit he was the one acting immature.</p> <p>He met her gaze with implacable eyes. His words remained cool, reasonable. Which was why she knew it was all bullshit. But he wasn\u2019t showing any cracks in the fa\u00e7ade, anything she could use to break past that wall he\u2019d built against her this morning. It was like he\u2019d reinforced it with fucking concrete while she slept.</p><p>\u201cYou came to me for guidance, and I\u2019ve given you that. If you\u2019ve done your research, you know the protocol. When a Master or sub says it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. You respect the boundaries and the consent.\u201d</p><p>He moved then, came to sit at the table with her. He didn\u2019t smile, didn\u2019t stab her in the chest with a gesture that patently dismissive of her feelings, but he did put his hand over hers. Now she saw his expression soften, become kind. \u201cYou were incredible last night. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better submissive, so know that much. You just need to move on and look elsewhere. I have no problem helping you with that. You\u2019ve told me you\u2019re not a child. I believe you, so I expect you to respect my decision like a reasonable adult. We\u2019ve always been friends. I\u2019m still your friend.\u201d</p><p>The Doms he had in mind were probably about her age, competent enough, but no one who would be a challenge, who could even touch what he\u2019d been able to do to her. He might not acknowledge it consciously, but it would be deliberate. He wouldn\u2019t want anything that could compete with him. He refused to accept her, but he\u2019d control the replacement candidate pool. If she could have bristled under his touch like a porcupine, she would have.</p><p>Rising, he picked up her plate. It made him lean over her, and the scent and strength of him, so close, was almost overwhelming. While he put her breakfast in a container as promised, she sat there numbly. When he disappeared briefly up the stairs, she stared out the window at a fence, a bird bath. An oak tree with a decorative lizard sculpture attached to it. He reappeared with her overnight bag. \u201cI have a flight out this morning for an afternoon meeting in Houston. I\u2019ll touch base with you when I get back and we\u2019ll talk out the details. I told Research you\u2019re doing some freelance for Pickard, so they know you might need to be on a part-time schedule with them on some days.\u201d</p> <p>How considerate of him. He had an appointment in Houston today; tonight, instead of going to Progeny with him, she\u2019d have an appointment with a Dumpster, her latest strategy to uncover dirt about the company being sued by Pickard\u2019s client for insurance fraud. It was a fitting change of schedule, seeing as she was being kicked out like garbage.</p><p>Ben had his hand on her elbow to bring her to her feet. With smooth efficiency, he moved them toward the door. Probably a scenario he\u2019d enacted with countless women before her. Except she wasn\u2019t them. He probably strolled to the door with them, rather than ushering them out like his ass was on fire. They\u2019d been casual lays, after all, everyone reasonable adults about it. Unlike her.</p><p>\u201cTell Max if you need to stop anywhere before you get to the office. Take more Advil through the day if you need it, and another long soak in Cass and Lucas\u2019 hot tub tonight. I\u2019ve put some more of that balm in your overnight bag for the sore areas.\u201d He brushed his lips over her cheek\u2014her cheek\u2014and opened the door, propelling her into the alcove. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Calm and Reasonable?\u201d She pivoted on her bare foot, looked up at him. \u201cMy shoes are still inside. If you throw them out onto the sidewalk, I might chase after them like a dog after a ball, giving you a chance to slam the door. But I\u2019d rather not get them scratched.\u201d</p><p>He started, glancing down at her feet, her painted toes. As he stared at them a long moment, she could see him sorting through things. He didn\u2019t miss details. Not unless something had unsettled him. A casual, reasonable bed partner didn\u2019t unsettle him. She\u2019d have let her lips curl in a satisfied smile if it wouldn\u2019t feel like a knife slash across her tight face.</p><p>He lifted his gaze to her. He at least had the decency to give her a wry quirk of his lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m being an ass. This isn\u2019t personal, Marcie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is so incredibly personal you can\u2019t get rid of me fast enough. If I was one of your easy ass fucks, you\u2019d be ordering me to go down on you underneath the breakfast table while you ate your fluffy, pretty omelet.\u201d Ignoring the fact that as her voice rose, the squeaks and breaks of her abraded vocal cords got worse, she stepped back into him, locked her hands in his shirt front. \u201cYou made love to me last night. You let me inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake. I care about you, Marcie.\u201d When he put his hands over her wrists, his face was locked down again, that expression she was beginning to hate. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this. There\u2019s no way any of it works, and you need to stop trying. I\u2019ll be cruel if you force me to it. That\u2019s a promise. Take what you\u2019ve been given and leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I give you, Ben?\u201d She stared up at him. He was looking at her, but not really at her. It was as if he\u2019d blanked out her features and was staring at something faceless. She dug her nails into flesh. She\u2019d marked him as well. He had claw marks in his back. \u201cYou figure if you give a woman Nirvana, she\u2019ll be okay with the fact you\u2019ve taken nothing for yourself? It doesn\u2019t play with me. You thought I was out of it in the tub last night. I wasn\u2019t. You were intimate with me. Caring. And don\u2019t you dare deny what happened after, on the balcony.\u201d</p><p>His eyes went ice cold so abruptly it startled her. Putting his hands on her wrists, he detached her hands from his shirtfront. \u201cWait here.\u201d</p><p>He turned, shutting the door as if he didn\u2019t believe she\u2019d obey, and she probably wouldn\u2019t have, except the frigid look in his eyes held her frozen, uncertain. When he came back, opened the door, he held her shoes. He locked her stiff fingers around them.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t talk about this further. Not right now. You\u2019re not in the right frame of mind for it, and neither am I. Go to the limo.\u201d When she continued to stand there, staring at him, he physically moved her off the stoop onto the walkway, closed the grate to the alcove, shutting her out. He stared at her through the bars. She wondered if he realized it looked like he was shutting himself into a prison cell.</p><p>\u201cI am your friend, Marcie, but from this moment on, only your friend. We are to each other what we were a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. She gave a bitter laugh. \u201cYeah, that much is true. The funny thing is, I\u2019m the only one who accepts what that is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you when I get back from Houston.\u201d With that, he stepped back into the house and closed the door. Fucking closed the door in her face.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t talk to her when he got back. He\u2019d do everything he could to avoid talking to her. When they next saw one another, it would be at a Thanksgiving or Christmas gathering with the others, where he could treat her with smooth charm, like any other woman he held at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>What swept through her was so strong, it made her lightheaded. She swayed, closed her eyes. Which was a mistake, since images from last night once again went through her head. The power of them, the emotion, the all-consuming...everything. He\u2019d say he\u2019d given her what she wanted, and she only had herself to blame for putting her heart out there, when he\u2019d told her what to expect. What total horseshit. What happened last night wasn\u2019t a one-sided experience.</p><p>She was young, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. She also wasn\u2019t some melodramatic teenager, imagining things. Even when she was in her teens, she\u2019d looked at him and seen things others hadn\u2019t. She remembered it now, him standing in the shadows of Jon and Rachel\u2019s wedding, watching their first dance. For just a brief moment, there\u2019d been a look in his eyes...</p><p>It recalled the many painful times she\u2019d been reminded she had no parents to come to awards ceremonies, see her off to prom, ask her how her day had gone, things every other kid with functioning parents took for granted. He trusted very few, and those few were now married, somehow pulled away from him, even though it looked as if they were still standing right there, where they\u2019d always been. Everybody dealt with change, but it broke her heart, seeing in that brief glimpse that this was a path he didn\u2019t know how to follow, shutting him out of their happiness.</p><p>Unable to see that desolation and not try to help, she\u2019d gone to him. Yeah, she was a shy awkward teen, but she thought of him as her friend. Sidling up to him in those shadows, she\u2019d elbowed him to catch his attention. His expression was back to being what was expected, congratulatory and amused, but that didn\u2019t matter. She pulled his head down to whisper in his ear, steeling herself to keep her cool, even though his whiskey-sweet breath was on her neck.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go put an \u2018I support offshore drilling\u2019 sticker on the back of Jon\u2019s hydroelectric getaway car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d retaliate. Put a Disney Gay Pride Day sticker on the back of the McLaren.\u201d</p><p>She smirked up at him, glad to see the sad look replaced by his smile. \u201cThen let me have some of your drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes everything fun happen then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to boys. For girls, it\u2019s age thirty. Your lives totally suck until then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d punched him in the side and he\u2019d hugged her, pressing a brotherly kiss on the top of her head. Later she\u2019d talked him into dancing with her, even doing the YMCA dance. She had incriminating photos to prove it.</p><p>She\u2019d made it her private mission to keep an eye on him during that event. She knew what it was to hunger for what one might never have. It gnawed, it ached. At a key moment, that hunger could break loose and result in very, very bad behavior.</p><p>Coming back to the present, she studied her surroundings with narrowed eyes. Finding what she sought, she nodded to herself and pivoted toward the street, for the first time registering the limo and the man leaning against it, patiently waiting for her.</p> <p>She wondered if Max had been standing there when she and Ben had her exchange at the door. Even if he\u2019d still been sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, he would have known from their body language things weren\u2019t peachy. Max didn\u2019t miss much.</p><p>The K&amp;A women joked about how much he looked like Peter, since he was Dana\u2019s regular driver. Blond, gray-eyed, with lots of muscles that had been used in his previous work as a Navy Seal. Why he\u2019d spent the past few years working for the company motor pool was a mystery, but they\u2019d speculated about it. As well as a lot more inappropriate things about the handsome, quiet male.</p><p>He wore a pair of belted tan khakis and white shirt open at the throat, a jacket over that. She had no doubt he had a weapon underneath it. Always prepared, after all. He nodded to her as she approached. \u201cMiss Marcie. Good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d It was a reflex answer as she handed him her bag and her shoes. The large fingers closing around the dainty straps would have amused her under normal circumstances, but right now, she had a different mission. Her hands now free, she turned around, headed back toward the front door.</p><p>She stepped off the path, smoothing her skirt modestly up under her thighs as she squatted. Selecting a handful of the smooth rocks that formed the mulch around the well-tended shrubs, she found they had a good weight and size in a woman\u2019s palm. Aware of Max\u2019s regard, she nevertheless ignored it.</p> <p>Moving back onto the walkway, she backed up a sufficient number of steps, gauging her distance and studying her potential targets. Ben would have gone back upstairs. There was an office there, right off the bedroom. He preferred work when anything was aggravating him, and he\u2019d made it clear she was an aggravation. His desk was close to that window. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cBen.\u201d Her throat had resigned itself to being abused, so it was settling into a kind of sexy, intense Lauren Bacall sound. She\u2019d been able to hear the muted rush of passing cars in the bedroom, so the window insulation wasn\u2019t soundproof. She was loud enough to be heard. \u201cHere\u2019s how reasonable adults react when they have feelings.\u201d</p><p>The first rock hit the upper office window dead on, breaking through with a satisfying shattering noise. The lower panel went next. She hoped she\u2019d winged him, bounced the damn thing off his stubborn head. It would probably break the rock. Then she adjusted her stance and aimed for the bedroom window, where that amazing moment of connection had happened. When he\u2019d lain upon her, looking down at her, her legs coiled over his hips, his hands on her face. She\u2019d leave an explosion of broken glass so he\u2019d have to strip the bed, get the linens washed or get splinters in his ass.</p><p>She hesitated when she lowered her gaze to the first level. Yeah, she could send a rock zinging through the wrought iron bars and take out door panels, but they were beautiful old stained glass. Some things were sacred. She targeted the living area windows instead, and used the last couple rocks for the other side, his dining room. Though she was standing about twenty feet away, she didn\u2019t miss a single target. Before Jeremy had changed from her brother into an addict, he\u2019d shown her how to throw a rock pretty damn well.</p><p>She was breathing a little erratically, but any desire to cry was gone. She was flat- out pissed, her blood on full boil. If he walked out that door, she wasn\u2019t entirely sure another rock wouldn\u2019t be aimed at his forehead as though a bull\u2019s-eye was drawn there. But of course he wasn\u2019t coming out. Stubborn bastard. No, worse than stubborn.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re too chickenshit to take me to a club,\u201d she snarled up at the now fully aerated window treatments, \u201cI will go by myself. Fuck you. How\u2019s that for reasonable?\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, she knew better than to bluff Ben O\u2019Callahan, but this time, she wasn\u2019t sure it was a bluff. She was so mad, she was going to throw it out there. To thine own self be true.</p><p>It was time to fall back, regroup, or she was going to prove herself an obsessed stalker after all. She\u2019d climb through one of those windows and beat him to death. Nothing said love like a two-by-four applied to soft tissue areas.</p><p>She marched toward the limo. Max was still leaning against the car, arms crossed over his broad chest. There was some sympathy in his gaze, some sardonic amusement. Apparently his scope of responsibility hadn\u2019t included stopping her. She would have liked to see him try. She was more than ready to kick someone\u2019s ass. Instead, she was going to have him take her home. She was doing exactly what she\u2019d intended today. Mostly.</p><p>She\u2019d call Research and tell them she\u2019d report Monday, because she was in no mood to be at K&amp;A today. She\u2019d take care of that Pickard job in the early evening hours, but then she was going to a club, damn it. Not Progeny. She\u2019d go back to Surreal, because she wouldn\u2019t run into someone she knew, and she was already familiar with their layout. She\u2019d tell Cass she was driving up to Baton Rouge for an overnight to follow up on the Pickard work, which was plausible, because there were a couple things she could check out there after she handled the Dumpster job here.</p><p>Catching a movement in her peripheral vision, she noticed one of Ben\u2019s neighbors standing on the sidewalk, a trio of apricot toy poodles in her arms, too stunned to be yappy. The woman was staring at Marcie in a fascinated, horrified way. Marcie gave her a dignified nod. \u201cHe deserved it, I promise,\u201d she said.</p><p>The woman\u2019s lips twitched. Putting the poodles down, she continued on her morning walk with only a couple backward looks.</p><p>Max handed her his handkerchief. When Marcie glanced at him, puzzled, he touched a fingertip to her face, letting her feel the tears. \u201cOh shit,\u201d she muttered. She mopped her face with it, blew her nose with a ferocious snort that had his brows rising. \u201cPlease take me home, Max. I want to stop on the way for a brownie from Starbuck\u2019s. I\u2019ll treat you to a coffee and you can have this omelet. I think I\u2019d choke on it at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, a glint in his eyes. Then he held the door for her.</p> <p>Holy hell. He\u2019d hit the floor like Peter under enemy fire when those first stones came through. \u201cFuck,\u201d Ben snarled, under a shower of glass. Only two things kept him from shoving up from the floor to wear her ass out. One, he got hard as steel from the thought of punishing her, which undermined the whole getting-rid-of-her scenario. Two\u2014more importantly\u2014he deserved her anger. It was his fault for letting it go this far, and so he would take the cost. Which was apparently eight perfectly preserved panes of pre-Civil War glass. Fuck, fuck and triple fuck.</p><p>Once she was done with her diatribe and he heard the limo pull away, he fished out his cell. Staying on the floor, he put in a call to his maid and maintenance services for glass cleanup and window replacement, respectively. But every word she\u2019d shouted at him was echoing in his mind. He could imagine how she\u2019d looked yelling at him, those gorgeous brown eyes flashing, her hair a swirl around her face, breasts heaving and fists clenched. Damn it, he was getting stiff against the floorboards, thinking about how he\u2019d deal with her in such a temper.</p><p>I swear to God, I\u2019m going to have to cut off my own dick.</p><p>Ben rolled to his back. He didn\u2019t feel like getting up yet. He\u2019d heard her threat about the club, but he also heard the waver of uncertainty behind it. She was just working off a mad, even though he had no doubt she\u2019d end up there by herself at some point if he didn\u2019t give her some direction. She was that stubborn. He\u2019d make sure she had the numbers of those other Doms he\u2019d talked about. Once she calmed down, she\u2019d be smart enough to take them, even if her initial motive in doing so was to make him jealous. It wouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s what he told himself. They were nice, young, calm and sedate guys. Doms she\u2019d find so boring they\u2019d put her to sleep.</p><p>They were too lighthanded. Even when she was crying out from every blow, her ass kept rising up to the cane, the spatula, the flogger. Those strikes made her wet, made her beg for more. Christ.</p><p>He needed to get to Houston. If he was smart, he\u2019d stay there for a couple months. Or he\u2019d come back tonight, go to Progeny himself. No, too much risk of dealing with someone he knew. He might go to Surreal. Take a taxi from the airport, hang out there until closing, have one of the limos pick him up and bring him home. He\u2019d find a sub who\u2019d help him forget how he\u2019d fucked this up. He\u2019d call Lucas later, maybe, explain the situation, though he wasn\u2019t really sure how to do that. Maybe he\u2019d wait and see what Marcie was going to do. She might not tell them. She was mad, and her pride was probably hurt.</p><p>He wanted to ignore the niggling thought that it went deeper than that, but he wouldn\u2019t duck that responsibility. He\u2019d taken her too deep, let her get too close. It was better to wound her now, when it wasn\u2019t mortal.</p><p>He\u2019d take her anger. Her tears would destroy him.</p><p>Ben: Congratulations on the five thousand you raised to help the off campus domestic violence shelter. Cass said you\u2019ve been volunteering there. She also told me about that run-in with a husband ignoring a restraining order. She said you wouldn\u2019t let him come into the house, basically backed him down. You have a tendency to take things to extremes, brat. A guy won\u2019t stop to think about assault charges when he\u2019s got a red haze in front of his eyes. Btw, we\u2019re matching the funds you raised, and I\u2019ve already authorized having a security system and panic button installed at the shelter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marcie: My knight in shining armor (lol). You guys are so overprotective, but I know the shelter will really appreciate it. As far as the asshole (aka husband) I just had to prove to him I had bigger balls. I did JJ. Seriously, don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m no different from you guys. If I don\u2019t stick up for what\u2019s right, for what I know is truth, no matter what the world throws at me, then what kind of person am I?</p><p>Ben: Not a corpse. Just be careful, brat. Who will interrupt my day with her incessant letters, texts and emails if you\u2019re not around?</p><p>Marcie: That\u2019s true. I\u2019m not sure if most of the women you date are literate.</p><p>Email exchange between Ben and Marcie</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Marcie paused inside the foyer of Surreal, breathed deep. She\u2019d chosen to spend some of her K&amp;A intern salary on a car service to bring her here, because she\u2019d made a deliberate decision to down a couple shots of tequila from Lucas\u2019 liquor cabinet before she left the house. The effect was still coursing through her veins, making her feel wild and loose, but she wasn\u2019t drunk. Underneath the storm waves, she was all deep ocean, focused and intent.</p><p>She\u2019d gone through an extreme experience with a Dom less than twenty-four hours ago. She could handle any Master here. Tonight she\u2019d get some nice marks to overlay Ben\u2019s, sashay into the office Monday, flip up her skirt and show him before she flounced down to her \u201cplace\u201d in Research.</p><p>Of course, she\u2019d have to use a Sharpie and circle the marks that were from her visit to Surreal. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be able to distinguish them from his, or those that had resulted from today\u2019s Dumpster adventure. She\u2019d added a couple aspirin to the tequila to deal with that. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d let that security thug get the jump on her, but maybe she\u2019d been spoiling for a fight. He\u2019d gone the intimidation route, the usual tactic for big guys, and it had become ugly. Unfortunately, he also got the raw edge of her temper, so it was a fair trade. At least the mask covered her black eye. Nothing could cover swollen testicles, so he\u2019d probably taken the night off.</p><p>Yeah, she was a badass. A badass whose palms were sweaty. She ignored that, handed her credit card to the hostess, a gorgeous ebony-haired pixie in corset, tight skirt and boots. When she\u2019d come here masked to observe Ben, she\u2019d had a definite plan, a focus. To watch him, gather information. He\u2019d commanded her attention so decisively, nothing else had intruded on that path. No room for this open-ended anxiety, the what-if or what-trouble-am-I-going-to-get-into feeling.</p><p>The hostess nodded to the pirate chest full of rubber bracelets. The various colors denoted categories of play. She hesitated long enough that she had to move aside to let more decisive people pick up their choice. Then, feeling the hostess\u2019s curious glance, that sense that she was about to be asked if everything was all right, if she needed help, she firmed her chin and snatched up a silver one. It said she was a moderately experienced sub, that she was unattached and interested in invitations to play.</p><p>Of course, the fact she was here alone, and her outfit, made that patently clear. Her wet latex leggings looked poured on and rode low on her hips. They laced up the back, from crotch to just below the twin dimples of her pelvis, following the seam of her buttocks. She\u2019d laced them snug enough that nothing was graphically revealed, but as her cheeks twitched along in a sauntering walk, interested parties might strain their eyes to see if they could discern any details through that shadowed sliver of exposure.</p><p>She\u2019d left her tunic top in the Surreal locker room, so all she wore waist up was a shelf bra that pushed her up and almost out. The bra was the same bronze shimmering color as the leggings. The lace edges that barely covered her nipples were black, matching her five-inch stilettos.</p><p>Okay, she was tense, but it had nothing to do with the environment. The very first time she\u2019d gone to a club, she\u2019d expected to be nervous. Instead, watching the many different ways that Masters and subs fulfilled their mutual needs, soaking in the atmosphere through all senses, she\u2019d felt like she\u2019d come home. She\u2019d known this world innately, even before she stepped across a club threshold.</p><p>She\u2019d had a chance to let her guard down, immerse herself even more, when she\u2019d visited clubs in New York City with Lucas\u2019 friend Marcus. She recalled how Thomas, Marcus\u2019 spouse and devoted submissive, had stood at her side. He\u2019d slid an arm around her, letting her lean against his attractively half-naked form, since he wore only a pair of snug jeans and his wedding band, permanent proof of his bond with his Master. Looking down at her, he\u2019d given her his slow, sweet smile that told her he understood exactly how she felt. Marcus had kept her close to the both of them on that initial trip, because she\u2019d nearly floated off into a trance from voyeurism alone.</p><p>No, her tension was because of what lines she might cross tonight, and whether she could face herself in the mirror tomorrow. Everything about last night continued to haunt her, making her shiver at inappropriate moments.</p><p>She shoved that sentimental trash out of her head. This was her choice. If Ben refused what she offered, then she was going to see how she handled what else was out there. The copper-and-black eye mask bolstered her courage and hid the risk of tears. Okay, Marcie. Go out and get what you want. Or, if you can\u2019t have that, let\u2019s prove he isn\u2019t going to change who you are just because he can\u2019t pull his head out of his ass.</p><p>Taking one more deep breath, she stepped into the public play area. She was ready to be adventurous, to have a great orgasm and get her ass spanked. To hell with Ben O\u2019Callahan.</p><p>Then she saw him at the bar.</p><p>He was cozying up to a blonde with tits so big they were practically in his drink. His hand was on her hip, giving her an idle stroke that ran his fingertips over the curve of her ass.</p><p>It hurt so badly, for a moment she hated him. From the beginning, she\u2019d had to fight all the despicable voices of logic that said she was mistaken, that what she felt from him was imagined. That he truly wasn\u2019t interested in her, that she\u2019d been throwing herself at him. But he hadn\u2019t been humoring her last night. She\u2019d seen his eyes. Which made seeing this even worse.</p><p>She swayed on the five-inch heels. She couldn\u2019t do this. She really couldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t want what she was about to do here. Ben had always been caring, compassionate, funny. He was being something he wasn\u2019t, she knew that, but his dysfunction didn\u2019t give him the right to be such an asshole. She loved him, truly loved him, and seeing him touch another woman like that, making it obvious he\u2019d probably fuck her tonight, after all he\u2019d done to her last night...</p><p>She was strong, but this required superhero strength. She didn\u2019t have it in her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to make someone notice you.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened at the warm comment. Glancing up and back, she found herself flanked by a man with red hair to his shoulders and direct blue eyes. The calm confidence, even more than the black bracelet, said he was an experienced Dom. He looked in his late twenties.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking to play tonight?\u201d</p><p>She turned her back on Ben. \u201cYes. Yes I am.\u201d</p><p>He took in the jut of her chin, the flash of her eyes. \u201cI see. Have you played before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...but not like this. I was sort of...with a Dom, but now I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to hang with me a little bit, see what might pique your interest?\u201d</p><p>When she took a deep breath this time, there was a little shudder to it that translated into a twitch through her limbs, a quick jerk. Damn it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo apologies necessary.\u201d Giving her a reassuring smile, he took her fingers in a warm hand and rubbed them. \u201cRelax. It\u2019s a playground, and we\u2019re all children here, looking to have fun. Is it all right if I touch you a little bit, help you relax? You can tell me to stop at any time, or if I\u2019m doing too much.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then nodded. He slid his hand to her hip, his thumb coursing over the top of her buttock, a move remarkably like what Ben had just done to the blonde. His eyes darkened as her lips parted, moistened. \u201cYou wear the silver bracelet, but I\u2019m thinking you\u2019re still fairly new to it. You just didn\u2019t want to be treated too gently. You\u2019re on that beginning edge, wanting even more.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. But not with you, as nice as you seem to be.</p><p>\u201cI have another friend.\u201d When he gestured across the play area, she saw an older man watching them. Her mouth went dry as she registered he was leaning against an empty St. Andrew\u2019s Cross. \u201cWould you like to be restrained on that? Let us give your beautiful ass a workout? We can do it over your clothes. Want to try it, see how it feels?\u201d</p><p>She knew how it felt. She was glad the mask hid the stark pain she was feeling. \u201cSure,\u201d she managed. \u201cOver the clothes will work.\u201d Hell, his touch on her hip had resulted in a reaction. Maybe it was all \u201ctouch button A to get reaction B\u201d. Maybe that floating sensation that happened last night was purely chemical, and if they had the expertise to get her to that level she\u2019d get lost in her head, cut adrift. Then it wouldn\u2019t matter that the man she wanted the most wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with her.</p><p>\u201cYou can call me Master L. What should I call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you wish, Master L.\u201d She was just a faceless slave, here to be used. The thought tightened her stomach in a not entirely unpleasant coil.</p><p>She watched him kiss her knuckles. Was he the type Ben would put on his call list as the \u201cperfect Dom\u201d mentor? The thought curdled in her stomach like sour milk. But she followed him, comfortable in the span of his arm, one hand resting on her hip and the small of her back, the other holding her fingers as he escorted her. He smelled good, a nice aftershave. He was handsome but not overdone, wearing a simple pair of jeans and an untucked button-down. Cowboy boots with silver tips.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a hat?\u201d</p><p>Following her glance, he smiled, gave her a bit more of a Texas drawl. \u201cYes ma\u2019am. But I don\u2019t wear it indoors, or in the presence of ladies.\u201d When he reached his companion, introduced as Frank, she found he was in his forties, with silver threaded through his dark hair. His eyes assessed her even more thoroughly, and he was more reserved, giving her only a courteous nod. It made her stomach flip inside that coil, gooseflesh rising on her arms as she recognized him as something closer to what her submissive nature craved. She had to steel herself not to drop her eyes in his presence. That wasn\u2019t required at this level, and he wasn\u2019t her Master. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Neither was Ben, was he?</p><p>They went over her safe word, what the boundaries would be. She explained the visible bruising on her upper body, saying she worked in a job that sometimes required full contact but that there was no injury. When they were satisfied they knew enough about her to keep her safe\u2014she gave vague but accurate information about anything beneath the clothes\u2014they lifted each of her hands, cuffed them to the cross, positioning her face forward against it.</p><p>The moment they started restraining her, that deep lower belly trembling started. But there was a wrong feeling to it. She put her forehead down on the wood crosspiece. She would do this. She could. She responded to Master L\u2019s questions. No, cuffs not too tight. Nowhere near as tight as what was around her heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to start with just my hand, and work up to some other things, all right? Frank will take over as things escalate.\u201d</p><p>Frank stepped up behind her to test the bonds, pressing himself against her body. As he withdrew, he tangled his hands in her hair, gave her a sharp tug that elicited a gasp, a spiral of shameful pleasure at the rough treatment. When it turned into a desperate whimper, Master L stroked her back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. We can stop at any time. You obviously want this. Don\u2019t fight yourself. We\u2019ll get you where you want to be.\u201d He leaned in, touching her chin, and she stared into his knowing eyes. \u201cWe can take you to a place where you won\u2019t even know he\u2019s in the room. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can make me believe he\u2019s not even on the planet, that would be better.\u201d</p><p>His lips firmed, and he nodded, glancing over at Frank. \u201cShe wants it rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the way we like it.\u201d</p><p>She wished they\u2019d bind her forehead to that crosspiece so she wasn\u2019t tempted to see what Ben was doing at the bar. It was still in her line of sight if she turned her head far enough.</p><p>Master L\u2019s hand landed on her buttock, a first slap, a test, an attention getter. It awoke the blows of last night, but not in an unpleasant way. It was a reminder of Ben\u2019s marks on her, which got her wet, no matter how much she despised him at the moment. Master L rubbed firm circles over her ass, took a healthy squeeze, tugged on the lacings of the leggings. His fingertips slipped into the spaces between the eye holes to do a brief caress of the seam of her buttocks before they moved on. Then another smack.</p><p>He was accomplished, alternating hard with soft, with those kneading caresses, so that she was shifting on the cross, that fluttery feeling in her belly settling into something pleasant. Frank ramped it up, doing a series of hard blows that made her arch into the sting. Then Master L returned. The unpredictability, the frequency and multiple sensations, were enough to get her aroused, get her body reacting without thought. So it was that, after one particularly stimulating series of blows, she turned her cheek to the crosspiece, seeking movement as an outlet for what was building inside her.</p><p>She was staring right at the bar. Realizing it, she started to turn her face away, no desire to torture herself, but Ben\u2019s glance slid her way. Passed over, then came back like a laser pointer.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised he recognized her. That was part of what broke her heart about him, wasn\u2019t it? He knew her anywhere, the same way she knew him. But he was with that blonde, she\u2019d come to this club for her own reasons, and she\u2019d kicked the ass of a guy nearly twice her size today. Lifting her chin, she gave him a cool look, and then turned her face into Frank\u2019s hand as it cupped her face. She even let her lips drag across his palm. He smelled good too. Like powdery sawdust. He must like to do woodwork. It was nice, reassuring.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s warmed up. She\u2019s getting looser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Master L had donned a vampire glove, and she flinched and shuddered, wriggling as he let the sharp edges scratch down her back, her upper arms. Frank lifted her hair and held it in a tight tail as Master L took the glove straight down her spine, over the bra strap and to the waist. They knew what they were doing, because the instinctive masochist was rising to the top, wanting more, even if it wasn\u2019t coming from the source she wanted.</p><p>You want me to prove I can be a shameless slut for anyone, Ben? You got it, baby.</p><p>A breath slid past her gritted teeth as Frank slapped her other buttock, making it wobble so hard she felt it in her pussy. She met Ben\u2019s gaze deliberately this time. His green eyes were ice, his jaw satisfyingly rigid. Good. Let him be mad. Wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do to stop her. He\u2019d relinquished any claim he might have, had tossed any leash she offered back at her feet.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It surprised her, the sudden ripple in her pussy as Master L reached around her, raked the glove across her belly, his breath on the back of her shoulder. She didn\u2019t know if it was a reaction to her defiance of Ben while two Masters had their way with her, or Master L\u2019s skill, but she was amping up her response. That was all that mattered. Another series of spankings from Master L, hitting her with consummate skill, a lighter stroke, harder, then one powerful clap that sent everything wobbling. Frank stepped back in with a cane. It slapped against the latex, awakening the blows of last night. The sting went right up through her core and to her nipples.</p><p>She was just a thing, a mindless slave who liked this, who liked the pleasure of serving Doms. So what if Ben didn\u2019t want her? She could do and be this, right? To hell with him, and with her hollow heart. It was like eating candy and knowing it was going to make you sick, knowing it didn\u2019t taste as good as you\u2019d hoped. It was still eating candy, and who passed up the chance to do that? Tomorrow could be the Titanic, right?</p><p>She pressed her face against her upper arm, but Frank caught her hair, pulled her head back. \u201cEyes forward,\u201d he ordered. \u201cKeep your head up, body still.\u201d</p><p>Holding poses increased the potency of psychological restraint. As her fingers curled in the cuffs, she was vaguely aware they were attracting an audience. A single drop of perspiration went from her throat down her sternum, and she thought of Ben\u2019s fingers trailing along that path the previous night.</p> <p>\u201cMore,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Master L\u2019s hand was on her shoulder. She turned her face into his knuckles, held her face there, hard.</p><p>\u201cPlease, more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want it harder?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd please...you can take off the clothes if you want. If it pleases you. Just leave the mask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur pleasure.\u201d He unhooked the bra and the straps, his fingers sliding along that now bare track, and Frank removed the cups, caressing the soft underside of her breasts. Since her throat was aching, she closed her eyes. When they loosened the lacings enough, they pushed the leggings off her ass and down to her stilettos. Though they left the garment gathered at her ankles, she was now pretty much naked. Once again, just a thing. A slave.</p><p>She must have said it, for Master L spoke. \u201cYeah, you are. A beautiful slave. One any Master would want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the proper discipline.\u201d That came from Frank, sending a thrill through her vitals. She was losing herself here, and that was okay. She could do that. It didn\u2019t matter that it all felt out of control, that she was afraid, that she had no idea where to go from here.</p><p>\u201cShe was worked over pretty good recently.\u201d That from Master L. His fingers trailed the bruises along her thighs, the welts underneath what they were doing. Ben\u2019s marks.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough,\u201d she said. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d Frank said. The cane struck her bare buttocks and she cried out, bucking against the cross. More, more, more.</p><p>But then there was a pause. No one touched her as they had between all the other blows. She didn\u2019t know why until she heard his voice.</p><p>\u201cFrank, Master L, a word?\u201d</p><p>Ben. Before she could turn her head, another male was gripping her hair, pushing her forehead against the crosspiece, telling her not to move. She knew that hand, knew firsthand how tight he could hold her. Even as something feral inside her wanted to struggle against it, bite and take a few of his fingers off, her arousal intensified threefold. Her pussy contracted, a short expulsion of cream. Damn traitorous body.</p><p>\u201cMaster L, this is my slave. She disobeyed me by seeking another Master tonight. My apologies for depriving you of the pleasure, but she needs discipline at my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem, gentlemen? Ben?\u201d</p><p>Another voice, one she was sure belonged to the assigned dungeon master. Despite his obvious familiarity with Ben, an interruption to a session in progress was bound to catch his attention. In a moment, he\u2019d ask her what she wanted, who she wanted. Whatever her decision, the DM would make a judgment as to what was best. If anything seemed hinky, he\u2019d end the scene, period.</p><p>Ben explained the situation to him as he explained it to Master L and Frank, no more, no less, which of course left a lot unexplained. If he claimed she was bratting to get his attention, she swore she\u2019d take his cock off with the nearest sharp object she could find. She hadn\u2019t come here looking for him, no matter that her body cried out for him the moment he\u2019d released her hair, stepped back.</p><p>Even without his grip, she was all too aware she kept staring forward, just as he\u2019d commanded with that physical cue. Now the DM was at her side. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cyou\u2019re safe here. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>She could tell Master L that Ben was lying. The DM would make Ben back off. Frank and Master L would continue to work their magic and she could get lost in the physical pleasure of the orgasm they\u2019d undoubtedly give her. That would be that.</p><p>Her scalp was tingling from his touch, and the ache that they\u2019d started from mere physical touch was now an agony of emotional need. She stared at the polished crosspiece. \u201cMaster L...Frank, sir, thank you both. But my Master is correct. I apologize for taking him away from Miss Big Tits at the bar to address my insubordination.\u201d</p><p>The DM had to work to disguise the half-snort, half-chuckle, but it puffed along her cheek. His tone remained serious, however. \u201cAll right, ma\u2019am.\u201d He turned his attention to Ben. \u201cInvolving two other Doms without informing them that they\u2019re walking into an ongoing session with your sub is bad etiquette, and can be dangerous. I trust it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t. My apologies to you gentlemen as well,\u201d Ben said, nothing given away in his voice. Marcie curled her fingers in the cuffs. He was taking the blame, the quickest way to get rid of them. What the hell did he want from her? She was torn between confusion and anger.</p><p>As the DM returned to his post, she heard Master L and Frank gathering their tools. \u201cA good slave,\u201d Master L said dryly, probably from her double-edged apology. \u201cThanks for the pleasure of her, Ben. You\u2019re fortunate, despite her willfulness. If you need assistance with her punishment, I\u2019d be happy to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. But for now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off.\u201d There was a grin in Frank\u2019s tone. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>The two men moved away, leaving a blanket of silence around them. She wasn\u2019t sure what look Ben had cast around them, but she had the sense that the casual voyeurs had given them a little more distance. Sounds of whipping punctuated the air nearby, followed by cries of pleasure. An undercurrent of sultry music had been playing throughout, but now it all seemed muted against the roaring white noise in her head, the red haze over her vision. When Ben curled his hand in her hair once again, Marcie clenched her teeth. \u201cIf you untie me, try to make me go home, I\u2019ll go right back to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of untying you.\u201d His body pressed up against her as she drew in a breath at the size of the erection pressed against her sore bare buttocks. The deadly calm of his voice made a cold knot in her belly. \u201cYou\u2019re such a good little researcher, Marcella. Tell me what consensual non-consent is.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s when the slave or sub...when her safe word is only for a medical emergency. Within the boundaries they\u2019ve set, the Dom can do anything he wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you willing to give me CNC?\u201d</p><p>She was angry with him, frustrated beyond belief, confused. He\u2019d had CNC with her from the very beginning. When he exercised his Mastery over her, the moment he touched her, she trusted him down to the level of her soul. It was one of the many reasons she knew what she knew. Could she set aside the hurt, the pain, to embrace that right now? Or would she tell him to fuck off and let her go?</p><p>She knew the answer to that. She closed her eyes. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBoundaries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know them. What happened to the blonde you were going to fuck?\u201d</p><p>In answer, he stepped away from her. A cane hit her upper thighs with the fast whipping air noise that made it even worse. She shrieked, not expecting the strike. Pressing her forehead back against the wood, she set her teeth, managing the pain that sang through her nerve endings.</p><p>\u201cYour safe word is simple. Red. Like your ass is going to be. If you use it, I\u2019ll make the decision, based on your condition, whether you have a medical emergency.\u201d</p><p>He passed his hand over her buttocks, used it to slap her ass several times, warming it up anew. Whereas Master L and Frank had been cautious, he knew just how hard to hit to wake up everything he\u2019d done to her last night. Then he picked up a switch. He wasn\u2019t playing or going for half measures. He was aiming for pain and punishment, pure and simple. If he thought he could beat her into submission, he was sadly mistaken. As he alternated its use with the spanking and the cane, she started to feel the burn, started to crave toward and writhe away from the blows at once. Honey from her pussy was running down her legs even as she shrieked at the pain.</p><p>Merciless, he bound her waist to keep her still, and as the volume of her cries rose, he strapped a rubber ball gag in her mouth to muffle the cries. She could still manage Red if needed, no matter how garbled, but if she went into full out screaming, as she had a feeling was going to happen, the gag would keep her from overwhelming the room.</p><p>The voyeurs were back. She could see them in the corners of her eyes. The K&amp;A men mostly didn\u2019t do public performances, but in the past couple years, she knew Ben had done it more often. It was more impersonal, after all. Right?</p><p>The pain of that thought was replaced with another kind of pain. He brought down what felt like a thin, hardened strip of rawhide to crisscross the existing marks, rapid, light blows that raked across the nerve endings without real damage but which delivered intense pain. She was moving and wiggling her ass, trying to get away from the agony. She was screaming \u201cno, no, no...stop, please\u201d because it really hurt. After last night, then this morning, oh God, it was too much.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t use that safe word. She went in and out of pain, struggling for that zone, but it was too much. She was crying, even as her body was stoked for a release, nipples hard, pussy wet. When he put his hand in her hair, yanking her head back, she looked up into the face of the devil himself. He hadn\u2019t put a cloth with the ball gag, so she knew her saliva was running over her chin, her makeup smeared from tears, her nose running. Completely exposed to him, raw and vulnerable. \u201cFive more minutes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cYou can do five more minutes.\u201d He dropped his hand to her cunt, rubbed through her slickness. \u201cWet and fuckable. Say it. You can do five more minutes.\u201d</p><p>She stared into his eyes. \u201cYes. I can.\u201d With the gag, the words were garbled, but clear enough for him.</p> <p>It was the longest five minutes she\u2019d ever experienced, and when it was over, she was gasping, hanging in her bindings. She let out a hoarse scream as he spanked her ass cheeks with both hands, hard, sending all the painful sensation reverberating through her. Then he pressed up behind her, clasping her buttocks in a bruising grip. Putting his mouth to her neck, he bit hard enough to draw blood. She wished there was a lower crosspiece to rub herself against, because her clit was throbbing.</p><p>He\u2019d reacted the way he would if she belonged to him and had defied him, actively seeking punishment to reinforce the boundaries between them. There was something about that which was important, though she couldn\u2019t wrap her mind around it right this second, fighting the storm inside her.</p><p>Now he was pulling her pants back on. He left the laces loose, and she cried out as he found her secret, sliding into the lubricated channel. She worked herself against his hand shamelessly, wishing he\u2019d touch her pussy. But of course he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou came here to be fucked tonight.\u201d</p><p>She twisted her head around enough to give him a glassy half-glare, despite the tears. \u201cYeah,\u201d she rasped. \u201cYou got everything revved up, and if you weren\u2019t man enough to take care of the itch, I was going where it could be scratched. That\u2019s what a slut does, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you fuck the blonde at the bar, are you hoping she\u2019ll help you forget last night?\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened. He moved his hand around to rub her clit through the thin latex. She ground herself against his erection, trying to drive him as crazy as he was driving her. He was flexing against her ass, as if he was fucking her. Then he captured her breast, tugging on her nipple.</p><p>\u201cGod...\u201d She was gasping as he worked her up higher. Her ass and thighs were throbbing, yet the wash of heat that came after that level of punishment made her want more, which was crazy because it had hurt like hell. Her mind was coming apart.</p><p>\u201cBen... Master...\u201d</p><p>He stopped, pressing his forehead hard against her hair, his fingers spasming around her breast. \u201cNo,\u201d he said in a growl. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She set her teeth. \u201cMaster.\u201d Don\u2019t pull away.</p><p>He stepped back, hands leaving her. Retrieving her bra, he hooked it around her, positioned the cups and secured the straps. He tightened up the lacings on the pants with one jerk that drove the breath from her. Then he freed her wrists and ankles. Coiling his arm around her waist, he brought her back to the floor on the wobbling stilettos. He gripped her other hand, holding her fast as he led her out of the public play area.</p><p>When she saw they were headed toward the exit, she balked, but he simply hitched her up on his hip and kept going until she put her feet back down and let him walk her. \u201cI\u2019m not done tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going unless you are.\u201d</p><p>He suppressed a hard sigh. Yeah, he was probably like Mount Vesuvius about to blow, but she was already at the eruption point. She wasn\u2019t going to be shut down. Before she could say anything further, she was yanked through the door, and they were out on the sidewalk on the west side of the building. He was crossing the street, taking her toward a K&amp;A limo.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...not...going.\u201d She planted her feet this time, yanked hard, and got away from him, though she almost tripped herself doing so. She kicked the shoes away, faced him on the balls of her feet.</p><p>When he turned toward her, she didn\u2019t give herself time to register his expression or anything else. She led with her emotions, did something she knew was wrong, on so many levels. She punched him dead in the mouth with all the strength she had.</p><p>Ben was pissed, torn up in twelve different ways. The guy he\u2019d been a lifetime ago knew only one way to respond to a physical attack. Catching her arm and her hair, he twisted her around, slammed her against the side of the limo. He pulled his strength back at the last moment, he wasn\u2019t that crazed, but it wasn\u2019t that which could harm her. It was what was raging out of control in him, what had goaded him to get her out of there and into a limo, out of his sight. Now.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t restrained himself as much as he\u2019d thought. She stumbled, hit her face on the metal corner of the rear window, letting out a surprised yelp of pain. When she managed to turn toward him, trying to regain her feet, he saw the bloom of blood. Worse, he saw her recognize the boiling, deadly rage pouring out of him. Every animal knew when they\u2019d pushed a predator too far. The heart would leap into the throat, and the feet would automatically try to get into motion, to run, even as the mind\u2019s fear would slow them down, just as the predator got faster, calmer, colder.</p><p>Her eyes widened, but she didn\u2019t run. She wasn\u2019t that smart. She was trying to take another aggressive, fuck-you stance, and say something that would be entirely unwise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He spun her back toward the limo before she could do it, startling another surprised cry out of her. \u201cThis is done,\u201d he said against her ear, pushing himself hard against her body, trapping her against the car. He could hear that pulse rabbiting beneath his grip. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends, we\u2019re not lovers. You don\u2019t know a fucking thing about me. You don\u2019t have what I need, you\u2019ll never have it. All your fucking useless dreams about me are just bullshit little-girl fantasies. That\u2019s it. We\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>He was hot and hard, a rutting monster fueled by watching Frank study her, Master L\u2019s hands touching her skin, their eyes calculating how she would surrender to them.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me,\u201d she said. Her voice was a shaky whisper that would have wrung mercy out of a stone. He felt nothing. He knew how to be mean, so mean that nothing in the world would fuck with him. When she tried to break free, he twisted her arm higher behind her back. Sliding his other hand around, he squeezed her breasts with no finesse, pure brutal possession, intending for it to be uncomfortable, to take only his pleasure and give her none. She struggled, but that just increased the pain to her arm, a deterrent. A sob caught in her throat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the prince in your Beauty and the Beast fairy tale.\u201d He wanted to die right now, because this was all wrong, but it had to be done. He had to do it. \u201cYou\u2019re going home, and this is over. You take that job in Milan, and you don\u2019t look back.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he knew he wasn\u2019t alone. Max stood to his left, just behind him. Tossing dark hair out of his eyes, Ben cocked his head. He gave Max a dangerous fuck-off look, but Max met it head on, his eyes cool. In control in a way Ben wasn\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s time to let her go, Mr. O\u2019Callahan,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019re right about that.\u201d Ben released her, stepped back. He didn\u2019t watch her sag against the limo. He pivoted, was walking away when Max caught her. She would push away from Max immediately, would try to stand on her own. He knew that about her. It would have made him smile if a rusty knife wasn\u2019t cutting into his chest. He didn\u2019t see the tears or the broken look on her face, but he didn\u2019t need to do so. It was branded on his fucking black heart. He hadn\u2019t needed to remove her mask to see every terrible emotion go through those beautiful brown eyes.</p><p>You can take shit off the street, dress it up, but it\u2019s still shit. It stains everything eventually.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look back, his feet pointed toward the darkest hole of night.</p> <p>Max didn\u2019t try to touch her again, but he did stay close. \u201cMiss Marcie? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Marcie stared at the shadowed edge of the parking lot where Ben had disappeared. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a funny thing to say?\u201d she said, her voice high and strange. \u201cWhen everything is obviously not all right.\u201d</p><p>Max took a cautious step closer. Her legs were shaking hard. She had that lovely ass of hers pressed against the car door for support, but her wrist was red where Ben had gripped her, and she\u2019d apparently hit her lip when he slammed her against the car. Jesus Christ, what was going on here? None of the guys had ever treated a woman like this. They\u2019d kill any man who did. Yeah, Ben was into handing out the pain, but to women who craved it for the right reasons. Definitely not in this context.</p><p>\u201cI guess people say that because the alternative is saying nothing,\u201d he ventured. \u201cBeing silent when it feels like something needs to be said.\u201d</p><p>Marcie\u2019s gaze shifted to him then, her eyes brimming. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said brokenly. \u201cBut sometimes there\u2019s nothing to say, Max.\u201d She took a deep breath that seemed to cost her dearly. \u201cI need you to do me a really big favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Her expression flickered. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. I have to tell Mr. Kensington about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an adult. It\u2019s my decision to share or not share.\u201d Her voice quivered again. \u201cI swear to God, if you say I\u2019m not an adult, I\u2019m going to find a blunt object and beat you to death with it.\u201d</p><p>Despite his best effort, his lips almost twitched. Jesus, she had spirit. Her eyes were actually flashing, even as she swiped at her tears with an impatient hand. \u201cNo ma\u2019am. You\u2019re as adult as they get. Hey, no. You stay here.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been about to push away from the car door, and from the direction of her look, he knew she was going to retrieve her shoes. Stilling her with a gentle hand and a firm look, he strode over to them. Picking them up, he marveled as he always did that women could walk in those things, but he bet Marcie had worked them to the nth degree.</p><p>She had a made-for-sex body, but one with a lot of strength to it. He\u2019d seen that punch, was surprised Ben hadn\u2019t spurted blood. She\u2019d had the balance, aim and force that said she knew what she was doing. Which meant she shouldn\u2019t have done it, but it was obvious there was a lot of emotional shit happening on both sides. Besides which, Max knew Ben was a way more lethal fighter than Marcie, even if she had ten black belts.</p><p>Since Ben had shown that side of himself in a way he shouldn\u2019t have either, it made Marcie\u2019s response now even more impressive. Max knew men who would have crapped themselves from that deadly backwash that Ben had dished out. They wouldn\u2019t be standing on their own bare feet, trying to hold it together and talk their driver into all sorts of foolishness.</p><p>He set his jaw, reminding himself of the dangerous influence of tears and a determined woman. As he came back toward the limo, he could see her gearing up for another try. But Max had his own code. \u201cNo,\u201d he repeated, before she could say anything. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am. Matt needs to know about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And you\u2019re one of theirs.\u201d He nodded into the night, after Ben. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing they take more serious than your well-being. He knows that.\u201d Which opened a whole other set of interesting questions.</p><p>\u201cCan you at least give me twenty-four hours before you tell Matt?\u201d</p><p>He suppressed a curse at that look, part plea, part demand. Jesus, what the hell was the matter with Ben? He was half tempted to go kick his ass himself. Except Max knew Ben. When she\u2019d landed that punch, something had welled up in the guy, something Max had sensed before from him, but had never seen unleashed like that. He had comrades with PTSD, when the dark shit came up and took over, spilled out like pus running from an old wound. What he\u2019d just seen had felt a lot like that.</p><p>Unless he was gravely mistaken about Ben\u2019s character, Max had a feeling that when the man\u2019s head got back on straight and he thought about what he\u2019d just done to her... Hell, he was probably going to figure out a way to kick his own ass, even before Matt Kensington could do it. Which was coming, Max was pretty sure of that. Unfortunately, Ben had probably intended that with this stunt tonight. It was as if he was burning his bridges deliberately. Fucking bastard was all over the map. This wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. No promises. Let me get you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She seemed to accept that was the best she was going to get. \u201cLet me go in and clean up my face first. I\u2019m not going back to my sister\u2019s looking like this.\u201d She unlaced the mask, scratching her snarled hair. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking hell. Did he do that?\u201d When she raised a surprised face to him, showing the black eye even more clearly, Max was ready to discard any sympathy for Ben and lead the lynch mob himself.</p><p>Her brow furrowed, then cleared. \u201cOh no. That was work. An investigative case I was doing for Pickard. Security guy got the jump on me in an alley over at Pfeiffer. I was going through their Dumpster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Jesus, girl. You\u2019re a magnet for trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagnet for everything but Ben, apparently.\u201d She stared off into the night again, and Max touched her arm.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said gently. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax, I have to go back in. Ben didn\u2019t let me get my clothes and purse out of the locker room. Asshole.\u201d</p><p>Max pressed his lips hard against a smile, though it was balanced with something far more grim, looking at her strained face. No way she was going back into Surreal. Not in this kind of mood. \u201cI\u2019ll go get them. Tell me the number and the code you used.\u201d</p><p>When she gave him an obstinate look, he chose a different tack. \u201cDo you really want to go back in there?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me go get your stuff. You can clean up in the limo. You\u2019ll find mirror, wet towels, all that girl stuff in the storage compartments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re always prepared, aren\u2019t they?\u201d She gave a bitter chuckle.</p><p>Not always, Max thought. When she slid into the limo, she gracefully accepted his steadying touch so she managed it without her knees buckling, but then she leveled a glare on him.</p><p>\u201cIf you engage the child locks while you\u2019re gone, I\u2019ll hotwire the limo and leave you here.\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed. \u201cDeal. Just promise me you\u2019ll lock the doors until I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, because stealing a stretch limo is so inconspicuous.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the limo that concerned him. The passenger was the real treasure. Shutting the door, he pointedly waited until she used the sharp painted nail of one forefinger and jabbed the door locks, engaging them. The exaggerated gesture, the fact she crossed her eyes at him, almost made him smile. The same way the streaked tracks of her tears squeezed his heart in a vise. She was a piece of work.</p><p>He was pretty sure Ben was out there watching, probably within hearing distance. He\u2019d wait until he was sure Max was taking her safely home, Max knew it. None of this made sense. He didn\u2019t want to make Marcie unhappier, but he knew his responsibility. To her, to Matt Kensington...and to Ben.</p><p>Marcie held it together. She could deal with this. She\u2019d get a good bath, a good night\u2019s sleep, then figure out what to do next. But when Max turned into the driveway, a variety of emotions rose up, nearly choking her. She\u2019d forgotten what night it was. While Cass and the other K&amp;A women had that monthly afternoon tea, they also had the occasional girls\u2019 night as well, which involved cocktails and lots of laughter. Unlike the tea parties, Marcie had never been home for one of those, because Cass made sure all the kids were at sleepovers or other activities on the night in question, probably so discussions could be far more adult. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was another limo in the drive, and she saw Wade give Max a companionable wave. He was Savannah\u2019s regular driver, and Dana had probably carpooled with her, freeing Max up for the evening to chauffeur Ben.</p><p>She felt that surge of resentment again, pushed it away. Marcie had called her car service on the way back, letting them know she\u2019d found another ride. It would save her some money, the only consolation so far for this terrible night.</p><p>\u201cYou going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>She looked at Max, who\u2019d come around to open the door for her. She\u2019d washed her face, combed her hair, dabbed some makeup on the black eye, though Cass already knew about that. She was fine. As fine as porcelain. Giving him a nod, she took his hand to get out. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I changed your schedule this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by much. All I was doing was waiting on Ben, picking up some extra cash with the overtime. He was planning on watching tonight, not playing. He\u2019d only been inside an hour when he came out with you, so I assume he never got past his first drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Of course. She should have figured that one out herself. You couldn\u2019t actively play and drink at Surreal. It was a club rule and why she\u2019d had the tequila before she came. It didn\u2019t matter. Ben could have taken the blonde outside the club to fuck her in the limo. Probably would have.</p><p>Max was a family friend, and normally she\u2019d give him a hug, but at the moment he was too male, too virile, and her clothes were too scanty, even though she\u2019d donned the thin tunic top. Before then, he\u2019d made a superhuman effort not to be caught staring at her overflowing breasts. She didn\u2019t really mind that, but if those strong male arms surrounded her in a hug, she was either going to cry all over his shirt or take a swing at him.</p><p>She opted for a cordial nod. She was going to make it all the way to her bedroom with quiet dignity.</p><p>When she slipped in the door, she stood in the darkened foyer, staring down the hallway toward the light of the kitchen and sitting room areas. She listened to the women\u2019s laughter, women who were submissives of varying degrees to strong Masters. Masters who were bonded to Ben in an exceptional pack relationship that included these women. But not her.</p><p>She needed to go upstairs, go to her room, take a hot shower. At least get out of these clothes, which now felt cheap, tawdry, ridiculous. No, they weren\u2019t. She wouldn\u2019t let him make her feel like that. The outfit was damn sexy, intended to get the big-ass cock of one stubborn, asshole lawyer rock-hard. It had done that, or her behavior had done that, because what he\u2019d pressed against her had definitely qualified as a raging hard-on.</p><p>She leaned against the wall, taking a breath. Go upstairs. Go upstairs.</p><p>Instead, she found herself moving past the staircase. They were in the sunroom, and she could hear their warm voices, drawing her to them.</p><p>It had been surprising to see Savannah here, but her bed rest was taking it easy around the house, not actual confinement to a mattress. She\u2019d probably wanted to get out for a little while and insisted on the event not being relocated to her home.</p><p>All of the women were with strong Doms, but part of that was because they were such strong personalities themselves. She could just imagine the sparks flying between the two CEOs, but Savannah was here. With a limo driver to ensure her safety. Matt had likely already called him three times. Rachel having a medical background probably helped ease his mind some, and no doubt Savannah had used that fact for leverage.</p><p>\u201cLook at this catalog. A twenty-four-carat diamond bracelet for a baby? Are they out of their minds?\u201d Savannah\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cThe scary thing is I\u2019m sure some idiot buys them,\u201d Dana responded.</p><p>\u201cYes, so your baby can be mugged in her stroller. For the love of God, let\u2019s stop looking at catalogs. I\u2019m already addicted to the shopping networks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound cranky. I think you need to play a relaxing game of Twister. Rachel can post the video feed on Facebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me her cane so I can beat her with it.\u201d</p><p>Cass\u2019 chuckle was dry. \u201cYou know that\u2019s just foreplay to Dana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I beat her to death.\u201d</p><p>How many years had she dreamed of being part of that inner circle? Laughing, listening, knowing she was part of something incredibly special. Knowing she was meant to be part of it.</p> <p>Maybe in the end, she was just a dumb fucking kid who had no clue. Maybe Ben O\u2019Callahan didn\u2019t want her, and she\u2019d made it all up in her head. The crush of a lonely teenager abandoned by her parents had evolved into the dysfunctional clich\u00e9 of a delusional grown woman. That burning drive, the absolute certainty that she was meant to be with him, it had all been a dream. A little girl\u2019s bullshit fantasy. The reason she refused to face the truth was it knocked the bottom out of her world, destroyed everything she thought she was, because so much of it had to do with her feelings for him.</p><p>The seeds of doubt she refused to let grow, but which had lurked in her subconscious from the first moment she\u2019d believed she was meant to belong to Ben, now grew into a monster beanstalk that covered everything else. If it was truth, if she had to face it once and for all, she needed her big sister, the only real mother she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>She paused in the doorway. She needed to turn around, retreat, because there was no way she could do this and not completely embarrass herself. The women were curled up in a variety of positions on the wicker furniture. Dana had her head on Rachel\u2019s shoulder, grinning at something Cass was saying with expressive hands and a half-full glass of red wine. Savannah was on her side on the lounger, a pillow propped between her knees to support her belly as she listened. She was always the perfect ice princess, even in that position, her blonde hair in a smooth tail over her silk-clad shoulder, but her expression was relaxed in a way usually only seen in this company.</p><p>Early on, Marcie had figured out what piece of jewelry served as a \u201ccollar\u201d to each woman, primarily because they always wore it to the tea parties, and each woman wore it for any gathering where work demands or other fashion etiquette didn\u2019t make it inappropriate.</p><p>Savannah wore the delicate silver choker with rose quartz Matt had given her on their first anniversary. Cass had a pair of beaten silver cuff bracelets, etched with Japanese characters. She\u2019d worn them at her marriage ceremony. Dana and Rachel\u2019s collars could be mistaken for nothing else. Dana\u2019s was a wide strap with a waterfall of decorative chains to soften it. The St. Christopher\u2019s medallion that belonged to Peter was on the D-ring. Though it was her main collar, she sometimes alternated it with the more subtle jasper necklace with Peter\u2019s dog tags that served the same purpose. Rachel\u2019s reflected Jon\u2019s exceptional design skills, made of sterling silver wire, bound at intervals by vertical supports made of gold, and embellished with a wire-wrapped sapphire pendant.</p><p>That, as well as the whole scenario, told Marcie the harsh truth. She didn\u2019t belong here. Marcie took a step backward, but Rachel was the one facing the doorway. Her gaze lifted at the movement, and apparently she got a good look at her face.</p><p>\u201cCass,\u201d she said, her serious tone bringing the conversation to a halt.</p><p>Cass twisted around. In the very next moment, she was up and moving. Marcie stood frozen, watching her come forward. Suddenly she was a little girl again, she couldn\u2019t help it. Cass had always been there for her, the sister who\u2019d become mother to them all, the one they all leaned upon when things became unbearable. Knowing that, seeing those keen blue eyes, the concerned set of her mouth, she couldn\u2019t hold it together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said brokenly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t...I needed you. All of you.\u201d</p><p>I had an odd dream the other night. It was dark, I was running from something, but I ran smack into it. I screamed, but then it was gone and you were there, blocking the darkness. That wasn\u2019t the weird thing about it, though\u2014you know it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve dreamed about you when I get anxious about things. What was odd was that, this time, as I watched you stare out at that darkness, making sure it didn\u2019t come closer to me, I thought: When he dreams of darkness, who saves him?</p><p>Letter from Marcie, first few weeks of college</p><p>I always want to be there for you, brat, but in your dreams, don\u2019t you ever run. You stop and face that darkness, tell it to fuck off. Never let it drive you away from what you want. Once you show fear to something, it owns you. And yes, that\u2019s also the answer to your question. Someone can save you from darkness once or twice, but only you can kick its ass and send it running.</p><p>Ben\u2019s response</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>The sobs burst out of her, everything she\u2019d been trying to manage since it all started, all the pretense and bravado swept away on a violent tide. Her knees buckled, but Rachel was already there, helping Cass catch her. They let her fold down to the floor, Rachel stroking her hair as Cass closed Marcie in her arms, practically holding her in her lap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. He doesn\u2019t want me...he hates me... I made him hate me.\u201d</p><p>Cass\u2019 hand whispered over her abraded wrist, then her gentle touch lifted her face, her thumb touching Marcie\u2019s mouth. Something fierce and dangerous went through her sister\u2019s expression. \u201cDid he do this to your lip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Marcie shook her head hastily. \u201cI hit it on the car when he shoved me against it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s loads better.\u201d That tight comment came from Dana as she now crouched on the floor with Cass.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll worry about that in a moment,\u201d Rachel said quietly. \u201cLet\u2019s get her to the other lounger, take a look at her. She\u2019s not moving well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, let her take this one. It\u2019s longer, and I\u2019ve warmed it up.\u201d Savannah had made it to her feet, and was gesturing them to the six-foot-long couch.</p><p>Marcie tried to protest, but they were moving her over there. She was hobbling a bit. The level of pain from the CNC session had worked her over pretty good, and then she\u2019d tightened up further during her argument with Ben. On top of that her knuckles hurt from hitting him. She\u2019d used that same fist earlier in the day, and the security thug had a rib cage like a steel vault. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they had her sitting, Rachel\u2019s fingers moved over her, but Marcie shook her head, uncomfortable with the fussing. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s okay. He knew what he was doing, at least with the switch and the cane and...\u201d She gave a hiccup, a near-hysterical snort. \u201cThat\u2019d sound weird in the wrong crowd, wouldn\u2019t it? I...it felt good and bad at once, you know. I\u2019m okay. Just...tough session.\u201d</p><p>Which she honestly might have loved if it wasn\u2019t driven by something so wrong between them.

I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssshh.\u201d Cass held her. \u201cJust get it out, sweetie. It\u2019s all right. We\u2019re here. We\u2019ve got you. Dana, can you find your way to my room and bring some warm clothes? I keep pajamas in the left top dresser drawer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFlannels and bunny slippers coming right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay,\u201d Rachel said, done with her cursory evaluation. \u201cShe\u2019s right. Just sore and stressed. Do you have heat and ice packs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster bathroom closet. This is one of her favorite rooms in the house. Can you work on her here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, this is a good space. I\u2019ll go get the packs and a warm throw for her to lie on while I work on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Marcie whispered. \u201cI hate making you worry, making you have to do things for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh love.\u201d Stroking her hair back, Cass kissed her forehead. \u201cDo you know how long it\u2019s been since you\u2019ve needed me to do anything for you? I\u2019m so sorry this happened, but I\u2019ve actually missed being there for you every once in a while. You ask so little for yourself, always handling everything so well.\u201d Marcie raised her head enough to see Cass smile through a sheen of tears. \u201cI\u2019m here for you, anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all are,\u201d Dana said. She was back, and her fingers were loosening the laces of the pants. She\u2019d been exploring them to determine their shape and workings. Now Marcie let out a combination sigh of relief and discomfort as they lifted her to her feet and removed them. She\u2019d left the shoes where she\u2019d crumpled and someone had put them neatly to the side of the couch.</p><p>When Rachel returned with a chenille throw, Savannah slid the tunic top over her head. Then her cool fingers caressed Marcie\u2019s back, releasing the catch of the shelf bra, letting it slide down her arms. She took the leggings that Dana handed her, folded them up with the bra and put the clothes with the shoes while the others eased Marcie down to her stomach on the couch. She was now fully naked, but the warm throw felt good against her skin.</p><p>\u201cNo shame, sweetheart,\u201d Cass said. \u201cWe\u2019re all girls here. All the kids are gone for the night. Jon has them making robots in his workshop or learning how to shape bonsai. One of his usual activities.\u201d</p><p>It made her smile a little, but she wasn\u2019t ashamed to be naked with them. If Ben wanted to strip her naked on St. Charles, tie her to a trolley stop sign and sit on a nearby bench to read his paper and enjoy the view, that wouldn\u2019t bother her. She was his. Because of the common elements that bound her to these women, particularly in this moment, she felt no more self-consciousness with them than she did with him. It might seem twisted to the rest of the world, but that was okay. It made sense to her.</p><p>Cass\u2019 fingers whispered over the cane marks. \u201cOkay, some ice for these areas should be good enough. I give him credit. He never breaks the skin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust every blood vessel beneath it,\u201d Dana chuckled. \u201cI remember.\u201d She paused, as if realizing now might not be a good time to remind Marcie of that, but in answer, Marcie laced her fingers with the black woman\u2019s, laying her head on her knuckles. It was different with Dana. She couldn\u2019t really explain that either, but when you belonged to one of the Knights, in a peripheral way you belonged to all of them. Max\u2019s words came back to her.</p><p>You\u2019re one of theirs.</p><p>Dana stroked her hair, leaned down and kissed her temple, a soft nuzzle. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t all Ben,\u201d Marcie mumbled, wistfully passing her fingers over the St. Christopher\u2019s medal, briefly hooking in the D-ring when Dana made a soft noise of sympathy. \u201cMaster L and Frank did the first part.\u201d</p><p>Now there was a full stop. Cass squatted where Marcie could see her face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t take me to the club, so I went on my own. To Surreal. I did go to Baton Rouge to get info for Pickard, that wasn\u2019t a lie. I just couldn\u2019t tell you the rest.\u201d It was important to let her sister know that, see Cass acknowledge it with a nod. \u201cMaster L and Frank invited me to play with them. They were going to work me over on top of my clothes, which was fine at first, but they were really good at it. Ben was at the bar with this...woman. I didn\u2019t know he was going to be there, but when I saw he was, and he was with her...I just wanted it all to go away. Anyhow, Master L and Frank did a good job. None of them broke anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far.\u201d Savannah was sitting on a broad and cushioned foot rest pulled over near them. She exchanged a glance with a tight-lipped Cass as Dana chuckled. She tugged Marcie\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cGirl, you\u2019ve got brass ones. Bigger than Ben\u2019s even. Damn, I bet he was pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Cass\u2019 voice was frost. Dana quieted, but she reached out, found the older sister\u2019s knee.</p> <p>\u201cNot like that, hon. You know what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Cass sighed, rubbed her temple. It made Marcie flinch, seeing her worry. \u201cRachel, do you think we should put her in the hot tub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. That\u2019ll help relax her, and then I can give her a full massage afterward.\u201d</p><p>They helped her to her feet, stayed close despite her protest that she could walk. The sun porch\u2019s annex held a hot tub that could seat a dozen people. There were a few wooden loungers around it, some of Jon\u2019s tranquil maples. He should start a nursery, call it Peaceful Plants. Ben could run a bakery right next to it. Steamed Buns.</p><p>She must have said the first part, because Rachel gave one of her musical chuckles. She and Cass were helping her into the hot tub, one on each side. \u201cI\u2019ll suggest it as a retirement option for him. I think he has enough projects and ideas going right now to last him the next forty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took me by surprise,\u201d Marcie said. There was no filter on her mouth right now, no organization, just myriad thoughts drifting through her head. She remembered that breakfast, what he\u2019d told her about touching Rachel. \u201cOne moment he\u2019s this peace-and-love super genius guru, the next, he\u2019s a Dom and he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurns the cartilage in your knees to jelly?\u201d Rachel squeezed her waist carefully, brushed her cheek against Marcie\u2019s. \u201cYes, he does. It makes kneeling to him very convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor several reasons,\u201d Cass said wryly. \u201cHere we go. We\u2019ve got you. Just take the steps slow.\u201d</p><p>Marcie was vaguely aware of the front doorbell ringing and Savannah telling Cass she\u2019d get it. When the heated water closed around her calves and Rachel pressed the control to start the jets, everything else was lost in the bliss and bubbling noise. She may have even moaned. She kept her wits about her enough to glance over her shoulder and watch Savannah move in a stately sway back across the sun porch, toward the front hallway.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even waddle. Wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But you should have seen her the night we got her to do Jell-O shots with us,\u201d Dana said. \u201cBefore she was pregnant, obviously. Even Matt had never seen her drunk. We have some blackmail photos. Or at least, I\u2019m told they\u2019re blackmail material. She says if we ever share them she\u2019ll hire an assassin to take us all out. I\u2019m not scared. We\u2019ll show them to you later.\u201d</p><p>Marcie smiled, she couldn\u2019t help it. Dana was just like that, the right combination of humor and calm assurance, with Rachel\u2019s earth mother support on the other side. No matter what, it was going to be all right.</p><p>She almost fell asleep in the hot tub, Dana and Rachel watching over her, but after twenty minutes, they brought her back out. Rachel moved one of the loungers to the sunroom, and Marcie was so loose they poured her back onto it. They\u2019d moved the chenille throw with it, which felt wonderful on her naked skin. Dana sat in a chair near her head, to give Rachel room. Savannah had pulled her foot rest close as well. Matt\u2019s wife had a bowl of ice as well as prepared ice packs, which Rachel indicated would be used when she was done, to keep the swelling down where needed. Cass sat next to Dana, stroking Marcie\u2019s hair with her fingers, soothing.</p><p>Marcie listened to the murmur of voices, not really focused on any of it, just floating in her head. There was no pain there, all the things that hurt or disturbed pushed behind a gray mist. She closed her eyes as Dana\u2019s fingers twined with hers, the black woman\u2019s thumb sliding over her palm, her wrist pulse, caressing. She bit her lip as one of the ice cubes made a slow glide over the marks on her thighs, her ass. She felt the tips of Savannah\u2019s nails. It felt good, soothing...but a little more than that too.</p><p>The hot tub had loosened her up, but it had done something else. She hadn\u2019t come tonight. What had happened at Surreal had been a roller coaster, physically and emotionally, and since the latter had claimed center stage for the past couple hours, she\u2019d assumed the former had settled down, but their touch was reawakening it. Were they doing it...intentionally?</p><p>\u201cUm...Cass...\u201d Her cheeks were warming. In a moment, she was going to be making it obvious how those slow, sensual glides of ice felt, the teasing touch on her wrist pulse, definitely an erogenous zone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Let them take care of you in the way they know you need.\u201d The two sisters met eye to eye as Cass knelt before her, stroked her hair along her temple. \u201cYou\u2019re one of us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just like that, the key to the city, to the secret clubhouse, to the place she\u2019d always known she belonged. It made tears spill forth anew. \u201cOh Cass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssh. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve known for a long time what you are, haven\u2019t I? And I\u2019ve never told you it\u2019s wrong. How could it be, when I\u2019m cut from the same cloth? But I worry. Because you\u2019re young, reckless...and it goes so deep for you, deeper than me. Maybe more than any of us. There was a time I was afraid the life I gave you contributed to it, in the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>Marcie was already shaking her head, but Cass pressed a hand over hers, showing she\u2019d made whatever peace she needed to make with that thought. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. As long as this is what you truly want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. But with him. Only him. What if he doesn\u2019t...\u201d She\u2019d imagined being part of this circle for a long time, but she hadn\u2019t thought what it would be like to be the fifth wheel of it.</p><p>Torment. Just like it was for Ben.</p><p>\u201cMarcie?\u201d Savannah spoke in that quiet, steady way of hers that commanded instant attention. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to look toward me. Just feel. And listen, when it\u2019s time to do so.\u201d</p><p>She could do that. Cass pressed a kiss to her forehead, touched her nose then moved out of her view. Marcie\u2019s fingers curled into Dana\u2019s as Savannah sent that cube of ice gliding the length of what felt like one of the rawhide marks, down over the pitting caused by the rattan points. A drop of water rolled down her buttock, into the crease. It was pretty close to her pussy, and that was starting to throb. She had her legs closed, but she wanted them open, wanted to feel that ice glide over labia, touch her clit and make her writhe. Get a grip, Marcie. This is Savannah, Matt\u2019s wife. Who was probably the only woman in the history of the world who could walk with a regal sway, versus an adorable waddle, during advanced pregnancy.</p><p>But her mind couldn\u2019t help but turn to Ben, how he\u2019d used ice in a far more invasive way to cool her down, to stop her orgasm when she couldn\u2019t do it herself. Dana made it worse, because now she bent her head, brushed her lips to Marcie\u2019s palm, her wrist. When she used the tip of her tongue, Marcie let out a breath, fingers gripping Dana\u2019s more tightly. \u201cGuys...what...\u201d Then she remembered what Savannah had said. Feel. Listen.</p><p>\u201cThat was Max at the door,\u201d Savannah said in that same conversational murmur. \u201cHe was making sure you were okay, that you\u2019d come to us, rather than sneaking off to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey really are the most overprotective, interfering males ever,\u201d Marcie muttered. She\u2019d tried to do that. Couldn\u2019t. What would happen when Max told Matt? Maybe she could get Savannah to intervene. This was between her and Ben, and if it was over, it was over. She didn\u2019t need anything else stirred up while her heart was already shattering and fragile. She didn\u2019t even have the energy to broach the topic now.</p><p>\u201cYes, God bless them. I\u2019ve known Ben O\u2019Callahan a long time. He is an extreme Master.\u201d Savannah\u2019s fingers followed the ice, the overlay of stripes and marks, two days\u2019 worth of his Dominance. \u201cBut anger never plays a role in that part of his life. He does have an Irish temper, but it\u2019s usually reserved for professional incompetence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when the Saints lose,\u201d Dana added.</p><p>\u201cHe deserves to be horsewhipped, and we are not going to make excuses for him. But I am going to tell you this. In the time I\u2019ve known him, he\u2019s never lost control with a woman like this. Matt agreed.\u201d</p><p>Marcie stilled. \u201cYou told him.\u201d Of course she had. She\u2019d been in the hot tub twenty minutes, so that explained where Savannah had gone. Cass had joined her at some point, so did that mean Lucas knew too? Oh hell, if Matt knew, they probably all did.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want...this was between him and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dearest.\u201d Savannah\u2019s voice was firm. Dana\u2019s hand had landed on her shoulder, anticipating Marcie trying to push up off the lounger. Rachel began a deep rub of her back designed to turn her into a limp noodle. As she struggled between alarm and the need to purr, Savannah continued.</p><p>\u201cWomen can fight their own battles, but thanks to Matt, I\u2019ve learned true strength includes the ability to seek backup when needed. You took this on all by yourself. You brought the fight to Ben, did all sorts of dangerous things to draw him out. You knew enough about him to know what would work, but you had no idea how it would play out. That\u2019s the foolish courage of youth.\u201d</p><p>Marcie couldn\u2019t bristle over the simple truth. Not when Savannah\u2019s voice was kind, not patronizing. \u201cYou needed that type of courage, the belief that you could handle whatever kind of bull charged out onto that field. Because at a certain point, instead of the matador, you became the red cape.\u201d</p><p>That ache came to the surface again. \u201cSo I screwed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Savannah resumed her glide with the ice. Marcie bit her lip as she followed the curve of her buttock and touched down on her leg. Several more drops ran down her inner thigh, making her twitch. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea what the outcome will be, but set aside emotions. Focus on what you know of Ben, all that wonderful research I\u2019m sure you did. Based on that, what is the most significant thing I\u2019ve said to you?\u201d</p><p>Marcie opened her eyes, glanced down the length of her body at the woman who met her gaze with piercing intelligence. Her mind was like a spaghetti soup, but when a successful Fortune-500 female CEO told her to review the details and come up with an answer, she dove into the tangle.</p><p>\u201cIn the time you\u2019ve known him, he\u2019s never lost control with a woman like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d Savannah nodded her approval. \u201cBy the way, when you start seeking permanent employment, I\u2019ll pay you twenty percent more than Pickard or K&amp;A. Plus give you a corner office and your own assistant.\u201d</p><p>Marcie blinked. Wow. That certainly bolstered her, but her mind was turning over the statement. She wanted to believe, but... \u201cHe could have lost it because he sees me as a little kid. The big-brother protective thing.\u201d</p><p>Rachel snorted. She passed a hand over Marcie\u2019s buttock, offering a light scrape with her nails that made Marcie jump, not in an unpleasant way. The physical therapist\u2019s quiet chuckle had a sensual note to it. \u201cNo, Marcie. He most definitely doesn\u2019t see you as a child. No matter how much he\u2019s telling himself he does.\u201d</p><p>On the back of Rachel\u2019s collar, next to the locking mechanism, Marcie knew there was a Sanskrit word. Owned. To wear something like that of Ben\u2019s...it was all she wanted.</p><p>The gray mist parted, letting in some of those unsettling feelings, but their words were giving her wounded heart stray shots of hope. If they were wrong, she\u2019d be opening herself to being stabbed again, and she wasn\u2019t sure if she was strong enough. Even now, remembering Ben\u2019s anger at the limo, his contempt, his...</p><p>She didn\u2019t want it to happen, but she\u2019d pushed that part of tonight\u2019s events furthest behind the gray mist for a reason. She hadn\u2019t let it affect her in years, but in that moment, when he had her shoved against the limo, when she realized she couldn\u2019t fight him off, and he wasn\u2019t necessarily going to let her go, she\u2019d remembered Allen, pushing her down on the floor, holding his forearm on her throat, not realizing she couldn\u2019t breathe as he tore at her clothes...</p><p>When a man attacked a woman, she never forgot it. It was in her head, the violence in his hands, the meanness in his face... Ben had betrayed what she knew of him, and she\u2019d trusted him. The way she\u2019d trusted Jeremy. Her brother hadn\u2019t pulled Allen off her. Cass had.</p><p>How could she trust Dr. Jekyll when she\u2019d seen Mr. Hyde? She was shaking again. She\u2019d told herself she wouldn\u2019t let her mind go in this direction. She was a clear-headed person, one who didn\u2019t let past baggage affect her present, but she was surrounded by women who knew what it was to be entirely vulnerable to the one they loved. It was a confessional she couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>\u201cHe was...I\u2019ve never seen him like that. I wasn\u2019t sure he wouldn\u2019t hurt me...like for real hurt, hit me in the face. It was someone else, some dark, terrible thing inside of him. It was like he hated me at that moment. I was...I was scared of him. I hate that. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be saying this. Cass was still in the room. But saying it out loud helped steady her, look at it with clearer eyes. Ben wasn\u2019t a chronic abuser of women. She knew that. Something else had happened tonight. It was as Savannah had implied. She needed to step back, look at all of it, not to make excuses for him, but to get all the information, figure it out, before she made the decision that was best for her. Even if it was a decision that broke her heart.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time you and Matt talked,\u201d Savannah said after a quiet moment. \u201cThis is in your hands, Marcie. But you have a family. We\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>And him. It was an odd thought, but being surrounded by their love and support made her wonder where Ben was, if he was still walking around in the cold darkness of the city streets, alone.</p><p>\u201cKeep in mind, whatever you decide, I\u2019m still going to kill him,\u201d Cass said. She put a small ice pack against Marcie\u2019s lip.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Dana said. \u201cAs long as someone points me toward him. I\u2019ll break his kneecap, then he can\u2019t outrun me.\u201d</p><p>Marcie smiled beneath the ice pack. \u201cI\u2019d like to see that.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s wife dropped another kiss on her knuckles. \u201cYou got to him, Marcie. This is a tricky, difficult situation, but I\u2019ll bet good money he doesn\u2019t know what the hell to do with how he feels about you.\u201d</p><p>That made two of them. Things had become more complicated and uncertain because of the evening\u2019s events, and she wasn\u2019t going to get it worked out in her head tonight. But that was what tomorrow was for, right?</p><p>\u201cAll right. Time to take care of some other things.\u201d As if discerning her thoughts, Cass rose. \u201cI\u2019m going to go make you some chocolate chip cookies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNestle Tollhouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any other kind? Hot out of the oven. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>As Cass rose and moved to the kitchen, Savannah picked up another ice cube. Marcie had been listening for the tiny clicks of her manicured nails against the bowl, each time anticipating the first really cold touch of the frosted ice, then that combination warm-cold feeling as it melted against her skin, the beads of water working their way down, both agitating and soothing the welts. Savannah took this one on a different track. After she circled it over her buttocks, she pressed it between, a slow, slow glide into that crevice, over the rim, and then down, down, toward the aching center core.</p> <p>Marcie\u2019s fingers tightened on Dana\u2019s, her thighs trembling, wanting to loosen. \u201cWhat...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d This from Rachel, whose hands were still working their magic. \u201cJust feel, Marcie. Enjoy. Do whatever your body wants you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Her Master hadn\u2019t given her permission to enjoy this. To experience this. Given the night\u2019s events, though, it seemed a fair trade. She made a noise of sheer ecstasy as Rachel\u2019s strong hands worked a particularly good spot.</p><p>\u201cThere we go. That works, doesn\u2019t it? Roll with the feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs out, if that\u2019s what you wish to do,\u201d Savannah said.</p> <p>Tentative, Marcie shifted. Dana made a warm sound of approval. The black woman had shifted to her knees by the lounger, and her kiss on Marcie\u2019s palm this time became something more. She teased Marcie\u2019s pulse with her tongue, followed the vein.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d A soft sound escaped as a result of that stimulation, as well as what Savannah was doing. The ice moved between her legs, Savannah tracing her labia, letting the tip of the ice slide between and letting it go, where it would melt, the drops following the path of gravity to drip over her clit. Another click in that metal bowl and Marcie\u2019s hips lifted to her, asking for more. She couldn\u2019t help it. Was she really doing this?</p><p>Yes, she was. Her sister had left the room, knowing they could provide this, knowing what she needed.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for you and me to change positions, Ice Princess.\u201d Dana directed that at Savannah. \u201cIf you think you can roll you and the mighty Matt mite in this direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the only one who gets away with calling me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid to punch a blind girl?\u201d</p> <p>Savannah snorted, didn\u2019t answer that. \u201cI don\u2019t need to roll,\u201d she said with dignity. \u201cAs long as I get a push from behind.\u201d</p><p>Marcie tilted her head to see Dana do just that, her hands incredibly gentle as she helped Savannah to her feet. She noticed Dana also caressed Savannah\u2019s swollen belly under the silk tunic, and Savannah\u2019s lips curved at the gesture. Matt\u2019s wife had always been the more austere aunt of the K&amp;A family, even when Marcie eavesdropped on those tea parties. Cass told her it had taken Savannah far longer to trust their female circle than the other women, but that it had taken the K&amp;A men a long time to win her faith as well.</p><p>\u201cYou understand him, don\u2019t you?\u201d Maybe it was the moment, feeling like nothing was off limits, but that austerity that always kept her somewhat at arm\u2019s length with Matt\u2019s wife felt a little less restrictive right now.</p><p>Savannah paused long enough that Marcie was about to apologize, retreat, but then the elegant fingers wrapped around hers, tightened.</p><p>\u201cI give Ben a great deal of credit for what he made of himself. When I met Matt, the official story about Ben was that he\u2019d spent most of his formative years in New England, and he and Matt had met at Yale. Nothing about him suggested otherwise, as if he\u2019d internalized that version of himself. They protected his past, not to make his life a lie, but so that he could stand away from it, not be defined by it, though of course emotionally, he still is.</p><p>\u201cIt is a mortal wound, when you realize that your parents don\u2019t love you. Don\u2019t want you. What dies is hard to resurrect, because we learn faith and trust on the foundation of our parents\u2019 love. Even if Ben carries such a wound, his behavior tonight seems extreme to me. However, my father\u2019s coldness was buffered by a house, servants, physical safety. A lack of material want. Ben didn\u2019t have any of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Marcie squeezed her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Both for asking and for the fact that happened to you. I\u2019ve loved you since I met you, even though you\u2019ve always been a little intimidating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to come to the next Jell-O-shot night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have something you should be doing over there?\u201d Savannah asked, narrowing her eyes at Dana. But when Marcie looked up at her again, Savannah\u2019s expression softened in a way she hadn\u2019t seen before. She touched Marcie\u2019s forehead. \u201cThey resurrected me,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of them. Don\u2019t worry, it will work out.\u201d</p><p>Marcie drew in her breath as Dana put another ice cube on her ass, only she was a little bit more forward about it than Savannah. She parted her buttocks, slid the ice right up against her anus, setting off a whole series of flashbacks. Ben\u2019s tongue there, his fingers, his cock stretching her. She whimpered, digging her nails into Savannah.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he has that effect on a woman.\u201d Dana\u2019s amusement had a sultry, serious purr to it, one that kept everything humming. Her slim fingers drew provocative circles on the marks. \u201cHe switched you good. Did you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Marcie swallowed over her raw throat. She was going to have a permanent rasp from these past few days. \u201cI like everything he does to me, and I just want more. The only thing I didn\u2019t like was how he was feeling, what he was feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. The boy has issues. Think we need to skip all this childhood therapy shit and just have Peter bash his head against a brick wall a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a very hard head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t all.\u201d</p><p>The switch from grim amusement to mischief was welcome. An unexpected little giggle bubbled up in her. She must be feeling punchy. \u201cThe other night...I lost count of how many times he came. What guy can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a cranky young god. Thor has his magic hammer, Ben has his hundred-horsepower cock.\u201d</p><p>Rachel chuckled while Savannah shook her head. \u201cA long time ago, I told Dana that Ben wants a woman\u2019s soul, not her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the devil can take your soul,\u201d Dana added, brushing her mouth on the small of Marcie\u2019s back. \u201cBut he can\u2019t take a heart. It has to be given, and usually requires one given in exchange.\u201d</p><p>Marcie was pretty sure Ben already had her soul, but there was another caveat. In order to give a heart, someone had to accept it. Dana started kneading Marcie\u2019s buttocks, creating that low-level discomfort that made her shiver, made her want more. \u201cYeah, you like that,\u201d the blind woman observed. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain junkie. No wonder you\u2019ve fucked with Ben\u2019s head so well. Let\u2019s get you up on your knees, little sister.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say to any of that, but she didn\u2019t have to do so. Instead, she was clutching Savannah with both hands, because Dana slid one of those hands beneath her, enough to lift her a few inches off the lounger, and put her mouth between Marcie\u2019s legs. She\u2019d never had a woman there, and the soft mouth, the feminine licks, were a different experience entirely from Ben\u2019s strong mouth and penetrating tongue. But Dana was focused, probably using her knowledge of what pleasured herself to bring Marcie to a different place, where thinking was no longer an option. She licked the cold labia, heating them up, stroked the clit with a broad then curling tongue. Two separate, dragging sensations. She tugged on the clit ring, making Marcie undulate against her with a moan.</p><p>Both strong brown hands now moved to Marcie\u2019s hips, thumbs nudging her inner thighs to spread her open. Marcie adjusted without thought, seeking more of that feeling, planting her knees out wide on the lounger.</p><p>She was propped on her elbows, and still holding Savannah\u2019s hands. When Savannah switched their grips, moving hers to Marcie\u2019s wrists, the suggestion of restraint was enough to send Marcie up another few notches. She could imagine Ben sitting in a corner, watching these women pleasure her, all at his command.</p><p>Rachel was no longer giving her a massage, at least not that kind. As she slid her hands under Marcie, Marcie dropped her forehead to the lounger. Jon\u2019s wife cupped her breasts, fingers closing over her nipples, tweaking the piercings.</p><p>\u201cOh...God...\u201d It didn\u2019t take any time at all. She was pushing against Dana\u2019s face, her fingers now grabbing Savannah\u2019s wrists so they were holding each other. Then Rachel\u2019s touch slid back to her shoulder blades, up into her hair. At the key moment, as her lower belly was coiling up tight, tighter, Rachel dug into her scalp, pulled hard on her hair. The way Ben would if he was fucking her, to pull her head up and back.</p><p>She came hard, intense, fast. It shuddered through her, head to toe. It was a purely physical release, but there was an emotional purging involved, something the women obviously knew she needed. Taking out the trash, so tomorrow she could look around the psyche and see what was there.</p><p>She threw her head back farther, neck arching with the power of the climax. It was then Rachel caught her jaw, taking that kiss Marcie had wanted at her house that day. It was so startling and unexpected, Marcie stilled, quivering in the aftershocks even as she explored the shape and pleasure a woman\u2019s lips could offer, an easy girl kiss. It was like cotton candy at the fair, a treat perfect when the environment was just right, and in this moment, it was. When she murmured something incoherent, Savannah\u2019s fingers joined Rachel\u2019s in her hair. She stroked gently while Rachel kept giving her tugs that made those aftershocks a steady bump of little waves through her body.</p><p>Slowly, they eased her back to her stomach, Rachel breaking the kiss to sweep her hands over her back and shoulders, resuming the massage. Savannah kept stroking her hair. She was falling into lassitude, until a sharp pinch made her yelp. Her gaze snapped down to Dana, who gave her an impish look. The woman picked up another piece of ice, soothed the little bite of pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKnow you appreciate the sadistic side, girlfriend. Didn\u2019t want to leave you unbalanced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she breathed. \u201cSome minister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinistration comes in all forms, love.\u201d</p> <p>She managed a snort, but she was well and truly limp now. She mumbled something appropriate, no idea what. Eyes closing, she gave herself back to their hands.</p><p>Cass came back a few minutes after the cries subsided. The cookies were in the oven, but she knew her sister wouldn\u2019t be eating them until later. Marcie was fast asleep, so deeply her arm had fallen off the side of the lounger, the way it had when she was ten. Tenderly, she knelt by Dana, tucked it into a folded position under Marcie\u2019s chin. Glancing at Savannah, she gestured, then helped the woman move over to a corner of the sun porch, out of hearing distance, in case Marcie drifted back to consciousness.</p><p>\u201cMatt\u2019s spoken to Max since we talked. He confirmed what Max told us. He\u2019s never seen Ben like this. He thinks whatever he\u2019s been carrying inside him the past couple years may have ruptured, or at least cracked pretty hard. He told Matt the guys should go look for him, because he doesn\u2019t think he should be alone.\u201d</p><p>Savannah nodded, studied her tense face. \u201cYou\u2019re her sister, Cass. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt asked me the same question.\u201d Cass sighed, shook her head. \u201cI know she\u2019s loved him since she was sixteen years old. He\u2019s every woman\u2019s fantasy, but I don\u2019t know if he has what it takes to be a woman\u2019s reality. To be what Lucas and Matt are to us. We\u2019ve always known he\u2019s the extreme one, Savannah. The one who carries the most demons. As her sister, it scares me to think of her exposed to that.\u201d She gave a tight smile. \u201cAt the moment, I want him dismembered and his body dumped in a swamp.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>Cass raised a brow. \u201cThere\u2019s something you want to say, but you\u2019re not sure it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing your negotiator skills on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. I\u2019d miss good stuff if I didn\u2019t.\u201d Cass sobered though, glancing at the sleeping woman, the focus of their concern. \u201cTell me something that will make this all right, Savannah. Something that gives me hope of a happy ending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe Marcie is right. I think she is the one for Ben, the same way each of us has been for our husbands. Only they accepted the truth of that first, pursued us, convinced us of it. With some rather tempting and unorthodox methods.\u201d</p><p>Cass managed an amused eye roll. \u201cA huge understatement.\u201d</p> <p>Savannah nodded. \u201cBen had a very different history from the other men. He\u2019s never let a woman get close enough to hurt him. He has surrogates, the wives of his friends, safe targets for his affections, but it\u2019s different from having a woman of his own. He\u2019s armored against that level of intimacy, and behind that armor is a lot of darkness. Marcie had a way in no woman has ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough our family connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d Savannah shifted on the footstool, adjusting swollen ankles onto the brace beneath Cass\u2019 chair. \u201cWe know these men have many traits in common. One of them is possessiveness, though they pretend to be civilized about it.\u201d</p><p>Cass snorted. \u201cNo disagreement here.\u201d</p><p>Savannah acknowledged that with a wry twist of her lips. \u201cWe love them, belong to them utterly, consider them ours as well. Ben is just as possessive and protective about what he considers his. However, he doesn\u2019t trust women, because the woman he was supposed to trust unconditionally, from his first breath in this world, abandoned and betrayed him. If his unconscious self recognized Marcie as his soul mate, seeing her with those two men tonight perhaps ripped something open that he\u2019s kept locked down for far too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always had more bravery than sense,\u201d Cass said. \u201cBut he had no right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t,\u201d Savannah said evenly. \u201cHe had no right at all to do what he did. But figuring out why he did it, seeing what he will do next, that\u2019s the difference between whether there is a future for them or not.\u201d</p><p>Cass considered that. \u201cMatt told Lucas. He\u2019ll be home later tonight. I\u2019ll have her in her pajamas by then, but he\u2019s going to know. Emotions are going to be running high.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMatt will send Peter or Jon after Ben. He can face Lucas at the office Monday. In a reasonably public place, Lucas will hold off murdering him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanet will cover their asses for many things, but not a capital crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Cass sighed again. \u201cI want to do something, Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did something tonight. Something important. She needed us.\u201d Savannah nodded toward Marcie. \u201cLet the men deal with Ben right now. They\u2019ll know how to handle him. Marcie herself has a choice in all this, once she feels a little more herself. We don\u2019t want to step on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might feel less equable when you have your own child,\u201d Cass said, but without rancor. Rising, she moved back to Marcie, knelt by her. She couldn\u2019t bear looking at that strained and exhausted face any longer without touching, reassuring herself that her sister was okay. It made her think of Jeremy\u2019s pale, thin face. She\u2019d seen him a couple weeks ago, and knew things were drawing to a close for him. The knowledge of that came forward now, making her feel even more fiercely protective, and more helpless.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so sure, Savannah. Why is she so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe letters,\u201d Marcie mumbled. \u201cHis letters.\u201d Her brown eyes opened, met Cass\u2019 blue ones. \u201cI wrote to him in college, and he answered. I could tell...it\u2019s hard to explain. I just knew. The things he told me...to help me, they told me things about him as well.\u201d Pain suffused her expression. \u201cMaybe I am too young, too stupid, too sure. But, Cass...I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll survive being wrong.\u201d</p><p>Tears spilled forth anew. Cass didn\u2019t know what to say to that, but she put her hand over the one Marcie had curled up under her chin. As she slid her arm over the younger woman\u2019s back, Dana and Rachel, who\u2019d been stroking and keeping her comfortable, now drew closer once again. Marcie didn\u2019t seem to notice. She kept that lock on Cass\u2019 gaze, her chin tightening. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have said that. If I am wrong, if he doesn\u2019t love me, if there\u2019s no chance...I\u2019ll go to Milan. I\u2019ll put it back together, Cass. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>Did she know her words broke as she spoke them, her hand quivering in Cass\u2019? When Marcie fixated on Ben as a teenager, Cass had been glad. Ben had been the big brother Jeremy failed to be. He\u2019d also done what Cass couldn\u2019t\u2014he\u2019d taught her to relax enough to enjoy life, to have fun, to be young. But what Cass had called a fixation, a crush, had been something very different in Marcie\u2019s mind, evolving into this as she became a woman. If she had to go back, would she have discouraged Ben\u2019s friendship with her sister, seeing her like this now?</p><p>The answer to that question depended a great deal on what happened next, as Savannah said. They were a close-knit group for a lot of reasons, not the least of which was how much faith they had in this unique circle of men. She couldn\u2019t let this one night wipe away seven years of Ben being what he\u2019d been to all of them. Just on principle, though, she might nurse a homicidal rage toward him for a day or two.</p><p>\u201cYou will be okay,\u201d Cass agreed, wiping away the tears. \u201cYou\u2019re very strong. You have family who loves you. Me, Lucas, all of us. We\u2019ll be here to take care of you, no matter what comes. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Her heart tightened at the thought of her husband, her Master, the man who meant so much to her. Lucas loved Marcie. Being the kind of Master he was, he would know what Ben had done to her with barely a glance. It wasn\u2019t the marks on her body. That was something Marcie craved. What would ignite Lucas was her shattered expression, her loss of faith, the evidence of betrayal. Ben broke down a sub with brutal methods, but only to bring her to a place where he gave her the maximum pleasure, the perfect experience. In this case, Ben had merely broken her, pushed her aside. Given his lethal talent at breaking a submissive, what he\u2019d done was an unforgivable breach.</p><p>No way around it. Monday was going to be pretty ugly.</p><p>\u201cRemember, we can still strap him down naked and go after him with a Taser. Combine that with a few chocolate truffles, and it\u2019d be the perfect girls\u2019 night.\u201d</p><p>That helpful advice came from Rachel. \u201cI think Dana\u2019s having a bad influence on you,\u201d Marcie said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone always blames me,\u201d Dana complained. \u201cNo one realizes Rachel is really worse. I\u2019m just her beard.\u201d</p><p>Marcie hiccupped, a half-chuckle. It also produced a few more tears, breaking Cass\u2019 heart a little.</p><p>Seeing it, Savannah glanced at Rachel and Dana. They picked up her cue without a word. The three of them slid their arms around both sisters, giving them an embrace that promised them all the love and support they needed.</p><p>Until tonight, the K&amp;A men had never let any of them down, had rescued them from some unbearable situations. Savannah knew Ben would make this good. If he didn\u2019t, he wasn\u2019t the man she believed him to be. While she might call her own judgment into doubt on rare occasion, she knew one thing about Matt Kensington. He never misjudged people. It would all work out. If it didn\u2019t...she\u2019d have a go with that Taser herself.</p><p>Ben knew he had no business being around anyone tonight. He wanted to pound on something. Fortunately, hanging around long enough to torture himself with that brief conversation between Marcie and Max had given him a target.</p><p>So Pfeiffer hired ham-handed security who liked to punch girls in the face. He\u2019d stayed in the shadows long enough to hear that and be certain that Marcie didn\u2019t break Max, talk him into something stupid. Like Ben hadn\u2019t already won the hands-down prize for the stupidest act of the millennium. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d have been looking through that trash container when she had shadows and low foot traffic, which meant the security asshole who\u2019d done it was a nightshift stiff. He wasn\u2019t oblivious to the irony of hunting down a guy who\u2019d hurt her. But hypocrisy was the least of his crimes tonight. He knew he was out of focus, more than a little out of control. He should go home, bolt the door, get blind drunk and leave it at that. But he hated being closed in when he felt like this. He needed to move, to keep moving, until things evened out. He\u2019d go beat this guy to a bloody pulp, buy a cheap bottle of whatever junk one of the convenience stores had, then go drink it on top of his cemetery perch. If he was lucky, he\u2019d pass out, roll off the top and break his fucking neck.</p><p>Pfeiffer was within walking distance of the K&amp;A offices. The building had a spiffy silver and glass fa\u00e7ade revealing the lobby inside. He contemplated picking up one of the big stone planters up front and tossing it through, but then he noticed the security desk was visible. He could wave and get the attention of the two guys sitting there, entirely dissatisfying. He was going to throw the planter anyway.</p><p>Then he noticed Peter sitting on a sidewalk bench, ankle balanced on his knee, patiently waiting for him.</p> <p>Max was too damn intuitive to be a fucking limo driver.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re out trawling for paid pussy, that\u2019s up on Canal Street. Blind women can smell that kind of thing though, so you better sleep with one eye open. Dana will shoot you full of holes, even if she can\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>Peter gave him a level look. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me beat you into unconsciousness, no matter how much you deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand back and watch me beat one of these guys into unconsciousness then. Other than doing the same to me, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to stop me.\u201d Ben tightened his jaw. \u201cGo home, Peter. I don\u2019t want to be around anyone. Particularly anyone I know.\u201d</p><p>Peter rose, stretching his substantial bulk, cracking his thick neck. \u201cThe guy you want isn\u2019t working tonight. I happen to know where he lives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you share that information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen him. I think you need to see him as well. It\u2019s not far.\u201d Sliding his hands into his jeans pockets, Peter began to walk up the street, literally whistling Dixie. Biting back a vile curse, Ben fell in with him in a few strides, since the asshole was ambling. Once there, Peter picked up the pace, but not by much. \u201cNice night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He said nothing further, and in a few blocks, he made a left, taking Ben down a street where the buildings had upper-level apartments much like his own place nearby. Peter stopped in front of one with a side staircase that led to living quarters above the Ruby Slipper restaurant. Ben went there regularly for breakfast and sometimes to watch ball games on the several wide-screens. He and this guy were practically neighbors.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You thinking of exchanging Christmas cards?\u201d Arching a brow, Peter rapped on a door that looked in need of painting.</p> <p>\u201cHold on. Jesus. Like a fucking train station tonight.\u201d The rumbling voice within sounded like it came from a bear.</p><p>Ben gave Peter a look when they heard a thud, a curse, then a slow progression to the door. \u201cHow old is this guy? Ninety?\u201d</p><p>The latch was thrown, and his target opened the door. Ben had to look up several inches. The guy freaking filled the door. Normally he\u2019d throw Peter at him first, to soften him up, but Ben was riding on blood lust, wanting to work the guy over personally. Unfortunately, someone had beaten him to it.</p><p>The man held a frozen slab of meat against the side of his face, nursing the mother of a swollen eye and nose. The way he protected his side suggested bruised ribs, his reason for taking his time. As he shifted to lean on the door, Ben recognized the semi-hunched walk, the symptom of very sore balls.</p><p>\u201cYou did this,\u201d he accused Peter.</p><p>\u201cNo, asshole.\u201d The tenant gave him a grumpy look. \u201cHe came by, took a look at me, said he needed to bring someone else by to gawk. Paid me twenty bucks to open the door again. Otherwise I\u2019d have told him to fuck off. I\u2019ve already lost a day\u2019s work this week, and I ain\u2019t no salaried suit. If I don\u2019t show up, I don\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Ben blinked, looked at Peter again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Peter\u2019s lip curled. \u201cNope. Wanna guess who did?\u201d</p> <p>The bear looked between the two of them. \u201cOh fuck. You two know that crazy bitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Ben took a step forward, but Peter put a light hand on his shoulder. It didn\u2019t stop Ben from saying what was on his mind though. The guy\u2019s hands were the size of tennis rackets. \u201cYou popped a woman in the face who weighs less than a buck thirty. Have you lost your mind? You could have just picked her up over your shoulder and tossed her off the property.\u201d</p><p>Bear-guy looked at Peter incredulously, as if they were allies, then came back to Ben. \u201cSorry, is there something you missed about this steak on my face and the ice I\u2019m having to put on my nuts? I could have picked up a porcupine easier than that bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should stop calling her bitch,\u201d Peter said mildly, but with enough steel to warn the guy they weren\u2019t buddies. Even so, Ben knew he was still here to be his leash. It rankled, because he was feeling a little thwarted and conflicted. He remembered overhearing Marcie in the break room, telling Janet she didn\u2019t work out in the usual girl ways. She did MMA and strength training. At the time, he hadn\u2019t given any more thought to that choice, assuming that, like most women, she did it to maintain her toned and entirely hot body, not for functional purposes. He could almost hear her reaction to that.</p><p>Once again, sexist pig assumption triumphs over reason and logic.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d The security employee held up his hand. \u201cHell, a little sympathy here. She cracked two of my ribs over a ream of papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because you punched her,\u201d Peter said patiently. \u201cShe was defending herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Listen, I don\u2019t want any crap for hitting her. Hell, if I brought assault charges, I\u2019d not only lose my credibility, but a judge would look at the two of us and laugh me out of court. It doesn\u2019t change the fact I\u2019ve taken easier beatings when I was a bouncer at a strip bar. Fuck, guys, she was caught red-handed, going through our garbage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you throw something in a Dumpster in a public alley, there\u2019s no guarantee of privacy,\u201d Ben said automatically.</p><p>\u201cFigures that you\u2019re a lawyer.\u201d The guy eyed Ben like he was a cockroach who\u2019d crawled up on his mat. \u201cIs that what this is about? You guys here to bring a suit against me or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter said, deadpan. \u201cMy colleague is thinking of hiring her for his own security needs.\u201d</p><p>The bear-guy relaxed considerably, grunted. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to stand in line. My boss says if she ever wants a job, he\u2019ll pay her twice what he\u2019s paying me.\u201d</p><p>Back out on the street, Ben stopped at a lightpost. Peter leaned on the other side of it, pulled out a candy bar and broke it in half, offering. Ben shook his head. He wanted a drink.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to tell Dana about this,\u201d Peter commented. \u201cShe\u2019s been looking for a sparring partner more her size. Maybe I\u2019ll ask that guy, since Marcie may be out of both our leagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She\u2019d taken on a guy probably three times her size and come out on the winning end. Because she\u2019d been level headed, prepared for what she faced. It was way different when an attack came from a blind spot, from someone she trusted. She\u2019d let him tie her up, beat the living hell out of her, and came back asking for more, because she believed he\u2019d never abuse the faith she put in him. The friendship she believed they\u2019d shared. The fact they were family.</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019d been kicking on a door he\u2019d intended to keep shut, a place she had no business being, but for him to blame that on her made him more of a shit than he already knew he was. \u201cI\u2019m fucking going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you aren\u2019t.\u201d Peter chewed on nougat and chocolate. \u201cYou just think you\u2019ll ditch me if you tell me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s girls\u2019 night. Dana\u2019s out late. I\u2019m lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as much as I love being your substitute cuddle toy...\u201d Ben drifted off. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. \u201cThe girls were all at Cass\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. They took care of her, man. She\u2019s all right.\u201d Now Peter\u2019s expression changed from that neutral calm into something sharp and way more focused, though he kept his voice mild. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Nothing. He\u2019d stopped thinking, which was why it had happened. If he closed his eyes, he saw her there again. Master L touching her, Frank undressing her. When he\u2019d taken over, ironically he\u2019d still been in control then. The practice of a lifetime had taken him through that session, every move choreographed, monitoring her stress level, her arousal, though something inside had been cold and numb. Then he\u2019d hauled her outside and she\u2019d hit him. That blow, the pain of it, and something had exploded. He\u2019d just reacted, all that shit boiling up and over, all over Marcie.</p><p>Moving to the curb, he dropped down on it, to hell with whatever grime his custom tailored slacks were accumulating. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>He was suddenly really tired. Nothing and nobody to be pissed at, other than himself. Nowhere to go. Just an empty place, and an empty hole inside himself.</p><p>When his head dropped into his hands, he felt Peter approach. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me.\u201d</p><p>That large hand settled on his shoulder, making him scoff. \u201cYou think I really deserve to be comforted? I hurt her, Peter. Just like I told that asshole. She weighs half of what I do, and I threw her up against the car like a doll. There\u2019s no coming back from this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, there is. It\u2019s just a hard road.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d He shoved Peter\u2019s hand away, got back up. \u201cI\u2019m really sick of you all having that fucking tone with me. You don\u2019t know what a hard road is. Not with what you have in your corner. It\u2019s fucking Christmas every fucking day for you.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was happening? He was shouting, his voice was hoarse. What had happened to him tonight? He was Ben O\u2019Callahan, a lawyer with K&amp;A, a sexual Dominant who always held control. He always kept his shit together. He was the fucking foam on the latte that rose above all of it. He\u2019d been there for them whenever they needed him, always. He hadn\u2019t let his friends down. But at this moment, he resented the hell out of every one of them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going. Get the hell away from me.\u201d</p> <p>Peter rose as he was walking away. \u201cYou know, Jon said something pretty interesting the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he always? The guy never shuts up.\u201d Ben came to a halt though, bracing himself against another lightpost, fingers gripping it hard, the peeling paint over the metal.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He said that our women\u2014Savannah, Cass, Rachel, Dana\u2014when we met them, each was in a situation where she really needed someone\u2019s help. Someone strong to stand at her back. I\u2019d say damsel in distress, but the lot of them would tie me down and pour acid on my manly parts.\u201d</p><p>Ben lifted his head. Peter met his gaze, those gray eyes as steady as the rock embedded in a cliff face. \u201cJon said maybe you were different. That maybe Marcie\u2019s supposed to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t move, something keeping him rooted to this spot, listening to this bullshit.</p> <p>Peter took another couple steps forward. \u201cYou\u2019ve been alone a long time, Ben. You have us, but it\u2019s not the same. You don\u2019t think we all see it? You\u2019re struggling. You\u2019re going to go off somewhere, get drunk tonight. That\u2019s not the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know the answer, it works as good as anything else. What I do in my personal time is my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That works, if you were just a coworker. But the five of us are a hell of a lot more than that.\u201d Peter closed in another step. \u201cWe love you, man. We always have, we always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d Ben felt like a vise was closing over his rib cage. Something was going to crack. \u201cI\u2019m not worth loving and you know it.\u201d</p><p>A look of pained compassion passed over Peter\u2019s face, but then it was gone and he shrugged. \u201cWell, tonight you\u2019re not. You\u2019re pretty much a piece of shit. But lucky I\u2019ve seen you on better days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat moment at the limo...I wanted to hurt her, Peter. Not like when I have her tied up and want to make her ass red. Not the good kind of hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you want to hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she makes me want things.\u201d Things he\u2019d taught himself not to want, viciously hammering down any yearning for them, because those things couldn\u2019t be trusted. They didn\u2019t stay, didn\u2019t last, and if he made himself vulnerable to them, they\u2019d become a black hole that would swallow him up.</p><p>\u201cLook at her, Peter. She\u2019s young, and perfect...\u201d Unspoiled. She was the face of what love was supposed to be. He knew everything about her, from every letter, from every word she\u2019d spoken, every expression he\u2019d seen cross her face. He didn\u2019t even deserve to be in the same room with her. \u201cWhat if I had really hurt her?\u201d Ben couldn\u2019t believe it, his voice broke. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt her, Peter. I really didn\u2019t. Goddamn it, I wish Max had broken my fucking neck.\u201d</p><p>He wished he\u2019d died on the streets before he\u2019d ever picked Jonas Kensington\u2019s pockets, anything to avoid the shame of what he\u2019d done tonight, becoming exactly what he\u2019d spent his childhood facing. Ugly faces, screwed up with hatred and anger, hard fists, grasping hands. All of them wanting the same thing. To drag everything down into the muck with them, to confirm that life was a living hell, nothing perfect out there they couldn\u2019t trash and destroy.</p><p>There was no such thing as love and compassion, light and hope. Not on the streets. And once the dirt of the streets was ground into his soul by the heels of everyone he\u2019d encountered, by supposed friends and unexpected foes, he was tainted.</p><p>Jesus, what the hell was he doing? He walked away, straight into an alley. When he realized he was facing a brick wall, he sat down on a pile of discarded packing pallets. Using the heels of his hands, he rubbed viciously at something that was dust in his eyes, damn it. His hands were shaking. No, he wasn\u2019t going to do this. He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He pushed back the noise, the memories, and when he surfaced, gasping like a swimmer, Peter was sitting next to him. Just a few inches between their hips and shoulders, but not touching.</p><p>No. He wasn\u2019t a fucking victim, someone who deserved compassion. He had manhandled a twenty-three-year-old girl, stomped on her spirit with the intent of crushing it. He saw himself shout those unforgivable words at her, saw each one hit her like bullets. Then he\u2019d left her bleeding, all for the crime of believing herself in love with him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be around her anymore. She pushes my buttons too hard. What if I hurt her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we kill you, dump you in the swamp and be done with it.\u201d Peter laid a hand on Ben\u2019s shoulder again, though Ben refused to look up from the hole he was staring into the filthy concrete ground. \u201cIf you truly believe that\u2019s a risk, you get help. Lance the boil, let the past come out and deal with it. Dana\u2019s counselor is a woman who\u2019s worked with countless vets with PTSD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are. You think because it happened when you were a kid on these streets, instead of in a desert a few thousand miles away, that it\u2019s so different?\u201d</p><p>Ben swallowed. He really didn\u2019t want to have this conversation. Everything in him was pulling away from it, but something kept him rooted. Marcie\u2019s wounded eyes, the fear he\u2019d put in her eyes. The past two years, the nights when nothing filled the ache except things he knew weren\u2019t the answer, things that merely made the ache worse in the long run.</p><p>\u201cAsking for help is the hardest thing for one of those guys to do. How can some fucking shrink sitting in her safe office, piping in Enya music, help you deal with the blood, the screams, the fucking noise in your head? The staring eyes of the dead, of the ones you feel like you let down? Of what you\u2019ve lost? But she can, Ben. Dana used to have nightmares all the time. Now she doesn\u2019t. We all have battlefields we\u2019ve survived, but until we make peace with them, we don\u2019t leave them behind. And your kind of battlefield? It can haunt you forever, keeping you from what you deserve.\u201d</p><p>Peter gripped his shoulder hard, drawing his eyes up to his face. \u201cYour parents didn\u2019t abandon you because you weren\u2019t worth loving, Ben. They abandoned you because they were assholes.\u201d</p><p>He definitely heard a rib crack from the pressure inside. When Peter sensed it, moving his touch to his nape, rubbing there, Ben swallowed. \u201cGet off me, you homo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know I\u2019ve always wanted to suck your monster dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood of you to finally admit it.\u201d</p><p>Peter eased up on the touch but stared him down. \u201cIf you love her, if you want her, you do whatever you have to do to deserve her. Because she\u2019s gone to an awful lot of trouble to prove she wants your sorry ass. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Rising, Ben rubbed a hand over his face. \u201cDon\u2019t know where I am on that. I\u2019ve got to go...to move. Don\u2019t follow me this time. I mean it. I need to work this shit out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you make me a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, we\u2019re girls now?\u201d</p><p>When Peter shifted, blocking his way out of the alley, Ben sighed. Yeah, he could get into a major brawl with him, but he\u2019d have to fight dirty to win, because fighting Peter was like facing a tank. Probably why Matt had sent him, knowing he was the only one Ben couldn\u2019t easily beat up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The gray eyes were steady, implacable. \u201cTell me you\u2019re not going to do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that kind of guy, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot usually, no. But I\u2019ve seen the look you\u2019ve got in your eyes. A guy so consumed with his demons he\u2019d throw himself on a mine to escape it. Then they send the little polished medal home to the people who love him. You\u2019ve got a lot of people who care about you, Ben. Don\u2019t do that to them. If you don\u2019t trust yourself tonight, then let me shadow you.\u201d</p><p>Ben sighed, looked back out in the darkness. \u201cFine, but keep a distance. I don\u2019t want anyone to think we\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chance of that. I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead dating an ambulance chaser.\u201d</p><p>Yes, these will make your ass bigger. But they will be worth it. Remember, a good friend will always tell you the truth. A great friend will validate your decision when you decide to do something stupid anyway.</p><p>Ben\u2019s note on a box of homemade truffles for Marcie\u2019s birthday</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Marcie woke at two a.m. She vaguely remembered being carried up to her bed by Lucas when he\u2019d gotten home and the party had broken up. She\u2019d almost immediately returned to a deep sleep, but it had been short-lived. A bad nightmare had sent her bolting out of the bed and practically into the wall. Cass was in the room with her in a flash, helping to calm her down. She hadn\u2019t had a nightmare in ages, but she guessed it made sense that it had happened tonight. She still hated it, because she didn\u2019t want anything about Ben tainted with that.</p><p>Her sister was still there, sleeping next to her, arm around Marcie\u2019s waist. Marcie studied her face, then leaned over, kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m going downstairs to get a snack,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMmph. Need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You go back to Lucas. He misses you. I\u2019m all right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay.\u201d But Cass slept on. Marcie smiled. Lucas would undoubtedly come find her himself before long. Slipping out of the bed, she pulled on her robe and slippers and shuffled down the steps, wincing only a little at the shock to her joints. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What surprised her was seeing Savannah asleep on their comfortable wide sofa, a body pillow firmly clasped between arms and legs. An afghan had been laid over her. In sleep, her face was far more relaxed, approachable. Remembering that earlier job offer, Marcie felt a frisson of warmth. She had great friends.</p><p>Because she saw Savannah, she was less surprised but not sure how to feel about seeing Matt in the kitchen. His laptop was open at the kitchen table, along with a couple files, but he was heating a kettle of water at the stove, three mugs laid out on the kitchen island.</p><p>It was rare she saw him in more casual attire, but it wasn\u2019t an unpleasant experience. The jeans fit well, the dark blue T-shirt stretching over his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard you up,\u201d he said. \u201cWant some hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t figure you for the hot-chocolate type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s for you and one\u2019s for Savannah. The third will be for Talia. She\u2019ll arrive as soon as she smells chocolate, no matter how deep she\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Marcie chuckled. \u201cYou know us pretty well.\u201d</p><p>Matt gestured to a stool at the kitchen island for Marcie to make herself comfortable. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Marcie shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Matt. Really. Is Ben okay?\u201d</p><p>When he glanced up at her, his brow furrowing, she dropped her attention to one of the mugs, turning it in her hands. \u201cI know you know what happened tonight. I also think... It would help if I understood more.\u201d She remembered again that glimpse of darkness in Ben\u2019s eyes, of a deep well that could swallow a soul whole. \u201cSavannah said you might talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain she didn\u2019t mean tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not doing anything, you\u2019re sort of not doing anything. At the moment.\u201d She knew she was treading on uncertain ground, but that rarely stopped her. She met his dark gaze. \u201cI can research a lot of things, but it\u2019s not the same as getting information right from the mind and perspective of the person who probably knows him best. You.\u201d</p><p>Matt considered her. \u201cYou\u2019re very forthright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told that\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you disregard that advice. However, I have another concern.\u201d He braced his hands on the counter. \u201cI asked how you are doing. You turned the conversation immediately to Ben\u2019s well-being. I hope you realize that your well-being is as important as his, particularly if this relationship is going to succeed.\u201d</p><p>She had the grace to flush a little. His tone was mild, but his expression wasn\u2019t. She\u2019d opened the door by being blunt, and he\u2019d shifted into the role of patriarch.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you won\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>Matt studied her an instant longer. \u201cBring me the chocolate and marshmallows from the pantry.\u201d</p><p>She immediately moved to do that. Standing next to him at the island, she emptied the powder into the mugs at his direction, stirred as he poured her cup. \u201cYou know how Ben came into our family,\u201d he said at last. \u201cNot the official story about growing up in New England, et cetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Matt nodded, his lips quirking. \u201cBecause our ladies do tend to share secrets with one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fair\u2019s fair.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a full smile at that. Gesturing her onto the stool next to him, he steadied it until she was situated. Then he sobered. \u201cThose first several years, he didn\u2019t like to be touched by anyone. Not men or women. It was obvious he trusted neither one, and I\u2019m sure he experienced the expected list of atrocities a child on the street faces.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d straightened, turning to lean against the counter next to her. Her slippered feet brushed against his jeans leg, but he didn\u2019t discourage the casual contact. Marcie was glad, because in the aftermath of the night\u2019s events, and imagining the dark picture he was painting, the tactile connection was reassuring. \u201cBut the real wounds he carried were chronic betrayals, inflicted by everyone who mattered in his life. It was a long time before he learned to relax enough to enjoy the camaraderie you see between him and the other men now. But that\u2019s not the only difference.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perhaps a sign of a divine plan that Lucas ended up as head of your household. He transitioned from losing his parents to an optimal adopted family early on, so optimal there\u2019s even a genetic resemblance between them. I\u2019m not saying he doesn\u2019t remember the loss, but he had a strong familial structure to take its place fairly quickly. That\u2019s rare, but it gives him a stability that holds fast through everything. I saw it when we met at Yale. I was a few years late attending, because I had to take over my father\u2019s business, but that was a fortuitous delay, since it gained me Lucas as a roommate.\u201d</p><p>Matt brushed her hair from her face, a gentle touch. \u201cThe code of morality that we observe, toward women, business, service in our community...that was a code that already existed for Lucas and myself, Jon and Peter. It drew us together, and we deepened that bond in our daily actions.\u201d He met Marcie\u2019s gaze. \u201cBen needed that structure because he had lived entirely without it. Our code became a lifeline to what he was meant to be, instead of the scavenger he\u2019d had to become. It defines him. When he lost control earlier tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pushed him. I was topping\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. There was a reason the other men deferred to Matt. Her words froze in her throat at the look on his face. \u201cWhat happened is entirely on Ben\u2019s shoulders,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHe knows it, we all know it. If you want to be with him, Marcie, do not ever excuse a loss of control like that.</p><p>\u201cYes, topping from the bottom can be dangerous, because it mixes up who is holding the physical and emotional control, and it\u2019s important that the Dom keep a calm hand on those reins at all times, because of how intense a session can become. However, what I just said about our code...for Peter, Jon, Lucas and myself, it is an ideal, however vital we consider it. For Ben, it\u2019s an imperative. If you love him, you hold him to it, always. With the exception of Peter, within the confines of military action, none of us have lived lives governed completely by violence. Ben has.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. He was waiting on her answer, and while he wasn\u2019t her Master, she knew exactly how to respond. \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>Matt nodded. \u201cBen has another side of that same coin, which is why he will be harder on himself about what happened tonight than anyone. He has no tolerance for an attack on an innocent. If he had been part of your life the night Jeremy\u2019s friend attacked you, that friend would be dead. His body would be lost in the bayou, never to be found, and Ben wouldn\u2019t lose a night of sleep over cutting his throat.\u201d</p><p>Marcie blinked. \u201cAre you trying to scare me away from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You asked me a question, and I\u2019m giving you an answer. You\u2019re very young.\u201d</p><p>She scowled, automatic resentment rising in her breast. Here it went. The \u201cyou\u2019re so young\u201d speech.</p><p>\u201cMarcie.\u201d He had that authoritative gaze fixed on her again. \u201cDrop the attitude. It\u2019s a simple fact. You don\u2019t have a lot of life experience to bring to a situation like this, the things I\u2019ve described. Correct?\u201d</p><p>She gave a grudging nod.</p><p>\u201cRight. So you need to consider it carefully. Are you ready to handle that type of man, something entirely separate from your feelings for him? You may want to negotiate a million-dollar contract, but do you step into the room before you have the resources to handle it?\u201d</p><p>She watched him pour more hot water, then patiently take up a spoon and stir a mug of chocolate for his wife. He had large hands, but they moved capably over the task. Savannah might be impatient with Matt\u2019s coddling, but the Tennyson CEO understood it. They all did. Savannah\u2019s mother had died as a result of her pregnancy. Though it was because of a virulent cancer that she\u2019d refused to have treated to protect her unborn child, there was a lingering legacy there. Under Matt\u2019s collar, Savannah often wore the locket left to her by her mother. The past was important.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t dictate choices. Cass had taught her that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can handle him, but it\u2019s not that kind of decision.\u201d There was no going back now. Not for her. \u201cFrom the moment we met, I knew I was his. That\u2019s who I want to be. So I have to figure it out, you know? Jon said it could only happen if I was myself, so that\u2019s got to be enough.\u201d She drew herself up. \u201cI think it is.\u201d</p><p>Matt pursed his lips, nodded. \u201cConsidering how long you have pursued him, I think your argument is credible. It\u2019s also fueled by the passion of youth which, in this case, is not a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>When he pushed her mug closer to her, reminding her the chocolate was starting to cool, she saw the ceramic had a picture of a cat on it, one with a comically disagreeable face, a fly sitting on its whisker. It made her lips twitch.</p><p>She looked up at him then. He was still stirring, so she had the pleasure of studying the aristocratic bone structure of his face, the set of his mouth. Though none of the Knights shared their women outside their own circle, Savannah stayed pretty exclusive to Matt and him to her, except for indulging some soft pleasures within the group\u2014like the women had done tonight. She wanted to ask about that, and about a million other questions, but she figured she\u2019d wait until another time. Or seek other sources for the information. Best not to poke the lead wolf with a stick.</p><p>\u201cI used to go crazy, reading the society pages,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWhenever they hooked him up with someone for a charity event, or reported seeing him \u2018with\u2019 Miss So-n-So, I\u2019d think\u2014what will I do if someone gets him first? If one day I open up the paper and see his engagement notice?\u201d</p><p>Matt arched a brow. \u201cDid you have a plan to handle that eventuality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It involved a shovel and a remote location.\u201d</p><p>Matt chuckled, heaping marshmallows in the top of Savannah\u2019s mug. \u201cYou and Ben may be a useful combination, if I ever need to be permanently rid of a competitor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It made her grin at him. Lifting the hot chocolate, he gave her a wink, moved into the other room. When she followed him, she saw his timing was as uncanny as usual. Savannah was sitting up, restless from the discomfort of being on one side too long. She gave him a cranky look.</p><p>\u201cI am exactly where I was when you checked on me thirty minutes ago. Oh except I had the baby. She slid right out, and now she\u2019s off somewhere playing with electrical sockets and curtain cords.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I\u2019ll lose my deposit on that birthing suite at the hospital. Maybe we can just go there for a vacation stay and cancel that private island resort we\u2019ve reserved for the fall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t reserved the entire wing so I\u2019ll have the undivided attention of every obstetrician in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I didn\u2019t?\u201d He gave her a lingering look, so full of warmth and gentle devotion that Savannah shook her head, a soft smile crossing her face. She glanced at Marcie.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hopeless.\u201d</p><p>Hopelessly in love with his wife. It made Marcie ache and yearn...and hope.</p><p>Ben made sure he came into the office a bare few minutes before the nine o\u2019clock staff meeting. He didn\u2019t want to chat over coffee or any other bullshit. He\u2019d given Peter the slip about thirty minutes after their heart-to-heart in the alley. Yeah, it had been a crappy thing to do, but Peter needed to get home to Dana, and Ben didn\u2019t need a nursemaid. While the mushy moment hadn\u2019t been faked, it had made it easier to fool Peter into thinking Ben accepted being followed. One of the few times he\u2019d been able to outwit the shrewd former captain.</p> <p>His head was pounding from whatever toxic brew he\u2019d poured down his throat in some of New Orleans\u2019 seedier dives throughout the weekend. He vaguely remembered getting into it in a pool hall with a trio of guys wearing a lot of biker leather. His ribs still hurt from being knocked down and kicked, but he didn\u2019t really remember much other than that. Except the guys being pretty affable about it, propping him up in the alley and watching over him until he regained consciousness. The biggest guy had even spotted him another beer, making the laconic comment, \u201cShe fucked you up, pal. Women\u2019ll do that. Go on home before you get yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>Since he didn\u2019t remember talking to anyone about Marcie, he supposed it was just an educated guess. Bikers could be pretty astute that way.</p><p>He barely nodded to Janet, went to his office, found the file he needed on his desk. Which either meant Janet had taken over Marcie\u2019s duties, or Marcie herself had come in and set it out. He\u2019d had her reassigned, but she could be in the building. The very thought of it made his head hurt worse.</p><p>When he was sitting in the alley with the biker, deciding whether he\u2019d sleep there and let someone steal his wallet, or struggle to his feet and find his way to the nearest hotel to hide out for the weekend, his thoughts had gone back to earlier in the night. Before the limo. She\u2019d embraced the CNC treatment, but ultimately what she\u2019d been seeking was that intense connection, the emotional input that promised a soul had a match in this world. It was the way she\u2019d been from the very beginning, the first time he\u2019d met her, when she was sixteen and not even on his sphere as a lover.</p><p>Friday night he\u2019d felt that desire from her, overriding everything else, even the physical. The problem was, he\u2019d felt it right back, and the more he\u2019d felt it, the more he\u2019d felt like a tiger trapped in a cage he didn\u2019t want opened. She just kept pushing and pushing. If he\u2019d seen it through the way he should have, he would have sent her spinning through subspace, fucked her brains out.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have left her aftercare to the staff though. He\u2019d have wrapped a blanket around her, held her as her teeth chattered and she shook, the effect of getting so deep in that zone, a place he could have gone with her, totally into topspace. Instead he\u2019d been unable to leave his own fucking headspace, his anger, his frustration, his lack of balance. He\u2019d had no business even touching her that night.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t a chickenshit, though. He\u2019d do his penance today, get past it. Get back to what he knew how to be. Marcie would finish her internship and head to Milan, because that\u2019s where she belonged. It should be clear to her after last night. Everything fucking the way it fucking should be.</p><p>As he came into the conference room ten minutes later, he bit back an oath. He was hoping Janet would be set up to transcribe, a buffer to anything too personal, but it was just Peter all by his lonesome. He was in his usual relaxed sprawl, but with an expression that said he was going to give him shit about ditching his tail. Hell, Ben needed coffee before he did this.</p><p>He dropped the folder on the table, gave Peter an even, don\u2019t-fuck-with-me look, and turned right into Lucas\u2019 fist.</p><p>For all that he razzed Lucas about being a pussy-cyclist, the guy had a hammer of a right punch. It practically lifted him off his feet, knocked him back onto the conference table. He deserved it, but he wasn\u2019t going down defenseless. As he rolled and came back to his feet, ready to counter, Peter was already there, dragging him back while Jon and Matt did the honors with Lucas.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you?\u201d Lucas snarled. \u201cI swear to God, I\u2019m going to put my foot so far up your ass you choke on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t supposed to come to the club. She was supposed to be bluffing.\u201d Where the hell had that knee-jerk, dumbass response come from? Damn, he needed coffee.</p><p>When Lucas\u2019 blue eyes turned into ice frost from the Antarctic, Matt and Jon let him go. \u201cFor that, you get a free one,\u201d Matt decided.</p><p>Peter had let him go as well, but Ben was still seeing stars. Lucas got in another face punch and a gut shot before Matt and Jon pulled him back again. Ben was fervently glad he\u2019d already puked up most of last night\u2019s intake in the hotel room. If he threw up on the boardroom carpet, Janet would make him clean every fiber with a toothbrush.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pinning the blame on her for what you dished out? A twenty-three-year-old inexperienced sub who showed up where you didn\u2019t expect her to be? Let me go,\u201d Lucas told Matt and Jon. \u201cI\u2019m going to fucking rip his head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our lawyer,\u201d Jon reminded him. \u201cHe can\u2019t get you off a murder rap if he\u2019s the victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may be inexperienced, but she\u2019s a sub, deep as they come,\u201d Ben said, surging against Peter\u2019s iron grip. \u201cFriday, it was going to be me, or whoever she grabbed at the club. They were ten deep for that feeding trough. No one outside this fucking room is going to touch her, goddamn it. Not while I\u2019m breathing.\u201d</p><p>He came to a full stop with that shouted declaration, feeling the shock of it reverberate off the walls and through his bones, settling into his gut. All heads turned toward him, four sets of eyes assessing, measuring. No. He wasn\u2019t that kind of Master. He wasn\u2019t possessive. He fucked women, let them go. Until last night. When he couldn\u2019t bear to see another Master\u2019s hands on what every blood cell in his body roared was his. Noah had been different, a sub under his command, a different tool, like the cane or rawhide.</p><p>He\u2019d told Peter he needed to work it out, but he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d chosen alcohol and fists instead. Now he\u2019d just blurted it out, bald as a naked newborn.</p><p>He struggled to be reasonable, calm. Sort of. \u201cI told her I was mentoring her,\u201d he said. \u201cJust her mentor.\u201d</p><p>The words sounded hollow, absurd. Weak. With a sudden weary sigh, he folded into a chair, nursing his aching temples and now his busted jaw. Lucas might have broken it. That\u2019d be great, a lawyer with his mouth wired shut. The world would celebrate.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Lucas demanded. \u201cSpill it, Ben. Give me a reason to hit you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas.\u201d Matt put a quelling hand on the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBen. Tell us what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her,\u201d Ben mumbled, so quietly that he didn\u2019t think they\u2019d heard. Until he raised his gaze to Lucas\u2019 frozen features. \u201cI want her,\u201d he repeated more strongly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to, but she wouldn\u2019t give up, and she got to me. It\u2019s all fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put this on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Ben leaped back to his feet, but Peter was there, steadying him. \u201cDamn it, she\u2019s been nothing but what she should be. Beautiful, generous, full of life. It crept up on me. I thought if I scared her off...she\u2019d be okay. I...It went too far. I just wanted her to find someone better for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, she wants you just as much, Ben,\u201d Jon observed. \u201cIt was a damn fool thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe woke up screaming Friday night,\u201d Lucas said. He was quieter now, but the harshness was still around his mouth, anger in his eyes. \u201cA nightmare about when Jeremy\u2019s friend attacked her. She hasn\u2019t had one of those in years. Cass slept in her room.\u201d</p><p>Goddamn it. Yeah, they should let Lucas go. In fact, they should all beat him to a bloody pulp and then toss him out the window to hit the asphalt below. A hundred broken bones wouldn\u2019t hit him as hard as those few words.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Ben sat back down in the chair, wouldn\u2019t let himself look down, no matter how hard it was to meet Lucas\u2019 eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lucas. You\u2019re right. It was unforgivable.\u201d</p><p>The CFO\u2019s face remained unreadable for several moments, then his jaw eased a fraction. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It is fucked up. But I\u2019m not the one you owe an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s the one,\u201d Jon said quietly, \u201cyou can\u2019t push her away, Ben. You know that. Why are you trying so hard?\u201d</p><p>Ben couldn\u2019t answer that. He just looked out the window. He didn\u2019t want to go there, didn\u2019t want to say it. But of course they knew. They\u2019d always known. He just didn\u2019t want that shit dredged up. He wondered if he could make it to the door and escape, but Peter had casually shifted in front of it, anticipating him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBen, look at me,\u201d Matt said. He had his firm, cool voice, the one that brooked no bullshit.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t. \u201cShe\u2019s everything I\u2019m not. She\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one thing that can clean a man\u2019s soul is surrendering to a woman\u2019s love, Ben,\u201d Jon said. \u201cYou just have to give her the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we saw how I dealt with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re fighting it. You\u2019re fighting yourself.\u201d</p><p>Matt took a step closer, and Ben felt that old terror, the one of being hemmed in. \u201cBen, look at me.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was the matter with him? He always met a man\u2019s eyes. But the part of him rising up, trying to choke him, reminded him of the uncomfortable moment with Peter last night. When he at last forced himself to meet those dark eyes, Matt was standing right in front of him. He put his hand on Ben\u2019s shoulder, fingers tightening. \u201cYou can choose to be a chickenshit bastard who runs away from a gift because you\u2019re scared it\u2019s going to abandon you one day, just like your parents. Or betray you, like pretty much everyone did when you were growing up. That decision will eat you like a cancer, but you can drink yourself into liver disease and beat that to the punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds swell. Option two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to come out of the cold, Ben. You were a child, fighting to stay alive on the streets, and you did what you had to do. You deserve love. Do the hardest thing a Master can do. Get your shit straight and accept the gift. Take the risk, the first step. Is she the one you want more than anything, now and forever?\u201d</p><p>Matt really did have his father\u2019s eyes, so much it was sometimes like the son was channeling the sire. Not a bad thing, despite the fact the thought reeked of Jon\u2019s New-Age bullshit. Long ago, when Ben was a kid, he\u2019d woken up in the Kensington guest bedroom screaming. Matt\u2019s dad had calmed him down, brought him cookies. Didn\u2019t make him talk, but Ben had talked anyway. When he\u2019d settled down, Jonas had given him a brief hug, a squeeze of his shoulders. Ben had tensed, but that was all Jonas had done. The man had left the lamp on low setting so Ben didn\u2019t have to go back to sleep in the dark.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she is. I want her.\u201d He wanted to say more, but if he was going to do that, he wanted to say it to Marcie. She deserved that, and way more.</p><p>\u201cGod help her.\u201d Peter\u2019s lips twitched. He stepped up to Matt\u2019s side.</p><p>Ben rose, a self-defense measure. \u201cOh Jesus. Tell me this isn\u2019t a hugging moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a hugging moment.\u201d Then Peter gave him one of his bear hugs anyway, the kind where the monster squeezed his ribs and slapped his back to the point of pain, therefore making Ben still feel manly. When he released him, Peter put his hand on Ben\u2019s face in a brotherly gesture of affection, shoved it away so his neck popped. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dumbass.\u201d</p><p>Matt returned to the head of the table, gesturing to all of them to take their seats. After a moment, Lucas took his usual place at Matt\u2019s right, though he continued to regard Ben with an undecided expression. Ben had a futile wish for his coffee, but settled for taking a couple deep breaths and sitting down again. He wasn\u2019t sure how the hell he was going to concentrate on business after all that, but he needn\u2019t have worried. Matt had rewritten the agenda.</p><p>\u201cYou owe Marcie amends,\u201d Matt said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most critical consequence of your actions. But you also owe us. This circle is bound by a code, and you broke that code.\u201d</p><p>Oh hell. But Matt was right. Jesus, he wanted penance, wanted to do something to purge this shit from his soul, the look he\u2019d put on Marcie\u2019s face. He had to fix it with her, but he also had to make it right with them. With Lucas.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He nodded, straightened. \u201cWhatever you think is fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking you cry like a little girl,\u201d Lucas said acidly, but there was a different set to his face now, one that said he might be forgiven. A few years from now. After a lot of groveling.</p><p>When they made their decision, Ben actually felt like bursting into tears. But he swallowed jagged glass, took it like a man. He deserved it, after all. Hard as accepting their ruling was, it was going to be worse, figuring out how to make it up to Marcie. But now that he\u2019d accepted it...</p><p>He wanted her. He\u2019d said it out loud, in front of all of them. It filled him with a strange sense of anticipation, reminding him of when each of them had come to this table, determined to make a chosen woman his. He\u2019d spent so much time denying her, pushing her away, but he let it unfold now, looked at it from several different directions. Come in out of the cold. He felt like he was standing in the middle of a room where he\u2019d cautiously opened a window, and then another...maybe one more. Letting the sunlight pour in.</p><p>I want her. I need her. If he hadn\u2019t fucked it up totally, she might consider being okay with that.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m nearly a decade older than she is,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cWhen she\u2019s turning forty, I\u2019ll be hitting fifty.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded. \u201cYou know Rachel is thirteen years older than me. We\u2019ve dealt with those issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does she deal with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s harder for a woman than a man. Some days she gets a little moody about it. But I point out that when I\u2019m eighty and she\u2019s ninety-three, we\u2019ll both be on walkers and mixing up our teeth in the morning water glasses.\u201d A smile touched Jon\u2019s lips. \u201cWe never really grow beyond a certain age. We\u2019re all the same inside, our desires, our needs. We just get better impulse control.</p><p>Peter slanted Ben a grin. \u201cWell, most of us get better impulse control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d</p><p>Jon waved the banter aside. \u201cBen, if you were fifty and Marcie was twenty-three, you\u2019d be having the obvious epiphany about your mortality, trying to sate it in fancy cars and young girls, but that\u2019s not what this is. You\u2019re thirty-two and in love with an intelligent, vibrant woman nine years younger than you.\u201d His blue eyes twinkled then. \u201cAnd Peter\u2019s right. You\u2019re emotionally immature for your age. Marcie is extraordinarily mature for hers, so you\u2019re a perfect fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said you told her I never grew beyond age thirteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes you emotional jailbait,\u201d Peter pointed out.</p><p>Ben shook his head, rose, went to the window. With his usual impeccable timing, Matt started hitting on today\u2019s business. Since the legal stuff wasn\u2019t relevant for the first couple agenda items, it gave him a strategic moment to take a breath. They\u2019d give him that. They were his friends, after all. His family.</p><p>He thought about how Marcie had walked into his office on those killer legs, with that come-hither smile playing around her lips. More than that, he remembered her eyes. Determined, playful...nervous. He\u2019d picked up on the active submissive in that first instance, and it ran bone deep in her. So to do what she\u2019d done, shoving herself at him like that...it had to have been hard.</p><p>A submissive woman was often strong and driven in her career, but in the bedroom she yearned to submit, to surrender. Marcie had combined her mundane persona with her D/s one, and that was a stress. He\u2019d seen it when she broke outside his front door and pelted his windows with rocks. She was pushed to the limits, and he\u2019d pushed her there. While he did that regularly as a Dom, he didn\u2019t usually do it as a man, causing that kind of pain.</p><p>He\u2019d deal with that. This time he really had to wrap his head around it, so he didn\u2019t screw up again. He\u2019d spent so much time vacillating, sending out mixed signals, and he couldn\u2019t do that anymore. She deserved better from her Master. If he could just step away from his fucked-up head, he could work it through. Normally, he used the topspace he found as a Dom to help him with that, but he wanted his next session, every future session, to be with her, so it was a chicken and egg dilemma.</p><p>He was going in circles like a damn hamster. He wanted to go to her, talk to her. Right now. He didn\u2019t want to wait another minute. This wasn\u2019t a legal case he had to prepare. It had to be raw, from the heart, pure instinct. They could do without him in the meeting.</p><p>Lucas\u2019 cell rang with the ringtone he used for Cassandra. Urgent by Foreigner. Ben glanced over his shoulder as Lucas picked it up. Maybe Cass was letting him know how Marcie was doing. Maybe Lucas would hand him the phone and Cass would tell him how Marcie was doing. Yeah right. As pissed as Lucas had been, Ben had a feeling it would take a truckload of diamonds to earn Cass\u2019 forgiveness. Even then, he\u2019d probably have to hide behind the truck\u2019s steel reinforced cab. Cass kept a Beretta, after all.</p><p>\u201cHey, Marcie.\u201d Lucas\u2019 obvious surprise at finding Marcie on the line disappeared as his grip on the phone tightened, his eyes darkening with pain. \u201cWhen? Okay. Are you with her? Okay. Just stay with her and the others. I\u2019ll be right there. Let me talk to her.\u201d</p><p>He shifted the phone to the other hand as the men rose, already anticipating the somber news. \u201cCassie? It\u2019s all right, baby. I know. I\u2019m so sorry. I love you. I\u2019m on my way. You keep Marcie and the kids with you, all right? I\u2019ll be there in a few minutes, promise.\u201d</p><p>As he clicked off, Lucas met Jon\u2019s eyes. \u201cJeremy died in Thailand early this morning.\u201d</p><p>I went to visit Jeremy at spring break. He was good, different. He\u2019s thin, looks like an old man, and he talks slow, moves slow. But when he looks at me, he sees me, he\u2019s no longer strung out. He took my hand, held it. Sat with me on a stone bench and we looked at the mist-covered mountains outside the temple together. He didn\u2019t say he was sorry, because it was as if he knew it wasn\u2019t needed anymore. That wasn\u2019t the same Jeremy. I cried all the way home on the plane. It felt bad to cry, but as much as I hated who he became on the drugs, he still isn\u2019t the brother I used to have. I guess I hoped I\u2019d get him back at some point. I was grieving him on the trip home as if he was actually dead. Please don\u2019t ever tell Cass I said that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Letter from Marcie to Ben, late sophomore year</p><p>All your secrets are safe with me, brat. Things change. You\u2019re a different person to him as well. You just need to figure out what you can be to one another now. When Jonas was killed, Matt and I didn\u2019t know each other well. I even resented him a little bit for being the real son of the only guy who was ever a decent father figure to me. But something inside said this was a relationship I didn\u2019t want to throw away. Look deeper, and you might find something in Jeremy of equal or even greater value than what you lost. Things happen for a reason.</p><p>Ben\u2019s response</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Jeremy was cremated in Thailand. While Lucas and Cass were there with Marcie, coordinating the arrangements, Jon and Rachel stayed with the children. Ben, Peter and Matt covered Lucas and Jon\u2019s workload at the office. Savannah handled phone calls and correspondence with family and friends.</p><p>Ben sent a wire transfer to their bank agent in Chiang Mai, a generous donation from all five of the K&amp;A men, a sincere thanks to the clinic and the monks for the physical and spiritual care they\u2019d given the troubled young man. Jeremy had come to them addicted to drugs and on death\u2019s door. The experimental clinic in Thailand recommended by Jon had given his body the additional years, but the monks\u2019 teachings and guidance had given his spirit renewed life Cassandra believed would be eternal. Ben hoped it was true. Lost souls needed all the help they could get, after all.</p><p>Even long distance, Marcie was working with Jessica to manage the memorial service details. He\u2019d learned that through Peter, since Dana had been chosen to perform the service. It was to be held at Lucas and Cassandra\u2019s plantation home on the outskirts of New Orleans. The sprawling grounds had a manmade lake fed by the marsh tributaries, lots of garden paths to walk, and a back lawn flanked by ancient oaks, the perfect setting.</p><p>He\u2019d been working long hours, taking the lion\u2019s share of Lucas\u2019 work, even when the others protested. \u201cI owe him,\u201d he said briefly, and Matt let it go at that. Part of his self-imposed penance. The extra work helped the gnawing ache he had over other things as well. He was worried about Marcie, sure she was pushing herself too hard to support Cass and Lucas, trying to handle every detail in Thailand and at home. He checked in with Dana and Savannah regularly, confirming they and Jess were pulling everything off her shoulders that she\u2019d let them take.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been able to resolve things with his girl before she left. If things had been fixed between them, he could have sent daily emails to her phone with more personal words of encouragement, comfort, things to make her smile. Instead, he found a card service that created unique, artistic digital bouquets, and sent her one daily, with basic notes. Thinking of you. Miss you. I\u2019m here for you. That one mocked him, because until they had a face-to-face, there was a lot of debris that told her the exact opposite. Damn it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply to them, but he saw the acknowledgments, knew she opened them all. He didn\u2019t need her to reply, didn\u2019t want to take up energy she needed for other things. The acknowledgment was enough. That\u2019s what he told himself, even as he told himself not to be an idiot and get caught up in a paranoid scenario where she wasn\u2019t replying because he\u2019d lost her forever.</p><p>He sent two real bouquets the day they arrived back into town, one for Marcie, one for Cass. The card to Marcie said simply, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. For everything. Will talk to you soon.\u201d Cass\u2019 card had the appropriate condolences from a family friend. Now wasn\u2019t the time for him to seek her forgiveness. Forgiveness was a selfish thing to ask during something like this.</p><p>While he wished the reason had been different, the separation had given him time to think things through. He was steadier now. Stronger perhaps, or at least on the right path to it. Though he wanted Marcie with an urgency that bordered on painful, he wasn\u2019t going to screw it up again. Timing was everything.</p><p>Hell. He was late, despite breaking every traffic law to get there on time. He\u2019d told Matt and Peter to go straight to the service while he went into the office to finish up a document for Lucas that needed to be filed today, and it had taken longer than expected. Crossing the back lawn quietly, he leaned against a tree a few feet back from the back row of chairs. It wasn\u2019t a large crowd, mostly family and close friends, like Steve Pickard and his wife, here to support Cassandra and her siblings. Jeremy hadn\u2019t had anyone in his life in the States not associated with his life as an addict. As Ben well knew, those kinds of acquaintances weren\u2019t attend-your-funeral types.</p><p>Though mindful of the reason they were all gathered, he couldn\u2019t help but seek out a glimpse of Marcie first. There. In the front row, her slim back even more fragile to him in the somber black, smooth hair in a barrette, the delicate line of her neck etched as she attended what Dana was saying. Her body leaned into Cass\u2019, giving comfort.</p><p>He turned his gaze to the podium, decorated with a beautiful spray of yellow lilies and purple iris. Dana stood on a step behind it so she was tall enough to be seen by the gathering. It was different, seeing Dana in her minister\u2019s robe, but her spiritual calling had always rested comfortably on her shoulders, despite the private side of her that some might say didn\u2019t mesh with a Christian message. Ben guessed it depended on how a person defined being a Christian.</p><p>Dana could be mischievous, playful, downright kinky and irrepressible. She also had a lake of calm inside her, a deep understanding of people\u2019s spiritual struggles in the face of physical and emotional adversity. She\u2019d faced it firsthand herself with her injuries in Iraq. Her ministerial skills had already won her a loyal following at her New Orleans church, and they showed now, in her gentle but honest treatment of Jeremy\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cOver six years ago, Jeremy came to the monastery door a troubled soul. Addicted to drugs, terminally ill, lost in every way one of us can be lost. But God opens doors for us throughout our lives, and Jeremy finally stepped through one that was offered. The monks told his sisters that he\u2019d learned to be a kind and humble soul, always willing to help with their daily tasks when he had the strength to do so.</p><p>\u201cOn his good days, he helped them in the garden. Cass and Marcie visited a patch of vegetables that he\u2019d sown and watered. Each day, even if he was too weak to do anything else, he would make his way down to that small patch of ground to care for it.\u201d</p><p>Ben turned his gaze back to Marcie. Marcie had her arm around Nate, just entering his teen years, and Jess was between Talia and Cherry, holding them close to her sides. When Marcie\u2019s head turned enough for him to see her profile, she looked composed but tired. He could see the strain. She\u2019d been doing what they were all doing. Attending to whatever details needed to be handled, trying to make things easier for Cass. They all knew what a blow this was for her, and now Dana hit that one straight on.</p><p>The blind woman tilted her head. She was wearing dark glasses, a way to keep her fixed gaze from being distracting, but they also gave the impression she was passing her glance over the assembled. \u201cMarcie told me that, for all the love his family gave him, it was his older sister Cass who never failed Jeremy, no matter the pain and suffering his actions sometimes brought upon the family. She always loved him, as love is meant to be. Just, true and honest.\u201d She looked toward Cass then, unfailing in her direction. \u201cCass, as such, your siblings wanted me to conclude this service by reading 1 Corinthians 13. In your honor. They\u2019re certain Jeremy would agree.\u201d</p><p>Ben watched Cass\u2019 shoulders quiver and then buckle. Lucas\u2019 arm tightened around her, his head bending over hers. Marcie pressed her temple hard to her sister\u2019s as the words were read.</p><p>Ben kept his gaze fixed on Marcie, the tears that ran down that side of her face, the brittle expression, as Dana spoke the powerful words.</p> <p>\u201cIf I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing... Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; ...it bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things...\u201d</p><p>He should be sitting with her, as Matt was with Savannah, Jon with Rachel...Lucas with Cass. The front row of chairs had been for Jeremy\u2019s immediate family. There were a line of chairs right behind them for the K&amp;A family and Steve Pickard, Cass\u2019 extended family. The single empty chair at the end was one he was sure Peter had kept open for him if he wanted to sit with them. He\u2019d stayed back here, though, and not just because he was late and didn\u2019t want to be disruptive. He\u2019d been listening, watching, looking...for something.</p><p>He drew a breath, a deep, slow one. When he was mastering a sub, everything went away but his body and her body. There was one singular focus, one intent, everything clear, nothing hidden or obscured. This moment felt like that. Everyone\u2019s focus on the minister, the quiet, tranquil surroundings, but there was a straight line between him and Marcie, connecting them. For the first time he put his hand on it, felt the tautness that confirmed it was tight and true, a true binding. Just waiting for him to have the courage to grasp it. To fight for it.</p><p>As the service concluded, people started filing back into the house for the hors d\u2019oeuvres and to give the family their condolences. Matt saw him, nodded. Ben acknowledged him but stayed where he was. Matt understood, continuing to escort Savannah toward the house, Talia now under his other arm. Nate and the other siblings likewise had fallen in among the guys, or with Steve Pickard and his wife.</p><p>Marcie had turned Cass over to Lucas, but she stayed by her chair, watching them all leave. At first, he thought she knew he was there, but then he realized she didn\u2019t. She looked too alone, too lost in her head. Once everyone was well on their way, she turned and walked away.</p><p>He followed her. She went to the end of a finger dock at the manmade lake, stepping out of her black heels to sit down. Putting her feet in the water, she braced her hands on the rough planking. Taking off his own shoes and socks, he rolled up the legs of his trousers, and then came up behind her, putting a brief hand on her shoulder to warn her of his presence before he sat down next to her, trailing his feet in the water next to hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She kept looking down into the water, the mild wind keeping it rippling with movement. After seeing her in outfits that taunted and teased him beyond bearing, it was unexpected to realize she was even more beautiful to him like this. Her face pale but quiet, her hair drawn back from her face, the dark modest dress against soft skin. She looked both older than expected, and yet more vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cIf you could meet God and ask him one question, what would it be?\u201d She had a wistful, sad look, and he knew he\u2019d do anything to make her feel better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask him if there was anything in the world that hadn\u2019t been done, that hadn\u2019t happened. Not the significant obvious stuff, like world peace. The urban legend kind of thing, what people claim has happened before, but no one is certain about it. Like someone sitting down on the toilet and finding a snake in there.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to look at him, her brows raised. \u201cYou ass,\u201d she said, and then she started laughing.</p><p>Extraordinary. That was the word Jon had used about her maturity, but it fit so much more about her. He couldn\u2019t help touching her face, but when he did, she stopped laughing. As she lifted a hand, hesitant, he waited on her. He knew it wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t sure of his permission. She wasn\u2019t sure of herself, of what she wanted. What he\u2019d done to her, the hurt, was still too close. He had to let her choose. Which meant he also had to swallow down the disappointment when she closed her hand into a fist, lowered it to her lap again. \u201cWhat would you really ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the presence of God, all questions are supposed to be answered, right? At least that\u2019s what I\u2019d hope.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you believed in God. Not specifically. I figured you were more of an agnostic, if not a complete atheist, because of how things went when you were little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my mother left me in an alley, I was wearing a plastic rosary with a pressed shamrock pendant, suggesting she was Irish Catholic. Guess that\u2019s the only reason she didn\u2019t abort me. Or maybe she didn\u2019t want to waste the cash she could use on her drug habit.\u201d He shrugged before she could say anything to that. \u201cWhen Jonas nabbed me for picking his pocket, he didn\u2019t turn me in to the cops. He found me a decent foster home. He checked in on me, made sure I went to school. A lot of things happened in my life, good and bad, but now I\u2019m pretty well off. I worked my ass off for that, but certain things had to happen at the right moments to get me on the right track. It makes sense there\u2019s something out there that will help you, if you\u2019re willing to be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if love is staring you right in the face, it\u2019d be kind of stupid to turn your back on it, right?\u201d</p><p>Touch\u00e9, love. But before he could think of a proper answer to that, she spoke again. \u201cI got your flowers. The bouquet. Forget-me-nots. But I don\u2019t want to talk about that right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She sat silently for a few minutes, gazing at the minnows clustering around her toes. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I was thinking about this today. It was so long ago, and it seems somehow disrespectful, with how much further Jeremy came by the end, but I was remembering that night.\u201d Her shoulder jerked, a tic, and his brow furrowed when he saw it.</p><p>\u201cAllen, that was his name. I was thirteen, didn\u2019t know anything. He was nineteen, and he came into my room, started flirting, but then he got mean and pushy. I was screaming for help, and he was tearing at my clothes, and all I could think was, \u2018why isn\u2019t Jeremy helping me?\u2019 I never thought...when I realized that he\u2019d been sitting in the other room, too stoned to even pay attention...\u201d</p><p>Ben put a hand over hers on the dock. He wanted to hold her, but recent and past history was pressing in too close, so he settled for that overlap of fingers. Hers were cold. She stared down at them. \u201cCassie got home just in time, pulled him off me. God, she was... I think about it now, and she was incredible. It was like watching a bear go after something attacking her cubs. A nineteen-year-old guy taller and heavier than she was and she pretty much kicked the crap out of him. All the shit I gave her growing up...and she was always there. But even after that, she loved Jeremy, just as much as she loved all of us.\u201d Her voice trembled. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s ever going to get over not being able to save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will. Because she\u2019s got you. And Lucas. All of us. We\u2019re here for all of you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him then, and her eyes were sheened with tears. \u201cBen, please hold me. I promise I won\u2019t try to jump you. At least right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he muttered, but he needed no further invitation to pull her into his arms. Or put his mouth over hers, despite the absolute stupidity of doing so. It was a soft, long kiss, with gentle heat and connection, and he could almost feel that line between them tightening, winding around them both, holding them together. But there was a tension to her, a caution. He\u2019d caused that, and he needed to fix it. It would take time, and a hell of a lot more than a kiss.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t rebuffed him though. She\u2019d asked him to hold her, even made a weak joke that made him hope she still wanted him. He needed her to want him with that same fierceness she\u2019d had before, so he could honor it the way he should have from the beginning.</p><p>But today wasn\u2019t about that. When he finally lifted his head, her eyes were closed. He used his fingertips to carry away the few tears, and then those brown eyes opened, looking at him. \u201cI should get back to the house. Cass will need me.\u201d</p><p>Looking at how pale she was close up, feeling the tremor in her hands, he shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s surrounded by friends and family right now. Let\u2019s take a little bit of time for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo arguing,\u201d he said quietly. Her gaze flickered up to his face, uncertain. \u201cIf I thought she genuinely needed you right now, we\u2019d go back. But she\u2019s all right. Give yourself a breath. You\u2019ve gotten what, probably two hours\u2019 sleep this week?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve been okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been better than okay. You\u2019ve been brilliant. But dim the wattage for a few moments, firefly. Let\u2019s walk somewhere. How about down to the gazebo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He helped her up, picked up her shoes. As Marcie watched him with those sad, tired eyes, he knelt, dried her feet with his handkerchief, guided each foot into the practical heels. She held onto his shoulder, and he felt the curve of her fingers in his coat. After he donned his own shoes and socks, straightened his trouser legs, he took that hand, pressed a kiss to her knuckles. Tucking it into the crook of his elbow, he guided her onto the path that followed the edge of the lake. For a little while she was quiet, just leaning against him, walking together, but then she pointed to the sky.</p><p>\u201cLook at that. See how the sky is blue above the tree canopy, and directly beneath it, it\u2019s white, a perfect segue? I wonder what causes that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll ask Jon. He knows all the science stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lawyer. You know how to make up stuff that sounds right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLight refraction,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cCaused by the whosiwhatsit interacting with the thingamajig in a synaptic reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s total nonsense. Good enough.\u201d They\u2019d dropped to holding hands, and it felt pretty damn natural. Even more for him to pull her under his arm, guide her hand under his coat so she could settle her palm on his waist and he could put his around her shoulders. She laid her head on his chest.</p><p>They followed the boardwalk to the screened gazebo overlooking the marsh. It was a hushed place, a couple white herons fishing gracefully among the waters, the silence punctuated by the occasional sawing cricket or chirping note of a frog.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just sit here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe can listen and watch.\u201d</p><p>He shed his coat, put it over her shoulders, then took a seat in the Adirondack chair. Guiding her onto his knee, he let her lean back against his body, put her head next to his. The marsh grasses rippled back and forth, like conversations. Seed motes floated through the air. The heron stepped with stately slowness through the water, watching for fish.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a quiet place like this, Ben? A place where everything makes sense?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been stroking her hair, carefully removing barrette and pins until it tumbled to her shoulders and he could comb through it, follow the line of her narrow shoulder blades. He could answer her question with more lawyer bullshit, things that sounded right, were somewhat true, but this was the first step. He wasn\u2019t going to be a chickenhearted bastard anymore.</p><p>\u201cThe St. Louis cemetery,\u201d he said, with effort. \u201cI used to go there as a kid, at night. I still go there to think. If you sit on top of one of the bigger vaults, you can see most of the place. There\u2019s a sense of peace there, of problems set aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Everyone there is dead.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her hair, though he couldn\u2019t help a smile. He turned his head enough so they were eye to eye. Hers had a soft gleam of tired humor. \u201cBrat,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo you find it...when you do a scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. I think you already know the answer.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together. \u201cWhen I was watching you that night at Surreal\u2014the first time\u2014I saw it. You could have been in the middle of an empty desert, because it was just you and those three women. You were focused on finding the true root of their submission, and when you got them into subspace, you were right there with them, in a similar...Domspace, where everything made sense, their very lives, every movement, every breath, in your hand.\u201d</p><p>She nodded out to the marsh. \u201cWhen I come here, for comfort, wisdom, or to be nothing for a little while, I imagine being held in God\u2019s hand. But the other night, when you took me over, Mastered me so completely, it was one and the same. I was held inside of you, because you had that same strength I sense here. I was nothing, in every good sense of the word, because it also felt like everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gave a slight smile then, laced with tears. \u201cHow many times I imagined you holding me just like this, so I could lean against you, and you wouldn\u2019t give way.\u201d She looked at him then. \u201cTell me more about the cemetery. Will you take me there sometime?\u201d</p><p>He had to clear his throat to answer. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll take you anywhere you want to go.\u201d He thought about the cemetery, what would interest her. \u201cThere\u2019s one particular vault with a statue of a child on it. Just a small thing, nothing extravagant, but the face is soft, innocent, worn down from age. The vault says \u2018closed forever\u2019, because when the child died, the parents were too heartbroken to have it used again. Since the last family member died some time ago, I took over the maintenance fee for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Other than the fact you\u2019re a good guy.\u201d</p> <p>He should have known she\u2019d ask. No cowards here, right? He shrugged, looked out over the marsh. \u201cNot so good. I did it because I envy that kid for being wanted that much, even though she was here for only three months.\u201d</p><p>He could feel her gaze on him, so he turned his face back to her, ran a knuckle along her cheek, kept talking. \u201cWhen you\u2019re there at night, the statues remind you of silent angels, all white and gray. There\u2019s a guy who comes and plays a sax to his friend, and it\u2019s some of the best sax playing I\u2019ve ever heard. But I don\u2019t go to him and ask him why he plays. Because in that place you whisper your secrets to those silent statues. To the angels of death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind being one of those statues,\u201d she said. \u201cAll bathed in shadows, whites and grays, hearing you whisper your heart and secrets to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy secrets might make your concrete feathers stand on end.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t smiling. Those brown eyes met his. \u201cWhen you go to the cemetery, does it help? Help you deal with what you lost?\u201d</p> <p>Or what he never had. \u201cYeah, it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me how. Please?\u201d She sighed, closed her eyes. \u201cJeremy died, but I lost him long ago. Just the same way we lost our parents. Not through death. Death is different, because it\u2019s over. No chance to hope, or to have hope crushed. Sometimes you can romanticize a dead person as time passes, or maybe remember some of the better things. When it came to you...I set myself up for loss there, I know it, so I don\u2019t blame you for what you can\u2019t give me. But I thought...maybe you could tell me how to deal with all of it.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to let that one stand. Yeah, he\u2019d let her down. They hadn\u2019t hit the nail on the head yet, but he was gauging what she was seeking, figuring out how much she wanted right now. He was used to the guys or her knocking on that door, and him refusing to open it. This was a situation where opening it to her without being asked might be the key to whatever happened going forward.</p><p>He spoke to the sky. \u201cYou can\u2019t get it from the self-help shows, all that bullshit about coping with loss. There is no coping. It takes you over, and you\u2019re a drowning swimmer, trying to keep your head afloat, wondering sometimes why the hell you bother, except there\u2019s this compulsion to stay alive, this biological imperative you can\u2019t shake. It\u2019s part of why D/s called to me, the primal, straightforward, fuck-PC-and-all-its-bullshit-terminology.</p><p>\u201cI could control things in that room, could get into the psyche of a woman and open her up, open her soul so I could find that part of her that\u2019s always raw and aching and open inside me. I could find what\u2019s real and not the fa\u00e7ade. But each time I get there, I\u2019m still empty. I touch that hand, find that spot, and it\u2019s not what I was seeking. So eventually you decide the point isn\u2019t finding something, but the search. You keep moving, avoid staying still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Jon said,\u201d Marcie murmured. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay still. You\u2019re afraid of stillness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot afraid.\u201d Ironically, Ben had to quell the urge to rise, move, but if he did that, he couldn\u2019t hold her. \u201cJust nothing there I want to be with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m there? Can you sit in that stillness with me? For just a moment? See what we find there together?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to meet her gaze. \u201cYeah. I can.\u201d</p><p>The simple words kindled hope in her eyes. He wanted to fan it to a full-on blaze, but he let her keep the lead. She brushed his face with those gentle fingers, looking at him with eyes that were old and young at once. \u201cIf you died, I\u2019d feel the way those parents did. It would break my heart. I would drown in a loss like that.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, she was ten times braver than he was. What he\u2019d scoffed at as youthful drama and exaggeration was simple, pure faith in her own heart and what it wanted. He stayed silent for a moment, overcome by it, then caressed her cheek. \u201cWhy me, Marcie? Tell me why it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>When she worried her bottom lip with her teeth, he brushed her chin with his lips, a nip. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything wrong,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cNot in the past, not now, not ever. All right? Just say it as you\u2019re thinking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She nodded. \u201cDo you remember the weekend Cass and Lucas got married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a minute after they met each other again at K&amp;A?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cIt might have been a little longer than that. They had to wait for Lucas\u2019 adopted family to fly in from Iowa to see the ceremony, after all. But I remember I\u2019d wandered away from the wedding, sort of like I did today. You came to find me. Not Jon or Matt, the ones someone else might expect. You said \u2018I\u2019m never going to let anything happen to you\u2019, as if you knew I was feeling uncertain about how fast things were changing. But what struck me was you didn\u2019t say, \u2018We\u2019re going to take care of you\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cMaybe you think it was a slip, but I don\u2019t. Just like I don\u2019t think it was a coincidence that you came looking for me now, when it could have been anyone else. From the first moment I met you, you made me feel safe. I was cold then too, and you put your coat over my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cI tried having other boyfriends. I pushed them, I yanked at their egos, not realizing at first why I was doing it. I needed them to be stronger than me, to put me in my place, prove to me they could hold the reins and they wouldn\u2019t let go. They couldn\u2019t. I believe in excelling in everything I do, Ben, and I won\u2019t take less than that. It\u2019s always been you. You\u2019ve always been my safety, my laughter, my sense of salvation. I\u2019ve always known you\u2019d be the Dom who will give me what I need. Who I can trust with my secrets. And if you didn\u2019t mean it, about being honest, I\u2019m probably going to drown you in this marsh, right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>It was crystal clear to him. She didn\u2019t know how to let go, a power submissive on turbo charge. The way she pursued him so relentlessly, the way she over-excelled at school, getting ahead of her grade levels. In essence, she\u2019d been \u201ctopping from the bottom\u201d all her life, with utter focus and determination. She craved a stronger hand to tell her it was okay to let go, to surrender. In return, she was the type of sub he\u2019d always desired. A hundred percent devoted, loyal. Stubborn, independent, defiant. And overflowing with love to give, something he hadn\u2019t anticipated wanting so much.</p><p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d he said softly, holding her gaze.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSo often in my life, people told me I\u2019m too young. When Cass had to take over from our mom, I was pretty young, but I was next oldest, so I helped Cass however I could. And then, when it was clear our father was never going to be around, and Jeremy got strung out on drugs, and his friend tried to attack me...all these different things, they give you a sense of fear, that the world isn\u2019t a stable place. You learn to be careful, and watchful, and you don\u2019t trust easily, though you keep hoping for something. You don\u2019t know exactly what it is, but you feel it... Maybe in the beginning all you know is it\u2019s a feeling you want to have and keep, to get more of it. But then, eventually, you realize what it is.\u201d</p><p>Ben stared at her. It echoed his own childhood experiences in a way he couldn\u2019t deny, resonating in the tightness of his chest. She was on a roll, the words tumbling out faster.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of comfort and safety so strong, you know that\u2019s the place you\u2019re meant to be, your haven in the world. Whenever you were counseling me, or playing games with me, or carrying me piggyback to throw me in the pool in the backyard...I felt that. You didn\u2019t realize how much I liked the way your shoulders felt under my hands, how you felt against my body. You know I dreamed about that, the way it felt to have my legs wrapped around you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d He tried for a humorous note, but his voice was too thick. He had his fingers tangled in her hair, and he stroked his thumbs along her temples, holding her, just holding her and listening to her. Really listening, perhaps for the first time. Seeing the truth instead of pushing it away.</p><p>\u201cI felt safe with you, but more than that, I felt I was where I needed to be. When we were together, everything was right and balanced. When things happened, and you wrote to help me, you were telling me about yourself at the same time. I wrote to you about losing my virginity and you told me how it was supposed to be. How, the first time you had sex that meant something, you\u2019d wanted to hang onto that feeling of closeness, no matter how much of an illusion it was, because you\u2019d sensed that was the important part, the seed of what it was really supposed to be like.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t use those words, but the meaning was there, between the lines. I\u2019ve become a master of reading between the lines. I know I became the confidante that you were to me, no matter how you want to deny it. Then there was the most important thing. The way you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, coming to a full stop, cheeks flushing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I went into pushy mode, and I wasn\u2019t trying not to do that. I promised myself...after the other night, I was never going to do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Cupping the side of her neck, he let his thumb play over her windpipe, watched her register the constriction, get short of breath not from the physical reaction but the psychological effect it had on her. \u201cYou know 1 Corinthians 13 also says \u2018It does not insist on its own way...\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marcie gave him her shy smile, strained at the edges. \u201cThat part was put in by the patriarchal guys who wrote the Bible and didn\u2019t want women telling them what was good for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt. They were wise to fear a determined woman. What was the most important thing?\u201d</p><p>Marcie knew it might sound childish, such a small thing, but it was like the day he\u2019d forgotten to give her those shoes, turning her out barefoot. He didn\u2019t miss details unless they were his blind spot. And Ben O\u2019Callahan\u2019s heart was his blind spot.</p><p>\u201cDid you look at the back of the forget-me-not pendant you took from me?\u201d</p><p>His brow creased. Then, as her heart caught in her throat, he shifted to reach into his slacks\u2019 pocket. He was carrying it with him. Not the collar, just the small pendant, but he was carrying a part of her on his person.</p><p>He tilted his head, looking down at it, and she couldn\u2019t resist. She stroked his hair away from his forehead, a gesture of tenderness, of love. He had to understand when he saw it.</p><p>His eyes darkened, his mouth tightened, and his fingers clenched over the disk. Nodding, she wrapped both her hands around his and lifted his knuckles to her lips, closing her eyes. \u201cWill you say it out loud? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways yours.\u201d His voice was husky.</p><p>\u201cYou started signing your letters that way on my twenty-first birthday, Ben. On the very day, in the card you sent me. Though we didn\u2019t correspond much during those two years, whenever I got any kind of card, email, letter or gift from you, that\u2019s how you signed it. Every time. Always yours. That kind of timing couldn\u2019t have been coincidental.\u201d</p><p>Ben stared down at their closed hands. She was right. It couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d missed it entirely, yet there it had been, all the time. The way her submission had been there. Lucas and all of them had noticed it early, but he, the man who didn\u2019t miss details, had blocked it.</p><p>\u201cYour card,\u201d she spoke softly now. \u201cYou said you were sorry. Is that your way of saying goodbye?\u201d</p><p>How could she even ask? But it made sense. She knew her side of things\u2014she was still trying to figure out where he was on all of it. As he paused, she bit her lip, looked back out toward the marsh.</p><p>Touching her chin, he brought her gaze back to him. Passing his thumb over that luscious lower lip, he curved his hand on her nape. Her brown eyes widened, then fluttered closed as he brought her to his mouth and kissed her. Deep and long. It wasn\u2019t an erotic, take-her-to-her-hands-and-knees-and-fuck-her kind of kiss. But in its own way, he thought it was the most all-absorbing, overwhelming kiss he\u2019d ever experienced, because everything she\u2019d just described happened in that kiss. He became everything and nothing at once.</p><p>Sliding his arm around her back, he turned her so she was cradled in his lap, her legs over the chair arm. Bracing his other hand on her hip and buttock, he took the kiss even deeper. She made a helpless little noise in her throat. Her hand slipped down, fingers tangling in his tie. His arms constricted around her, mashing her breasts pleasantly against his chest, and his grip on her hip shifted, so he was cupping her buttock to hold her even closer.</p><p>When at last he eased her back, her gaze was satisfyingly glazed, but he was knocked off his axis as well. Pretty amazing.</p><p>\u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got that,\u201d she said breathlessly. There was a little curve to her lips, but uncertainty as well.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m out of courage, Ben. I know I went about it the wrong way, but I didn\u2019t know how else to do it. Now I\u2019m thinking all I did was open myself up for the worst rejection of my life, something that will be hard to survive. But I can survive it.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her chin, she gave him a direct look. Though she was still in his lap, her body had tensed, ready to move away, to put distance between them. \u201cMaybe you think you made the message clear enough at the club, but we were both pretty emotional that night. So here and now, when everything\u2019s quiet and clear, I need your final answer, no matter how scared I am of it. I don\u2019t want you as my mentor, unless it\u2019s part of you being my permanent Master. Am I wasting my time? Is there any chance you\u2019ll ever be in love with me, the way I am with you?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d said she was out of courage, but he knew of no one, man or woman, who would risk an emotional blow as baldly as that. She kept her gaze locked on him, didn\u2019t flinch, even though he could tell how fragile she was, how vulnerable. A kitten and a lioness together. A shapeshifting sorceress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer you, but I want an answer from you first. I know you\u2019ve thought a lot about what happened at Surreal. What was your conclusion?\u201d He\u2019d remind her to be honest, but at this point he realized she didn\u2019t know how to be anything else.</p><p>That chin lifted higher, tightened. \u201cYou wanted me. You didn\u2019t want anyone else touching me. And the way you acted at the car...\u201d When a shadow passed through her eyes, he couldn\u2019t stop himself. He put his hands on her face.</p> <p>\u201cWas unforgivable. Unconscionable. I\u2019d go through any level of hell if it could take me back to that moment. I never want you to be afraid of me, Marcie. I never want you to connect me in any way to what happened to you as a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lucas,\u201d she muttered, but he increased his grip, bringing her eyes back up to him.</p><p>\u201cHe was right to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you,\u201d she said, and she had no idea how it relieved him, down deep in his gut, to see the irritated truth of it in her eyes. \u201cYou were purposefully trying to hurt my feelings that night, and you succeeded. Yes, you\u2019re pretty scary when you\u2019re riled like that, but...\u201d She shook her head, put her hands on his wrists, squeezing. \u201cI know you, Ben. I was freaked out, I admit it, but after I thought it through, I knew the only reason you did it was because you were scared.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. Her fingers were cold and nervous on his, but she\u2019d delivered the truth as steady as if she was the Head Mother in The Sound of Music.</p><p>Jesus Christ. Jon was right. She was more emotionally mature than him.</p><p>It made him smile, he couldn\u2019t help it. Her brow raised, her expression puzzled, but he just pushed her head back down next to his, stroked her hair as she lay in his arms, quiet, waiting on him. The water birds made their strange calls, the reeds rustling with the wind. He wasn\u2019t even really thinking. He was feeling. She liked being a bad girl, would always push the limits. It was a symptom of the feelings she had inside her that she wanted to get out, that she trusted him to handle, to use to pleasure them both. She knew he liked challenges, and she was the challenge of a lifetime.</p><p>Closing his arms around her, he rose, bringing them both to their feet. She looked up at him, that uncertain, waiting look, but she still had that tightness to her chin. She was ready for whatever he decided. He stepped back, releasing her.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>They were on a rough wooden dock, but it didn\u2019t matter. Everything inside him tied into a hundred different knots as she responded immediately, began to sink to her knees. He caught her elbow. Slipping his coat off her shoulders, he put it down to protect her knees. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an expensive coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour legs rank up there with the Seven Wonders of the World.\u201d</p><p>She gave a tiny smile, though she was still too serious. Too sad. That wouldn\u2019t change today, because today was about far more than what was happening between them, but he could change this part, maybe make it better.</p><p>When she sank down to her knees, he touched her chin, making her look up at him. \u201cA slave is braver than her Master, Marcie. That\u2019s the way it works. So you say it first, lay it all on the line for me. Take the risk.\u201d</p><p>By commanding her to her knees, he\u2019d given her hope, and he loved seeing it spark in her brown gaze. She closed her hand over his wrist, a breach he allowed because her fingers felt too good to resist. He wanted the connection. \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you since I was sixteen years old,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery guy I met, I compared him to you. I counted the days until break, when I might get a glimpse of you on the holidays. As soon as I realized what I was, I started calling you Master in my heart. I have a diary I wrote to you throughout college. I love you, Master. I love you with every part of me, and I love every part of you. I\u2019m here, and I want you more than I\u2019ve ever wanted anything.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, looked over the slow moving water, though her fingers squeezed his. \u201cPlease let me love you, Ben.\u201d Her whisper was a caress. \u201cI won\u2019t let you down. I can survive your darkness.\u201d</p><p>To survive it himself, he\u2019d rebuilt who he was from the ground up, locking away the person he\u2019d once been. The other night had proven that wasn\u2019t the best strategy. In fact, Marcie\u2019s words felt like that cell was being unlocked, that she was standing there in its doorway, impossibly vulnerable yet completely unafraid of the monster within. Sunlight was streaming in behind her, inviting the beast out into the light.</p><p>It was Beauty and the Beast, when all was said and done. Because in the end, the Beast was willing to do anything to deserve her love.</p><p>\u201cFirst off, you have never, will never, let me down. All you have to be is yourself.\u201d As her eyes filled with more tears, he squatted down, closed his arms around her, buried his face in her hair. \u201cYou asked if there\u2019s a chance I\u2019ll ever be in love with you. I already am.\u201d His throat closed up as a sob broke from hers, so strong it shook her narrow shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m crazy fucking in love with you, Marcella Moira. God help you. And I\u2019m so, so sorry for every awful, cruel thing I\u2019ve done to you.\u201d</p><p>Her arms wormed out from beneath his, locked around his shoulders, hands gripping his shirt as tight as they could. She made an incoherent sound of joy and sorrow at once, and he pressed his face harder into her hair. A chuckle strangled out of him as she spoke against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry for every awful cruel thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet brat. Brave girl.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers convulsed on him with every word, and he held her, let her cry, murmuring to her as she got it all out. He wished he could have held her when she first learned about Jeremy. He wished he could have been with her when she had that nightmare, soothed it away. But he\u2019d make sure he was there to drive away any others she had. And he damn sure wouldn\u2019t cause any more of them. When she started to slow down a bit, he fished out another handkerchief, glad he\u2019d brought a spare for today\u2019s emotional event. After she dried her eyes, he let her keep it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right. Now I want you to stand.\u201d</p><p>He helped her, because she was a little shaky, and got even more so when he stayed on one knee, looking up at her. He put his hand against her face. \u201cWhat happened in the parking lot at Surreal won\u2019t ever happen again.\u201d</p><p>She started to shake her head, but he wouldn\u2019t let himself off the hook for it. \u201cIt was inexcusable. If you want me as your Master, then you accept and understand that the guilt and blame for that night lies entirely with me.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, tears gathering once more, though she tried to wipe them away with the handkerchief she held in her free hand. She sniffed. \u201cDana said if you were really sorry, you\u2019d let them tie you up naked, rub you down with kerosene and zap you with a Taser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve taken leave of my fucking senses. Especially when it comes to Reverend Dana. She\u2019s about as bad as you are for taking advantage.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head. That guarded look was still there, but it had lessened by a significant degree. He\u2019d win her trust back. She was going to give him the chance to do so, thank God. He hadn\u2019t completely fucked it up.</p><p>\u201cCass said you\u2019d owe me until the day you die, but that you\u2019d made amends with Matt and the others. Something about restoring you to rights with the code of chivalry.\u201d Her silken brow rose, a small smile playing around her soft lips. \u201cWhat did they make you do?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, looked away. \u201cNot going to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d Her slim fingers crept under his jaw, teased his face back toward her. \u201cYou find me irresistible. You just told me so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I love you,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cThat\u2019s very different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not.\u201d She dimpled, and of course he couldn\u2019t resist her. Besides which, she\u2019d worry it out of him like a terrier digging a rat out of a hole. Jesus, she was going to be so such a pain in his ass. He\u2019d probably lose all his hair before he hit forty. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease? Pretty please?\u201d She batted her eyes at him.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDo that again and I\u2019ll smack your ass, right here in front of the fish.\u201d</p><p>Of course she batted her eyes again, then shrieked as he rose and tossed her over his shoulder, giving her a resounding slap on her soft buttock. He had to resist the urge to take hold of it, squeeze and enjoy the pleasure of touching what was his. She braced herself with hands curled in his shirt, docile in his hold, conveying that she would give him anything he wanted. It was an effort to put her back on her feet, even more so when her hands remained fastened to him, her body leaning against his. He could tell she was still waiting for an answer. Tenacious female. He relented.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to drink for a year.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened, her mouth getting serious, but he didn\u2019t want to take her there. So he gave her the other part of it. The really painful part. \u201cAnd I gave away my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Those eyes widened to saucer shape. \u201cThe Mercedes? Your half-a-million-dollar sports car? The high-performance engineering piece of art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks for reminding me. I donated it to the upcoming auction for the new domestic-violence shelter.\u201d</p><p>Marcie\u2019s gaze darkened then, and her hands cupped his face. \u201cBen, you didn\u2019t...even that night, when you were so angry...I knew you weren\u2019t going to hurt me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarcie.\u201d He touched her lower lip. Though faint, the mark was still there where she\u2019d hit the car. \u201cI did hurt you. I laid hands on you in anger. That\u2019s the one thing a Master never does to his sub, and a man never does to a woman. Not ever,\u201d he repeated, underscoring it.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t angry. Not at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich made it even worse. I\u2019m done discussing it,\u201d he said.</p><p>The voice Marcie heard was his Master\u2019s voice, which brought her nerve endings to full alert at once, even as his hand tightened on her wrist. To restrain, not to harm, an entirely different connotation. \u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d he said. \u201cExcept for what I owe you.\u201d</p><p>There was no changing certain things about the K&amp;A men, any more than a woman could change the shape of a knight\u2019s heart. She accepted that, loved him all the more for it. \u201cHow much will they get for it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cLewis, legal counsel for Sonoco, will bid on it. Matt sent him an email, telling him it\u2019s up for auction because I lost a bet. He knew Lewis won\u2019t be able to resist rubbing my nose in it, but he\u2019s a good guy\u2014I\u2019ll deny that if you tell him. He\u2019ll bid a fair price. His revenge will probably take care of the shelter\u2019s operating expenses for the next two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could bid against him.\u201d She gave him a hopeful expression. \u201cSince you insist that you owe me something, you could buy me your car. Even Cass would agree that\u2019s a sufficient level of remorse.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cNot likely. I know Cassandra Moira. If I lie down under a convoy of semis, it wouldn\u2019t be sufficient. Plus, you behind the wheel of the McLaren would make me old before my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet I could drive it faster than you ever have, you big pussy.\u201d</p><p>He slung her back over his shoulder despite her squeal, ignoring her thump on his broad back. Snagging his coat from the ground, he started back down the dock. \u201cI can see all my spare time\u2019s going to be spent teaching you to be a proper slave. After we take care of what I should have given you from the very beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She was trying to look up into his face, working her way around his side like a sinuous python. Once they were off the dock, he let her down, holding her by the waist. With her looking up into his face, wondering, it hit him square in the gut. She was so goddamn beautiful. So strong, so brave, so intelligent. It all underscored what he\u2019d blocked when she was too young for it to be appropriate, the clues he\u2019d ignored... Like how much he\u2019d missed her letters the past two years. Or his punch-in-the-gut reaction when she walked back into his office.</p><p>It all boiled down to one thing\u2014that overwhelming sense that she was his.</p><p>His slave, his submissive. He saw it even now, in the way her eyes searched his face, anticipating what it was he was about to say, what he wanted, how she could serve him. She didn\u2019t realize that the mere fact she was breathing and near was enough for him.</p><p>It was unexpected, and he wasn\u2019t sure he fully trusted it. He\u2019d wanted something like it for so long, but he\u2019d lied to himself over and over, run smoke screens over those yearnings. It was hard to clear all that out in a moment, particularly when he\u2019d spent so much time rebuffing her. Now he was going to have the pleasure of fully embracing what she was offering, and though he was feeling a sharp urgency to get started, his Dom side impatient to fully claim her, he needed some time to adjust to it, to prepare. To make sure the experience was everything she desired and more.</p><p>Still, he\u2019d opened a door, and she wasn\u2019t going to leave it alone. She was such a kid. It almost made him grin. \u201cWhat should you have given me from the beginning?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He put the coat back over her shoulders against the incoming evening chill. Then he tucked her under his arm and started back toward the house. They\u2019d set up a pavilion tent and soft music was drifting out from under it, a time for friends and family to relax and reminisce about Jeremy. About the importance of family, whether of blood or the kind that a person was lucky enough to find during his life. He tightened his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to make you mine, the way I should have done it the moment you walked into my office. Not tonight, but soon.\u201d He stopped then, faced her. \u201cAre you ready for that, Marcie? You know what belonging to me means.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, quivered under his hands. \u201cYes, Master. I do. I want that more than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then. In three weeks, I\u2019ll send you instructions and you\u2019ll follow them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree\u2014\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cAll right, Master. Will the others\u2014\u201d</p><p>At his second quelling look, she broke off the question, settled. She wouldn\u2019t always be so malleable, God help him, but he expected that was part of what he loved about her.</p><p>He knew what she\u2019d been about to ask. The other K&amp;A men had always been involved in making a woman part of their circle. He saw no reason for Marcie to be any different, when she obviously wanted that. Yet she was unique to him, to his heart. His, in a way she wouldn\u2019t be to any of the others, even as they contributed to her pleasure. He felt the edge of it in his teeth, like blood to a predator, and had to curb that impatience once again. Not today. She was impatient with the idea of three weeks. She had no idea what that wait was going to do to him, but he was going to do it right.</p><p>Right now, she needed something else from him. She was starting to drag her feet, her eyes on that pavilion ahead. The past week or so had been about arranging all the details, the service. This was the epilogue, a pavilion of people saying goodbye and facing the truth that her older brother was gone. An older brother who\u2019d once been her hero, until he\u2019d become a nightmare.</p><p>They were crossing a footbridge over one of the creeks. When Marcie stopped, listening to the music coming from the pavilion, he stopped with her, giving her time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll Stand By You, by the Pretenders. Cass used to sing that when we were young.\u201d She started to hum it, closing her eyes.</p><p>She opened them when he turned her toward him. Sliding one arm around her waist, he took her other hand in his, against his chest, and began to sway with her. He picked up the hum, going along with it. Hell, people didn\u2019t dance at funerals, but he didn\u2019t really care. She let out a weary sigh, relaxed a little more in his arms.</p><p>He could be here for this, and for every need she had after this moment. She might think he was her Master, holding all the reins, but when push came to shove, he couldn\u2019t deny her anything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cass had gone into the house with Jessica and Nate to show Steve Pickard\u2019s wife some pictures of Jeremy. She\u2019d told Lucas she\u2019d be okay, and so he was sitting out in a corner of the pavilion, keeping an eye on Cherry and Talia. Steve had the two girls engaged in conversation about their school activities, so all the kids were handled, giving him a momentary break.</p><p>As he took a swallow of Scotch he\u2019d poured from the self-serve wet bar, he glanced out over the marsh and saw Ben and Marcie coming back from the lake. He\u2019d intended to go after her when he didn\u2019t see her come in from the service, but he\u2019d gotten involved in other things. His moment of guilt was short-lived, though, seeing Marcie tucked under Ben\u2019s arm, a comfortable fit.</p><p>His lips twisted wryly. He hoped he\u2019d done well by Cass\u2019 siblings, because he loved all of the kids. The rest of the guys felt the same way, but there\u2019d been a special relationship between Ben and Marcie from the beginning, he couldn\u2019t deny it. He hadn\u2019t had to worry about Marcie all that much, because when she needed an adult friend, a shoulder, an ear, Ben had been there. Her playmate, her surrogate big brother, and now something else entirely.</p> <p>As they stopped on the bridge and he saw her register the song, the sadness from it reflected in her face, he was ready to go to her. But Ben turned to her, going into that slow dance, his head bent protective and attentive over hers.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one for him, Lucas. You can tell.\u201d Jon was standing at his shoulder now, holding a beer and gazing at them. \u201cHe gave his heart to her a long time ago. She brought it back to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Lucas sighed. \u201cWith all this other shit, I\u2019d forgotten their history. There it is, right in front of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight where it was destined to be. That was why it took him so much longer. He had to wait for her to be ready. And figure out what he truly wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, if his head\u2019s back on straight, there\u2019s no one in the world I\u2019d trust with her more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou might want to tell Ben that at some point. I think he\u2019d be surprised to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced at Matt as he took a seat next to him. The CEO nodded toward them. \u201cShe had to have enough faith for both of them. She\u2019s a remarkable young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn some ways, I get how Ben felt,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what I did to deserve a gift like Dana. I just try to do whatever\u2019s needed to earn it, every day, weighting the other side of that scale as much as I can.\u201d He gave a half smile. \u201cShe always gives me twice as much, so I\u2019ll never catch up. Some gifts take a lifetime to find the balance.\u201d</p><p>\u201dFor some of us, maybe not even then.\u201d Lucas nudged Matt. \u201cMost of us still think Savannah married beneath her.\u201d</p><p>No argument there,\u201d Matt returned, unruffled. \u201cCass\u2019ll probably throw your midwest beancounting ass back into the pond any day now.\u201d</p><p>Lucas sobered, looking back at Ben and Marcie. Their lawyer had his hand curved around her jaw, thumb stroking her cheek as she pressed her face into his chest. \u201cHe\u2019ll protect her with everything he is. He\u2019s figured it out. He won\u2019t let her down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the job.\u201d Matt lifted his glass, tapped it to his. \u201cAnd the blessing.\u201d</p><p>Marcie: I\u2019m sitting in the student commons, and the sunset is spectacular. The reds are painted against the clouds, as if the sun is courting the moon.</p><p>Ben: Does the moon like being courted?</p><p>Marcie: What woman doesn\u2019t?</p><p>Marcie texting Ben, sophomore year</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Marcie stood on the footbridge, watching the sky and remembering the dance she and Ben had shared here, three weeks before. Tonight would be a full moon. She felt like its light was already filling her, lifting her up toward the heavens.</p><p>Ever since Jeremy\u2019s service, she\u2019d received some type of whimsical gift or gesture from Ben every day. He\u2019d made her dinner at his Garden District house. Her as well as Cass and Lucas, the other K&amp;A men, her siblings. He\u2019d had her come early, help him chop, mix, saut\u00e9. Driven her completely crazy when he laid kisses on her neck, holding her inside his armspan as he showed her exactly how he wanted things prepared. But her Master had been clear.</p> <p>No sex right now. These next three weeks are for something different.</p><p>She tried really hard to change his mind. Alice had returned from her trip, but Peter needed some admin help on an offsite project. Therefore, Ben agreed to let Marcie split her internship between his office and the research department on the days Alice was gone. Of course, on those days, she always wore provocative clothes, doing a lot of bending over file cabinets in line with his office door. When he brought her close enough to touch, she made sure he knew what every inch of her felt like against him. She couldn\u2019t help herself, and it wasn\u2019t entirely her fault. While he\u2019d said no sex, apparently that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t kiss her whenever he desired, long, drugging kisses that left her knees weak and her pussy soaked.</p><p>She\u2019d lost count of how many times he\u2019d had her come into his office, shut the door and then ordered her behind his desk to straddle his thigh while he kissed her, his hands dropping to knead her ass. Every time, no matter how she tried to control herself, she found herself rubbing herself on that hard muscle, straining against him like a complete out-of-control nymphomaniac. He\u2019d stop her before she could come, make her stay completely still. Sometimes he\u2019d open her blouse, stroke her breasts. Lay a kiss between them, then rearrange her clothes and send her back to her desk with a firm pat on the ass.</p><p>She was going to hack him up with his commercial grade, beautifully sharpened and polished meat cleaver. She\u2019d be sorry, but no jury of her female peers would convict her.</p><p>He took her for long walks at lunch, holding her hand, buying her food from the sidewalk vendors. At night, he\u2019d call her, give her bedtime stories that left her toes curling and her anything but sleepy. Especially with his parting good night.</p><p>\u201cRemember, your hand and your vibrator stays away from what\u2019s mine. You come on my command alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d She\u2019d purred it into the phone, trying to cover the desperation. His sexy chuckle alone made her nipples harden.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be stroking my cock, baby. Thinking about you while I watch the evening news. And when I come, I\u2019ll say your name. Your punishment for trying to change your Master\u2019s mind with your tight skirts and those little stunts you pull at the office.\u201d</p><p>Hack, hack, hack. No, forget the meat cleaver. She\u2019d use a power saw.</p><p>He\u2019d told her he was her Master, which meant he held the reins. So she had to wait on him. He was testing her. She was trying, but God, she was going to go crazy.</p><p>On the flip side, Ben was making no secret of the fact he considered her his. There was no emotional uncertainty anymore. With every passing day, she became joyously more confident of his feelings. The night he\u2019d prepared that dinner, Talia, as precocious a teenager as Marcie had ever been, had tracked every time Ben grazed his fingers over Marcie\u2019s hip, or brushed his lips against her temple when he handed her something to bring to the table. When her younger sister was helping her clear, she\u2019d leaned in, whispered to Marcie, \u201cAre you Ben\u2019s girlfriend now?\u201d</p><p>Before Marcie could answer, Ben had come by with a stack of plates, pulled Talia\u2019s ponytail. \u201cYes, she is.\u201d And that was that.</p><p>She saw the exchanged looks between the other men and their wives that night, but she had a feeling it wasn\u2019t only because of the new dynamic between her and Ben. Something was easier about the K&amp;A lawyer. The jokes he made, the fact he smiled a little more often...it was obvious that something was uncoiling inside of him, turning him in a better direction. Thinking she might have something to do with that was a good feeling, but just seeing him happier made her heart swell to bursting. It also touched something in her deeply, seeing him casually bypassing his normal whiskey, even abstaining from wine.</p><p>As remarkable as that was, other things were going on as well. They\u2019d had other get-togethers, not just at Ben\u2019s house, but at Jon and Rachel\u2019s, and a concert at Audubon Park. During those events, she\u2019d noted a distinct change in her relationship with the others. When Peter passed behind her chair at Jon and Rachel\u2019s, he\u2019d playfully put his large hands on either side of the seat, his knuckles brushing her hips as he scooted her closer to the table so he could get his massive bulk in the narrow area between wall and chair. As he straightened, he\u2019d laid his hands on her shoulders. The wide neckline of her cotton top had made it a simple, casual thing to hook his thumb under her bra strap, and he\u2019d idly stroked her there as he exchanged a few remarks with Jon about a subject she couldn\u2019t possibly remember, not with that happening and Ben watching, leaned back in his chair, his green eyes intent on her reaction.</p><p>Later that same evening, when Matt was sitting on the couch with her and Savannah, he had his arm around his wife, but he also had his arm stretched behind Marcie. A couple times he stroked his strong fingers casually through Marcie\u2019s hair, tracing the shell of her ear. She\u2019d stayed still, nerves tingling along her spine, everything coiling up tight at the touch, which couldn\u2019t be called anything but sexually proprietary. Once again, Ben had his eyes on her, his expression telling her that their subtle enjoyment of her had his full approval. When she leaned across him to accept Savannah\u2019s invitation to feel the baby kick, Matt\u2019s hand dropped to her waist, fingers wrapped over her hip bone. As the conversations continued, it was both more comfortable and titillating than expected, to stay leaning against him.</p><p>Of course, the big surprise was when Lucas demonstrated some of the same type of behavior. At the Audubon concert, Marcie had been sitting on her hip on the picnic blanket next to Cass. When Lucas asked them if they wanted more wine, he brushed a kiss along his wife\u2019s throat, taking a nip with teeth, but as he moved around Marcie to go get them both a glass, he let his fingertips trail up the inside of Marcie\u2019s thigh in what was undeniably a sexual caress. She felt a tingle all the way up her groin muscle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knew what this was. Dana had spoken of it once during those tea parties. Before Peter initiated her into the group, they\u2019d done things like that to get her used to their touches, their scent. Ben was getting her ready, and it made her crazy with lust and anxiety, all the more because it was so subtle.</p><p>The same night, Ben left her with a kiss where he pressed her up against the car door, and she was ready to claw his clothes off him. When he called her at midnight, he was stretched out in front of his flat-screen, watching one of the latest offerings from an erotic filmmaker. Ben casually described the scene he was watching, of a woman on all fours being fucked from behind while she gave oral service to her Master. Ben asked her if she fantasized about such a scenario, made her tell him her reactions in detail, physical and emotional. Before long, she was sweating through her nightshirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to make me into a lust-crazed lunatic,\u201d she accused.</p> <p>\u201cLie down on your back,\u201d he said.</p><p>The switch from teasing seduction to command flipped a switch inside of her. She lay down immediately, aware her limbs were shaking.</p><p>\u201cLegs spread. Arms to the headboard.\u201d</p><p>Everything stretched to snapping in another heartbeat. That dark, insidious edge to Ben, the edge he\u2019d been holding back, was in his voice now. In an instant, she wanted to be punished, wanted more than that firm pat. She wanted to be gagged, roped down, beaten within an inch of her life and then fucked in the ass, into unconsciousness.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p> <p>She did, and bit her lip, hard, to keep herself still. She imagined his hands on her ankles, the sound of a cuff being wrapped around one, then the other, the tension as they were fastened to the end of the bed. He\u2019d do the same to her wrists.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t worn any panties under the nightshirt, because she couldn\u2019t handle the friction. She wanted to be good for her Master, but she just couldn\u2019t be anymore. She imagined him bending over her in the dark, his green gaze intent, that mouth stern, uncompromising. As kind and romantic as he\u2019d been these past few days, she knew that transition, when the sadist in him would rise to the top. He wanted to make her suffer, wanted to make her scream with pleasure, beg for mercy that he wouldn\u2019t give. He\u2019d run his hand down her sternum, tug on her nipple piercing, and then his hand would go lower, lower.</p><p>Her hips jerked, imagining his hands there, his fingers sliding into her soaked pussy, pushing, stroking. He\u2019d hook the clit ring, tug on it, sharp enough to send a pain through the tissues. Then he\u2019d lift her up, lie beneath her, and put his cock in her ass. Take all of me, baby. That\u2019s it, squeeze down on me. You keep coming down on me, lifting up...down. There you go. And every time you go up or down, you squeeze on me like your life depends on it.</p><p>He was murmuring it to her, his voice a sexy rumble over the phone. She was gasping, telling him she was doing just that. Doing it to empty air, believing it was his cock, and the constricting of the muscles in her rectum were contracting her pussy, rippling along her clit.</p><p>\u201cBen...Master...\u201d She whispered it, whimpered it. She needed him, needed him. She couldn\u2019t wait another moment for him. She loved him. She needed to serve him, which meant she needed to be good, she needed to wait. But she couldn\u2019t stop moving her hips up and down, up and down, imagining his cock deep inside her, his fingers working in her dripping cunt. \u201cPlease...oh God...\u201d</p><p>Stretched out on the bed, nothing touching her but air, her imagination and his voice, she climaxed, a hard pull on her lower abdomen, thighs thrumming with the sensation, pussy spasming. \u201cOh God...Master...\u201d</p> <p>The words he spoke to her didn\u2019t matter. She clung to his voice, the rough edge of it that told her he was working his cock, listening to her come for him. When she came down, far too soon, needing more than just the empty imagining, she held the phone tight, quelling an odd desire to press it against her pussy, the closest she could get to him.</p><p>\u201cYou came without permission. I\u2019ll be taking care of that soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He gave a low, dangerous chuckle. \u201cCareful what you wish for, brat.\u201d</p><p>Now it was day twenty-one. While he was merciless, the timeline had given her a blissful light at the end of the tunnel. The note had arrived yesterday, in a box containing a shimmering forest green short robe and matching slippers.</p><p>When you get up Friday morning, you won\u2019t be going into work. Do not shower. Wear only what\u2019s in this box and your nipple and clit jewelry. Unless you get dizzy from it, no food for twelve hours. Sips of water as needed. Whenever you sit or lie down today, your thighs will stay open. When your pussy gets wet (what I\u2019d expect from a shameless slut like yourself), you will not clean your cream off your thighs.</p><p>A limo will pick you up at seven. Make no special preparations. Bring nothing but yourself and this robe. Leave your hair down, no clips or ties. Once you get into the limo, you will not speak unless asked a direct question. Until you see me, no male should touch you. No incidental brush against Lucas at the house, no taking the driver\u2019s hand to get into the limo. Every inch of your soft skin is mine to touch, mine alone. Your Master</p><p>A gardenia tied with a ribbon lay on the top of the robe. She\u2019d brushed the petals over her cheek as she fingered the fabric. The silk was so thin it clung to her hips and breasts like skin. The kids had school, and were going to be picked up afterward by Rachel to go to the movies. With Cass and Lucas at work, Marcie had the house to herself all day.</p> <p>She\u2019d planned so hard for this day, had thought about it so long, that she found the reality dizzying. As the clock ticked so slowly toward seven, everything seemed dreamlike. She\u2019d lain out by the pool, watching the clouds move overhead, and held the thought to her like a cherished doll. Ben O\u2019Callahan was in love with her. He was going to claim her as his. Formally, as his submissive, his property. His lover. She knew what that meant to those five men who were an integral part of her blood family.</p><p>She\u2019d refused to let the possibility of failure enter her mind until that dreadful night had forced her to confront the unthinkable. Until then, her certainty that she was meant to be his had driven her forward. With the goal achieved but not consummated, it left her oddly unbalanced, that part of her empty and waiting to be filled with something more substantial.</p><p>Returning to the present, she decided she felt like a harlequin, one half focused as a laser, steady as a rock, the other like nitro trapped in a bottle, ready to explode.</p><p>Putting her hand on her heart, she tapped out that song, I\u2019ll Stand By You, remembering their dance together. It made sense that it came to mind now, because she was standing on the same footbridge. She swayed, replaying the words in her head, so appropriate to everything she\u2019d hoped and dreamed about when it came to Ben.</p><p>\u201cYou amaze me.\u201d</p><p>Opening her eyes, she saw her sister at the entrance to the bridge, watching her. She was glad to see Cass a little less tired today. She, Lucas and the others had tried their best to balance her natural need to grieve with distractions, things to keep the ache from being unbearable. It was going to take time, they all knew that, but it was hard to see her sister with that sadness in her eyes so often. Marcie had shed her own tears over Jeremy, but no matter how guilty she felt about it, the truth was Ben\u2019s behavior toward her these past several weeks had kept her preoccupied. She wouldn\u2019t put it past him to have taken into account that side effect. Ruthless Master, merciful lover. Good friend.</p><p>She went to Cass now, held her sister close. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Don\u2019t you want to know why you amaze me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m an incredible sister in all ways and you worship me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not loaning you my Jimmy Choos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>Cass grinned, as Marcie had hoped, and eased back. \u201cThis is beautiful.\u201d Cass fingered the hem of the robe. \u201cThe man does have good taste in clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He\u2019s probably a repressed homosexual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Cass snorted, then sobered. \u201cYou amaze me because you had such determination, such conviction. You didn\u2019t doubt yourself, or the way you felt for him, no matter how much it looked like an adolescent crush. You knew.\u201d</p><p>Marcie shrugged. \u201cThere were times I was afraid I was wrong, from his end of things. But the stories you\u2019ve told me...each of them knowing which woman was the one? There was another side to that. Even though each of you had reasons to resist or doubt the inevitable, it was already inside you too, such that he was able to convince you of it pretty damn quickly. I remember how Dana put it. \u2018One look into Peter\u2019s gray eyes and I knew I was fucked. Literally and figuratively.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Cass\u2019 blue eyes twinkled. \u201cWell, the soldier\u2019s as much a part of her as the minister.\u201d Then she grew somber again. \u201cWe should have supported you more. It wouldn\u2019t have been as difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Marcie shook her head. \u201cThat was part of it. You challenged the premise, tested it, Ben most of all. That\u2019s the way any deal is supposed to go, to make sure it\u2019s solid. And these past three weeks...he\u2019s been wonderful.</p><p>Her sister gave her that penetrating look. \u201cThere\u2019s a but in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds terrible.\u201d Marcie laughed at herself. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of going crazy, because he\u2019s keeping it to all romantic stuff. Most women complain about guys wanting to have sex and nothing else, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen some of the romantic things he\u2019s doing.\u201d Cass lifted a brow. \u201cYes, it does fulfill emotional needs, but at the same time, it keeps a fire going under the physical. They\u2019re very good at that. He wants you worked up to the point you\u2019d jump him on a public street corner if he told you to do so.\u201d</p><p>Marcie blinked at the bald assessment. \u201cHe\u2019s doing it intentionally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and no. Yes, in that they can\u2019t help themselves. The romantic is integrated with the Dom, and no, in that I do believe he\u2019s truly trying to woo you, the way he knew he should have been doing from the very beginning. More than that, he\u2019s giving you time to trust him again. And maybe time for him to trust himself again as well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marcie nodded. \u201cMuch as I hate to admit it, I probably needed that. I\u2019m not sure if...right after, I would have been ready. There needed to be some time for the air to clear. But honest to God, if he gives me another one of those neck kisses in front of you guys again I\u2019m not going to be responsible for raping him on the kitchen island.\u201d</p><p>Cass put an arm around her, smiling, but then they contemplated the water together. \u201cYou had to grow up so fast,\u201d her sister said at last. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen asked me the same thing. He called at lunch, and he was so gentle. Told me it wouldn\u2019t change anything for him. Said I could have more time if I needed it. But I don\u2019t need more time. I\u2019ve wanted this for so long. I feel like a carnival\u2019s been set up within a stone\u2019s throw of my bedroom window for seven years, but I haven\u2019t been allowed on any of the rides.\u201d</p> <p>At Cass\u2019 raised brow, Marcie chuckled. \u201cOkay, maybe that didn\u2019t come out quite right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably came out pretty close.\u201d Cass gave her a teasing pinch. \u201cJust have a care with some of those rides. There are some proprietary clauses involved.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Marcie\u2019s time to get serious. \u201cCass, we haven\u2019t really talked about it much... It\u2019s more than a little awkward. Lucas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Cass put her hands on Marcie\u2019s shoulders, gave her a straightforward look. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in it, love. You\u2019ll always be my little sister, which means I\u2019ll always see the child in you, but I also see the woman. This is who and what they are. Lucas and I have talked about it. I\u2019m not confused about what will happen tonight, and his part in it. Of course, I\u2019ve told him any fantasies he might have about some sister-sister action is confined to his late-night cable subscription,\u201d she paused as Marcie choked on a laugh, \u201cbut this...this is what we are. I\u2019m mainly worried about you. Are you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I thought possible,\u201d Marcie said wryly. \u201cBut I\u2019m really excited too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right then. The limo arrived a few minutes ago. That\u2019s why I came out. It\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>Marcie glanced toward the house, felt that trembling in her lower belly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can expect everything, and things you never imagined. That\u2019s the way they work.\u201d</p><p>Max was her driver tonight, and she gave him a warm smile, remembering his kindness the night at the club. There was no awkwardness about that now. It was past, and she saw he was okay with things as well, no concern in his gaze tonight. He kept his attention courteously on her face as he held the door open for her, though she noted he sneaked a quick, sweeping glance over her nearly bare legs when she took her seat in the limo. It made her feel good. He was a guy, after all, and the robe was designed to highlight her full potential.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hand her into the vehicle as he normally would. That, and the fact they only exchanged nods, told her he had the no-talking and no-touching part of the instructions. She settled into the plush backseat, drawing deep breaths. There was a tray set up with a bowl of strawberries that had been dipped in chocolates of varying shades. Next to them was a thin black eye mask with lacings to hold it snug on the bridge of her nose and against the eyes. She read the notecard next to it.</p><p>Put on the mask, lace it tight, so you can see nothing. You may touch and smell the strawberries, but do not taste.</p> <p>Picking up the mask in fingers that trembled, she followed the direction. The smell of the strawberries was too good to resist, so she lifted one, inhaled deeply. Oh wow. Ben had done these himself. She knew it, because Dana had talked about the night she was first shared with all of them. How they\u2019d brought the juiciest, largest strawberries she\u2019d ever tasted, coated in a chocolate that was as much an orgasm for the nose as the tongue. Peter\u2019s wife had learned later Ben had hand-dipped them himself in a special mixture of dark chocolates, vanilla and spices.</p><p>The richness of it brought saliva to Marcie\u2019s tongue. There was white chocolate, vanilla, butterscotch...praline coating. The evil man knew she lived for dessert. Her tongue longed to taste, her stomach rumbling, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>His directions, so simple and straightforward, had nevertheless kept her in a state of wet longing through most of the day. With every hour that passed, she was more aware of her body. She wished he\u2019d let her shower. She wasn\u2019t grungy, but it felt odd to come to him with hair that had been combed but not styled. She would have touched up her nails, done her makeup. Just as he\u2019d anticipated, her arousal had formed damp tracks on her thighs more than once today, drying there. To heightened male senses, she would smell like what she was. A female in raging heat.</p><p>She kept picking up the different strawberries, smelling each. The flavors seemed designed to stir her arousal further. She tried hard to hold them by the greenery at top, but she managed to get some of the melting chocolate on her fingertips. She couldn\u2019t find a towel or wipe, which left only the robe or the seat. Realizing it would qualify as tasting, she stopped with her hand halfway to her lips. Instead, she left her hands in a half curl on her parted thighs.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t ask Max where she might find a napkin, of course. For a devilish moment, she imagined extending her fingers over the seat back, a mute request that he oblige her with his mouth. She was sure that would break Ben\u2019s rules on several different levels, particularly the no-male-touching rule.</p><p>Another time, she might do it, because she had a sense of what kind of infractions Ben would enjoy punishing her for, but this was not that day. Playtime and challenges weren\u2019t part of this. All balls were now in Ben\u2019s court. In truth, she was more anxious than she\u2019d let on to Cass. Because she\u2019d had to fight so hard for her objective, she\u2019d never completely surrendered herself the way she knew would happen tonight, the way a submissive was supposed to do. She hungered hard for it to come from Ben, but the reality was pretty unnerving.</p><p>She wanted to please him. Wanted to feel that sense of completion, of total belonging. She was as nervous about this night as a virgin on her wedding night. To her, it was the same, the level of commitment, the sense of no turning back.</p><p>While the physical was a big part of tonight, in the past three weeks, he hadn\u2019t neglected the emotional framework that would propel the physical to go to a far more intense level than she\u2019d yet experienced, God help her. She remembered what Rachel and Dana had said about Ben taking a woman\u2019s soul, never her heart, because that meant he had to give her his.</p> <p>If she read all the signals right, it would be a mutual exchange tonight. Ever since the day on the dock, he\u2019d been cautiously handing her pieces of his heart, of who he was, and she cherished all of it. Holding the white-chocolate strawberry now, she remembered helping him prepare for that dinner with the others. As always, he\u2019d gone through her grocery selections with meticulous care, but he\u2019d taught her well. Everything was fresh. While he cut a cucumber, she\u2019d asked him, \u201cWhat made you want to learn to cook like this?\u201d</p><p>Instead of a casual answer, like \u201cI like food\u201d, he\u2019d paused, knife in one hand, eyes on the vegetable he was slicing. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be so hungry you\u2019ll eat garbage, Marcie. I know why Scarlett O\u2019Hara felt the way she did.\u201d</p><p>Quiet, matter-of-fact. Honest. It was all he\u2019d said, but she was fine with that. She didn\u2019t mind learning about his life in small pieces, if that was easier for him, and it gave her something new to discover every day. She\u2019d slipped her arms around him, put her cheek to his back, just like she\u2019d done on the balcony that night. Putting his hand over hers, he clasped them against his sternum, then he\u2019d turned and fed her the cucumber piece, pleased when she said she liked the marinade he\u2019d brushed over it.</p><p>The car stopped, bringing her back to the present. When the door opened, she sensed she was being studied. She lifted her chin, straightened her back.</p><p>\u201cTake off the robe. Leave the slippers on for now. Come to me.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s voice. It was like feeling rain on her face after the heat of a drought. She smiled at him, she couldn\u2019t help it. Slipping the tie carefully, so she didn\u2019t transfer the stickiness of her fingers to it, she shrugged the silk off her shoulders, let it pool on her hips. As she moved across the seat toward his voice, he touched her arm. Since she wasn\u2019t allowed to speak, she couldn\u2019t warn him about the chocolate. But he\u2019d already seen it. He took her wrist, not her hand, and when he helped her out of the vehicle, he brought her fingers to his mouth.</p><p>It was incredibly intense, feeling that stimulation after a full day of waiting, imagining. The sight deprivation made it even more excruciating. She made a yearning noise as the wet heat of his mouth closed over each of the affected digits, his tongue swirling her clean.</p><p>\u201cDid you taste any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Master.\u201d She was standing naked before him, with no idea where she was, except she was outside, not in a parking deck. In the distance, she could hear cars, so they weren\u2019t in a secluded environment. The echo suggested they were surrounded by buildings...perhaps a side street. But it didn\u2019t matter. With the blindfold on, she was entirely at his mercy, and her mind settled into that mode, completely his. His.</p><p>\u201cLift your chin. This is temporary.\u201d</p><p>He buckled the slim collar on her, and she felt the tug of a tether snapped to it. \u201cFollow my lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, Master.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause at that, then the pressure increased. She stepped forward. It wasn\u2019t easy to walk normally when she couldn\u2019t see him, but she did her best, felt his hand brush her hip, guide and steady her to walk up two flights of steps. Then they were inside. The echo of the door closing suggested a large, open room. Maybe a loft? It had that old brick smell. Probably his place in the Warehouse District. She\u2019d never been to that one.</p><p>\u201cTake off the slippers. Kneel, submissive posture.\u201d</p><p>Folding her legs beneath her, she put her hands behind her back, kept her spine straight. Opened her knees. He let the leash drop so it dangled loosely between her breasts, down into that spread area. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m putting your mind in the right place for becoming my property, now and forever. I\u2019m going to immobilize you in a latex vacuum bed. It\u2019s like a cocoon, and has some nice modifications, thanks to Jon. I will decide when you\u2019ve been in it long enough. I will not speak to you, but I will be here, watching you, checking your breathing. You will never be alone. You understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cY-yes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stammer. Miracles can happen.\u201d His voice was amused, but it was also tender. She sensed him moving around her, wanted desperately for him to touch her, but she waited, holding the posture. \u201cAre you scared, brat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master. A little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s the way I want you. Ass in the air, forehead to the ground.\u201d</p><p>She used her stomach muscles to control her descent. His hands brushed her stomach and shoulder, making sure she got there safely. Then he put his hands on her buttocks, probed between them. Lube trickled into her rectum, and she moaned as his finger pushed in, stretching her. Her pussy wept, but he didn\u2019t touch it. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hot and wet a lot today, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPush out toward me. This is going to be thick, but you\u2019ll like the lubricant.\u201d</p><p>She complied, pressing her cheek into the floor as he worked the thick phallus into her ass. She moved her hips in eager response, wishing it was his cock, hoping she\u2019d get that sometime tonight. When it was all the way in, and she felt split in two, he held onto it, rocked it as she shuddered and her pussy trickled a free flow of arousal down her thighs once more. He made a tsking noise.</p><p>\u201cSit up, slowly, reach in front of you. The vacuum bed is there. Lie down on it.\u201d</p><p>He helped, lifting her off her feet and positioning her on the frame, covered with thin fabric. He made sure the plug stayed in until she had her hips against the solid surface, which drove it deeper. Then he pulled a second layer of fabric over her. She heard the zipper being fitted, running up along the side, enclosing her. There were holes for her breasts. He was stretching them around those, and the restriction was tight, like rubber bands, so that the seal on the cocoon wouldn\u2019t be broken, but it made her breasts tingle.</p><p>\u201cLegs spread as far as they can go, fingers flat on your thighs.\u201d While she made that adjustment, he coaxed her mouth open. A hollow gag was fitted there, her tongue depressed by it, her breath sounding fast and shallow. Okay, she was scared. This was...she was trusting all of herself to him. This was the real deal. Of course, she was also hot and revved up. It was worse than not licking the chocolate off her fingers, or resisting the overwhelming desire to touch her pussy these past few nights.</p><p>The zipper was now run behind her head, so she was enclosed fully in it, like a sleeping bag with the top closed. Way different from her childhood sleepovers though. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hear the vacuum engine now. It will take all the air out, and you\u2019ll be fully immobilized. You\u2019ll be left this way, until I feel you\u2019re in the proper state of mind. Nod if you understand.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>The vacuum switched on, a much quieter motor than she expected, but then he had said Jon was involved in the modifications. She\u2019d never seen one with cut-outs for the breasts like this. The tightening began, her body gradually being locked into the position. At first, she had a slight amount of movement, but the vacuum continued to remove even that slack area. Oh God...she was being completely held down. It was like having a laced mask on from head to toe, and being restrained at the same time. She couldn\u2019t see. She could hear though. He left the vacuum on to keep the restriction fully in force. Her fingers pressed hard on her thighs, so close to her pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou are just a body. My body, to do with as I wish. You have no identity except as my slave.\u201d</p><p>Yes, yes, yes. I love you, I want you, I serve you, Master. This was the full surrender she wanted, and God help her, she knew it was just beginning. He\u2019d removed the collar and tether, so it was just her, and the piercings. The cocoon had to be etching her body out as if she were naked.</p><p>Silence settled in, and all that came with it. She wanted him talking again, to be sure he was here. The arousal was intense. Throughout her pursuit of him, so much had been about movement, thinking, doing. This was about stillness, waiting, submission. He not only required her obedience, he\u2019d made it an irresistible demand, encasing her like this. She could let go and be whatever he wanted her to be in this moment, because that was all she\u2019d ever wanted\u2014to be what he needed and desired.</p><p>She\u2019d heard how time could pass in such a situation, five minutes seeming like fifteen, but experiencing it firsthand was a lot more effort. She had to bite down on that tube so she didn\u2019t talk, call out to him. Her body shook in the cocoon. Her nipples stayed tight and hard, exposed to the air. The muscles in her ass and pussy kept contracting, a mute plea, and of course when she contracted over that dildo, it sent all sorts of reaction spiraling through her.</p><p>He wanted her broken down, reduced to pure sensation. Whether she wanted that or not, it was going to happen. It made her recall something she\u2019d read on one of the fetish forums, a stream of consciousness offered by a submissive, right after she\u2019d undergone a deeply intense session.</p><p>There\u2019s this threshold of panic, where you realize he has all the control. I\u2019m not talking the safe word thing or being able to call a halt. He\u2019s plucked your free will right out of your hands, and you let him have it, and you don\u2019t want it back. That\u2019s what scares you shitless. You\u2019re just all his, and that\u2019s all you ever want to be. When you come out of the experience, you feel a bit like a kid coming out of a scary ride at Disneyland. Did that really happen? Will I have the courage to ride again? And you know you will.</p><p>That threshold of panic rose, heralded by the increased rasp of her breath. But that told him she was still breathing, so it wouldn\u2019t be cause for alarm. He wasn\u2019t going to respond to anything that wasn\u2019t physical distress. He wanted her to go through the emotional maelstrom. That was part of this.</p> <p>Her fingers curled, best as they were able, beneath the latex. Can\u2019t do this...too much... She tried to focus on the breathing. Need him to talk to me... Need his touch...</p><p>He was asking her to have faith in him the way God did. Sightless, without touch or visible evidence of his presence.</p><p>But just like God, there was visible evidence of his presence. The cocoon was part of that presence. Him bringing her here, the instructions. He was present in her life and guiding her in a variety of ways.</p><p>She suppressed a hysterical giggle. Yeah, she was sure the Sunday preachers would admire her analogy. At least Dana would understand. \u201cBen, Ben...\u201d She\u2019d uttered his name before she could stop herself, before she could bite it back. Though it was a bare whisper of sound echoing in that hollow gag, she knew she\u2019d screwed up. Spoken without being spoken to.</p><p>Then she did it again, louder, unable to help herself. \u201cBen. Ben. Please...\u201d It came through like a disembodied humming, the syllables unintelligible except to the male who seemed to know so much about her.</p><p>He waited another five hours, or so it seemed to her. That panic built hard and fast in her, taking over. When his hand touched her forehead, she let out a sob of relief. She recognized the shape and strength of his fingers. The touch was far too brief though.</p><p>\u201cEasy, brat. You have visitors. I want you on your best behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at those pretty tits, the nipples so hard.\u201d</p><p>Peter. Peter was in the room. She nearly choked.</p><p>\u201cIf you take out the gag, the opening\u2019s large enough she can get her tongue through the air hole. She can tease your cock with it.\u201d Jon, helpfully highlighting the features of the vacuum bed.</p><p>How long had they been here? She let out a strangled noise as a mouth touched her pussy, caressed her over the latex. Even with that thin barrier, the tongue and lips knew just how to work her up, get her wetter, make her whimper with the need to squirm against the erotic skill of that mouth.</p><p>\u201cNice. Slick and smooth, probably juicy as a peach on the inside. We need to open this up, let me smell her.\u201d</p><p>Lucas.</p><p>\u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t realize the latex showed so much detail. It\u2019s molded right to her cunt. You can see how erect her clit is.\u201d</p><p>Unlike the others, he\u2019d touched her intimately first, before speaking. His fingers trailed along her hip bone, over her pubic bone, a prominent mound. Her breath rasped through the tube. Pleasure, shock and thrilled amazement spiraled through her. He and Ben had chosen to address the elephant in the room head on. Lucas had just made it crystal clear he no longer saw her as a child. While Lucas would still be as protective as any of them, a guardian of her well-being, the shape of it had changed. She was Ben\u2019s, and therefore belonged to them all, in a far more adult way. She might be the youngest of the group, but she was now one of the Knights\u2019 women.</p><p>She\u2019d never been so aroused in her life, so emotionally stirred up as she imagined them circling her, studying what they might do to her under Ben\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cJon, can we open it up?\u201d His authoritative voice cut into her spinning mind, riveting her on his deep timbre.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. See the seam here?\u201d She shivered as a finger, probably Jon\u2019s, traced her pussy. \u201cUse a cutting tool to pop that seam, and it will stretch and seal around her cunt, just like her breasts. There\u2019s a second vacuum tube inserted in this area specifically to increase the seal there, compensate for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll handle that in a minute. Peter, take care of her nipples first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d What she assumed were Peter\u2019s fingers took a gentle hold of one nipple, fondling it before he began unscrewing the ball of one of the barbells. Nipple piercings were sensitive, and she was literally helpless, completely immobilized, so she couldn\u2019t help some trepidation. Four men surrounding her, acting\u2014as Ben said\u2014as if she was just a body for their pleasure, no will or voice of her own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Peter removed both her barbells with amazingly competent fingers, given how large his hands were. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel a little discomfort here, nothing much.\u201d</p><p>She held her breath, that little quiver in her stomach a frantic butterfly in a jar. Someone\u2019s hands cupped her breasts beneath, squeezing them to push the nipples up even higher. She thought it might be Lucas, because she caught the pleasing scent of the cologne he wore.</p><p>A tiny whispering sigh caught in her throat as something was threaded through one nipple piercing, then the other. It was the same type of bar as her barbells, just a little thicker, and the slender steel bar went all the way across between them. Peter was adding fasteners to the sides to hold it in place, and then he pinched the bar between thumb and forefinger, tugging on both nipples at once. She let out a soft cry against the breathing tube.</p><p>\u201cThese teardrop weights can be added to the bar.\u201d She heard the click of metal objects, perhaps being rolled in Peter\u2019s palm. \u201cIt will make her feel the pinch and burn a bit more. You can also attach a cable to the bar, connect it to a hook and raise or lower it to stretch out the nipples as much as she can stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d Ben\u2019s hands replaced Lucas\u2019 on her breasts, squeezing, flicking that bar. \u201cThey\u2019ve already gotten stiffer, bigger. She likes it. She\u2019d take first prize in a wet T-shirt contest. Lucas, your turn. I want her dripping, close to coming, but not there.\u201d</p><p>A precise touch, some pressure between her legs, and the seam was released, probably by Jon. Myriad small noises vibrated in her throat as he stretched the latex around the outside of her labia, and that second vacuum tube engaged, giving her an increased sense of constriction around already swollen tissues. She imagined it looked like a peach cut open in truth, the juices squeezing forth from it, tempting the tongue...</p><p>She cried out through the open gag as Ben caressed her pussy, pushed a finger inside to test her wetness. She wondered about what Jon had said, if she could service Ben\u2019s cock through that breathing hole. She could suck on him while...</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s more than ready. She\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it, she was so stimulated that she shrieked when Lucas\u2019 mouth touched her pussy. He flicked his tongue over her clit, traced the labia with lazy thoroughness, learning her. \u201cDifferent scent from her sister, but similar. They\u2019re both screamers though. You\u2019ve had bad, bad dreams about being in our bedroom, sucking my cock while I was going down on her, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a direct question, Marcie.\u201d</p><p>A few moments ago she\u2019d begged for someone to be talking to her. Now she wanted to be silent and just feel, but she managed to speak, garbled as it was. \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>Not Master. She had only one of those in the room, but she\u2019d give all of these men sir, because not to do so seemed unwise.</p><p>\u201cA polite slave. I like that.\u201d That tongue slid up her clit, around, teased under the hood, hot breath bathing her labia. She squirmed the tiny amount possible, and the nipple bar tingled. Especially when Peter came back and tapped something against it, something that...</p><p>\u201cArgh.\u201d She arched up as much as possible, which wasn\u2019t much. It made the sensation all the more excruciatingly intense. Some type of electrical wand, sparking shock along that bar.</p><p>\u201cGood response,\u201d Peter murmured. \u201cVery nice. Give me the other one, Jon.\u201d Then he did it again, a different sensation.</p><p>Lucas tugged her clit ring in his teeth. She was going to come, she was going to... \u201cMaster...I need to come...going to come.\u201d She sounded like she had a mouth full of marbles, or in this case, tubing, but Ben understood.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d His tone was sharp, stern. \u201cYou don\u2019t have my permission to do that. You\u2019re here to serve the Masters\u2019 pleasure, not your own.\u201d</p><p>She bit back a groan, but bore down, trying her best to hold out against the diabolical workings of that tongue. When she was younger, Marcie had wondered about the jagged rips in her sister\u2019s pillowcases, and why she\u2019d had to replace them so often. Her sister had likely gnawed holes in them so the rest of the house wouldn\u2019t hear her screaming.</p><p>\u201cYou belong to me, Marcie.\u201d Ben\u2019s voice. \u201cWhen it suits me, you belong to them. But to no one else. No other Master touches you, ever again.\u201d</p><p>She jolted from another mild shock through the nipple bar, the sensation arrowing down to where Lucas\u2019 mouth was working her. Then Peter\u2019s mouth got into the act, covering one of the nipples, licking above and under that bar.</p><p>Another shriek reverberated in her ears. She couldn\u2019t not come. She had to come. Had to...</p><p>\u201cSorry...can\u2019t...Master...help...\u201d</p> <p>It swept over her so hard, there was no stopping it. She wailed, cried out, pleaded for all sorts of unlikely things. Lucas kept working her with his mouth, Peter and Jon a mixture of mouth, fingers and tiny touches of electric stimulus. Ben hadn\u2019t touched her nearly enough.</p><p>It was indescribable, coming under that level of restriction and restraint, so hard, deep, dirty, so intense it was almost uncomfortable, because she had no ability to move herself against Lucas\u2019 mouth or Peter\u2019s touch. When they finally withdrew, she was making tiny jerks as if Peter was hitting her with far harder voltage.</p><p>She needed to see Ben. Needed Ben period, and then she heard his voice again.</p><p>\u201cPut her on the web.\u201d</p><p>When the vacuum noise stopped, the touch of the latex began to ease. She still had that blindfold though. The hollow gag was pulled from her mouth. Her breasts and cunt tingled from the return of blood flow to those areas.</p><p>When she was freed from the cocoon, her legs had no ability to hold her, but she needn\u2019t have worried. She was swung up in Ben\u2019s arms. He was wearing his suit, his tailored shirt and silk tie pressing against her skin, his slacks and belt against her bare hip. Were they all dressed for the office, and her here, naked, stripped down to nothing but sticky arousal, mussed hair? It perversely turned her on even more.</p><p>He put her on her knees. \u201cJon\u2019s making a change to the web, so you have a minute. Get busy. And don\u2019t you let that dildo come out of your pretty ass. Keep those muscles tight, like it\u2019s my cock.\u201d She heard the sound of his slacks being opened and made a noise of eager hunger. She would have surged forward on her knees, but he clamped his hand down on her hair to hold her steady as he fed her his cock, thick and enormous, pre-cum oozing from the slit, telling her how her helplessness had affected him. He thrust in hard, ruthless, working her mouth the way he\u2019d pound into her pussy when he wanted to sate his lust.</p><p>She loved it, sucked on him as hard as she could, working him in her mouth, taking him deep, loving how he stretched her lips, the tears of stress that came to her eyes as she tried her best to take all of him. Rough and hard was the way she wanted it. When she gripped him, he didn\u2019t stop her, so she made the most of the opportunity, working that thin layer of heated skin up and down his shaft, giving him that friction, tightening her fingers around his ridged head, using the lubrication from the slit to give him further pleasure.</p><p>Too soon, though, he pulled back. Peter\u2019s hands on her again, removing the nipple bar, then Ben lifted her beneath the arms effortlessly. She was placed face forward against a suspended rope net, like the rigging of a pirate ship. Her arms were threaded through two separate openings, wrists bound to the line above it. Her knees were guided into another pair of openings, so her weight wasn\u2019t pulling against her shoulders. More rope passed around her waist, then knotted at her sternum before the two ends were guided between her breasts and to her shoulders to form a Y-shape. Two sets of hands were working on her. Because of those three weeks of casual caresses, she realized she could tell who was who. Apparently both Peter and Jon knew the art of Japanese bondage. She was being trussed to that web, as well as having her upper body harnessed inside a complicated weaving of knots. Helpless, total restraint.</p><p>She made a quiet noise as her breasts were lifted in capable hands and worked through two openings in the web, reinforced by further weavings by Peter and Jon. In the end, her breasts were squeezed, constricted, the nipples becoming even more sensitive to the open air. They\u2019d be jutting out, displayed and framed by the ropes, and with her bound this way, the men could do anything they liked to them. Peter replaced the nipple bar, which essentially locked her on the web with steel as well as rope. The lines that were taken over her shoulders had been reattached to the waist rope, leaving her pussy and ass unencumbered except for the wraps of rope that held her thighs firmly to the web. Since one of the horizontal lines was pressed against her clit, she squirmed against it, unable to help herself.</p><p>\u201cNone of that.\u201d She jumped as a switch touched her buttock, a sharp sting. Then Ben\u2019s hand was there, working that dildo in her ass. \u201cClench down, as if it was my cock. Like you were imagining, that night in your bed. Say what you were thinking, out loud for all of us to hear.\u201d</p><p>Her arousal shot up even higher, even as she blushed. \u201cFuck me...with your cock. Master...harder...please. Ohh...\u201d She remembered how her climax had taken her over, without his permission to release. It made her pussy ripple with an aftershock even now.</p><p>She clenched over the dildo, groaning with the sensation. \u201cKeep doing it,\u201d he ordered, and she obeyed as the others finished what they were doing. Even her head was secured to the web, a line that ran around her forehead. With her legs spread, knees tied down, her body completely restrained, she was able to be fucked, sucked, whatever they desired. The web gave them the flexibility to angle her as they desired.</p><p>\u201cBeautifully done.\u201d He touched her flank with that switch again, a quick sting. \u201cThank the Masters properly, Marcie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-thank you...Master Peter. Master Jon...Master Lucas. Thank you for using me for my Master\u2019s pleasure and your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGorgeous.\u201d That came from Jon. He caressed her shoulder as he tested the bindings once more. \u201cWelcome to the family, love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then Peter cupped her breasts, a flick of his tongue over the sensitized nipples. \u201cYour breasts are as beautiful as your sister\u2019s. Pure honey skin.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Lucas. His hand trailed over her face, a softer, more thoughtful caress, but then that hand dropped, found her dripping cunt, fingered her until she was growling like a needy cat.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to talk Cass into that fantasy I have, don\u2019t you? Particularly since it\u2019s your fantasy as well.\u201d</p> <p>That sent a spasm through her, particularly when his fingers stroked her clit so knowledgeably. \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>A touch of amusement entered his voice, tangled with a good degree of lust. When Lucas got home tonight, she was pretty sure Cass was going to get a good workout. \u201cI\u2019m sure I won\u2019t get that kind of deference when she\u2019s off this web, Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still has a punishment coming,\u201d Peter offered, creating a spiral of anxiety in her lower belly. \u201cMaybe that will help her remember to be more respectful. For a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I have a certain code, Marcie,\u201d Ben said, staying frustratingly out of reach. She licked her lips, remembering the taste of his cock. \u201cAbout letting my submissive top from the bottom. You need to remember your place is firmly on the bottom, always. Five switches from each of them to drive the lesson home.\u201d</p><p>Despite the threat, Marcie clung to his voice. She was in high gear, stimulated by all of this, but her emotional hunger was nowhere near sated. She needed him. Would eventually beg if she had to do so.</p> <p>She remembered how much the switching had hurt from Ben, but how it had made her so hot, knowing she\u2019d given him the right to do it. Now he was offering it to the others as a rite of passage, as part of her initiation. A ball gag was pushed into her mouth with cloth wadding to absorb the saliva. Then it was buckled tightly around her head, as her fingers clutched the ropes. She shook her head several times, trying to shake off the fear, the anticipation of the pain. She needed to do this. Punishment was necessary. Her Master said so.</p><p>She yelped as the first one hit. She didn\u2019t know who it was until he was done, alternating between the right and left buttock. \u201cNice striping,\u201d Peter commented. \u201cHand it over, Jon.\u201d</p><p>She was braced for five more strikes, but not for them being around her breasts. She let out a startled cry as the switch stung the top of her breast, brought down upon both of them from above, since Peter was a tall guy. His large hand curved around her nape, holding her there as he administered four more, at different angles, probably making a crisscross shape of red lines on her distended curves.</p><p>Lucas got her inner thighs, not quite hitting her pussy, but close enough she felt the reverberation through it. She was gasping, holding on to those ropes for dear life. Fire was spreading across her flesh, and then Ben gathered her hair, wrapping it into a tight tail, securing it high on her head, baring her neck for the press of his mouth.</p><p>She shuddered, moaned like a dove, needy. She wanted the gag gone. But she was at the mercy of her Master. Then he was removing it from her mouth, answering her prayers.</p><p>\u201cNo more topping. No more misbehaving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve had that conversation with Dana before.\u201d Peter\u2019s snort sent a ripple of humor through the men.</p><p>Dana misbehaved because she needed to feel her Master\u2019s yoke, its reassurance. That was a part of it for Marcie, but it was more than that also. Sometimes her Master needed her to misbehave, to give him the outlet of punishment, to feed his sadistic side. It gave her as much pleasure as it gave him. So in as demure a voice as she could muster, she managed two words. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s snort was quite distinguishable from Peter\u2019s. \u201cJust for that...\u201d</p><p>She started out with \u201cNo, no, no...\u201d because hell, it hurt so bad, having that switch strike her buttocks, her thighs. The pain was intense, excruciating, because it didn\u2019t take much with a switch. He knew her better than they did, knew how much she could take, what she craved. On ten, she gasped with relief, her legs quivering.</p><p>Things had gotten quiet again. She could hear Ben\u2019s breath, his shoes tapping as he moved, studying her stretched and tormented body from every angle, she was sure. She ached for him. Her pussy hadn\u2019t stopped dripping yet, and her ass, legs and breasts were on fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Marcie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever my Master desires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he desires?\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t help it, her lips curved, even as a few tears ran out from under the mask. \u201cTo fuck me. Please, Master.\u201d</p><p>She listened to the polished dress shoes move behind her. His fingers touched her ass, worked the dildo so that she spasmed in near climax once more, crying out. Then it was pulled free.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cock, Master. In my ass. Please. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a moment. We have a late arrival. Someone who takes the topping issue almost as seriously as I do.\u201d</p><p>A late arrival? There was only one... She hadn\u2019t expected him, not with Savannah pregnant, but then she felt his touch. Matt\u2019s firm hand was as unique as the four others. She recalled his fingers tracing the shell of her ear as they now slid along her spine, up to her nape. As he moved around her, he must have gripped the rope, because her body swayed on the web.</p><p>\u201cI expect Ben will have to stay on his toes, keeping you in line.\u201d A statement of fact, not really a question, but the Master\u2019s tone was so clear, rippling through her every nerve ending, she knew a response was needed.</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>A masculine chuckle. \u201cLucky man. We\u2019re all lucky in that regard.\u201d She drew in a breath as Matt\u2019s hand caressed her throat, then cupped her cheek in a firm hold. \u201cYou won\u2019t push it to the lengths you\u2019ve pushed it before this night though. Will you?\u201d</p><p>She was incapable of lying, even to save her tender skin. \u201cUnless my Master needs me to push it, sir.\u201d</p><p>Five more from Ben, and as she shrieked through the impact, she pressed her face hard into Matt\u2019s large hand, bit down to contain it all. The sound of her flesh being whipped just made it even more intense. Matt didn\u2019t move away, letting her lock her jaw on the calloused mound of his palm. With the other hand, he held her head rigidly still, reinforcing the rope bindings on it, his fingers tangled in her hair. When Ben finished, she was gasping for air. A handkerchief touched her face, Matt taking away her tears.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him, Marcie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cAlways. He\u2019s my Master.\u201d</p><p>Matt brushed his lips against her forehead, both cheeks. \u201cYes, he is. Make him deserve you, sweet girl. And love him like he deserves.\u201d</p><p>A reminder of their talk, and a blessing from the patriarch at once. She pressed her lips into his palm once more, soothing where she\u2019d bitten with a shy touch of her tongue. Another chuckle, and he gave her hair a reproving tug. \u201cShe\u2019s a handful, Ben. She\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is.\u201d There was a silence, in which she imagined Ben and Matt exchanging a look that, like everything tonight, made things right. Balanced. Then she heard Matt moving away.</p><p>Now it was just her and Ben. Alone.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>At the blissful sound of his slacks being unbelted, opened, she was already pushing out toward him, her sphincter muscles contracting. He let out a soft oath, his fingers dipping in to caress that rim.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re flaring, love. A beautiful red rosebud, begging for my cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>He was wearing a condom, a surprise, but it made him nice and slick. He stretched her as she made those animal noises, which became a long cry when he slid in fully, pressing his thighs and pelvis firmly against her abused buttocks.</p><p>\u201cWhose are you, Marcie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours, Master. All yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I want to fuck your ass all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your right. I belong to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake you suck my cock until your jaw cramps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI belong...to you. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen clutch me with those muscles like I taught you.\u201d</p><p>She did, until she was struggling against exhaustion. But she reveled in every thrust, his grunts, the ropes rubbing against her flesh, the constriction around her breasts, her waist, her legs, everywhere she was bound. His pelvis pressing against her ass, making the welts from the switch burn, a reminder of his claim on her. The moist heat of his breath against her neck.</p><p>The others might still be watching, they might be gone, but for her there was only him right now. And then she was sure they were gone, because he loosened the blindfold, let it drop.</p><p>It was his loft apartment. Whereas the dungeon in the Garden District was full of luxurious pieces with satin polished wood and velvet, this one was a sparsely outfitted torture chamber, intended to be intimidating with its hard dark floors, blackened windows, single-bulb lights hanging from the ceiling. It was separated from the rest of the apartment by a thick curtain of overlapping thick plastic strips, like at a construction site.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t move everything to the Garden District. I like the idea of having this equipment close to work. Particularly if I need to take a particular K&amp;A employee home for lunch and discipline her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat employee might decide to work for Tennyson Industries. The pay\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, a dangerous, thrilling sound, his breath on her neck. \u201cSavannah can\u2019t match our benefits. I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>There was the sound of the condom being removed. When he came to stand before her, he\u2019d left the slacks open, his erect cock pushing up and out of the fabric. He got up close and personal, so she was staring into those vivid eyes and his cock brushed against her belly through the opening of the ropes. He cupped her face, traced her cheekbone, caught strands of her hair. \u201cMy sweet slave,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Stepping back, he unbuttoned his shirt, shrugged it off, dropped the slacks and shoved off his briefs, got rid of all of it. It was the first time he\u2019d given her that pleasure when she was conscious enough to appreciate it. He was beautiful, every bare, perfect inch. She saw some unexpected scars, high on his thigh, at his abdomen, but they fit the tough, muscled body. The light mat of dark hair arrowed down to his groin and sprinkled his thighs and calves. A virile male animal. If this was Beauty and the Beast, she\u2019d want him to stay the growling, dangerous Beast, never become the cultured, much-too-gentle prince. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEyes down, Marcie.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, and had the pleasure and anticipation of watching him take that thick cock in his hand. She\u2019d love to watch him masturbate, see how those strong fingers milked seed out of the thick organ. The night he\u2019d told her he was doing that in front of the TV, she imagined him ordering her to stay on her knees next to him, eyes down while he jacked off. Then he\u2019d torment her further by letting her clean him with her tongue, licking his seed off his balls and thighs, the base of his shaft, the broad head.</p><p>His other arm slid through the ropes, around her waist, palm settling on her buttock to use the ropes\u2019 flexibility to angle her properly for him. It tilted her away from him, so that with her head firmly anchored to the web, she had to strain her gaze to keep looking down as he\u2019d ordered and see as much as she could within that range.</p> <p>He pushed into her pussy, stretching her out with excruciating slowness, that harrowing, almost too-full feeling she\u2019d never tire of experiencing. He kept going until his thighs pressed against the inside of hers. He kept his hand on her ass, but brought the other one back to the side of her neck, fingers twisting in her hair tight. He withdrew, then slid back in, keeping his eyes on hers.</p><p>No words; none needed. This was a taking, his mouth in that ruthless set, eyes unwavering, and she returned that in full measure, holding the lock, letting him see her helpless pleasure, hear the unintelligible pleas for her Master that broke from her lips, increasing the fire in his eyes. He was building her up to that incredible peak again, and bound as she was, she had no control. He had it all. But it wasn\u2019t a one-sided thing. She could see his total attention on her, how her surrender absorbed him...overwhelmed him, brought him into an untouchable space with her. It was just the two of them, giving, taking, until those two sides were fully twined together, the two of them fused.</p><p>He came closer, put his mouth on hers. It brought her to life like a detonator. She tried to devour him, would have if she hadn\u2019t been so completely restrained. As it was, she made little crazed sounds in her throat, conveying her madness without words. She needed him, needed him.</p><p>Oh God, his cock felt good. He was pressed to her now, his chest a broad wall against her bound breasts, pelvis rocking against her thighs. The angle was precarious, narrow, and it rubbed him against her clit in a tiny, teasing touch. In, out. With how thick he was, every thrust and withdrawal made her burn even hotter, the excruciating stretch of his size keeping the climax just out of reach for the moment. Scraping his teeth against hers, he nipped, tongue teasing her lips as he held her head still. He was a master at building an explosion inside a finite space, the pressure becoming so dense until she was sure she\u2019d shatter from the inside out. But she squeezed down on him. She wanted him to come with her, get lost in this, stay in that bubble together.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease come for me, Master.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou...first.\u201d</p><p>His voice was satisfyingly hoarse. It infused her with pleasure and power, and she had to hear him come, wanted to know she\u2019d been able to give him that. \u201cPlease, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways...trying to...argue.\u201d He pulled his lips back from his teeth, maybe a feral grin, maybe a rictus of control, trying to hold back his climax. \u201cRight now, Marcie. Obey your Master. Your pussy is mine. You do what I tell you to do with it...or you won\u2019t be sitting for a week.\u201d</p><p>Putting his hand between them then, he found her clit. That mere brush of friction and she lost control. She protested, a brief plea, and then she was coming, milking him hard with the spasms, such that she got what she wanted as well. He came right in the middle of her own climax, grunting at the intensity of it, making tears spring to her eyes as his fingers bruised in their hold on her buttock. She liked the idea of those bruises, but it was all part of a whirling vortex of sensation as she screamed out her pleasure once again, her body unable to resist anything he desired of her.</p><p>He was her Master, after all.</p><p>When that climax left her, so did every scrap of energy she had. It wasn\u2019t just the physical. There was a haze over her mind, a numb aftermath of ecstasy, a postpartum experience that kept her drifting, malleable, limp. She was aware of him freeing her. He put the collar back on her, as well as the tether. Twining it around his wrist, he lifted her tenderly as a child cradled in his arms. He walked through those thick plastic curtains, and they were in a well-appointed loft apartment with masculine furniture, a big flat-screen, a kitchen full of silver appliances. There were intriguing pieces of art on the walls.</p> <p>Moving across that space, he took her into a large bathroom. She smelled fragrant steam, sensed flickering candlelight.</p><p>She was shivering, but he stepped into a large Jacuzzi tub, sat down, putting her between his knees, wrapping an arm around her middle and pressing her head back on his shoulder. She didn\u2019t know how long the tub had been running or who had drawn the bath. Jon had likely invented something to keep the water nice and hot.</p><p>\u201cNo talking,\u201d Ben said quietly. \u201cNot unless I give you permission.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think she could form words anyway, so that was good. But she drifted around in that haze as he wet her hair, cleaned it, fingers combing, massaging her nape. Then he shifted her around to all fours and attached the tether to a ring on the tub wall to keep her in that position. Using a moisturizing soap, he cleaned her skin, then followed that up with a warming oil he worked all over her body, paying particular attention to her joints and muscles. Her nipples still held that steel bar, replaced by him, and it was a provocative weight in her all-fours position. Then he turned his attention to her pussy and ass.</p><p>He cleaned her thoroughly, embarrassingly so, then worked in more soothing oils, spreading her legs out farther, making her whimper at the ripples of response he started. She was so sensitive, as if that climax had permanently awoken nerve endings that responded with jolts of pleasure to his every touch.</p><p>Unhooking the tether, he spoke in a quiet rumble against her ear. \u201cPut your arms around me, baby.\u201d</p><p>She did, and he lifted her out of the tub, taking her to her knees on a stack of soft towels. He used a couple others to dry her while she leaned against the inside of his right leg. He massaged her head for a long time, almost putting her to sleep. She could barely keep her head up by the time he combed her hair, but he steadied her chin with one hand.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think...you did this.\u201d</p> <p>When his fingers stilled, she realized she\u2019d spoken aloud. \u201cSorry,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a pass on that one. Tell me what you meant.\u201d</p><p>She laid her head on his bare thigh, managed to lever her gaze open enough to see he\u2019d donned a pair of short, clingy boxers. She could see the size of him beneath it, the generous curve of his balls, and she wanted to touch, nip. Squeeze. She took a steadying breath. \u201cI guess...because of how you are, I thought you\u2019d have somebody else handle aftercare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHand you off like a serving girl who\u2019s met my needs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. Which is kind of a turn-on, the psych...sic...psychology of it.\u201d She fumbled with her thick tongue. \u201cBut I like this even better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like this too.\u201d He braided her hair into two tails, wrapped them together and used a band to hold them back off her face. Sensing he was gathering his thoughts, she didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cIn the not-too-distant future, I will take you to the K&amp;A boardroom and allow the others to pleasure you there. It\u2019s another little tradition we have.\u201d</p><p>She knew that, thanks to Dana\u2019s provocative description. Savannah and Cass had both experienced the full sensual onslaught of the five K&amp;A men in their boardroom, before either had committed their hearts to their respective Masters. Dana and Rachel had enjoyed it later. For Dana it had been a special birthday present; for Rachel, her first wedding anniversary.</p><p>In the short time Marcie had been working for Ben, she hadn\u2019t had the chance to sneak in and check it out, but from Dana she knew the K&amp;A boardroom had some ingenious engineering, thanks to Jon\u2019s aptitude and the other men\u2019s imaginations. It was the ultimate adult Transformer, the table, screens and cameras able to serve an entirely different purpose when the men desired them to do so.</p><p>\u201cI decided not to do that tonight,\u201d Ben continued. He stroked her hair, a more tender touch that drew her eyes up to his serious face. \u201cFor a long time,\u201d he said quietly, holding her gaze, \u201cI rejected the possibility of someone belonging to me totally, of serving me the way I wanted. My demands can be extreme, so I learned to behave as if I didn\u2019t want that. But what I really wanted, always wanted, was someone to belong to me fully. Like this. I wanted to prepare her from head to toe, take care of everything, because you\u2019re mine, entirely. To care for, to punish, to pleasure. This first time, I wanted you to experience that in a more personal space. A space that was mine alone.\u201d</p><p>Her heart cracked open. \u201cWhat can your slave do for you now?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhatever I demand.\u201d His hands remained gentle, despite the intriguing threat. \u201cBut she has a choice to make first.\u201d</p><p>Reaching toward a drawer, he opened it, removed a carved wooden box. When he flipped it open, her heart jumped in her throat and stayed there.</p><p>It was a collar. Simple, elegant stainless steel, with a key-pin-locking mechanism and matching cuffs. She\u2019d seen a variety of more complex and decorative collars, but in a blink she understood that this meshed with the type of Master Ben was. Something that made it clear in no uncertain terms that this was a collar and cuffs for his property, his submissive. There was an etching on each. Three forget-me-nots. As she tilted the collar toward the light, her eyes stung. Always yours was etched on the inside.</p><p>He met her gaze. \u201cLast chance, Marcie. I put these on, you\u2019re mine, irrevocably. You\u2019ve been a student of who and what the K&amp;A men are for a long time. You\u2019re my choice, and that\u2019s forever. You put these on, you take them off only when I give you permission to do so, and that\u2019s probably only going to be for their cleaning and care.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Remembering her earlier thoughts, she knew she\u2019d been right. This moment meant as much to her as being presented an engagement ring, the commitment the same. Deeper in some ways, because she knew what it meant to him. While he finally understood and accepted what she was offering, it said he was now demanding it from her.</p><p>Tears were rolling down her face. Seeing them, his mouth softened. She lifted fingers to his lips, touched.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want to be yours, Ben. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted. I\u2019ve only been waiting on you.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted in a wry smile. \u201cLeave it to you to get that little dig in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t say I had to be docile and silent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do my very best, Master,\u201d she said prudently. \u201cUnless you prefer me to fall short in that area, in which case I\u2019m certain I can excel at that.\u201d</p><p>Though he chuckled, his response was somber, intent. \u201cYou embrace the hard stuff, love it, but I don\u2019t ever want to push you beyond what you can bear, Marcie. You\u2019re going to have to help me learn how to love you. I\u2019ve done a lot of things with women, but that\u2019s one thing I haven\u2019t practiced much.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been practicing a long time. Savannah, Cass, Dana, Rachel, my younger sisters...Ben, you love all of us. You love Peter, Matt, Lucas and Jon. You\u2019ve looked out for them, been part of our family, no matter what.\u201d She met his gaze. \u201cAll those letters...you\u2019ve been winning my heart, loving me, for seven years. I trust you. Please give me your collar, Master. I can\u2019t bear another moment without it.\u201d</p><p>A muscle worked in his jaw. Picking up the collar, he closed it around her throat. It lay lightly on her collarbone but had enough of a weight and a snug enough fit it stole her breath in all the right ways, sent her brain in a hundred different directions, while keeping one part of it very still, very focused.</p><p>His. His. His.</p><p>The cuffs just underscored it. He caressed her pulse beneath them, looked at her like that, all naked but for that mark of ownership. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said at last, then lifted her in his arms again.</p><p>He carried her back out into the loft. On this side, the thick plastic curtain was camouflaged by strategically placed screens. Tonight they\u2019d been adjusted so she could still see the equipment, the latex vacuum bed where she\u2019d lain. Turning her attention to the rest of the apartment, she found a king-sized bed on the lower level, piled up with pillows. She assumed that one was his. But he carried her up the stairs to the open room above it, where there was another king-sized bed and a window to look out at the New Orleans\u2019 lights. Putting her arms around his shoulders, she pressed her face into his throat, her lips there.</p><p>\u201cI feel so floaty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were gone, baby. Off in subspace. You\u2019re still there. You don\u2019t worry about anything. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>He laid her down in the bed, arranged the covers over her. She suppressed a sigh. She didn\u2019t want him to leave, but she knew he didn\u2019t sleep with women, and there was another bed downstairs. Small steps. No. No, she didn\u2019t want that. He\u2019d said to be herself, tell him what she wanted, needed.</p><p>As he moved back toward the stairs, she made a noise and he turned, eyebrow cocked. \u201cWhat is it, Marcie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go. Please...come sleep with me?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a crooked smile, one that made those emerald green eyes an even deeper color. \u201cWhere else would I be sleeping, brat? I\u2019m just turning off the light. The downstairs bed is a guest bed. Closer to the kitchen and bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d When darkness descended, the lights from the city cast a dim glow over the room. She waited with bated breath until he slid in behind her, lifting her thigh with a firm hand so he could slide his cock between her legs, rest it against her sore pussy, a reminder that she would serve him whenever he desired. But tonight, this was enough. She curved her fingers over his on her breast, glad when he didn\u2019t tell her not to do that. He put his lips against her neck, against that new collar. \u201cSleep. That\u2019s my last command of the night. Just sleep.\u201d</p><p>She was lost to dreams within minutes.</p><p>When she woke, it took her a moment to remember\u2014joyously\u2014where she was. But she was alone. Before she could panic over that, she realized two things. One, Ben was moving around the kitchen below. Two, she was still wearing his collar and cuffs. A wonderfully familiar aroma was drifting up from the kitchen, but she couldn\u2019t quite place it since it wasn\u2019t a normal breakfast smell.</p> <p>Rising, she ran her hands through her hair. She didn\u2019t see clothes for her, not even his shirt, and before she could think about what that meant, he\u2019d realized she was up.</p><p>\u201cNo clothes, unless you\u2019re cold. Just the collar and cuffs, Marcie. Come down here.\u201d</p><p>She did, her legs shaking a little from last night\u2019s exertions, and at the reality of what it all meant. Rising in his bed, coming to him as his, first thing in the morning, every day for the rest of her life. He was wearing only a pair of faded jeans, no shirt, and saliva gathered in her mouth just at the sight of him. As he straightened from doing something with the oven, she obeyed her first desire. Her eyes and mouth soft, she walked right into him, put her arms around his waist, pressed her cheek to his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Master,\u201d she said against his skin.</p><p>He slid his arms around her tight, held her that way a long moment, lips in her hair. \u201cGood morning, brat.\u201d Then she gave a little yelp as he hit her bare bottom with the heated spatula. \u201cGo kneel on the pillow by my chair. Going to feed you some breakfast. We have to be in the office in a couple hours for the Chen meet. I assume you\u2019re ready for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be. Um, if I have clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch as I\u2019d love to see Chen\u2019s reaction to you sashaying in bare-assed naked, I had Cass pack you another overnight bag. Max brought it last night when he dropped you off. Do you have your Pickard job in the afternoon?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cTell him not to send you on any more investigative jobs that involve going toe to toe with security thugs or I\u2019ll have his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI handled that guy just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d He gave her a bolstering grin, but a sharp look right along with it. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>She pouted a little bit about that, started working on how she was going to get around it, just as he brought a sizeable piece of warm chocolate cake to the table, not yet iced. He\u2019d brought a bowl of icing to take care of that. She stared at the plate, her mouth now watering for other reasons. \u201cYou made me cake.\u201d</p><p>Start every day with chocolate cake. That way, no matter what else happens, the day started with something perfect.</p><p>She lifted her gaze to him. \u201cAre you worried about how the day will end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re not going to be part of it.\u201d He tossed the spatula and the oven mitt onto the counter, then sat down on the chair, swinging his leg over her head so she was kneeling between his spread thighs. Her gaze couldn\u2019t help going downward and thinking about how good that chocolate icing would taste, spread on his cock.</p><p>He tweaked her breast, making her yelp. \u201cBehave, brat. You get sick on icing, it\u2019ll spoil your appetite for the cake.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think anything could spoil her appetite for the man in front of her. Now all the way through forever. He liked the bad girl in her, would always like that. As much as she liked the bad boy in him. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave your strength. You have a busy day ahead. Tonight, after Pickard, I want you to come back to the office. Bring that mask you wore on the parking deck.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, but she had to open her mouth fast for the bite of cake or she would have been wearing it. She gave him a narrow glance as he patted at her lips with a tsking noise. Then the taste hit her. \u201cOh God. Oh my God. This is as good as sex.\u201d</p><p>When he laughed, it captivated her, the way it made him look younger, happier. She\u2019d missed that side of him. But as he continued, her thoughts went to an entirely different but no less pleasurable place.</p><p>\u201cI turn the car over to the auction tomorrow. So tonight I\u2019m going to fuck you on the hood, exactly the way you were taunting me to do it on that security footage. Then Lewis can have it.\u201d</p><p>She vividly imagined it. Ben, tying her wrists to the rearview mirrors, bending her over the hood in those teetering heels, hand smacking her ass to get it good and red before he rammed into her... She was getting short of breath just thinking of it.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cass said that your package arrived, whatever that means. She put it in the bag and told me I wasn\u2019t allowed to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh.\u201d Marcie brightened, momentarily distracted from lust. As she started to scramble off the pillow, over to the bag, she caught herself just in time. \u201cMaster, may I... I have something for you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a quizzical look, but nodded with warm approval at her remembering to ask permission. It pleased her down to her toes. Then he got a devilish glint in his eyes. \u201cIf you do it on your hands and knees.\u201d</p><p>Which she was sure gave him quite a view of her ass and pussy as she moved the few necessary feet to the end of the kitchen counter. Opening the bag, seeing the wrapped package, a tiny smile bloomed in her heart. She loved the K&amp;A women.</p><p>As she came back to him, she noticed he was just as fascinated by how her breasts swayed heavy and full in the all-fours position. During the night, he\u2019d replaced the bar with the nipple rings strung with the emeralds, the ones she\u2019d worn to match her clit piercing. Studying them and the movement of her breasts, he was getting hard and thick again against the jeans. It was obvious from that spread thigh position. They might just be late to that meeting after all. She could hardly wait. But first she wanted to give him this.</p><p>The package was wrapped in paper covered with a toy car pattern, a silver bow on top. He lifted his brow and she grinned. \u201cThe night at Surreal...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The moment she said the words, his gaze shadowed. She couldn\u2019t stand that. Setting the package at his elbow, she rose on her knees, put one hand on his thigh, the other on his face. \u201cIf I have to accept you\u2019re at fault, you have to accept I\u2019ve completely forgiven you. I can\u2019t regret that night, Ben. It resulted in you opening your heart to me. Because of that, I\u2019d go through it again a hundred times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t let you. I\u2019d cut off my arms first. Max would shoot me long before that.\u201d</p><p>When he pressed his lips to her eye, her nose, then her throat, his hands sliding up to cup her breasts, she lost her focus. \u201cStop,\u201d she said breathlessly, laughter in her voice. \u201cI have to give you your gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my gift.\u201d</p><p>Extricating herself from him, she snatched the package and thrust it between them. \u201cI actually got this gift to remind you that I forgive you for that night.\u201d Sobering, she put a hand on his chest. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>His look twisted her heart. She managed a smile. \u201cEvery time you see it, you can decide if I was worth it. Once you put it together, that is. You might need Jon\u2019s help. There\u2019s like a million pieces.\u201d</p><p>She liked his intrigued look, his obvious eagerness to open a gift from her. She couldn\u2019t wait to do Christmas with him. As he tore off the paper, Marcie couldn\u2019t suppress her grin when he recognized it as a model kit for a Mercedes-Benz McLaren Roadster. Cocking that handsome brow at her, he tapped the contents list. \u201cIt says \u2018glue gun required\u2019. I can think of some interesting things to do with a glue gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d She sat back on her heels, her hands on his knees, but Ben noticed her attention was no longer on her gift. She was in the position she\u2019d been in that first day, climbing over his legs to retrieve his pen, then sitting up between his knees just like this. Her gaze passed with a far more blatant appraisal over his erection before those mink lashes lifted. \u201cSomething I can do for you, Mr. O\u2019Callahan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Setting aside the model, he put his hand on her face, touching her mouth, imagining it about to be stretched by his cock, her lips swollen and glistening while her pussy worked itself into the same state, readying itself for him. \u201cYou make me come fast enough, you might just get a spanking before you go into work.\u201d</p><p>That was the only incentive she needed. Opening his jeans, she leaned forward, her lips already parted. Ben closed his hand on her shoulder as she teased his head with her tongue, tracing the broad head all the way around, and then doing a little nip-suck maneuver on the top like an ice cream cone, teasing the slit. Jesus...</p><p>She played with him like that for a good few moments until he\u2019d had enough of it and moved his hand to her hair, tightening there. \u201cTake me all the way in, brat. Deep throat.\u201d</p><p>Those sweet lips stretching, that slick, hot throat, so like her cunt, sucking him, tongue playing the throbbing veins on the underside like a damn violin. He thrust up into her mouth, and she made a noise at the stress, but it was a noise of pleasure. She liked it rough, his slave. She wanted icing on his cock, wanted to lick it off. He\u2019d maybe give her that later, but right now he just wanted her sucking on him like this. Then he wanted to fuck her on the kitchen table, feel that wet pussy, that tight ass. Every morning for the rest of his life.</p><p>Her head was moving over him, her fingers digging into his thighs. Those pretty fingers, all that beautiful blonde hair, the delectable ass that he\u2019d watched crawl away from him. God, it tempted him to command her to move around naked and on all fours in their home full time wearing his collar and those cuffs. In that position, he could see the pink lips of her cunt and rosebud of her ass, all of her so accessible and fuckable.</p><p>She brought both hands into it now, gripping him, sliding up, using his pre-cum to slick him up. She was devouring him, making animal noises in her throat. She knew how to give head like a pro, but it was all for him, her Master.</p><p>\u201cGet up here.\u201d A lifetime of fucking women\u2019s asses, but now, he wanted her face-to-face. Wanted to be deep in her pussy, wanted to be staring into her eyes. It took her breath away, he could tell, the way he lifted her straight up off the floor, biceps flexing, to set her on his lap, make her straddle his cock. It took some angling, because of his size, but then he had her locked on, working her down that well-greased pole. Her mouth was slick from it, and he brought her to his lips, suckling and biting on it, tasting himself and her.</p><p>She moaned as he got her settled all the way on, and then he started moving. \u201cHang on, baby,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI just want to fuck you this morning. Use you hard.\u201d</p><p>In answer to that, she coiled her arms around his shoulders. \u201cYeeeessss...\u201d It drove him crazy, because she kept breathing little things like that, things that made him harder, needier, where Master and slave meant nothing, unless Master also meant slave. He was all hers. Always yours. He knew it for sure when he came, exploding inside of her like a heat missile. Not from the grip of her cunt, the press of her nipples, the slap of her ass against his legs, but from the words she whispered in his ear right before he released.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Master. Love you...always...forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
