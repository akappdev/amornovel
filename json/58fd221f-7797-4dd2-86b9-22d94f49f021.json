When Robert was alive. But tonight, on the most romantic day of the year, thirty-eight-year-old Anne Marie Roche was alone. Turning over the closed sign on the door of Blossom Street Books, she glanced at the Valentine\u2019s display with its cutout hearts and pink balloons and the collection of romance novels she didn\u2019t read anymore. Then she looked outside. Streetlights flickered on as evening settled over the Seattle neighborhood.</p><p>The truth was, Anne Marie hated her life. Well, okay, hate was putting it too strongly. After all, she was healthy, reasonably young and reasonably attractive, financially solvent, and she owned the most popular bookstore in the area. But she didn\u2019t have anyone to love, anyone who loved her. She was no longer part of something larger than herself. Every morning when she woke, she found the other side of the bed empty and she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever get accustomed to that desolate feeling.</p><p>Her husband had died nine months ago. So, technically, she was a widow, although she and Robert had been separated. But they saw each other regularly and were working on a reconciliation.</p> <p>Then, suddenly, it was all over, all hope gone. Just when they were on the verge of reuniting, her husband had a massive heart attack. He\u2019d collapsed at the office and died even before the paramedics could arrive.</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s mother had warned her about the risks of marrying an older man, but fifteen years wasn\u2019t that much older. Robert, charismatic and handsome, had been in his mid-forties when they met. They\u2019d been happy together, well matched in every way but one.</p><p>Anne Marie wanted a baby.</p><p>Robert hadn\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019d had a family\u2014two children\u2014with his first wife, Pamela, and wasn\u2019t interested in starting a second one. When she\u2019d married him, Anne Marie had agreed to his stipulation. At the time it hadn\u2019t seemed important. She was madly in love with Robert\u2014and then two years ago it hit her. This longing, this need for a baby, grew more and more intense, and Robert\u2019s refusal became more adamant. His solution had been to buy her a dog she\u2019d named Baxter. Much as she loved her Yorkie, her feelings hadn\u2019t changed. She\u2019d still wanted a baby.</p> <p>The situation wasn\u2019t helped by Melissa, Robert\u2019s twenty-four-year-old daughter, who disliked Anne Marie and always had. Over the years Anne Marie had made many attempts to ease the tension between them, all of which failed. Fortunately she had a good relationship with Brandon, Robert\u2019s son, who was five years older than his sister.</p><p>When problems arose in Anne Marie and Robert\u2019s marriage, Melissa hadn\u2019t been able to disguise her glee. Her stepdaughter seemed absolutely delighted when Robert moved out the autumn before last, seven months before his death.</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d done to warrant such passionate loathing, other than to fall in love with Melissa\u2019s father. She supposed the girl\u2019s ardent hope that her parents would one day remarry was responsible for her bitterness. Every child wanted his or her family intact. And Melissa was a young teen when Anne Marie married Robert\u2014a hard age made harder by the family\u2019s circumstances. Anne Marie didn\u2019t blame Robert\u2019s daughter, but his marriage to Pamela had been dead long before she entered the picture. Still, try as she might, Anne Marie had never been able to find common ground with Melissa. In fact, she hadn\u2019t heard from her since the funeral.</p><p>Anne Marie opened the shop door as Elise Beaumont approached. Elise\u2019s husband, Maverick, had recently passed away after a lengthy battle with cancer. In her mid-sixties, she was a retired librarian who\u2019d reconnected with her husband after nearly thirty years apart, only to lose him again after less than three. She was a slight, gray-haired woman who\u2019d become almost gaunt, but the sternness of her features was softened by the sadness in her eyes. A frequent patron of the bookstore, she and Anne Marie had become friends during the months of Maverick\u2019s decline. In many ways his death was a release, yet Anne Marie understood how difficult it was to let go of someone you loved.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d come,\u201d Anne Marie told her with a quick hug. She\u2019d closed the store two hours early, giving Steve Handley, her usual Thursday-night assistant, a free evening for his own Valentine celebration.</p><p>Elise slipped off her coat and draped it over the back of an overstuffed chair. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would and then I decided that being with the other widows was exactly what I needed tonight.\u201d</p> <p>The widows.</p><p>They\u2019d met in a book group Anne Marie had organized at the store. After Robert died, she\u2019d suggested reading Lolly Winston\u2019s Good Grief, a novel about a young woman adjusting to widowhood. It was through the group that Anne Marie had met Lillie Higgins and Barbie Foster. Colette Blake had joined, too. She\u2019d been a widow who\u2019d rented the apartment above A Good Yarn, Lydia Goetz\u2019s yarn store. Colette had married again the previous year.</p><p>Although the larger group had read and discussed other books, the widows had gravitated together and begun to meet on their own. Their sessions were often informal gatherings over coffee at the nearby French Caf\u00e9 or a glass of wine upstairs at Anne Marie\u2019s.</p><p>Lillie and Barbie were a unique pair of widows, mother and daughter. They\u2019d lost their husbands in a private plane crash three years earlier. Anne Marie remembered reading about the Learjet incident in the paper; both pilots and their two passengers had been killed in a freak accident on landing in Seattle. Lillie\u2019s husband and son-in-law were executives at a perfume company and often took business trips together.</p><p>Lillie Higgins was close to Elise\u2019s age, but that was all they shared. Actually, it was difficult to tell exactly how old Lillie was. She looked barely fifty, but with a forty-year-old daughter, she had to be in her mid-sixties. Petite and delicate, she was one of those rare women who never seemed to age. Her wardrobe consisted of ultra-expensive knits and gold jewelry. Anne Marie had the impression that if Lillie wanted, she could purchase this bookstore ten times over.</p><p>Her daughter, Barbie Foster, was a lot like her mother and aptly named, at least as far as appearances went. She had long blond hair that never seemed to get mussed, gorgeous crystal-blue eyes, a flawless figure. It was hard to believe she had eighteen-year-old twin sons who were college freshmen; Anne Marie would bet that most people assumed she was their sister rather than their mother. If Anne Marie didn\u2019t like Barbie so much, it would be easy to resent her for being so...perfect.</p><p>\u201cThanks for closing early tonight. I\u2019d much rather be here than spend another evening alone,\u201d Elise said, breaking into Anne Marie\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>There was that word again.</p> <p>Alone.</p><p>Despite her own misgivings about Valentine\u2019s Day, Anne Marie tried to smile. She gestured toward the rear of the store. \u201cI\u2019ve got the bubble wrap and everything set up in the back room.\u201d</p><p>The previous month, as they discussed an Elizabeth Buchan novel, the subject of Valentine\u2019s Day had come up. Anne Marie learned from her friends that this was perhaps the most painful holiday for widows. That was when their small group decided to plan their own celebration. Only instead of romantic love and marriage, they\u2019d celebrate friendship. They\u2019d defy the world\u2019s pitying glances and toast each other\u2019s past loves and future hopes.</p><p>Elise managed a quivering smile as she peered into the back of the store. \u201cBubble wrap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have tons,\u201d Anne Marie informed her. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how many shippers use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why is it on the floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d It seemed silly now that Anne Marie was trying to explain. \u201cI always have this insatiable urge to pop it, so I thought we could do it together\u2014by walking on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want us to step on bubble wrap?\u201d Elise asked, sounding confused.</p><p>\u201cThink of it as our own Valentine\u2019s dance and fireworks in one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut fireworks are for Independence Day or maybe New Year\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Anne Marie said bracingly. \u201cNew beginnings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll drink champagne, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. I\u2019ve got a couple bottles of the real stuff, Veuve Clicquot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVeuve means widow, you know. The widow Clicquot\u2019s bubbly\u2014what else could we possibly drink?\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and Lillie and Barbie entered in a cloud of some elegant scent. As soon as they were inside, Anne Marie locked the shop.</p><p>\u201cParty time,\u201d Lillie said, handing Anne Marie a white box filled with pastries.</p><p>\u201cI brought chocolate,\u201d Barbie announced, holding up a box of dark Belgian chocolates. She wore a red pantsuit with a wide black belt that emphasized her petite waist. Was there no justice in this world? The woman had the figure of a goddess and she ate chocolate?</p><p>\u201cI read that dark chocolate and red wine have all kinds of natural benefits,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Anne Marie had read that, too.</p><p>Lillie shook her head in mock astonishment. \u201cFirst wine and now chocolate. Life is good.\u201d</p><p>Leading the way to the back room, Anne Marie dimmed the lights in the front of the shop. Beside the champagne and flutes, she\u2019d arranged a crystal vase of red roses; they\u2019d been a gift from Susannah\u2019s Garden, the flower shop next door. All the retailers on Blossom Street were friends. Hearing about the small party, Alix Turner from the French Caf\u00e9 had dropped off a tray of cheese, crackers and seedless green grapes, which Anne Marie had placed on her work table, now covered with a lacy cloth. Lydia had insisted they use it for their celebration. It was so beautiful it reawakened Anne Marie\u2019s desire to learn to knit.</p><p>She wished she could see her friends\u2019 gifts as more than expressions of sympathy, but her state of mind made that impossible. Still, because of the other widows, for their sake as well as her own, she was determined to try.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be fun,\u201d Elise said, telling them why Anne Marie had spread out the bubble wrap.</p><p>\u201cWhat a wonderful idea!\u201d Barbie exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cShall I pour?\u201d Anne Marie asked, ignoring the sense of oppression she couldn\u2019t seem to escape. It had been present for months and she\u2019d thought life would be better by now. Perhaps she needed counseling. One thing was certain; she needed something.</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d Lillie said, motioning toward the champagne.</p><p>Anne Marie opened the bottle and filled the four glasses and then they toasted one another, clicking the rims of the flutes.</p><p>\u201cTo love,\u201d Elise said. \u201cTo Maverick.\u201d Her voice broke.</p><p>\u201cTo chocolate!\u201d Barbie made a silly face, perhaps to draw attention away from Elise\u2019s tears.</p><p>\u201cAnd the Widow\u2019s champagne,\u201d Lillie threw in.</p><p>Anne Marie remained silent.</p><p>Although it\u2019d been nine months, her grief didn\u2019t seem to diminish or become any easier to bear. She worked too much, ate too little and grieved for all the might-have-beens. It was more than the fact that the man she\u2019d loved was dead. With his death, she was forced to give up the dream of all she\u2019d hoped her marriage would be. A true companionship\u2014and the foundation of a family. Even if she were to fall in love again, which seemed unlikely, a pregnancy past the age of forty was risky. The dream of having her own child had died with Robert. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The four sipped their champagne in silence, each caught up in her own memories. Anne Marie saw the sorrow on Elise\u2019s face, the contemplative look on Lillie\u2019s, Barbie\u2019s half smile.</p><p>\u201cWill we be removing our shoes in order to pop the bubble wrap?\u201d Lillie asked a moment later.</p><p>\u201cMom has this thing about walking around in stocking feet,\u201d Barbie said, glancing at her mother. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t done in our household,\u201d Lillie murmured.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to take our shoes off,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cThe whole idea is to have fun. Make a bit of noise, celebrate our friendship and our memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I say, let \u2019er rip,\u201d Elise said. She raised her sensibly shod foot and stomped on a bubble. A popping sound exploded in the room.</p><p>Barbie went next, her step firm. Her high heels effectively demolished a series of bubbles.</p><p>Pop. Pop. Pop.</p><p>Pop.</p> <p>Lillie followed. Her movements were tentative, almost apologetic.</p><p>Pop.</p><p>Anne Marie went last. It felt...good. Really good, and the noise only added to the unexpected sense of fun and exhilaration. For the first time since the party had begun, she smiled.</p><p>By then they were all flushed with excitement and champagne. The others were laughing giddily; Anne Marie couldn\u2019t quite manage that but she could almost laugh. The ability to express joy had left her when Robert died. That wasn\u2019t all she\u2019d lost. She used to sing, freely and without self-consciousness. But after Robert\u2019s funeral Anne Marie discovered she couldn\u2019t sing anymore. She just couldn\u2019t. Her throat closed up whenever she tried. What came out were strangled sounds that barely resembled music, and after a while she gave up. It\u2019d been months since she\u2019d even attempted a song.</p><p>The popping continued as they paraded around on the bubble wrap, pausing now and then to sip champagne. They marched with all the pomp and ceremony of soldiers in procession, saluting one another with their champagne flutes.</p><p>Thanks to her friends, Anne Marie found that her mood had begun to lift.</p> <p>Soon all the bubbles were popped. Bringing their champagne, they sat in the chairs where the reader groups met and toasted each other again in the dimly lit store.</p><p>Leaning back, Anne Marie tried to relax. Despite her earlier laughter, despite spending this evening with friends, her eyes filled with tears. She blinked them away, but new tears came, and it wasn\u2019t long before Barbie noticed. Her friend placed a reassuring hand on Anne Marie\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cDoes it ever hurt any less?\u201d Anne Marie asked. Searching for a tissue in her hip pocket, she blotted her eyes. She hated breaking down like this. She wanted to explain that she\u2019d never been a weepy or sentimental woman. All her emotions had become more intense since Robert\u2019s death.</p><p>Lillie and Barbie exchanged knowing looks. They\u2019d been widows the longest.</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Lillie promised her, growing serious, too. \u201cBut it takes time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel so alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s to be expected,\u201d Barbie said, passing her the box of chocolates. \u201cHere, have another one. You\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my grandmother used to say,\u201d Elise added. \u201cEat, and everything will seem better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMine always said I\u2019d be good as new if I did something for someone else,\u201d Lillie said. \u201cGrams swore that showing kindness to others was the cure for any kind of unhappiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExercise helps, too,\u201d Barbie put in. \u201cI spent many, many hours at the gym.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just buy something?\u201d Anne Marie asked plaintively, and hiccuped a laugh as she made the suggestion.</p><p>The others smiled.</p><p>\u201cI wish it was that easy,\u201d Elise said in a solemn voice.</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s appetite had been nonexistent for months and she didn\u2019t really enjoy going to a gym\u2014walking nowhere on a treadmill seemed rather pointless to her. She didn\u2019t feel like doing volunteer work, either, at least not right now\u2014although helping another person might get her past this slump, this interval of self-absorption.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all looking for a quick fix, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Barbie said quietly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Lillie settled back in her chair. \u201cOf these different options, the one I could really sink my teeth into is buying something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo could I,\u201d Barbie said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI realize you\u2019re joking\u2014well, partly\u2014but material things won\u2019t help,\u201d Elise cautioned, bringing them all back to reality. \u201cAny relief a spending spree offers is bound to be temporary.\u201d</p><p>As tempting as the idea of buying herself a gift might be, Anne Marie supposed she was right.</p><p>\u201cWe all need to take care of ourselves physically. Eat right. Exercise,\u201d Elise said thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s important we get our finances in order, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more on that,\u201d Lillie said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make a list of our suggestions,\u201d Elise went on. Reaching for her purse, she took out a small spiral notebook.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to make a list,\u201d Lillie piped up, \u201cit won\u2019t be about eating cauliflower and going jogging. Instead, I\u2019d plan to do some of the things I\u2019ve put off for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, something fun,\u201d Lillie said, \u201clike traveling to Paris.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie felt as if a bolt of lightning had struck her. When they were first married, Robert had promised her that one day he\u2019d take her to Paris. They talked about it frequently, discussing every aspect of their trip to the City of Light. The museums they\u2019d visit, the places they\u2019d walk, the meals they\u2019d eat...</p><p>\u201cI want to go to Paris with someone I love,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI want to fall in love again,\u201d Barbie said decisively. \u201cHead over heels in love like I was before. A love that\u2019ll change my life.\u201d</p><p>They all grew quiet for a long moment, considering her words.</p><p>Anne Marie couldn\u2019t believe Barbie would lack for male companionship. They\u2019d never discussed the subject, but she was surprised that a woman as attractive as Barbie didn\u2019t have her choice of men. Maybe she did. Maybe she simply had high standards. If so, Anne Marie couldn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cWe all want to be loved,\u201d Lillie said. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic human need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had love,\u201d Elise told them, her voice hoarse with pain. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to find that kind of love again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had it, too,\u201d Barbie said.</p><p>Another hush fell over them.</p><p>\u201cMaking a list is a good idea,\u201d Elise stated emphatically. \u201cA list of things to do.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded, fingering one of the suspended Valentine\u2019s decorations as she did. The idea had caught her interest. She needed to revive her enthusiasm. She needed to find inspiration and motivation\u2014and a list might just do that. She was a list-maker anyway, but this would be different. It wouldn\u2019t be the usual catalog of appointments and everyday obligations.</p><p>\u201cPersonally I don\u2019t need another to-do list,\u201d Lillie murmured, echoing Anne Marie\u2019s thought. \u201cI have enough of those already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis would n\u2019t be like that,\u201d Anne Marie responded, glancing at Elise for verification. \u201cThis would be a...an inventory of wishes,\u201d she said, thinking out loud. She recognized that there were plenty of shoulds involved in widowhood; her friends were right about that. She did need to get her financial affairs in order and pay attention to her health.</p><p>\u201cTwenty wishes,\u201d she said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhy twenty?\u201d Elise asked, leaning forward, her interest obvious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It sounds right.\u201d Anne Marie shrugged lightly. The number had leaped into her head, and she didn\u2019t know quite why. Twenty. Twenty wishes that would help her recapture her excitement about life. Twenty dreams written down. Twenty possibilities that would give her a reason to look toward the future instead of staying mired in her grief. She couldn\u2019t continue to drag from one day to the next, lost in pain and heartache because Robert was dead. She needed a new sense of purpose. She owed that to herself\u2014and to him.</p><p>\u201cTwenty wishes,\u201d Barbie repeated slowly. \u201cI think that works. Twenty\u2019s a manageable number. Not like a hundred, say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not too few\u2014like two or three,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>Anne Marie could tell that her friends were taking the idea seriously, which only strengthened her own certainty about it. \u201cWishes and hopes for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d Lillie proclaimed.</p><p>Barbie sat up straighter in her chair. \u201cYou should learn French,\u201d she said, smiling at Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cFrench?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor when you\u2019re in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had two years of French in high school.\u201d However, about all she remembered was how to conjugate the verbs \u00eatre and avoir.</p><p>\u201cTake a refresher course.\u201d Barbie slid onto the edge of her cushion.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might learn how to belly dance,\u201d Barbie said next.</p><p>The others looked at her with expressions of surprise; Anne Marie grinned in approval.</p><p>\u201cLillie mentioned this earlier, but I think it would do us all a world of good to be volunteers,\u201d Elise said. \u201cI\u2019ve become a Lunch Buddy at my grandson\u2019s school and I really look forward to my time with Malcolm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch Buddy? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA program for children at risk,\u201d Elise explained. \u201cOnce a week I visit the school and have lunch with a little boy in third grade. Malcolm is a sweet-natured child, and he\u2019s flourished under my attention. The minute I walk into the school, he races toward me as if he\u2019s been waiting for my visit all week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the two of you have lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but he also likes to show me his schoolwork. He\u2019s struggling with reading. However, he\u2019s trying hard, and every once in a while he\u2019ll read to me or I\u2019ll read to him. I\u2019ve introduced him to the Lemony Snicket books and he\u2019s loving those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tutor him, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, he has a reading tutor. It\u2019s not that kind of program. I\u2019m his friend. Or more like an extra grandmother.\u201d</p><p>The idea appealed to Anne Marie, but she didn\u2019t know if this was the right program for her. She\u2019d consider it. Her day off was Wednesday and every other Saturday when Theresa came into the store. She had to admit that volunteering at an elementary school would give her something to do other than feel sorry for herself.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a wish, exactly. Still, Elise claimed she felt better because of it. Helping someone else\u2014perhaps that was the key.</p><p>The party broke up around nine-thirty, and after she\u2019d waved everyone off, Anne Marie locked the front door. Then she climbed the stairs to her tiny apartment above the bookstore. Her ever-faithful Baxter was waiting for her, running circles around her legs until she bent down and lifted him up and lavished him with the attention he craved. After taking him out for a brief walk, she returned to the apartment, still thinking about the widows\u2019 new project. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She made a cup of tea and grabbed a notepad, sitting on the couch with Baxter curled up beside her. At the top of the page she wrote:</p><p>Twenty Wishes</p><p>It took her a long time to write down the first item.</p><p>1. Find one good thing about life</p> <p>She felt almost embarrassed that all she could come up with was such a plaintive, pathetic desire, one that betrayed the sorry state of her mental health. Sitting back, she closed her eyes and tried to remember what she used to dream about, the half-expressed wishes of her younger years.</p><p>She added a second item, silly though it was.</p><p>2. Buy myself a pair of red cowboy boots</p><p>In her twenties, long before she married Robert, Anne Marie had seen a pair in a display window and they\u2019d stopped her cold. She absolutely had to have those boots. When she\u2019d gone into the store and tried them on, they were a perfect fit. Perfect. Unfortunately the price tag wasn\u2019t. No way could she afford $1500 for a pair of cow boy boots! With reluctance she\u2019d walked out of the store, abandoning that small dream.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have afforded such an extravagance working part-time at the university bookstore. But she still thought about those boots. She still wanted them, and the price no longer daunted her as it had all those years ago. Somehow, she\u2019d find herself a pair of decadent cowboy boots. Red ones.</p> <p>Chewing on the end of her pen, she contemplated other wishes. Really, this shouldn\u2019t be so difficult....</p><p>It occurred to her that if she was going to buy red cowboy boots, she should think of something to do in them.</p><p>3. Learn how to line dance</p><p>She suspected line dancing might be a bit pass\u00e9 in Seattle\u2014as opposed to, say, Dallas\u2014but the good thing was that it didn\u2019t require a partner. She could show up and just have fun without worrying about being part of a couple. She wasn\u2019t ready for another relationship; perhaps in time, but definitely not yet. After a few minutes she crossed out the line-dancing wish. She didn\u2019t have the energy to be sociable. She read over her first wish and scratched that out, too. She didn\u2019t know how to gauge whether she\u2019d actually found something good about life. It wasn\u2019t specific enough.</p><p>A host of possibilities bounced around in her head but she didn\u2019t bother to write any of them on her list.</p><p>Lillie was right; she needed to get her finances in order. She wrote that down on a second sheet of paper, along with getting her annual physical and\u2014maybe\u2014signing up for the gym. The only thing on the first sheet, her wish list, was those boots.</p> <p>So now she had two separate lists\u2014one for wishes and the second for the more practical aspects of life. Not that each wish wouldn\u2019t ultimately require its own to-do list, but that was a concern for another day. She closed her eyes and tried to figure out what she wanted most, what wish she hoped to fulfill. The next few ideas were all sensible ones, like scheduling appointments she\u2019d postponed for months. It was a sad commentary that her one wish, the lone desire of her heart, was an outrageously priced pair of boots.</p><p>That was the problem; she no longer knew what she wanted. Shrouded in grief and lost dreams, her joy had vanished, the same way laughter and singing had.</p><p>So far, her second list outnumbered the wish list. It included booking appointments with an accountant, an attorney, the vet and a couple of doctors. Sad, sad, sad. She could well imagine what Lillie and Barbie\u2019s lists looked like. They\u2019d have wonderful ideas. Places to go, experiences to savor, people to meet.</p><p>Anne Marie stared at her wish list with its one ridiculous statement, tempted to crumple it up.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. For reasons she couldn\u2019t explain, she left it sitting on her kitchen counter. Lists were important; she knew that. Over the years she\u2019d read enough about goal-setting to realize the value of writing things down. In fact, the store carried a number of bestselling titles on that very topic.</p><p>Okay, this was a start. She wasn\u2019t going to abandon the idea. And at least she\u2019d taken control of some immediate needs. She\u2019d identified what she had to do.</p><p>Sometime later, she\u2019d list what she wanted to do.</p><p>She ran her finger over the word boots. Foolish, impractical, ridiculous\u2014but she didn\u2019t care. She was determined to have the things.</p> <p>Already the thought of listing her wishes was making a difference; already she felt a tiny bit of hope, a whisper of excitement. The thawing had begun.</p><p>Eventually other desires, other wishes, would come to her. She had nineteen left. She felt as if the genie had finally escaped the lamp and was waiting to hear her greatest desires. All she had to do was listen to her own heart and as soon as she did, her wildest dreams would come true.</p><p>If only life could be that simple.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t, of course, but Anne Marie decided she was willing to pretend.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>All that next week Anne Marie continued to look at her list. The sheet of paper with TWENTY WISHES written across the top became a patchwork of scribbles and scratched-out lines. She wrote I want to sing again, then changed her mind, deciding it was unnecessary to waste a wish on something she was convinced would return in its own time.</p><p>Eventually she transferred her list, such as it was, to a yellow legal pad, which somehow made her wishes seem more official. Then on Wednesday, her day off, she walked past a craft store on her way back from the accountant\u2019s and noticed the scrapbooking supplies in the window. She stared at the beautifully embellished pages displayed in the showcase. She used to possess a certain decorative flair. She wasn\u2019t sure she did anymore, but the idea of creating pages like that for her meager list of wishes appealed to her. A scrapbook to compile her wishes, make her plans and document her efforts. Those wishes would encourage her to look forward, to focus on the future with an optimism that had been lacking since her separation from Robert.</p><p>With that in mind, Anne Marie bought the necessary supplies, then lugged them home. As she passed A Good Yarn, the shop just two doors down from the bookstore, she impulsively stepped inside. First, she wanted to thank Lydia for the table covering and second...she\u2019d ask about classes.</p><p>She\u2019d add knitting to her wish list. Anne Marie wondered why she hadn\u2019t thought of that earlier. Elise was a consummate knitter and often encouraged the others to learn. She described the satisfactions of knitting in such a compelling way, Anne Marie had flirted more than once with the idea of taking a class. Lydia Goetz, who owned A Good Yarn, was a much-loved and admired member of the Blossom Street neighborhood. Anne Marie was friendly with her and had often gone inside the yarn store, but never with the serious intent of learning to knit. Now, the prospect of knitting filled her with unfamiliar enthusiasm.</p><p>Lydia was sitting at the table in the back of the shop with her sister, Margaret. Although Lydia was petite and graceful, her sister was rather big-boned, a little ungainly. At first glance it was hard to believe they were even related. Once the surprise of learning they were sisters wore off, the resemblance revealed itself in the shape of their eyes and the thrust of their chins.</p><p>When Anne Marie entered the store, the sisters were obviously involved in their conversation; as they spoke, Lydia was knitting, Margaret crocheting. The bell above the door jingled, startling them both.</p><p>A smile instantly broke out on Lydia\u2019s face. \u201cAnne Marie, how nice to see you! I\u2019m glad you stopped by.\u201d</p><p>Lydia had a natural warmth that made customers feel welcome.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Anne Marie said, smiling at the two women. \u201cLydia, I came to thank you again for the gorgeous tablecloth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re welcome. You know, it\u2019s really a lace shawl I knit years ago. I hope you\u2019ll have occasion to use it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to visit the bookstore,\u201d Lydia told her. \u201cI want to pick up a couple of new mysteries. By the way, how did the Valentine\u2019s party go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was wonderful,\u201d Anne Marie said, gazing around. Whenever she went into the yarn shop, she was astonished by the range of beautiful colors and inviting textures. She walked over to the blue, green and teal yarns that lined one area of the shelves. Putting down her packages, she reached out a hand to touch a skein of irresistibly soft wool.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you find something?\u201d Lydia asked.</p><p>Anne Marie nodded and, strangely, felt a bit hesitant. \u201cI\u2019d like to learn to knit.\u201d This was the first positive step she\u2019d taken toward acting on her wish list. She\u2019d been searching for somewhere to start, and knitting would do very well. \u201cI...saw the notice in the window for a beginners\u2019 class last week, but there isn\u2019t a sign now. Do you have one scheduled anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, Margaret and I were just discussing a beginners\u2019 class for Thursday afternoons.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie shook her head. \u201cI work all day on Thursdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also thinking about starting a new class for people who work. How about lunchtime on Tuesdays?\u201d Lydia suggested next. \u201cWould you like to sign up for that?\u201d</p><p>Before Anne Marie could respond, Margaret was on her feet. \u201cThat\u2019s too many classes,\u201d she muttered. \u201cLydia\u2019s teaching far too many classes and it exhausts her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargaret!\u201d Lydia protested and cast a despairing look at her sister.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true. You need to get someone else in here who can teach. I do as much as I can,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there are times I\u2019ve got more customers than I can handle and you\u2019re involved with all those classes.\u201d</p><p>Lydia ignored her sister. \u201cAnne Marie, if you want to learn how to knit, I\u2019ll teach you myself.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to Anne Marie that what she really wanted was a class. She\u2019d rejected line dancing because that had seemed like an overwhelming social occasion; a small knitting group was far less threatening. Other than the Valentine\u2019s event with the widows, she hadn\u2019t gone anywhere or done much of anything since Robert\u2019s funeral. Until now, the mere thought of making cheerful conversation with anyone outside the bookstore was beyond her. She decided she could ease into socializing with a knitting class. A few likeminded women, all focused on the same task...</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer,\u201d Anne Marie told Lydia. \u201cHowever, I think Margaret\u2019s probably right. You\u2019ve got a lot on your plate. Let me know if that noontime beginner class pans out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d exchanged farewells, Anne Marie picked up her shopping bags and left the yarn store. As she strolled past the shop window she noticed Whiskers, Lydia\u2019s cat, curled up in a basket of red wool. When Anne Marie walked Baxter, he often stood on his hind legs, front paws against the window, fixated on Lydia\u2019s cat\u2014who wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p>Hauling the scrapbooking supplies upstairs to her apartment, Anne Marie set her bags on the kitchen table, then scooped up her dog, stroking his silky fur. \u201cHey, Mr. Baxter. I just saw your friend Whiskers.\u201d</p><p>He wriggled excitedly and she put him down, collecting a biscuit from a box on the counter. \u201cHere you go.\u201d She smiled as he loudly crunched his cookie, licking up each and every crumb. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll knit you a little coat sometime...and maybe I won\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now that a knitting class apparently wasn\u2019t a sure thing, Anne Marie was shocked at how discouraged she felt. One roadblock, and she was ready to pack it in. Less than a year ago, hardly anything seemed to defeat her, but these days even the most mundane problems were disheartening.</p><p>At least Baxter\u2019s needs were straightforward and easily met, and he viewed her with unwavering devotion. There was comfort in that.</p><p>Eager to start her scrapbook project, she got to work. The three-ring binder was black with a clear plastic cover. For the next thirty minutes she cut out letters, decorated them with glitter glue and pasted them on a bright pink sheet. Then she slipped it behind the cover so the front of the binder read TWENTY WISHES. In addition to the binder, Anne Marie had purchased twenty plastic folders, one for each wish.</p><p>She became so involved in her work that it was well past one before she realized she hadn\u2019t eaten lunch. She emptied a can of soup into a bowl, and it was heating in the microwave when her phone rang.</p> <p>Startled, she picked up the receiver on the first ring. The beeper went off at the same time, indicating that her meal was ready.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, cradling the phone against her shoulder as she opened the microwave. She rarely got calls at home anymore. In the weeks after Robert\u2019s funeral, she\u2019d heard from a number of couples they\u2019d been friends with, but those people had gradually drifted away. Anne Marie hadn\u2019t made the effort to keep in touch, either. It was easier to lose herself in her grief than to reach out to others.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie, it\u2019s Lillie. Guess what?\u201d her friend said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hearing the excitement in Lillie\u2019s voice lifted her own spirits.</p><p>\u201cRemember what you said Valentine\u2019s night?\u201d</p> <p>Anne Marie frowned. \u201cNot exactly. I said various things. Which one do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Elise was talking about eating something to feel better and then someone else\u2014me, I think\u2014brought up volunteering and you said...\u201d She giggled. \u201cYou asked why we couldn\u2019t just buy ourselves something.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie smiled. She\u2019d been joking at the time, but it appeared that Lillie had taken her seriously. \u201cAre you about to tell me you bought yourself something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure did,\u201d Lillie said gleefully.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t leave me in suspense. What did you get?\u201d</p><p>Lillie giggled again. \u201cA brand-new shiny red convertible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Anne Marie feigned shock.</p><p>\u201cYes. Can you imagine me at sixty-three buying myself a sports car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind is it?\u201d Anne Marie knew next to nothing about cars, which was why she belonged to Triple A. In truth, Robert had been pretty helpless, too.</p><p>\u201cA BMW.\u201d</p><p>It must\u2019ve been expensive; Anne Marie knew that much. Well, Lillie could afford it. The perfume company had been more than generous to her and Barbie after the plane crash, and they were both financially secure.</p><p>\u201cWant to go for a ride?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s first inclination was to decline. Almost immediately she changed her mind. Why not go? Lillie\u2019s excitement was so contagious, she couldn\u2019t resist joining in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d she said warmly.</p> <p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll meet you in front of the bookstore in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, what about Jacqueline?\u201d She knew Lillie had plenty of other friends and that she and Jacqueline Donovan were especially close. They\u2019d raised their children together, belonged to the same country club and were active members of several charitable organizations. Jacqueline, too, was a frequent customer at Blossom Street Books, not to mention all the other neighborhood stores.</p><p>\u201cRest assured, she\u2019ll get her turn,\u201d Lillie told her. \u201cSo, do you want to go for a ride or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I just thought...never mind. I\u2019d love to ride in your shiny new red convertible.\u201d</p><p>Gulping down her soup and then grabbing her coat, Anne Marie waited outside by the curb. Lillie pulled up right on time. The car, a convertible, was certainly bright red, and it shone from fender to fender. Despite the overcast skies, her friend had the top down.</p><p>Anne Marie stepped forward, gawking at the vehicle. \u201cLillie, it\u2019s fabulous!\u201d</p><p>The older woman grinned. \u201cI think so, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Barbie have to say?\u201d</p><p>Lillie shook her head. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know yet. No one does. I\u2019d just driven it off the showroom floor when I called you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who inspired the idea. So it\u2019s only fitting that you be the first one to ride in it.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie remembered the \u201ceat something,\u201d \u201cdo something\u201d conversation, but she never would\u2019ve guessed she\u2019d end up riding in a brand-new BMW because of it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my life that I\u2019ve purchased my own car. I negotiated the deal myself,\u201d Lillie announced proudly. \u201cAnd I had all my facts straight before I even walked inside. Those salesmen take one look at me and see dollar signs. I needed to prove to them\u2014and to myself\u2014that I\u2019m no pushover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you did\u2014and then some.\u201d</p><p>Lillie nodded. \u201cI got on the Internet and found a Web site that showed the invoice price, and then broke out the dealer\u2019s typical overheads and advertising costs.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie was more impressed by the minute. \u201cYou really did your research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear, you can find out just about anything on the Internet.\u201d She raised her eyebrows. \u201cI also discovered that the dealer cost includes a holdback for profit.\u201d Lillie smiled roguishly as she continued her story. \u201cThe salesman was a charming fellow, I will say that. He expected to walk away with a substantial commission check, but I quickly disavowed him of that notion.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie stared at her, astonished. \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe started negotiating and I had him at the point of accepting my offer when I remembered that dealers sometimes get incentives and rebates on cars sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarn right I did and he agreed to my terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillie, congratulations.\u201d Anne Marie had no idea the older woman had such a head for business. As far as she was aware, Lillie hadn\u2019t worked a day in her life, or at least not outside the home. In many ways Barbie was a younger version of her mother. Both women had married young, and each had chosen a husband ten or so years her senior. That was something Anne Marie had in common with them; the fact that they were both mothers was not. They\u2019d promptly delivered the requisite child, in Barbie\u2019s case, twin sons. If Anne Marie recalled correctly, the Foster boys, Eric and Kurt, were enrolled in separate East Coast schools\u2014very elite ones, naturally.</p><p>\u201cIt feels so good to drive a vehicle I negotiated for myself,\u201d Lillie said. \u201cAnd this came about because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, I just made an offhand comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than purchasing my own car,\u201d she said, as though Anne Marie hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cit was managing everything myself instead of handing the task over to someone else. I\u2019ve always felt I could be a good businesswoman if I\u2019d been given the opportunity.\u201d She rubbed her hand over the arc of the steering wheel. \u201cNo one seemed to consider me capable of running my own affairs. Ironically, the person I needed to convince most was me. Thanks to you, I did.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie felt a bit uncomfortable; Lillie was giving her far more credit than she deserved.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Lillie said. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>Swinging open the passenger door, Anne Marie climbed into the convertible and fastened her seat belt.</p><p>Lillie gripped the steering wheel tightly, throwing back her head. \u201cI have to tell you, I\u2019m really getting into this Twenty Wishes thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cWhen you phoned I was in the middle of making a scrapbook, a page for each wish. I\u2019m going to cut out magazine pictures to visualize them and to document the various steps.\u201d</p><p>Lillie turned to smile at her. \u201cWhat a great idea.\u201d</p><p>The praise encouraged her and Anne Marie quickly went on to describe the craft-store supplies she\u2019d purchased. \u201cI don\u2019t have much of a list as yet, but I\u2019m working on it. How about you?\u201d</p><p>Lillie was silent for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I want to fall in love.\u201d She spoke with a determination Anne Marie had never heard from her.</p><p>\u201cBarbie said the same thing at our Valentine\u2019s party,\u201d Anne Marie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of men ask me out,\u201d Lillie told her. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound egotistical, but I\u2019m not interested in most of them.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded, not surprised that \u201cplenty of men\u201d would find Lillie attractive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned a thing or two in the last sixty-odd years,\u201d Lillie was saying, \u201cand I\u2019m not as impressed with riches or connections as I once was. When I fall in love, I want it to be with a man of integrity. Someone who\u2019s decent and kind and\u2014\u201d She paused as though searching for the right word. \u201cHonorable. I want to fall in love with an honorable man.\u201d She seemed embarrassed at having spoken her wish aloud, and leaned forward to start the engine. \u201cAs you might\u2019ve guessed, my marriage\u2014unlike my daughter\u2019s\u2014wasn\u2019t a particularly good one. I don\u2019t want to repeat the mistakes I made when I was younger.\u201d The car roared to life, then purred with the sound of a flawlessly tuned engine.</p><p>Checking behind her, Lillie backed out of the parking space on Blossom Street. From there they headed toward the freeway on-ramp. Lillie proposed a drive through the Kent Valley and along the Green River, and Anne Marie agreed.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Anne Marie let the cold February wind sweep past her. Lillie turned on the radio just as the DJ announced a hit from the late 1960s. Soon she was crooning along to The Lovin\u2019 Spoonful\u2019s \u201cDid You Ever Have To Make Up Your Mind.\u201d Anne Marie remembered her mother singing that song as a girl. Perhaps it was unusual to find herself good friends with a woman who was her mother\u2019s contemporary. Sadly, although Anne Marie was an only child, she and her mother weren\u2019t close. Her parents had divorced when she was in sixth grade, and the bitterness, especially on her mother\u2019s part, had lingered through the years. It didn\u2019t help that Anne Marie resembled her father. She\u2019d had little contact with him after the divorce, and he died in a boating accident on Lake Washington when she was twenty-five. Her mother had never remarried.</p><p>Because they had such an uneasy relationship, Anne Marie avoided frequent visits home. She made a point of calling her mother at least once a month. Even then, it seemed they didn\u2019t have much to discuss. Sad as it was to admit, Anne Marie had more in common with Lillie than she did with her own mother.</p><p>As Lillie\u2019s voice grew louder, Anne Marie stayed quiet, afraid that if she attempted to sing she\u2019d embarrass herself. After about twenty minutes, Lillie exited the freeway and drove toward the road that ran beside the banks of the Green River. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was about as perfect a moment as Anne Marie could remember since Robert\u2019s death. They had the road to themselves. The sun was on her face and the wind tossed her hair in every direction and she couldn\u2019t have cared less.</p><p>Lillie, however, had wrapped a silk scarf over her elegantly arranged hair, which held it neatly in place.</p><p>Darting around the twisting country roads, Lillie revealed her skill as a driver. Then, in the middle of a sharp turn, she let out a small cry of alarm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Anne Marie was instantly on edge. She grasped the passenger door as Lillie struggled to control the vehicle.</p> <p>\u201cThe steering wheel,\u201d she gasped. She pulled the car over to the side of the road and cut the engine. She looked wide-eyed at Anne Marie. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the steering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a brand-new car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to remind me,\u201d Lillie said through clenched teeth. She opened the car door and got out, then reached behind the seat for her purse. Taking out her cell phone, she exhaled slowly. \u201cFortunately I have the dealership\u2019s number in my Calls Received.\u201d She wrapped one arm around her waist while she waited for someone to answer.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, speaking without even a hint of irritation in her voice. \u201cThis is Lillie Higgins. I was in the dealership earlier this afternoon. Could I speak with Darryl Pierpont, please? He\u2019s the salesman who sold me this vehicle.\u201d She waited, and it seemed the salesman was unavailable because Lillie asked to speak with the manager, who was apparently out of the office, as well. Lillie then said, \u201cAll right, answer me this. Has the dealership deposited the check I wrote?\u201d She turned to Anne Marie, eyes fierce. \u201cI suggest you don\u2019t, as I\u2019m about to put a stop payment order on it.\u201d</p><p>That quickly got her the attention she sought. After explaining what had happened and listening for a moment, then describing her location, Lillie closed the cell.</p> <p>\u201cThe dealership\u2019s sending a tow truck for the car. The service manager is bringing me a replacement vehicle until they can determine what\u2019s wrong with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs they should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil then we have to sit here and wait.\u201d</p><p>They climbed back into the car and chatted for half an hour or so until another BMW arrived, followed by a tow truck. A Hispanic man stepped out of the car. \u201cMs. Higgins?\u201d he asked with a slight Mexican accent, looking at Lillie.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Hector Silva, manager of the service department. I would like to personally apologize for this inconvenience.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve owned this car for less than two hours!\u201d</p><p>Hector shook his head. \u201cI give you my word that we will find out what caused the problem and repair it properly. Until then, the dealership would like you to use this loaner car.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie liked the man immediately. He was around Lillie\u2019s age, she guessed, with lovely tanned skin and salt-and-pepper hair. He handed Lillie some papers to sign and then the keys to the other car.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a ride back to the dealership, Mr. Silva?\u201d Lillie offered, surprising Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, I\u2019ll escort your convertible with the tow truck driver. I\u2019ll have your car back to you as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head. \u201cIt is my pleasure, Ms. Higgins.\u201d</p><p>While Hector Silva and the driver of the tow truck conferred, Lillie and Anne Marie slipped into the second car, a luxury sedan.</p> <p>\u201cHe was so nice,\u201d Anne Marie commented. The service manager couldn\u2019t have been more accommodating or polite.</p><p>\u201cI was looking forward to giving the dealership a piece of my mind,\u201d Lillie said with a sigh. \u201cBut how can I when everyone\u2019s being so wonderful? Well,\u201d she said, grinning, \u201cafter I threatened them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat had nothing to do with Mr. Silva, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Lillie said. \u201cHe struck me as genuine.\u201d</p><p>They resumed their drive, except that this time Lillie headed straight back to the city, stopping in front of Blossom Street Books.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lillie,\u201d Anne Marie said as she climbed out. \u201cI\u2019ve never enjoyed a car ride more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d And with a smile that shone from her eyes and her heart, Lillie drove off.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Standing in front of Woodrow Wilson Elementary School, Anne Marie took a deep breath. Elise Beaumont had repeatedly encouraged her to become a volunteer and had recommended the Lunch Buddy program. Elise herself was a Lunch Buddy at a different school\u2014her grandson\u2019s\u2014but Woodrow Wilson was closer to Blossom Street. She\u2019d sounded so positive about the experience that Anne Marie had felt inspired to make the initial call. Volunteering was now number three on her list of Twenty Wishes, after the red boots and learning to knit.</p><p>Lillie had bought her red BMW convertible and despite the problems that first day, she was thrilled with her purchase. Buoyed by that sense of exhilaration, Lillie had decided to look more closely into the financial matters she\u2019d left in the hands of others. She, too, was working on her list, as were Barbie and Elise.</p><p>Last week Elise had said she was applying for a part-time job. For the last three years of her husband\u2019s illness, she\u2019d been Maverick\u2019s primary caregiver. Now that her husband was gone, Elise needed some kind of activity to fill her time. Maverick wouldn\u2019t have wanted her to mope uselessly around the house, she insisted.</p><p>Although Anne Marie had only met Maverick Beaumont\u2014a professional poker player\u2014once or twice, she felt Elise was right. Maverick was obviously a man of action and he would\u2019ve urged his wife to do something constructive and meaningful with her remaining years. The Lunch Buddy program was a worthwhile start, but Elise had extra time, lots of it, and energy to spare.</p><p>Anne Marie wasn\u2019t sure how Robert would react if he were to find out she\u2019d volunteered as a Lunch Buddy\u2014let alone that she\u2019d begun a list of Twenty Wishes. Would he consider it frivolous? Self-involved? Or would he think it was a good idea, a good way of recapturing her enthusiasm for life? They\u2019d been married almost eleven years and there were days Anne Marie felt she\u2019d never really known her husband.</p><p>Robert was a private person who kept his feelings hidden from the world and sometimes even from her. When she first told him she wanted a child, Robert had simply left the room. Not until three days later was he willing to discuss the matter. He\u2019d told her that a second family was out of the question; as far as he was concerned, they\u2019d made that decision before their marriage. He was right. She\u2019d agreed there\u2019d be no children. What he didn\u2019t understand or seem capable of acknowledging was that she\u2019d been at a very different point in her life when she\u2019d married him. She\u2019d been too young to realize how intense the desire for a baby would become as the years went on.</p><p>Robert said he already had his family, that it was time to think about grandchildren, not more children. She\u2019d agreed to his terms and, according to him, that agreement was binding.</p><p>Anne Marie had tried to ignore her yearning for a child. With Robert\u2019s encouragement and support, she\u2019d purchased Blossom Street Books with a small inheritance from her grandparents\u2019e state, which she\u2019d invested years before. That hadn\u2019t solved the problem, nor had Baxter, the Yorkie he\u2019d surprised her with one evening. Much as she loved Robert, her bookstore and her dog, her need for a baby was still there, growing until she could no longer ignore it.</p><p>She wanted a baby. Robert\u2019s baby. The promise she\u2019d made him had been more than eleven years ago. She\u2019d changed her mind, but he refused to change his. She\u2019d pleaded and cajoled, all to no avail.</p><p>To complicate everything, Robert had discussed this personal and private matter with his daughter, who\u2019d naturally sided with her father. That made Anne Marie\u2019s relationship with Melissa\u2014and with Robert\u2014even more difficult.</p><p>Melissa had hated Anne Marie from the day she married Robert. Granted, the girl had only been thirteen at the time, but she\u2019d rejected Anne Marie\u2019s overtures in no uncertain terms, and her attitude had become more adamant, more intolerant, with age. His daughter had always been Daddy\u2019s little girl and her resentment toward Anne Marie was unyielding. Melissa had done everything possible to make her feel like an outsider. Anne Marie hadn\u2019t been invited to graduations, birthdays or other family events. Brandon, her stepson, had accepted her from the beginning, and they\u2019d held their own little celebrations. During the first few years, Robert had tried to build a bridge between her and his daughter, but that effort had fallen by the wayside. After a while both she and Robert had given up. His relationship with Melissa had become something completely separate from his marriage.</p><p>Still, Anne Marie felt deeply betrayed when her husband took a private matter between the two of them to his daughter. He\u2019d been disloyal to her. Even worse was learning about it from Melissa, who\u2019d taunted Anne Marie with what she knew. That had added humiliation to the pain.</p><p>Robert listened stoically as she wept and cried out her fury. Nothing she said seemed to affect him. He listened, his face impassive, and then a few days later, packed a bag and moved out. Just like that.</p><p>The shock of it had left Anne Marie reeling for weeks. After a month in which she refused to give him the satisfaction of calling, Robert had briefly returned to the house to suggest a legal separation.</p><p>Remaining as unemotional as possible, Anne Marie had agreed. Perhaps living apart would be best while they both considered their options. By then, Anne Marie had been angry. Okay, furious. She\u2019d wondered if Robert had ever really loved her. How selfish, how unfair, how...male of him.</p><p>Anne Marie felt it was imperative that Robert know she was serious about a baby. He\u2019d moved out of the house and, following his lead, she\u2019d moved out, too, leaving the place to sit vacant. Fortunately she had the apartment above the bookstore, which had recently become available. She hoped such a drastic action would give Robert notice that she was more than able to support herself\u2014more than capable of living her life without him. In his own fit of defiance, Robert had listed the house, which was in his name. Everyone was surprised when it sold the first week. Anne Marie\u2019s things, whatever she hadn\u2019t moved to the apartment, had been taken to a storage unit. It had all been so petty, so juvenile.</p><p>Their separation had become a battle of wills, each of them intent on showing how unnecessary and superfluous the other was. They were clearly destined for the divorce court, until Anne Marie decided enough was enough. After all, this was the man she loved. Despite everything\u2014her disappointment, her anger toward Melissa\u2014her feelings for her husband hadn\u2019t changed. The day she called Robert at the office had been a turning point. She admitted she missed him and was sorry the situation had deteriorated so far. He seemed surprised to hear from her and at the same time delighted. He said he was sorry, too, and they\u2019d agreed to meet for dinner.</p><p>The one stipulation was that there be no talk about Anne Marie having a baby. Although she didn\u2019t like it, she\u2019d promised. Dinner was wonderful and Robert had gone out of his way to make the evening as romantic as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Robert Roche could certainly be charming when he put his mind to it, and that night he\u2019d charmed himself right into her bed. Their lovemaking had always been powerful and it felt so wonderful to be with him again. Then, in the morning when she awoke, Anne Marie discovered he\u2019d left during the night. That was like a slap in the face. It would serve him right if she ended up pregnant, she\u2019d thought angrily.</p><p>Only she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>They\u2019d continued to meet and to talk regularly but that was the last time they\u2019d made love.</p><p>Shaking her head, trying to free herself from the memories, Anne Marie realized she\u2019d been standing in front of the elementary school for ten minutes without moving. Making a determined effort, she walked into the building.</p> <p>She had an appointment with the school counselor, Ms. Helen Mayer, at ten-thirty and she was already five minutes late.</p><p>As soon as Anne Marie entered the school, the hallway immediately filled with noisy youngsters, all of them trying to get past her and outside. But for the first time that day, the sun peeked out through dark clouds, and she took that as a favorable sign.</p><p>Eventually Anne Marie located the school office, which had a small waiting area, a large counter that stretched across the room and a number of offices behind it.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d the woman at the counter asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Anne Marie Roche. I have an appointment with Ms. Mayer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re here for the Lunch Buddy program?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Anne Marie nervously brushed her hair away from her face. She wore it straight, shoulder-length, and had dressed in wool slacks and a white turtleneck sweater. Now that she was actually at the office, her uncertainty returned. She wasn\u2019t convinced this was the best project for her, wish list or not. She didn\u2019t know anything about children of elementary-school age, or any age for that matter. Her experience with Melissa hadn\u2019t exactly inspired confidence in her ability to relate to kids.</p><p>\u201cMs. Mayer is meeting with the other volunteers in Room 121,\u201d the woman told her. \u201cThere\u2019s an orientation first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Anne Marie said with a nod, figuring the orientation would help her decide. \u201cHow do I find Room 121?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy. Just go out the way you came in, take a left and follow the hallway to the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the secretary mumbled as she turned back to her computer screen.</p><p>Mentally repeating the directions, Anne Marie stepped out of the office. For a moment she hesitated, thinking she could just leave now, simply walk out. She didn\u2019t know any young children and couldn\u2019t imagine what they\u2019d want to talk about. But her hesitation was brief. The prospect of confessing to Elise that she hadn\u2019t even tried compelled Anne Marie to go to Room 121.</p><p>Two other women and one man were already seated on metal folding chairs at a long conference table. There was a chalkboard behind them. Helen Mayer welcomed her with a gesture toward an empty seat.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Anne Marie,\u201d she said. \u201cMeet Maggie, Lois and John.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded in the direction of the other volunteers and pulled out a chair. She still felt the urge to make an excuse and walk out. She couldn\u2019t, though. Not without at least going through the orientation.</p><p>\u201cI believe that\u2019s everyone,\u201d Helen said, reaching for a piece of chalk. She walked over to the board and wrote each person\u2019s name.</p><p>During the next thirty minutes, Anne Marie learned that this was a four-month commitment. She must agree to meet faithfully with her lunch buddy once a week for that period of time.</p><p>\u201cEvery week?\u201d one of the other women asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, the same day if possible but it\u2019s understandable if you occasionally need to change days. It\u2019s best for the children to have a sense of routine and trust that you\u2019ll be here for them.\u201d</p><p>The others all nodded. A little belatedly, Anne Marie did, too.</p><p>\u201cNext, we ask that you eat the food from the cafeteria. Lunch Buddy kids get their lunch free, thanks to a government subsidy, but you can buy yours at a minimal charge. If you must bring in food from outside, please check to be sure the child you\u2019re paired with doesn\u2019t have any food allergies.\u201d</p><p>That was reasonable, Anne Marie thought.</p><p>\u201cAfter lunch you can let the child take you to his or her classroom. Or you can go outside for recess if you prefer. The idea is to spend the entire lunch period with your assigned child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they still jump rope?\u201d Lois asked.</p><p>Ms. Mayer nodded. \u201cWith the same rhymes we used when I was a girl.\u201d</p><p>The women exchanged smiles.</p><p>\u201cThe important thing is to interact with the child,\u201d the school counselor continued. \u201cGet to know him or her and forge a friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about seeing the child outside school?\u201d This question came from Maggie, who appeared to be in her early fifties.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll have to be approved by the child\u2019s parent or guardian.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie couldn\u2019t imagine seeing the child other than inside the protected walls of the school. She didn\u2019t want to get emotionally attached. Besides, that wasn\u2019t part of the deal. All that was required was to come in and have lunch with her young charge. If he or she wanted to show off school assignments, fine. But that was the limit of what Anne Marie could handle. She had enough to cope with; she didn\u2019t need to add anything else to the mix. Any relationship with an at-risk child would have to remain casual. Nothing beyond the most basic obligations.</p><p>The orientation meeting took the full half hour. Several additional questions were asked, but Anne Marie only half listened. While the others chatted, she struggled, asking herself over and over if this was the right volunteer program. She couldn\u2019t imagine why Elise seemed to think she\u2019d be a perfect Lunch Buddy. Anne Marie didn\u2019t feel perfect. What she felt was...nothing. Nothing at all. Zoned out. Emotionally dead. Disinterested.</p><p>Ms. Mayer handed out the assignments, leaving Anne Marie for last. She must have sensed her doubts because she asked, \u201cDo you have any further questions?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie shook her head. \u201cNot really. I\u2019m just wondering if I\u2019m really a good candidate for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not give it a try? I suspect you\u2019ll enjoy it. Almost everyone does.\u201d</p><p>The other woman\u2019s reassurance warmed her. \u201cOkay, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe child I have in mind for you is named Ellen Falk,\u201d she went on to say. \u201cEllen is eight years old and in second grade. Because of the Right to Privacy Laws, I\u2019m not allowed to reveal any details about her home background. However, I can tell you that Ellen is currently living with her maternal grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she been in this school long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen\u2019s been a student here for the past two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Before Anne Marie could ask why the school counselor had decided to pair her with this particular child, Helen Mayer continued. \u201cEllen is an intense child. Very quiet. Shy. She doesn\u2019t have a lot to say, but don\u2019t let that discourage you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Anne Marie said again.</p><p>\u201cTalk to her and be patient. She\u2019ll speak to you when she\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Oh, great. She\u2019d have to carry the entire conversation for heaven only knew how many weeks. \u201cIs there a reason you decided to match me up with this child?\u201d she asked. Surely there was another one, another little girl who was more personable. Anne Marie wasn\u2019t much of a talker herself these days, and she wasn\u2019t sure that pairing her with an intense, reticent child would work.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent question,\u201d Helen Mayer said approvingly. \u201cEllen loves to read, and since you own Blossom Street Books...well, it seemed to be a good fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen is one of our top second-grade readers.\u201d</p><p>Rather than suggest being paired with a different child, Anne Marie decided to go ahead with this arrangement. \u201cI look forward to meeting her,\u201d she said, wincing inwardly at the lie.</p><p>\u201cEllen has first lunch, which starts in a few minutes, so if you\u2019ll come with me, I\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie still wasn\u2019t convinced she was ready for this. However, it was now or never. Once she walked out of Room 121, Anne Marie knew that unless she met the child immediately, she wouldn\u2019t be back.</p><p>Ms. Mayer led her down the hallway to a row of classrooms, each door marked with the grade and the teacher\u2019s name. Ellen was in Ms. Peterski\u2019s class. Helen Mayer waited until a young woman\u2014obviously Ms. Peterski\u2014and twenty or so children had filed out, then walked inside, Anne Marie a few steps behind her.</p><p>The first thing Anne Marie noticed was how impossibly small the desks were. The second was the child sitting in the far corner all alone. Her head was lowered, and her stick-straight hair fell forward, hiding her eyes.</p><p>\u201cEllen,\u201d the school counselor said, her voice full of enthusiasm. \u201cI want you to meet your Lunch Buddy.\u201d</p><p>The little girl, dressed in dirty tennis shoes, jeans and a red T-shirt, slid out of her chair and moved toward them, her gaze on the floor.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie, meet Ellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Ellen,\u201d Anne Marie said dutifully. She kept her voice soft and modulated.</p><p>Ellen didn\u2019t acknowledge the greeting.</p><p>After an awkward silence, Ms. Mayer spoke again. \u201cEllen, would you please escort your guest to the lunchroom?\u201d</p><p>In response Ellen nodded and walked quickly out of the room. She stood outside the door until Anne Marie caught up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice T-shirt you\u2019re wearing,\u201d Anne Marie said, testing the waters. \u201cRed is one of my favorite colors.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>The noise from the cafeteria grew louder as they made their way down the hall. Ellen joined the other students in the lunch line and Anne Marie stood behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for lunch today?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>Ellen pointed to one of the students at a nearby table, spooning macaroni and cheese into her mouth. \u201cThat.\u201d</p><p>At last! The eight-year-old actually had a voice.</p><p>The line started to move. \u201cMacaroni and cheese used to be one of my favorite lunches,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cDo you like it, too?\u201d</p><p>Ellen shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite?\u201d</p><p>She expected the universal response of pizza. Instead Ellen said, \u201cChili and corn bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that, too.\u201d Well, she didn\u2019t hate it, but it wasn\u2019t one of Anne Marie\u2019s favorites. Thus far they didn\u2019t seem to have a lot in common.</p><p>Their lunch consisted of macaroni and cheese, a gelatin salad, carrot sticks, milk and an oatmeal cookie. Carrying her tray, Anne Marie followed the girl to a table near the back of the room. Ellen chose to sit at the far end, away from the other children.</p><p>Anne Marie set her tray across from Ellen, then pulled out her chair and sat down. Ellen bowed her head and folded her hands on her lap for a silent moment before she reached for her silverware. Apparently she was saying grace before eating her lunch.</p><p>Anne Marie took a sip of milk once Ellen had taken her first bite. \u201cI understand you like to read,\u201d she said conversationally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ellen nodded.</p><p>\u201cI own a bookstore. Have you read any of the Harry Potter books?\u201d</p><p>Ellen shook her head. \u201cMy grandma said they\u2019re too advanced for me. She said I could read them in fourth grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother\u2019s probably right.\u201d</p> <p>Ellen crunched down on a carrot stick.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your favorite author?\u201d Anne Marie asked, encouraged by the girl\u2019s response.</p><p>Ellen swallowed. \u201cI like lots of authors.\u201d</p><p>Again, this was progress. Of a sort. And the girl didn\u2019t talk with her mouth full, which meant she\u2019d been taught some manners.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was your age, books were my best friends.\u201d Anne Marie could recall reading in her bedroom with the door closed to drown out the sound of her parents arguing.</p> <p>That comment didn\u2019t warrant a response. Anne Marie took another bite of her lunch as she mentally sorted through potential topics of conversation. It was hard to remember what she\u2019d liked when she was eight. She didn\u2019t think Ellen would be interested in hearing about her widowed friends or her list of Twenty Wishes.</p><p>They continued to eat in silence until an idea struck Anne Marie. \u201cDo you like dogs?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded vigorously.</p><p>\u201cI have a dog.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since they\u2019d sat at the table, Ellen looked up. \u201cA boy dog or a girl dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boy. His name is Baxter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBaxter.\u201d A hint of a smile flashed in her eyes.</p><p>Anne Marie felt a surge of relief. She\u2019d hit pay dirt. Ellen liked dogs. \u201cHe\u2019s a Yorkshire terrier. Do you know what kind of dog that is?\u201d</p><p>Ellen shook her head.</p><p>\u201cBaxter is small but he has the heart of a tiger. He\u2019s not afraid of anything.\u201d</p><p>Ellen\u2019s eyes brightened.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to meet him one day?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded again. \u201cWhat color is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly he\u2019s black but his face is sort of a tan, and he has funny-looking ears that stick straight up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy ears stick out, too,\u201d Ellen said in a solemn voice.</p><p>Anne Marie studied the child. She could see the faint outline of Ellen\u2019s ears beneath her straight hair, which hung just below her chin. \u201cI had ears like that when I was your age,\u201d Anne Marie told her. \u201cThen I grew up and my ears stayed the same size and everything else got bigger.\u201d</p><p>Ellen took another bite of her macaroni and cheese.</p><p>Anne Marie did, too. She finished the lunch period by telling the girl stories about Baxter. Ellen asked dozens of questions and even giggled once.</p><p>The other children gradually left the lunchroom, drifting out to the schoolyard. The muted sound of their play could be heard through the windows. Anne Marie looked out several times; when she asked if Ellen wanted to go outside, the youngster declined.</p><p>The bell finally rang, signaling the end of lunch. Ellen stood.</p><p>So did Anne Marie.</p><p>Ellen carried her dirty tray to the kitchen and showed Anne Marie where to place it.</p><p>\u201cI guess you have to go back to class now,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>Ellen nodded. Anne Marie walked her to the classroom door and just as she was about to leave, Ellen whispered something she couldn\u2019t quite hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>Ellen glanced up. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said more loudly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ellen. I\u2019ll see you next Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>Ellen smiled, then quietly entered the room and walked to her desk.</p><p>As Anne Marie watched, her chest constricted with a sensation that felt alien to her. It was a good feeling, though\u2014one that came from reaching out to someone else.</p><p>Elise was right; Anne Marie did feel better for volunteering. Little Ellen Falk needed a friend.</p><p>The ironic thing was that Anne Marie needed one even more.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>After leaving Woodrow Wilson Elementary, Anne Marie ran a few errands in the neighborhood. She bought groceries, went to the post office and picked up some dry cleaning. Her Wednesdays were generally crowded with appointments and chores.</p><p>When she brought the groceries up to her apartment, she noticed that the light on her answering machine was flashing. After greeting a sleepy Baxter and putting the perishables in the refrigerator, she grabbed a pen and pad and pushed the message button.</p><p>The first one was from the school counselor. \u201cAnne Marie, this is Helen Mayer. I wanted to see how everything went with Ellen. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at the school.\u201d She then repeated the phone number. \u201cSee you next Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>The second message began. \u201cAnne Marie\u2014\u201d Melissa Roche\u2019s voice stopped Anne Marie cold.</p><p>\u201cCould you call me at your earliest convenience?\u201d Her question was followed by a slight hesitation. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>The recording ended with Melissa reciting her phone number. \u201cThis is a new number. If I don\u2019t hear from you by the end of the day, I\u2019ll call the bookstore.\u201d</p><p>That sounded almost like a threat.</p><p>Anne Marie wondered about Melissa\u2019s request as she finished putting the groceries away. When she was done, she tentatively reached for the phone. If Melissa was seeking her out, it had to be something serious, although she couldn\u2019t imagine what. The call connected and the phone rang twice. Anne Marie was hoping for a reprieve. She didn\u2019t get one.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Melissa answered. Her voice seemed clipped, defensive.</p><p>\u201cThis is Anne Marie,\u201d she said, trying to keep her own voice as unemotional as possible.</p><p>\u201cI know who it is,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cI have Caller ID.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left a message for me,\u201d Anne Marie reminded her. The enmity between them remained, despite the fact that Robert was gone.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d Melissa told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free now.\u201d Anne Marie would rather get this over with.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I need to talk to you face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly what Anne Marie had hoped to avoid. Naturally, she was suspicious of Melissa\u2019s sudden need for a meeting. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie, please, I wouldn\u2019t ask if it wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled slowly. \u201cAll right. When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about tomorrow night? We could meet for dinner....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI close the store on Thursday nights. It would have to be after eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Friday night then?\u201d Melissa suggested.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Anne Marie knew her reluctance must be evident. She could think of a dozen ways she\u2019d rather spend Friday evening than sitting across a table from her stepdaughter.</p><p>Melissa chose a restaurant and they set the time. The conversation ended shortly thereafter, and when she put the phone back, Anne Marie felt queasy. Everything about their short conversation had unnerved her. She hated going into this meeting with Melissa so unprepared, but then it occurred to her that perhaps Brandon knew what was going on. She hadn\u2019t spoken to her stepson in a few weeks, and this was a good excuse to catch up with him. She hoped he could clear up the mystery; if he had any idea why Melissa had contacted her after all these months, he\u2019d certainly tell her.</p><p>Anne Marie opened a drawer in the kitchen and removed the telephone directory, then flipped through the pages until she found her stepson\u2019s work number.</p><p>Brandon answered immediately, obviously pleased to hear from her.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie! How are you doing?\u201d he asked. Although Robert had been especially close to Melissa, the relationship between father and son was often strained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Good. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Brandon was a claims adjuster for an insurance company and she was well aware that he didn\u2019t have time to waste on idle chitchat.</p><p>\u201cI heard from Melissa this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa called you?\u201d That was strange enough to instantly get his attention. \u201cWhat did she want?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cTo talk to me, or so she says. We\u2019re meeting for dinner. Can you tell me what that\u2019s about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa called you?\u201d Brandon repeated. He seemed completely at a loss. \u201cI couldn\u2019t begin to tell you what she wants.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t figure it out, either. She insists we talk face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to give her a call?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d Whatever it was didn\u2019t appear to involve Brandon.</p><p>\u201cLet me know what\u2019s up, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard from her?\u201d Brandon and Melissa had always been fairly close, even though he openly disapproved of his sister\u2019s attitude toward Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cNot in a couple of weeks, which isn\u2019t like her. After Dad died, I heard from her practically every day. Lately, though, she\u2019s been keeping to herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t called her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve left her a couple of messages. Apparently she\u2019s been spending all her time with that guy she\u2019s seeing. If I\u2019m reading the situation right, it sounds like she and Michael are serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that good news or bad?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s good. I like Michael and as far as I can tell, he really cares about Melissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a couple of times. He came to Dad\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie had been too grief-stricken to remember who\u2019d been there; not only that, Michael would\u2019ve been a stranger to her, one among many.</p><p>Was Melissa planning to confide in her about this young man? Hard to believe, but Anne Marie\u2019s curiosity was even more pronounced now.</p><p>She replaced the phone, staring out the kitchen window onto the alley behind Blossom Street. She\u2019d just have to wait until Friday to learn the reason for Melissa\u2019s phone call.</p><p>On Friday, Anne Marie got to the restaurant shortly before the predetermined time of seven. Based on past experience, she expected Melissa to be late; that was usually the case, especially if the event happened to include Anne Marie\u2014like dinner at her and Robert\u2019s house or a holiday get-together. It was yet another way she displayed her complete lack of regard for her stepmother. But when Anne Marie arrived Melissa was already there, pacing outside the restaurant. Anne Marie was shocked, to say the least.</p><p>Melissa had suggested a well-known seafood place on the waterfront close to Pike Place Market. Walking fast, it was about twenty minutes from the bookstore, and Anne Marie had worn an extra sweater against the cold wind coming off Elliot Bay.</p><p>Her stepdaughter abruptly stopped her pacing the moment she saw her. Because of their long, unfortunate history, Anne Marie didn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014lower her guard. She\u2019d been sucker punched too many times by some slyly cruel comment or unmistakable slight.</p><p>\u201cHello, Melissa,\u201d she said, maintaining a cool facade. \u201cYou\u2019re looking well.\u201d Her stepdaughter was an attractive woman, tall and willowy in stature. Her hair was dark and fell in soft natural curls about her face. She was wearing black jeans and an expensive three-quarter-length khaki raincoat. Even as a girl, she\u2019d been almost obsessed with fashion and appearances, an obsession her father had indulged. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look good, too,\u201d Melissa said carelessly. \u201cAre you dating anyone?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie bit her tongue. \u201cNo. If that\u2019s what you want to talk about, I think I should leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, would you?\u201d Melissa snapped. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you dating.\u201d</p><p>The derisive, scornful attitude was there in full display, and Anne Marie wondered why she still tried. Her stepdaughter seemed unreachable\u2014by her, anyway\u2014and had been from the day they met.</p> <p>\u201cI...I shouldn\u2019t have asked,\u201d Melissa murmured in what might have passed for an apology if her voice hadn\u2019t held the same level of hostility. \u201cIt isn\u2019t really any of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go inside?\u201d Anne Marie said. The wind was growing stronger, and the rain seemed about to start any minute.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Melissa agreed, moving quickly to the door.</p><p>Melissa had made a reservation, and they were soon seated at a table by the window. The water was as dark as the sky but Anne Marie gazed out at the lights, dimly visible in the fog. Then she turned to her menu. She and Melissa both seemed determined to make a thorough study of it. With her nerves on edge, Anne Marie didn\u2019t have much of an appetite. She decided on clam chowder in a bread bowl and when the server came, she was surprised to hear Melissa order the same thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like some coffee, too,\u201d Melissa told him.</p> <p>\u201cI would, as well.\u201d</p><p>Once the waiter had left, Melissa nervously reached for her linen napkin, which she spread carefully across her lap. Then she rearranged her silverware.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to tell me what this is about?\u201d Anne Marie asked. Any exchange of pleasantries was pointless.</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cIt\u2019s probably unfair to come to you about this,\u201d Melissa finally said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie closed her eyes briefly. \u201cRather than hint at what you want to say, why don\u2019t you just say it?\u201d</p><p>Melissa placed her hands in her lap and lowered her head. \u201cI...I haven\u2019t been doing well since Dad died.\u201d</p> <p>Anne Marie nodded. \u201cI haven\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>Melissa looked up and bit her lip. \u201cI miss him so much.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie tried to swallow the sudden lump in her throat. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought if I went into his office and talked to his friends I\u2019d feel better.\u201d</p><p>The waiter brought their coffee, and Anne Marie welcomed the distraction. She could feel tears welling up and she didn\u2019t want the embarrassment of crying in front of Melissa.</p><p>When they were alone again, Melissa dumped sugar in her coffee. \u201cLike I said, I decided to stop by the office,\u201d she muttered, scooping up three tiny half-and-half cups and peeling away the tops. \u201cDad was always so proud of his role in the business.\u201d</p><p>Robert had every right to be proud. He\u2019d worked for the data storage business almost from its inception and much of the company\u2019s success could be attributed to his efforts. He enjoyed his job, although the demands on his time had increased constantly. For three consecutive years, Robert had planned to take Anne Marie to Paris for their wedding anniversary. Each year he\u2019d been forced to cancel their vacation plans because of business.</p><p>\u201cEveryone must\u2019ve been happy to see you,\u201d Anne Marie commented politely.</p> <p>Melissa shrugged. \u201cEven in this short amount of time, there\u2019ve been a lot of changes.\u201d</p><p>That was understandable. Robert had died almost ten months ago, and life had a way of creeping forward, no matter what the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember Rebecca Gilroy?\u201d Melissa asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The young woman had been Robert\u2019s personal assistant. As Anne Marie recalled, Rebecca had started working for the company a year or so before Robert\u2019s heart attack.</p><p>\u201cShe had a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was pregnant.\u201d Had she learned of it, Anne Marie would\u2019ve sent her a gift. She\u2019d only met Rebecca on a few occasions, but she\u2019d liked her.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t married.\u201d Melissa\u2019s gaze held hers.</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t consider that significant. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly a prerequisite these days.\u201d</p><p>Melissa picked up her coffee and Anne Marie noticed that her hands were trembling.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember exactly when you and my dad separated?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie expelled her breath. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m likely to forget, Melissa. Of course I remember. He...left on September 18th the year before last.\u201d She lifted her shoulders as she took in a deep breath, feeling raw and vulnerable. \u201cI was miserable without your father. I still am.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure where this conversation was leading and strained to hold on to her patience. Exhaling, she added, \u201cDespite the fact that you dislike me, we\u2019ve always had something very important in common. We both loved your father.\u201d</p><p>Melissa didn\u2019t acknowledge the comment; instead she stared down at the table. \u201cOne night a couple of months after you and Dad separated, I decided to treat him to dinner. He was working too hard and he often stayed late at the office.\u201d</p><p>That was a fairly typical occurrence throughout their marriage. As a company executive, Robert put in long hours.</p><p>\u201cI picked up a couple of sandwiches and some of his favorite soup and went over there to surprise him.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded patiently, wondering when her stepdaughter would get to the point.</p><p>\u201cThe security guard let me in and when I walked into the office...\u201d</p><p>The waiter approached the table with their order; Melissa stopped talking and even seemed grateful for the intrusion.</p><p>Anne Marie took her first taste, delicious despite her lack of appetite. Realizing Melissa hadn\u2019t continued, she gestured with her spoon. \u201cGo on. You walked into the office and?\u201d</p><p>Melissa nodded and reluctantly picked up her own spoon. \u201cRebecca was there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMandatory overtime was one of the job requirements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t exactly...working.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Melissa glared at her then. \u201cDo I have to spell it out for you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make me say it, then fine. Rebecca and my father were...they were having sex.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s spoon clattered to the floor as the shock overwhelmed her. Her body felt mercifully numb, and her mind refused to accept what she\u2019d heard. It was like the day the company president had come to the bookstore to personally tell her Robert had died. The same kind of dazed unbelief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Anne Marie,\u201d Melissa whispered. \u201cI...I shouldn\u2019t have been so straightforward, but I didn\u2019t know how else to say it.\u201d</p><p>Melissa\u2019s words had begun to fall together in her mind. Robert and Rebecca sexually involved. Rebecca pregnant and unmarried. Rebecca had a child.</p><p>Anne Marie could no longer breathe.</p><p>\u201cRebecca\u2019s baby...\u201d</p><p>Melissa\u2019s eyes held hers. \u201cI\u2019m not positive...but I think so. You know her better than I do. I only saw her the one time...with Dad, and then when I stopped by the office recently. I...I had the impression that she isn\u2019t the type to sleep around. Oh, and she was at the funeral.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie closed her eyes and shook her head. All of a sudden, the few spoonfuls of soup she\u2019d managed to swallow came back up her throat. Grabbing her napkin, she held it over her mouth and leaped from her chair. She weaved unsteadily around the tables, then bolted for the ladies\u2019 room and made it inside just in time. Stumbling into a vacant stall, Anne Marie was violently ill. When she finished, she was so weak she couldn\u2019t immediately get up.</p><p>Melissa was waiting for her as she came out of the stall and handed her a dampened paper towel. Tears had forged wet trails down the younger woman\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry...I shouldn\u2019t have told you. I...I had no idea what else to do.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie held the cold, wet towel to her face with both hands. Shock, betrayal, outrage\u2014all these emotions bombarded her with such force she didn\u2019t know which one to react to first.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve talked to Brandon,\u201d Melissa whispered, leaning against the wall. She slid down until she was in a crouching position. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you...I shouldn\u2019t have told you.\u201d</p><p>A waitress came into the ladies\u2019 room. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d she asked, looking concerned. \u201cThe manager asked me to make sure there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with your dinner.\u201d</p><p>As Melissa straightened, Anne Marie tried to reassure the woman that this had nothing to do with the food. \u201cWe\u2019re fine. It wasn\u2019t the soup...it\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be no charge for your dinners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please. I\u2019ll pay.\u201d The anger had begun to fortify her now, and she washed her hands with a grim determination that was sure to kill any potential germs.</p><p>Melissa waited for her by the washroom door, following her back to the table. Anne Marie scooped up her purse and slapped two twenty-dollar bills down on the table. That should more than cover their soup and coffee. Like a stray puppy, her stepdaughter trailed her outside, a foot or two behind.</p><p>The rain had begun in earnest by then and was falling so hard large drops bounced on the sidewalk. Anne Marie flattened herself against the side of the building while she struggled to comprehend what she\u2019d heard. It seemed impossible. Unbelievable.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be right. Robert would never risk getting Rebecca pregnant. Even the one night they\u2019d spent together\u2014She froze. They hadn\u2019t used protection. She\u2019d told him she was off her birth control pills and it was as if it no longer mattered to him. His lack of concern had thrilled Anne Marie. She saw it as the first crack in his stubborn unwillingness to accept her need for a baby.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie...\u201d Melissa choked out her name. The tears ran down her stepdaughter\u2019s face, mingling with the rain. Her hair hung in wet clumps but she didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cSomeone needs to talk to Rebecca\u2014to ask her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Melissa wailed.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat difference does it make now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the baby\u2019s Dad\u2019s, then...then it\u2019s related to me. And if that baby really is Dad\u2019s, then...I have to know. I\u2019ve got a right to know.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie wondered if Robert\u2019s daughter would have been as tolerant toward a child she might have had. \u201cDid Rebecca\u2014did she have a boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boy.\u201d</p><p>The pain was as searing as a hot poker against her skin. It took her a moment to find her voice. \u201cIf the child is Robert\u2019s, why hasn\u2019t Rebecca said anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know,\u201d Melissa whispered. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to hurt me,\u201d Anne Marie said coldly.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Melissa\u2019s denial was instantaneous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no love lost between us.\u201d Anne Marie had no illusions about her stepdaughter\u2019s motives. \u201cYou don\u2019t like me. You never have. All these years you\u2019ve been trying to get back at me, to punish me, and now you have.\u201d</p><p>Not bothering to deny the accusation, Melissa buried her face in her hands and started to weep uncontrollably. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie wanted to turn her back on Robert\u2019s daughter and walk away. But she couldn\u2019t bear to hear Melissa weep. Even though she was the one Robert had betrayed, Anne Marie reached for his daughter and folded her arms around Melissa.</p><p>The two women clung together, hardly aware of the people scurrying by.</p> <p>Anne Marie\u2019s reserve broke apart and the pain of Robert\u2019s betrayal came over her in an explosive, unstoppable rush. She wept as she never had before, even at Robert\u2019s funeral. Her shoulders heaved and the noisy, racking sobs consumed her.</p><p>Then it was Melissa who was holding her, comforting her. After all the years of looking for common ground with her stepdaughter, Anne Marie had finally found it.</p><p>In her husband\u2019s betrayal.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Barbie Foster stood in line at the movie theater multiplex, waiting to purchase a ticket, preferably for a comedy. She needed a reason to laugh. Her day had started early when she opened Barbie\u2019s, her dress shop, two blocks off Blossom Street. The shop was high-end, exclusive and very expensive. Her clientele were women who could easily afford to drop four figures on a dress. Barbie made sure they got their money\u2019s worth, providing advice, accessories and free alterations. She had a number of regular customers who counted on her for their entire wardrobes. Her own sense of style had served her well.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t want to sound conceited, but Barbie was aware that she was an attractive woman. Since Gary\u2019s death, she\u2019d received no shortage of attention from the opposite sex. Men wanted a woman like her on their arm\u2014and, she suspected, they wanted her money. Barbie, however, wasn\u2019t easily swayed by flattery. She\u2019d been happy in her marriage and had loved her husband. At this point in her life she wasn\u2019t willing to settle for mere companionship or, heaven forbid, no-strings sex. She wanted love. She longed for a man who\u2019d treat her like a princess the way Gary had. Her friends told her that was a dated attitude; Barbie didn\u2019t care. Unfortunately there weren\u2019t many princes around these days.</p><p>She\u2019d married young. In retrospect she recognized how fortunate she\u2019d been in finding Gary. She\u2019d had no real life experience, so the fact that she\u2019d met a really wonderful man and fallen in love with him was pure luck. He was ten years her senior; at thirty, he\u2019d had a wisdom beyond his years and a great capacity for love, for loyalty. He\u2019d been working for her father at the time and came to the house often. She\u2019d had a crush on him that developed into genuine love, although it took her a few years to recognize just how genuine it was. At nineteen, she always made sure she happened to be around whenever he stopped by, and enjoyed parading through the house to the pool\u2014in her bikini, of course. She still smiled at the way Gary had looked in every direction except hers.</p><p>They\u2019d married when she was twenty-one, with her father\u2019s blessing and, surprisingly perhaps, her mother\u2019s. She got pregnant the first week of their honeymoon. When she\u2019d delivered identical twin sons, Gary had been over the moon. The pregnancy had been difficult, however, and he\u2019d insisted the two boys were family enough.</p><p>The twins, Eric and Kurt, filled their lives and they were idyllically happy. Not that she and Gary didn\u2019t have their share of differences and arguments, but they forgave each other quickly and never confused disagreement with anger. Their household had been calm, orderly, contented. The plane crash ended all that. Barbie had always been close to her sons, but following the tragic deaths, of Gary and her father, the three of them were closer than ever. They helped one another through their grief, and even now they talked almost every day.</p><p>Encouraged by her mother and sons, a year after Gary\u2019s death Barbie started her own business. The dress shop helped take her mind off her loneliness and gave her purpose. Her sons were eighteen and growing increasingly independent. They\u2019d be on their own soon. As it happened, they were attending colleges on the opposite side of the country. Swallowing her natural instinct to hold on to her children, she flew out to Boston and New York with her sons, got them settled in their respective schools and then flew home. She\u2019d wept like a baby throughout the entire five-hour flight back to the West Coast.</p><p>Her house seemed so empty without the boys\u2014her house and her life. She\u2019d never felt more alone than she had since last September when she\u2019d accompanied Kurt and Eric to their East Coast schools. Thankfully, though, they\u2019d both come home for Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p> <p>She\u2019d kept herself occupied with the shop, but the Valentine\u2019s get-together with the other widows had revealed a different kind of opportunity. Barbie had begun to compose her list of Twenty Wishes, hoping to discover a new objective, some new goal to pursue. Her mother had leaped at this idea with an enthusiasm she hadn\u2019t shown in years, and if for no other reason, Barbie had followed suit. They often did things together and, in fact, her mother was Barbie\u2019s best friend.</p><p>The line moved. Barbie approached the teenage cashier and handed her a ten-dollar bill.</p><p>\u201cWhich movie?\u201d</p><p>Barbie smiled at her. \u201cYou decide. Preferably a comedy.\u201d</p><p>The girl searched her face. \u201cThere are three or four showing. You don\u2019t care which one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d All Barbie wanted to do was escape reality for the next two hours.</p><p>The teenager took her money and a single ticket shot up, which she gave Barbie, along with her change. \u201cTheater number twelve,\u201d she instructed. \u201cThe movie starts at four twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>Although she wasn\u2019t hungry, the instant Barbie stepped into the lobby, the scent of popcorn made her mouth water. She purchased a small bag and a soft drink, then headed for theater number twelve.</p> <p>The previews were underway, and Barbie quickly located a seat in a middle row. She settled down with her popcorn and drink, dropping her purse in the empty seat beside her.</p><p>Glancing about, Barbie saw nothing but couples, most of them older and presumably retired. She nibbled on her popcorn and all at once her throat went dry. The entire world seemed to be made up of people in love. She envied the other women in the audience their long-lasting relationships, their forever loves, which was what she and Gary should have had. She wanted another chance. She was attractive, well off, a nice person\u2014and alone. Falling in love again was first on her list of wishes. But she didn\u2019t want another relationship unless she could find a man like Gary and there didn\u2019t seem to be many of those.</p><p>Until the other widows had started talking about those stupid wishes, Barbie\u2019s life had seemed to be trudging along satisfactorily enough. Her mother\u2019s list was nearly complete. Not Barbie\u2019s. She\u2019d written down a few things besides falling in love. She wanted to learn how to belly dance. She and Gary had seen a belly dance performance during a brief stopover in Cairo years before and she\u2019d been intrigued by the sensuous, feminine movements. She\u2019d listed something else, too. She wanted to go snorkeling in Hawaii and shopping in Paris and sightseeing in London\u2014all of which she\u2019d done with Gary and enjoyed. But she didn\u2019t want to do them alone.</p><p>At the moment, her desire to fall in love again seemed an illusion beyond her grasp. But she wasn\u2019t exactly looking for a relationship. If she truly wanted to love and be loved, she had to be receptive to love, open to it, willing to risk the pain of loss.</p><p>She shook her head, telling herself there was no point in believing that a man might one day love her the way Gary had. Love her. Not her money, not her beauty. Her.</p><p>All of a sudden tears welled in her eyes and she dashed them angrily away. She didn\u2019t have a thing to cry about. Not a single, solitary thing. Dozens of women, hundreds of them, would envy her life. She had no money problems, her children were responsible adults, and at forty she didn\u2019t look a day over thirty. The tears made no sense whatsoever, and yet there was no denying them.</p><p>Reaching for her purse, Barbie pulled out a pack of tissues, grabbed one and loudly blew her nose.</p><p>The previews for upcoming features were still flashing across the screen. They were apparently comedies because the audience found the clips amusing. Sporadic laughter broke out around her.</p><p>Sniffling and dabbing her eyes, she noticed a man in a wheelchair approaching the row. He was staring at her, which wasn\u2019t uncommon. Men liked to look at her. Only it wasn\u2019t appreciation or approval she saw in his gaze. Instead, he seemed to be regarding her with irritation.</p><p>Maneuvering his chair into the empty space beside Barbie, he turned to glare at her. \u201cIn case you weren\u2019t aware of it, you\u2019re sitting in the row reserved for people with wheelchairs and their companions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Barbie hadn\u2019t realized that, although now he\u2019d mentioned it, she saw the row was clearly marked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to leave.\u201d His words lacked any hint of friendliness.</p><p>He must have someone with him and wanted the seat for that person. No wonder he frowned at her as if she\u2019d trespassed on his personal property.</p><p>Retrieving her large purse, she draped it over her shoulder, grabbed her popcorn and soft drink and stood. Instead of walking all the way through the empty row, she tried to get past him.</p><p>In an effort to give her the necessary room, he started to roll back his wheelchair and somehow caught the hem of her pants. Barbie stumbled and in the process of righting herself, dumped the entire contents of her soft drink in his lap.</p><p>The man gasped at the shock as the soda drenched his pants and ice cubes slid to the floor.</p><p>\u201cOh, I am so sorry.\u201d Barbie plunged her hand in her purse for the tissue packet and managed to spill her popcorn on him as well.</p><p>\u201cI...I couldn\u2019t be sorrier,\u201d she muttered, more embarrassed than she\u2019d ever felt before.</p><p>\u201cWould you kindly just leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pointed in the direction he wanted her to go, then shook his head in disgust.</p><p>Barbie couldn\u2019t get out of the row fast enough. Feeling like a clumsy fool, she rushed into the empty lobby. She yanked a handful of napkins from the dispenser and hurriedly returned to the theater.</p><p>The man was still brushing popcorn off his lap when she offered him the napkins.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything else?\u201d she asked in a loud whisper.</p><p>His intense blue eyes glared back at her. \u201cI think you\u2019ve already done enough. The best thing you could do is leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to be so rude. \u201cI said I was sorry,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cFine. Apology accepted. Now if it\u2019s possible, I\u2019d like to enjoy the movie.\u201d</p><p>Barbie gritted her teeth. She felt like dumping another soft drink on his head. It wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d purposely spilled the soda. It\u2019d been an accident and she\u2019d apologized repeatedly. She felt her regret turn into annoyance at his ungracious reaction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because he\u2019d made it abundantly clear that he wanted her far away, Barbie took an empty seat on the aisle five rows back from the wheelchair section. She made a determined effort to focus her attention on the movie, which had started about ten minutes earlier.</p><p>It was a comedy, just as she\u2019d requested, only now she wasn\u2019t in any mood to laugh. Instead, she tapped her foot compulsively, scowling at the unfriendly man seated below her. When she saw that her tapping was irritating others, she crossed her legs and allowed her foot to swing. In all her life she\u2019d never met anyone so incredibly rude. He deserved to have that soda dumped in his lap!</p><p>The rest of the audience laughed at the antics on the screen. Barbie might have, too, if she\u2019d been able to concentrate. Almost against her will, her eyes kept traveling to the man in the wheelchair. The little girl in her wanted to stick her tongue out at him.</p><p>He\u2019d asked her to move and yet no one sat next to him. In fact, the entire row was empty. He hadn\u2019t come with anyone; he just didn\u2019t want her sitting next to him.</p> <p>What exactly was wrong with her? Lots of men would have welcomed her company. And they would\u2019ve been more polite about that little accident, too. She was tempted to give that...that Neanderthal a piece of her mind. He had a lot of nerve asking her to leave. It was a free country and she could sit anywhere she darn well pleased.</p><p>Barbie left halfway through the movie, pacing the lobby in her exasperation. Where did he get off acting like such a jerk\u2014and worse, making her feel like one? The teenager who\u2019d sold her the ticket watched her for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d she called out.</p><p>Barbie whirled around, her agitation mounting. \u201cI was just insulted,\u201d she said, although there wasn\u2019t anything the girl could do about it. \u201cWithout realizing it, I sat in the wheelchair seating and this man told me to move.\u201d</p><p>The girl looked down, but not before Barbie caught her smiling.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s funny?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m sorry. You didn\u2019t have to move if you didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that at the time. I assumed there was someone with him and I\u2019d taken his or her spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems. Furthermore, I didn\u2019t mean to spill my drink on him. It was an accident.\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou spilled your drink? On him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn his lap.\u201d</p><p>The teenager giggled and covered her mouth with her hand. \u201cDid he get mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but it was an accident. The popcorn, too.\u201d</p><p>Another giggle escaped. \u201cOh, my gosh.\u201d</p><p>Barbie raised her eyebrows at this girl\u2019s amusement. \u201cI have never met a more unreasonable or ruder man in my entire life,\u201d she said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my uncle Mark,\u201d the girl explained, grinning openly now.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your...uncle.\u201d Barbie seemed to leap from one fire into another. Every word she\u2019d said was likely to be repeated to \u201cUncle Mark.\u201d Well, good. Someone should give that arrogant, supercilious hothead a real talking-to. Who did he think he was, anyway?</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, he can be a bit unreasonable,\u201d the girl said.</p> <p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let him bother you.\u201d</p><p>Barbie opened her mouth to argue and then decided the girl was right. She\u2019d paid for her ticket, the same as he had, and could sit wherever she pleased. If she chose to sit in the wheelchair area, that was her business, as long as no one legitimately needed the seat. And no one did.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back in?\u201d the girl suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s a very funny movie, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks\u2014I will.\u201d Barbie marched into the theater, determined to sit where she wanted.</p><p>And lost her nerve.</p><p>It just wasn\u2019t in her to create a scene. Instead she walked over to her previous seat. She slipped into it, balancing her purse on her lap, and stared at the screen. Whatever was happening in the movie bypassed her completely.</p><p>Giving up on the film, she studied the back of the man\u2019s head. He must\u2019ve sensed her watching him because he shifted his position, as though he felt uncomfortable. Fine with her.</p><p>In another thirty minutes, the movie ended and the lights came on. The theater emptied, but Barbie remained in her seat. Mark whatever-his-name stayed where he was, too. When the last person had walked out, he wheeled his chair toward the exit.</p><p>\u201cAre you always so rude?\u201d she asked, striding after him.</p><p>He wheeled around and for an instant seemed surprised to see her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rude when the situation calls for it,\u201d Mark informed her.</p><p>In the darkened theater Barbie hadn\u2019t gotten a good look at him. She did now and almost did a double take. The man was gorgeous. Mean as a snake, though. Gary would never have talked to a woman the way this man did. He\u2019d always been respectful. Polite.</p><p>\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t apologized,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you do whatever you want. All I ask is that you stay out of my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly.\u201d She marched ahead with all the righteousness she could muster. But before she left the building, Barbie decided to stop at the ladies\u2019 room.</p><p>She\u2019d just emerged when she saw Mark wheel himself into the theater lobby.</p><p>\u201cHe was pretty annoyed,\u201d his niece said in a low voice, joining Barbie.</p><p>\u201cI told him exactly what I thought of him.\u201d</p><p>The girl smiled gleefully. \u201cDid you really?\u201d</p><p>Barbie nodded. \u201cAnd then some.\u201d Although she was beginning to suspect she\u2019d overreacted.</p><p>\u201cPeople tiptoe around him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d She and Gary had believed in treating people equally. Anything else was a form of discrimination, of seeing the disability and not the person.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because everyone in the family feels sorry for him and he hates that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Well, she certainly hadn\u2019t shown him any pity\u2014but maybe she\u2019d been somewhat rude herself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, though,\u201d the girl went on, \u201cwhich is one reason he stops in here on the evenings I\u2019m working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he come to the movies often?\u201d Barbie wasn\u2019t sure what had prompted the question.</p><p>\u201cUncle Mark comes to the movies every Monday night.\u201d The girl held Barbie\u2019s look for an extra-long moment. \u201cI\u2019m Tessa, by the way, and Mark Bassett is my uncle\u2019s name.\u201d She thrust out her hand.</p><p>Barbie shook it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m Barbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come again, won\u2019t you?\u201d Tessa asked.</p><p>\u201cI live in the neighborhood.\u201d Well, sort of. It was a twenty-minute drive, but this theater was the closest multiplex in her vicinity.</p><p>\u201cI wish you would,\u201d Tessa said, walking her to the glass doors that led to the parking lot. She held one open. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d Barbie said, removing the car keys from her purse. Sitting inside her vehicle, she let the conversation with Tessa run through her mind. Tessa was basically asking her to return the following Monday\u2014and she\u2019d more or less agreed. She\u2019d need to give that some thought. She felt an undeniable attraction to this man, not to mention a sense of challenge and the exhilaration that came with it. In fact, she hadn\u2019t reacted that strongly to anyone in...years. She didn\u2019t understand the intensity of her own response.</p><p>As she always did when she was upset or confused, Barbie phoned her mother. Lillie answered right away.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, where were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided to go to the movies. I\u2019m on my cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left you a message,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d come by the house and have dinner with me.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly ravenous, Barbie remembered that she hadn\u2019t eaten anything more than some toast and a few handfuls of popcorn all day.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want me to pick anything up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I got groceries earlier today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have your car yet?\u201d Barbie asked. The red-hot convertible had gone back to the dealership for the same problem as before. The shop had worked on the steering mechanism twice now.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m not worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so calm about all this.\u201d Barbie marveled at her mother\u2019s patience. She hadn\u2019t complained even once.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right, dear?\u201d her mother asked. \u201cYou sound agitated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, a little.\u201d Barbie went on to explain what had happened\u2014without, for some reason, mentioning that the man was in a wheelchair. To her dismay, her mother laughed.</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d she protested. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.... It\u2019s just that I can\u2019t imagine you being so clumsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was his fault,\u201d Barbie insisted. \u201cHe\u2019s just fortunate I didn\u2019t land in his lap.\u201d</p><p>Instantly a picture appeared in her mind, and to her shock, it wasn\u2019t an unpleasant one. Barbie saw herself sitting on Mark\u2019s lap, her arms around his neck, their eyes meeting, their lips...She shook her head. She didn\u2019t know where that vision had come from because the man was so...unpleasant.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me all about it once you\u2019re here,\u201d Lillie said.</p><p>\u201cSee you in a few minutes, then.\u201d Barbie was about to snap her cell phone shut when her mother\u2019s voice stopped her. \u201cBarbie, listen, I almost forgot. Jacqueline Donovan invited us to a small gathering next Monday. You\u2019ll be able to attend, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday?\u201d she repeated. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom,\u201d she said, making her decision. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve already got plans.\u201d</p><p>Mark Bassett wasn\u2019t going to get rid of her as easily as he no doubt hoped.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Anne Marie had been in emotional free fall ever since her Friday-night dinner with Melissa. She\u2019d tried to push the conversation from her mind but hadn\u2019t succeeded. Robert\u2019s unfaithfulness hung over her every minute of every day\u2014the betrayal, the pain, the anger. It would n\u2019t hurt as much if she hadn\u2019t so desperately wanted her husband\u2019s child. For him to adamantly refuse her and then fall into bed with another woman, a woman who now had a child that might be his, bordered on cruelty.</p><p>Another complication was her stepdaughter. Anne Marie didn\u2019t want to believe that Melissa had purposely set out to hurt and humiliate her, and yet she was suspicious. Still, she felt that Robert\u2019s daughter was distressed by her father\u2019s actions and had told the truth when she said she wasn\u2019t sure where else to turn. Anne Marie didn\u2019t understand, though, why Melissa hadn\u2019t confided in her brother. Surely Brandon would\u2019ve been a more natural choice. Had she come to Anne Marie because she wanted to talk to another woman? Because she knew that no one else had loved Robert as much? One thing was certain; the instant Melissa had seen how badly she\u2019d hurt Anne Marie, she was genuinely regretful. In the end, Melissa had been the one comforting her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On Sunday Anne Marie hid inside her small apartment with only Baxter for company. She didn\u2019t answer the phone, didn\u2019t check her messages. How she managed to work even half of Saturday was a mystery. At about noon, she pleaded a migraine and left the shop in Theresa\u2019s hands. Thankfully, the store was closed on Sundays.</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t leave her apartment other than to take Baxter for brief walks. She wandered from room to room with a box of tissues while she vented her pain and her grief.</p><p>How could Robert have let this happen? How could he betray her in such a fundamental way? The phone rang a number of times but she didn\u2019t answer. Her display screen showed that most of the calls were from Melissa, the last person she wanted to hear from. The messages accumulated until her voice-mail box was full. Anne Marie didn\u2019t care. As far as she was concerned, the less contact with the outside world the better.</p><p>Monday she had to work again. Intuitively, her staff\u2014Theresa Newman and a college student named Cathy O\u2019Donnell\u2014seemed to understand she needed space. As much as possible, she stayed in the office at the back and shuffled through mounds of paperwork. She didn\u2019t feel capable of dealing with the public.</p> <p>At twelve-thirty, Theresa entered the office. \u201cSomeone out front would like to see you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cA customer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d Theresa acted uncertain. \u201cI think it might be your stepdaughter.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie tensed. If Melissa had come to the store, it likely wasn\u2019t a social visit. After Friday, Anne Marie was wary; she felt too fragile to deal with anything else her stepdaughter might have to tell her.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie?\u201d Melissa pushed her way past Theresa and stepped into the office.</p> <p>Theresa cast Anne Marie an apologetic look and excused herself.</p><p>Melissa stood awkwardly in the doorway. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer the phone?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI called and called. It was like you dropped off the face of the earth.\u201d</p><p>She would\u2019ve thought the answer was fairly obvious. \u201cI...I wasn\u2019t up to talking to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been worried about you. Brandon has, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him?\u201d</p><p>Melissa nodded. \u201cHe was furious with me. He said...he said I should never have told you.\u201d</p> <p>Harsh words trembled on the tip of her tongue. How she wished Melissa had gone to her brother first. But she supposed that eventually she would\u2019ve uncovered the truth on her own. Now or later, did it really matter?</p><p>Melissa seemed close to tears. \u201cBrandon\u2019s right.\u201d Her voice was shaky. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Anne Marie. At the time I...I felt I should tell you. I knew it would shock you like it did me, but I didn\u2019t realize how hurt you\u2019d be. I was stupid and thoughtless. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>It would\u2019ve been easy to dissolve into tears all over again. Anne Marie made an effort to maintain the tight control she held on her emotions. \u201cIn a way you did the right thing,\u201d she said, trying to speak calmly. \u201cI would\u2019ve needed to learn about this baby at some point.\u201d</p><p>Melissa advanced one step into the room. \u201cI still feel terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put it behind us,\u201d Anne Marie said. The girl would never know what it cost her to make that offer. Instinctively she wanted to blame her for this pain, but Anne Marie discovered she couldn\u2019t do it. After years of trying to find some kind of connection with her stepdaughter, she didn\u2019t want to destroy the tenuous one they now shared.</p><p>\u201cCan I do something to make it up to you?\u201d Melissa pleaded.</p><p>Anne Marie shook her head.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d she implored next.</p> <p>She drew in a deep breath. \u201cDo you have a new heart for me?\u201d she asked, in a tone she hoped was offhand and witty. From the sad look in her stepdaughter\u2019s eyes, Anne Marie knew it hadn\u2019t been.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should just go.\u201d Melissa\u2019s shoulders slumped as she half-turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we have tea one day soon,\u201d Anne Marie suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d Melissa asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Robert\u2019s daughter and no matter what you think of me, I loved your father,\u201d Anne Marie said, unwilling to be dishonest.</p><p>\u201cEven now?\u201d Melissa asked. \u201cKnowing he betrayed you?\u201d</p><p>Love was difficult to explain. Robert\u2019s actions had devastated her, and while she wanted to confront him, force him to own up to his betrayal, that possibility had been taken away from her. And yet...she loved him.</p><p>\u201cDad hurt you badly, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. I could hate him for that but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d Melissa cut in, eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cAnd what good would that do?\u201d Anne Marie asked her. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve been over this time and again. I could let the news bury me\u2014and for a while it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.... I blame myself for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I meant what I said about putting this behind us. Anyway, I\u2019m dealing with everything as best I can. At first I wanted to lash out, but I couldn\u2019t see how that would help. My pain and anger aren\u2019t going to change a thing, are they?\u201d</p><p>Melissa stared at her for a long moment. \u201cYou\u2019re a better person than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2014just a bit more experienced, a bit more broken and bruised.\u201d She\u2019d never expected Melissa to compliment her on anything. \u201cYou\u2019re still young. Life kicks us all in the teeth sooner or later.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to sound so negative, but at this point it was difficult not to. \u201cI appreciate that you wanted to check up on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt so awful about what my father did. And the news about Rebecca\u2019s baby hit me hard. So I turned to you and I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie waved one hand airily. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m beyond all that.\u201d It wasn\u2019t completely true; she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever recover from Robert\u2019s betrayal\u2014and the way she\u2019d found out.</p><p>Melissa stayed a few more minutes and then left for her afternoon class. The invitation for tea was intentionally open-ended. Anne Marie would call her when she felt more...prepared.</p><p>An hour later, she felt composed enough to meet the public again. Cathy had gone for the day, and while Theresa took her lunch break, Anne Marie handled the cash register. Mondays were generally slow and she had only two customers, neither of whom needed help. She was emotionally off-balance, although she had to admit she felt better after talking to her stepdaughter. Melissa\u2019s concern, and Brandon\u2019s, had comforted her, at least a little.</p><p>The shop door opened and Elise Beaumont came inside. Her expression was speculative, but if she noticed that Anne Marie looked pale and drawn, she didn\u2019t mention it.</p><p>\u201cHello, Elise,\u201d Anne Marie said, trying to act cheerful. \u201cI\u2019ve put aside a couple of new titles you might like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Elise walked up to the counter. \u201cI came to see how it went with the Lunch Buddy program last week.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d almost forgotten about her volunteer project. \u201cOh, yes. It was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the school pair you up with a child?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded. \u201cHer name\u2019s Ellen Falk and she\u2019s in second grade.\u201d It took her a moment to conjure up Ellen\u2019s face, recalling how shy and awkward the young girl had been.</p><p>Elise picked up one of the books Anne Marie placed in front of her and flipped it open. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem too enthusiastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure Ellen and I are the best match.\u201d She went on to explain how the eight-year-old had barely said a word the entire lunch period. Over the weekend she\u2019d lost whatever optimism she\u2019d felt at the end of their previous session.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early yet. Give it time,\u201d Elise urged.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d However, Anne Marie still had her doubts about the project. She\u2019d finish out the school year but then she\u2019d look for a different volunteer organization. \u201cI need to call the school counselor,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only real enthusiasm Ellen showed was when I talked about Baxter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe child\u2019s interested in dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. I thought if I got permission to bring him to the school, Ellen would enjoy meeting him.\u201d Baxter was a good-natured dog who seemed to do well with children, and Anne Marie had no worries about his behavior.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>Elise decided to buy one of the books Anne Marie had recommended, a debut novel by a former journalist, and then wandered the store for a few minutes. With her own background as a librarian, she was an avid reader and a good customer. In fact, she often knew more about books and authors than Anne Marie did. With a second purchase in hand, Elise returned to the counter.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s bothering you,\u201d she announced, studying Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m fine,\u201d Anne Marie insisted.</p><p>\u201cActually, you aren\u2019t and that brave front is crumbling fast. You need someone to talk to. I\u2019m available.\u201d</p><p>Elise liked to get to the point. She wasn\u2019t one to ease into a subject or look for a circumspect approach. Anne Marie usually appreciated her friend\u2019s directness. Now, however, she didn\u2019t feel ready to unburden herself.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Elise pressed.</p><p>\u201cI...I received some shocking news last Friday,\u201d she began. \u201cBut I\u2019m dealing with it.\u201d</p><p>Elise waited patiently for her to continue.</p><p>Anne Marie glanced over her shoulder at another customer who\u2019d just walked in and was scanning the shelves. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it here.\u201d</p><p>Elise patted her hand. \u201cThat\u2019s understandable. We\u2019ll just wait until\u2014\u201d</p><p>The shop door opened, as if on cue, and Theresa came back from lunch. \u201cThe French Caf\u00e9 has a fabulous squash soup today,\u201d she said breezily. \u201cYou should try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might do that.\u201d Anne Marie hadn\u2019t eaten much of anything since Friday night. She was too thin as it was but she wasn\u2019t hungry, and this latest incident had contributed to her lack of appetite.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of having a bite to eat myself. Join me,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>It was more of a decree than a request; still, Anne Marie agreed. Elise was probably right\u2014it would help to talk about this and to eat. With the glimmer of a smile she recalled Elise\u2019s advice at the Valentine\u2019s get-together. Theresa took over for her, and Anne Marie collected her purse and walked out with Elise.</p><p>\u201cYou should be wearing more than a sweater,\u201d the older woman told her.</p><p>Anne Marie shrugged halfheartedly. \u201cYou\u2019re beginning to sound like my mother,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cFrom the look in your eyes, I\u2019d say you need one.\u201d</p><p>That comment brought immediate tears, which Anne Marie struggled to hide as she returned to the office for her jacket. She grabbed a tissue to wipe her nose, then tossed it in the waste basket. She certainly couldn\u2019t talk to her mother about what she\u2019d learned. Laura Bostwick would use it as an opportunity to harangue Anne Marie about the huge mistake she\u2019d made in marrying Robert. Laura had disapproved from the start. Trapped in her own unhappiness, she seemed to take a malevolent pleasure in destroying other people\u2019s joy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise linked arms with her as they crossed the street. \u201cYou\u2019re so thin now I\u2019m afraid a strong wind will blow you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Elise. Don\u2019t exaggerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a problem I wish I had,\u201d Elise muttered. \u201cWhen Maverick died, I\u2019m afraid I buried my sorrows in food. Isn\u2019t that ridiculous, considering how closely I watched his diet?\u201d Unexpectedly she smiled. \u201cHe said he ate like a bird\u2014flax seed, blueberries, wheat germ...Maverick had such a delightful sense of humor. I sometimes wonder if I\u2019ll ever stop missing him.\u201d She shook her head and brought her attention back to Anne Marie.</p><p>The French Caf\u00e9 was the most popular restaurant on Blossom Street; even now, at almost two, it was crowded with lunchtime customers.</p> <p>Alix Turner, who baked all the pastries, belonged to one of Anne Marie\u2019s reader groups and often recommended the bookstore to others.</p><p>When it was their turn to order, both Anne Marie and Elise chose the squash soup. While they waited for the server to deliver their order, they sipped their coffee.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we wait until after we eat?\u201d Anne Marie murmured, not eager to discuss Robert\u2019s infidelity.</p><p>Elise looked at her sternly. \u201cDon\u2019t put it off. Whatever happened is tearing you up inside. You\u2019ll feel better if you share it\u2014if not with me, then someone else. Frankly, I\u2019m your best option.\u201d</p> <p>Anne Marie had to laugh; some of the things Elise said verged on egotistical. Fortunately she knew the other woman well enough not to take offense.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about our Twenty Wishes instead,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cAre you working on your list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Elise smiled. \u201cI\u2019m determined to go on a hot air balloon ride. That one\u2019s at the top of my list.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI have another wish....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise not to laugh or try to talk me out of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d There was the matter of those red cowboy boots, for one thing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get a tattoo.\u201d</p><p>What? Elise? Anne Marie nearly swallowed her tongue. \u201cHave you decided where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a tattoo parlor near the waterfront and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant where on you. Your shoulder or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not sure yet. Maverick had one. On his right arm.\u201d The older woman looked flustered. \u201cBut that\u2019s enough about me. Tell me what\u2019s troubling you.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie would rather avoid the subject altogether; at the same time she was grateful for the chance to talk about it with someone she knew and trusted. She sighed. \u201cI had dinner with my stepdaughter Friday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it the evening wasn\u2019t pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...Melissa had recently gone to Robert\u2019s office and discovered that his personal assistant had a baby.\u201d</p> <p>Elise straightened her shoulders. \u201cA baby...\u201d she repeated. \u201cIs it Robert\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s highly probable.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cBut you\u2019re not sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to find out, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s my place to say or do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is!\u201d Elise said adamantly. \u201cWho better than you? Robert was your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so far the identity of the father is pure conjecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, to a certain extent. Apparently while Robert and I were separated, Melissa discovered her father and Rebecca in a, uh, compromising position. Nine months later, Rebecca turns up with a baby. What else am I to think?\u201d</p><p>Elise pursed her lips. \u201cIt does seem suspicious. The only way to know for sure is to ask her.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie saw the wisdom of confronting Rebecca, but she couldn\u2019t do it. She wasn\u2019t convinced she\u2019d ever have the courage to speak to her. \u201cBrandon and Melissa are the ones who need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, my dear, were Robert\u2019s wife. Yes, I\u2019m aware that you\u2019d separated. He behaved badly, and I\u2019m positive that if he was here, he\u2019d tell you how much he regrets everything that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want another family.... Perhaps he just didn\u2019t want children with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Elise said sharply. \u201cDon\u2019t think it, either. If Robert was alive he\u2019d be aghast at this news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never knew him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I know you,\u201d she came right back. \u201cFrom what you\u2019ve told me, Robert loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he did.\u201d All of a sudden Anne Marie couldn\u2019t help wondering. She\u2019d lost Robert to a heart attack and now the vision of the man she\u2019d so desperately loved had been destroyed. Along with it, all her dreams of the future, the hopes and promises she\u2019d hung on to during their separation, had fizzled out to nothing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leap to any conclusions until you talk to Rebecca yourself,\u201d Elise warned her. \u201cNo one has more of a right to the truth than you.\u201d</p><p>Elise made it sound so simple, so straight forward and uncomplicated.</p><p>The server brought the steaming soup, and Anne Marie inhaled the gingery scent. For the first time in days she felt like eating. Elise reached across the table and clasped her forearm.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll contact Rebecca and ask her. Do it for yourself,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can and you will,\u201d the other woman insisted. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember what Scripture says? \u2018The truth shall set you free,\u2019 and until you know the truth you\u2019ll be held captive by your fears and doubts.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie merely nodded as she tasted her soup. Delicious. They\u2019d used coconut milk, she guessed, allowing herself to be momentarily distracted.</p><p>\u201cFind out,\u201d Elise urged again as she picked up her spoon. \u201cDon\u2019t accept all this conjecture and half-baked information. Melissa might have misjudged the situation entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t think so.\u201d Naturally Anne Marie wanted to believe that Robert would never cheat on her. And yet she had to be realistic, too.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know and you won\u2019t until you speak to this woman.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie was forced to agree.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do it, then?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly she nodded. Not now, though, not when the pain was still so fresh and her heart was aching.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t disappoint me, will you?\u201d Elise held her gaze for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anne Marie promised. \u201cI\u2019ll get in touch with Rebecca and I\u2019ll ask her.\u201d</p><p>Then and only then did Elise smile. \u201cRemember\u2014the truth shall set you free.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>The minute Anne Marie entered the school grounds at Woodrow Wilson with Baxter on his leash, she was surrounded by children, apparently out for a late recess or an early lunch. Baxter looked up at her expectantly and, fearing the small dog might be overwhelmed, she lifted him into her arms.</p><p>\u201cI brought Baxter to visit Ellen Falk,\u201d she explained as the children gathered around.</p><p>By the time Anne Marie had walked inside, Ellen\u2019s second-grade class had been dismissed for lunch. She found the little girl waiting in the hallway by the lunchroom. She stood with her back against the wall, staring down at the floor.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ellen.\u201d Anne Marie spoke softly so as not to alarm her.</p><p>Ellen glanced up and when she saw Baxter, a tentative smile slid into place. \u201cYou brought him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called and Ms. Mayer said it would be all right to bring Baxter so the two of you can meet.\u201d Bending down to her constant friend and companion, Anne Marie said, \u201cBaxter, this is Ellen.\u201d</p><p>Ellen stared at the dog. \u201cHi,\u201d she said and offered him her hand to sniff. \u201cWould it be okay if I petted him?\u201d she asked, her eyes filled with longing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Even with Anne Marie\u2019s permission, Ellen hesitated as she raised her hand and gently touched the top of Baxter\u2019s head. As if he understood how badly this little girl needed a friend, Baxter licked her hand.</p><p>\u201cHe likes you,\u201d Anne Marie told her. \u201cWould you like to hold him?\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s eyes grew large. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Let me show you how to carry him.\u201d She gave Ellen a demonstration of the way she tucked Baxter between her arm and her side, then handed her the dog.</p><p>Baxter wagged his tail, and Ellen couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>\u201cShall we get some lunch?\u201d Anne Marie asked. \u201cMs. Mayer said we\u2019ll need to take our lunches back to the classroom. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ellen looked at her anxiously. \u201cBaxter can come, too, can\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Anne Marie assured her.</p><p>The Yorkshire terrier attracted lots of curious attention as Ellen waited outside the busy cafeteria. \u201cI\u2019ll get our lunch while you watch Baxter,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>The menu for the day was chili with corn bread, which Anne Marie remembered was Ellen\u2019s favorite. She chose a fresh salad and canned peaches for herself. Her appetite was improving. Since her lunch with Elise the day before, she\u2019d actually felt the faint stirrings of hunger. Talking to her friend had made her feel calmer and more rational, although Anne Marie wasn\u2019t ready to confront Rebecca yet. She would in time, as soon as she was emotionally prepared to deal with the other woman\u2019s answer.</p><p>When she\u2019d assembled their lunch, several of the children had gathered around Ellen, asking questions about Baxter.</p><p>\u201cI have to go now,\u201d the child told the others, and Anne Marie grinned at the importance in her voice. Ellen dutifully followed her down the hall toward the classroom, carrying Baxter as though he was the most precious burden imaginable.</p><p>The door was open and Ellen led the way to her desk. Anne Marie set the tray down and pulled up a chair next to Ellen\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Baxter?\u201d Ellen asked, carefully putting him down. \u201cWe can\u2019t eat in front of him, can we? That would be impolite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it would,\u201d Anne Marie agreed. She\u2019d brought along a small can of gourmet dog food, which was a rare treat for him. As she retrieved it from her purse, Baxter practically did flips of joy.</p><p>Ellen giggled, covered her mouth with her hand, then giggled again. \u201cHe\u2019s so funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d Anne Marie said, smiling, too.</p><p>Ellen seemed far more interested in Baxter than in eating her own lunch. She watched Baxter wolf down his food before she turned to her own plate. \u201cOne time my mama said she\u2019d buy me a dog.\u201d</p><p>Knowing the girl lived with her grandmother, Anne Marie wasn\u2019t sure how to comment.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dog do you want?\u201d</p><p>Ellen looked up from her chili. \u201cAny kind. But Mama made lots of promises she never kept. I live with my Grandma Dolores now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes she have a dog?\u201d</p><p>Ellen shook her head. \u201cShe said she\u2019s too old to take care of a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is she?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>Ellen contemplated the question. \u201cReally, really old.

She took another spoonful of her chili and paused long enough to pet Baxter.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably take him for a walk once you finish your lunch.\u201d Anne Marie had brought a plastic bag in case nature called while Baxter was outside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m full,\u201d Ellen said decisively, planting both hands on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cPositive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Can we go now?\u201d</p><p>They brought their trays back to the cafeteria and Anne Marie carried them inside, remembering how Ellen had instructed her the week before. When she\u2019d put them away, the two of them walked outside.</p><p>Typical for early March in the Pacific Northwest, a fine mist was falling. Most of the children ignored the rain, as did Ellen and Anne Marie. They strolled through the yard, making for a small grassy area nearby, and Anne Marie let Ellen take the leash. A dozen kids trailed behind as if she were the Pied Piper. They would\u2019ve followed Ellen and Baxter out of the yard if the recess monitor hadn\u2019t intervened.</p><p>As usual, Baxter sniffed every inch of territory as he trotted toward the gate. \u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d Anne Marie asked, walking side-by-side with the eight-year-old. She hoped to become better acquainted with Ellen, although it seemed she had to drag every morsel of information from the child. Thus far, all she knew was that Ellen liked dogs and lived with her grandmother, who was over fifty and therefore \u201creally old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a lot of help. \u201cDo you have any problems with math?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Grandma Dolores says I\u2019m smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you are.\u201d</p><p>Ellen seemed to have nothing else to say. She concentrated on the dog, praising him and periodically bending down to stroke his silk years.</p><p>Anne Marie had hoped for more progress today. She\u2019d seen some, thanks solely to Baxter, but now that she\u2019d made a commitment to the program and to Ellen, she was eager for the next breakthrough.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know any tricks?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>\u201cBaxter? He can sit on command.\u201d</p><p>Ellen seemed pleased. She stopped walking. \u201cSit,\u201d she said sternly.</p><p>Her Yorkie immediately complied, and Ellen beamed. \u201cHe\u2019s smart, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is. He doesn\u2019t know how to roll over, though. I\u2019ve tried, but I can\u2019t make him understand what I want him to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a book from the library and teach him,\u201d Ellen instantly volunteered. \u201cCan you bring him next Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie had discussed the situation with Ms. Mayer. The point of the Lunch Buddy program was for Ellen and Anne Marie to become friends. Helen Mayer\u2019s concern was that Ellen would bond with Baxter and not Anne Marie. She\u2019d suggested the dog only visit once a month.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Baxter won\u2019t be able to come next week,\u201d Anne Marie explained. \u201cBut I\u2019ll bring him again soon.\u201d</p><p>The light seemed to go out of Ellen\u2019s eyes and she docilely accepted the news. \u201cI like Baxter,\u201d she said a few minutes later.</p><p>\u201cI can tell, and he certainly likes you.\u2019</p><p>Her returning smile was fragile, as if she\u2019d long ago learned to accept disappointments.</p><p>What little conversation they exchanged after that was focused on Baxter. When the lunch bell rang, Ellen lingered on the playground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you next week,\u201d Anne Marie promised.</p><p>Ellen lowered her eyes and nodded.</p><p>Ellen was obviously accustomed to adults making promises they didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t keep. Anne Marie wanted to reassure the youngster that if she said she\u2019d be at the school, she would be, but actions spoke much louder than words. She hoped that over time Ellen would come to trust her.</p><p>\u201cCan I hug Baxter goodbye?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Crouching, Ellen petted the dog, then picked him up and gently gave him a hug. \u201cThank you for bringing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ellen.\u201d</p><p>With that, the girl raced toward the school building. She was the last one to enter and Anne Marie hoped she wouldn\u2019t be late for class.</p><p>\u201cWell, Baxter,\u201d she murmured to her pet, \u201cyou were a real hit.\u201d As she hurried toward the parking lot, Helen Mayer stepped out of the school, walking purposefully in Anne Marie\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go with Ellen this week?\u201d she asked, quickly catching up. She wore only a sweater and shivered as she wrapped her arms around her waist.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I think,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cThanks mostly to Baxter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that might be the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted me to bring him next week, but I told her he couldn\u2019t come and it would only be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat little girl\u2019s been through a great deal,\u201d Ms. Mayer said, lowering her voice. \u201cAs I explained earlier, the privacy laws prohibit me from saying any more, but rest assured that Ellen badly needs a friend.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie immediately felt guilty for wishing she\u2019d found another volunteer effort. But she\u2019d made a four-month commitment and she planned to see it through. She had no intention of being another adult in Ellen\u2019s life who broke her promises.</p><p>The school counselor walked her to the parking lot. \u201cNext Tuesday afternoon, the school\u2019s putting on a play.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded.</p><p>\u201cEllen has a small role in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the chorus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice. She didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Mayer didn\u2019t seem surprised. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019s such a shy child. She\u2019s gifted vocally, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll help her self-esteem if she excels in singing.\u201d Anne Marie didn\u2019t say that she used to sing, too. Or that she hadn\u2019t sung in months...</p><p>\u201cOh, I agree, this opportunity is wonderful for Ellen,\u201d Ms. Mayer said. \u201cShe\u2019s the only second-grader in the chorus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrific.\u201d There was no personal reason for Anne Marie to feel proud of Ellen, but she did.</p><p>\u201cHer grandmother won\u2019t be able to attend.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, Anne Marie grinned. \u201cHer Grandma Dolores is really old, you know. She\u2019s at least fifty.\u201d</p><p>The school counselor smiled, too. \u201cIt would mean the world to Ellen if you could come for the program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d She thought about her Tuesday schedule. She had meetings with a publisher\u2019s rep, plus an appointment with her bookkeeper. As much as possible, Anne Marie tried to handle all her paperwork on Tuesdays.</p><p>\u201cEllen won\u2019t have anyone there if you don\u2019t come,\u201d the counselor continued. \u201cIf there\u2019s any chance at all...\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie swallowed a sigh. \u201cWhat time is the program?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTuesday afternoon at two.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been afraid of that. \u201cI have an important meeting then. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Mayer didn\u2019t hide her disappointment. \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t? It would mean so much to Ellen.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie hesitated as she tried to work out how to rearrange her schedule. Perhaps she could ask Theresa to meet with the sales rep, who was coming in at two.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re busy....\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s busy,\u201d Anne Marie said. Her life was no different from anyone else\u2019s. She wondered if Ms. Mayer championed the other children as diligently as she did Ellen. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can get one of my employees to cover for me. Exactly how long will this take?\u201d</p><p>Ms. Mayer smiled broadly. \u201cAn hour at the most. And after the program, the children will be serving cookies and juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d Anne Marie promised.</p><p>\u201cThat would be wonderful.\u201d She clasped her hands together. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d Glancing over her shoulder, she said, \u201cI have to get back to the school now, but thank you again.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie opened her car door and placed Baxter inside. This volunteering was demanding more time and commitment than she\u2019d originally assumed. The problem was, she couldn\u2019t say no.</p><p>When she returned to Blossom Street, she brought Baxter up to the apartment, then hurried into the bookstore to see Theresa. The part-time position suited Theresa well, since she had three children, one in high school and the youngest two attending junior high.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Theresa smiled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to see you.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie tried to stay as far away from the business as she could on Wednesdays. The moment she made herself available, she invariably ended up spending half her day in the store. \u201cI\u2019m only here for a few minutes,\u201d she said, vowing that would be the truth.</p><p>\u201cMs. Higgins was looking for you,\u201d Theresa told her. \u201cShe forgot this was your day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you able to help her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she wasn\u2019t interested in buying anything. She wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie would give Lillie a call later on. She hoped the situation with her car had been settled.</p><p>\u201cThere was a phone call for you, too. A man at one of the distributors. He asked if you\u2019d call him back at your convenience. I wrote down all the information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that in the morning,\u201d Anne Marie said. She lingered, procrastinating because she hated to ask her employees to fill in for her. \u201cTheresa, I was wondering if you could work next Tuesday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext Tuesday?\u201d Looking pensive, Theresa bit her bottom lip. \u201cI think so. Can I get back to you to confirm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. The thing is, I\u2019m a Lunch Buddy for this little girl named Ellen and...well, she\u2019s going to be in a school production and the counselor seemed to think it would help if I could be there.\u201d She didn\u2019t know why she was rattling on about this when it really wasn\u2019t Theresa\u2019s problem.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine but I\u2019ll need to check with Jeff first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, and if it doesn\u2019t work out, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll try Cathy or Steve.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anne Marie went upstairs to her apartment. Baxter, who was asleep in his small bed, didn\u2019t so much as stir. Apparently the excursion to the school had tired him out. \u201cSome watchdog you are, Mr. Baxter,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Her plan for the afternoon was to work on her list of wishes. Since her dinner with Melissa, Anne Marie hadn\u2019t really given it much thought.</p><p>1. Buy red cowboy boots</p><p>2. Learn to knit</p> <p>3. Volunteer\u2014become a Lunch Buddy</p><p>4. Take French lessons</p><p>Then, because it seemed so unlikely and yet necessary, she added the first wish, the one she\u2019d crossed out earlier.</p><p>5. Find one good thing about life</p><p>She took out the binder she\u2019d purchased and assembled the scrapbooking supplies and the few pictures she\u2019d already cut out. Red cowboy boots from a catalog. A hand-knit sweater from a magazine. A photo of the Eiffel Tower. She\u2019d need to get a picture of Ellen and...Suddenly it seemed pointless to go on, in light of what she\u2019d discovered about Robert and her own pitiful life.</p> <p>Rather than allow herself to sink into further depression, she reached for her phone and called Lillie. They arranged to meet for dinner at a Thai place they both liked.</p><p>That evening Lillie arrived at the restaurant before Anne Marie did and had already secured a table. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you phoned,\u201d Lillie said, kissing her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve got lots to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Twenty Wishes?\u201d Earlier, just reading her list had depressed her. She\u2019d been convinced she\u2019d never feel like dreaming again, not when she\u2019d obviously been so wrong about her entire life.</p><p>\u201cThat list\u2019s given me a whole new burst of energy,\u201d Lillie said. \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends about it and now they\u2019re all writing their own lists.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLists are big these days. Who would\u2019ve believed it?\u201d Lillie\u2019s eyes twinkled with merriment. \u201cI\u2019ve been adding to mine nearly every day, thinking about all the things I want to do. Things I haven\u2019t considered in years. It all started when I bought that red convertible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which...\u201d</p><p>Lillie waved the question aside even before Anne Marie could ask it. \u201cJust a minor glitch and that nice man from the service department is taking care of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say you\u2019re still driving a loaner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Everything\u2019s under control and I haven\u2019t been inconvenienced in the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be inconvenienced. You bought their car!\u201d</p><p>Lillie studied her menu. \u201cI\u2019m starved. How about you?\u201d</p> <p>Anne Marie needed to think about it, then realized she actually was hungry. \u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. The way I feel right now, I\u2019m tempted to order everything on the menu. Let\u2019s begin with the assorted appetizers, and then a green mango salad....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pad thai. I love their pad thai,\u201d Anne Marie said, entering into the spirit of the evening.</p><p>Between the perfectly spiced food and Lillie\u2019s invigorating company, dinner was a welcome reprieve from the low-grade depression that had been hanging over Anne Marie. Back in her apartment a few hours later, she came across the binder and the scrapbooking supplies spread out on the kitchen table.</p><p>She sat down again and read over her list. Maybe her wishes weren\u2019t so impossible, after all.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Lillie Higgins paid extra-close attention to her makeup Friday morning, chastising herself as she did. Anyone who even suspected that she was preening and primping for the service department manager at a car dealership would be aghast.</p><p>Lillie had nothing to say in her defense. She just found Hector Silva appealing; he was kind and generous and unfailingly polite. He seemed so natural, while the men who usually set out to charm her came across as self-conscious, trying too hard to impress. Not Hector Silva. His work ethic, his dignity and decency...She couldn\u2019t praise him enough.</p><p>They\u2019d exchanged two brief conversations, and after each one Lillie had walked away feeling good. More than good, elated. She liked him\u2014it was that simple\u2014and she enjoyed talking to him. Both times she\u2019d wished the conversations could\u2019ve been longer.</p><p>Now that her car was repaired to Hector\u2019s satisfaction, she didn\u2019t have an excuse to chat with him anymore. So she\u2019d decided to make the most of today\u2019s encounter, which would likely be their last.</p><p>Lillie arrived at the dealership with the loaner at the precise time Hector had indicated. She wore a pink linen pantsuit with a silk floral scarf tied around her head. She\u2019d struggled with that, not wanting to look like a babushka or some latter-day hippie, and she\u2019d finally managed to arrange it in an attractive style. Desiree, the temperamental French hairdresser she and Jacqueline Donovan shared, had insisted that if Lillie was determined to drive a convertible, she take measures to protect her hair.</p><p>When Lillie pulled into the parking space outside the service area, Hector immediately stepped outside as if he\u2019d been standing by the door, waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Ms. Higgins,\u201d he said with the slightest bow.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Silva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Hector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll call me Lillie. After everything we\u2019ve been through with this car, I believe we\u2019ve become friends, don\u2019t you? And friends call each other by their first names.\u201d Referring to him as a friend might be presumptuous, but she couldn\u2019t seem to stop herself.</p><p>He grinned, and his dark eyes glinted with pleasure. \u201cI feel the same way.\u201d After the briefest of hesitations, he added, \u201cLillie.\u201d She loved how he said her name, placing equal emphasis on each syllable. She\u2019d never heard anyone draw it out like that. He made it sound...sensuous. Completely unlike the blunt \u201cLil\u201d her husband used to call her.</p><p>\u201cYour vehicle is ready.\u201d He gestured toward the red convertible parked near the service area.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever find out what the problem was?\u201d she asked, although in truth she didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>\u201cAs far as I can tell, the hydraulic hose had an air bubble in it. I worked on it myself and I had my best mechanic check it, too. He assures me the problem has been fixed. You shouldn\u2019t have any steering troubles from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t.\u201d Instinctively, she felt certain that Hector\u2019s pledge was the only guarantee she needed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken it out for a test drive and in my estimation it runs beautifully. However, if you\u2019d like, the two of us could go for a short ride.\u201d</p><p>Lillie knew this was above and beyond anything that was necessary. Nevertheless she nearly squeaked with joyful anticipation. Oh, she was behaving badly, wasn\u2019t she? And she intended to go on doing it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate that very much,\u201d she told him earnestly. \u201cBut only if it won\u2019t keep you from your duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are our customer, Lillie, and it is the goal of the dealership to exceed your expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His dedication to duty dispelled the notion that he was doing this for her and her alone. In fact, he seemed to be quoting from a policy manual. That gave her pause. Perhaps what she felt toward him was imaginary, something she\u2019d dreamed up\u2014but she knew it wasn\u2019t. The real question was whether Hector reciprocated her feelings.</p><p>Hector held open the driver\u2019s door for her.</p><p>Lillie slipped behind the wheel as he walked around the vehicle and joined her in the passenger seat. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you have time for this?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cYes, Lillie, I\u2019m very sure.\u201d He encouraged her with a smile.</p><p>She turned the key and the engine instantly surged to life. \u201cIs there any specific place you\u2019d like me to drive?\u201d she asked, hoping he\u2019d suggest a route.</p><p>\u201cGreen River in the Kent Valley should be a good test.\u201d</p><p>That was where the vehicle had broken down the first time. It was also twenty minutes away. This was more than a short test drive, she thought excitedly. More than business.</p><p>Still, they didn\u2019t exchange a single word as she drove down the freeway. It wasn\u2019t until they neared the river that Hector spoke.</p><p>\u201cThe car is in perfect running condition,\u201d he told her in a solemn tone.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell just by the sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. My wife, when she was alive, used to tease me. She said I could read cars better than I could people, and she was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a widower?\u201d Lillie had noticed that Hector wasn\u2019t wearing a wedding band, but she\u2019d assumed it was because of his work.</p><p>\u201cYes, almost ten years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Lillie knew the pain of losing a life partner, even when the marriage wasn\u2019t ideal.</p><p>\u201cAngelina was a good woman and a good wife,\u201d Hector said. \u201cAnd a devoted mother. We have three beautiful children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband died in a plane crash three years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>Lillie focused her attention on the road, although their conversation was of far greater interest. She might be seeing more here than was warranted but she sensed that Hector wanted her to know he was a widower. She wanted him to realize she was unattached, too.</p><p>\u201cHow old are your children?\u201d she asked, not reacting to his sympathy, which made her a little uncomfortable. David had been an excellent provider and an adequate husband, but he\u2019d had his weakness. Unfortunately that weakness involved other women.</p><p>For years Lillie had turned a blind eye to David\u2019s wanderings. It was easier to pretend than to confront the ugly truth of her husband\u2019s infidelities. During the last ten years of their marriage, there had been no real intimacy between them. Lillie had swallowed her pride and pretended not to know about her husband\u2019s affairs\u2014as long as he remained discreet.</p><p>\u201cMy children are all grown now,\u201d Hector said. \u201cThey have graduated from college and taken advanced training in the fields of their choice. Manuel is an attorney. Luis is a physician and my daughter, Rita, is a teacher.\u201d His pride in his family was evident.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, all three of your children are accomplished professionals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir mother and I believed in higher education.\u201d Hector looked at her as she slowed the car\u2019s speed to take a sharp curve. \u201cYou have children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA daughter. Her husband was with mine in the plane crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s eyes grew dark with compassion. \u201cIn one day your daughter lost both her husband and her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It had been a horrific day and not one Lillie wanted to think about. David and Gary had been flying home from a business trip. The pilot and co-pilot had died, too.</p><p>The FAA had investigated, and after a thorough exploration of the facts had determined the cause of the accident\u2014sudden, catastrophic engine failure. But that knowledge didn\u2019t take away the shock and the grief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour daughter has a family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a grandmother, then?\u201d</p><p>The boys were the very joy of her life. \u201cI have twin grandsons, Eric and Kurt. They\u2019re in their first year of college.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hector wore an astounded expression. \u201cIt isn\u2019t possible you have grandchildren of that age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth my daughter and I married young.\u201d Although she wasn\u2019t in the habit of divulging her age, she felt she could with Hector. \u201cI\u2019m sixty-three.\u201d</p><p>Again his eyes widened. \u201cI would have said you were closer to your mid-forties.\u201d</p><p>With another man, Lillie might have expected such flattery. But Hector was what David would\u2019ve called a straight shooter. He didn\u2019t give compliments for any reason other than that he meant them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sixty-four,\u201d Hector admitted. \u201cI will be retiring in a few months.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you been with the dealership?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-four years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the same dealership?\u201d That was practically unheard of these days.</p><p>\u201cI started as a maintenance man and attended night school to become a mechanic. When I had my certificate, the service manager at the time offered me a job. I worked hard and within ten years I was the chief mechanic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you take over as manager?\u201d</p><p>Hector didn\u2019t need to think about the answer. \u201cAlmost twelve years ago. I would have retired sooner, only the expenses of college made that impossible.\u201d He grimaced comically. \u201cPrivate colleges.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll of your children were in college at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thankfully, each one received financial assistance through scholarships and grants. But I have to tell you the costs were staggering.\u201d</p><p>Lillie knew that from what Barbie had told her about Eric and Kurt\u2019s tuition costs and the other expenses associated with getting them started in school. Even now, Lillie could hardly believe it. She was impressed that Hector had managed to put three children through school on what he earned as a service manager. He no doubt made good money, but still...</p><p>\u201cYour daughter attended college?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lillie shook her head. \u201cBarbie married young, just as I did. Both David and I were disappointed but ultimately we approved of the marriage. She knew her own mind, and I will say she and Gary were very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it is with love sometimes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, glancing in her direction. \u201cSometimes the heart really does know what\u2019s best.\u201d</p><p>Her own heart was speaking loud and clear at that very moment.</p><p>They\u2019d been gone for more than an hour, and it was time to return to the dealership. Both grew quiet. Minutes earlier, their conversation had been animated; now, reality set in and there didn\u2019t seem to be anything else to say.</p> <p>When Lillie pulled into the dealership\u2019s parking lot, she experienced a pang of regret. This was it; the ride\u2014and her relationship with Hector\u2014was over. There was no further reason to see him. It wasn\u2019t as though they\u2019d ever encounter each other in the normal course of their lives.</p><p>He told her where to park, pointing at an empty slot.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Hector, for everything you\u2019ve done,\u201d she said, forcing a smile.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>They sat in the car, and he seemed as reluctant to move as she was.</p><p>\u201cI should get back to work,\u201d Hector finally said.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>His hand was on the door handle. \u201cIt isn\u2019t every day I get to ride with such a beautiful woman,\u201d he said with quiet gallantry. He climbed out and gently closed the door. His eyes avoided hers. \u201cGoodbye, Lillie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Hector.\u201d</p><p>He was a service manager for a car dealership and she was a wealthy widow. She accepted that their paths would likely never cross again. Despite that, she could do him one good turn. When she got home, Lillie phoned the dealership, leaving a message for the owner, Steve Sullivan. She praised Hector\u2019s efforts on her behalf and stressed to Steve that he had an outstanding employee.</p><p>That way, at least, she could play a small, if benevolent, role in Hector\u2019s life.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough but it would have to do.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Monday evening, Barbie showed up at the theater a little later than she had the previous week. Tessa Bassett was selling tickets again, and when she saw Barbie, her face lit up.</p><p>\u201cShould I recommend another movie?\u201d the girl asked cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d The ill-tempered Mark Bassett was the sole reason Barbie had come back. In the last week she\u2019d spent a lot of time thinking about him. She felt strangely invigorated by the challenge he offered, but it was more than that. She was attracted to him, not only because of his looks but because she saw in him the same loneliness she\u2019d experienced since her husband\u2019s death. Once she made it past the barrier he\u2019d erected against the world, perhaps they could be friends. Perhaps even more. The fact that he was physically disabled didn\u2019t bother her, nor did she find it especially daunting. She knew it didn\u2019t define or describe the person inside, any more than her appearance did.</p><p>Tessa mentioned a movie Barbie had never heard of and handed her the ticket, as well as her change.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure this is a good movie?\u201d Barbie asked.</p><p>Tessa\u2019s eyes held hers. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect movie.\u201d</p><p>Barbie was willing to take the girl\u2019s word for it. In the theater lobby, she once again purchased a small bag of popcorn and a cold soda, then walked into the dimly lit theater.</p><p>She saw that Mark was already in one of the wheelchair spaces. Tessa had been right; this was the perfect movie.</p><p>Without hesitation, Barbie moved around the back and entered the row from the opposite direction. She sat down, leaving one empty seat between her and Mark.</p><p>The instant she did, he turned to glare at her. \u201cThis space is reserved for wheelchair seating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she said as she crossed her legs. She started to eat her popcorn as if she didn\u2019t have a care in the world. Feeling both silly and daring, she tossed a kernel in the air and caught it in her mouth. Proud of herself, she grinned triumphantly at Mark.</p><p>Clearly he wasn\u2019t impressed with her dexterity. \u201cWould you kindly move?\u201d</p><p>His voice was even less friendly than it had been the last time.</p><p>\u201cI have every right to sit here should I choose to do so,\u201d she returned formally. She held out her bag of popcorn. \u201cHere,\u201d she said.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offering you some of my popcorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I want your popcorn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cranky. My boys get cranky when they\u2019re hungry, so I figured that might be your problem.\u201d</p><p>He looked pointedly away.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not interested, the proper response is no, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that, and Barbie munched her popcorn, swaying her leg back and forth.</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwinging your leg like a pendulum.\u201d</p><p>She crossed the opposite leg and swung it, instead.</p><p>Mark groaned.</p><p>The theater darkened, and the previews appeared on the screen. Barbie finished the small bag of popcorn. Her hands were greasy, but in her rush to get into the theater she\u2019d forgotten to pick up a napkin. She\u2019d also forgotten to replace the tissues she kept in her purse. She stood up to go back to the lobby. Rather than march all the way down the row, she leaned over to nudge Mark.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d He actually seemed pleased.</p><p>\u201cNo, I need a napkin. Can I get you anything while I\u2019m up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She sighed audibly. \u201cAre you always this rude or is it just me you don\u2019t like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>She refused to feel insulted; instead she interpreted his response as an admission that he was aware of her. Aware and interested.</p><p>\u201cYou act as if that pleases you,\u201d he said, sounding surprised.</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t hurt my feelings if that was your intent. Now, can I get by? Please?\u201d</p><p>With exaggerated effort, he rolled back his wheelchair, allowing her to exit the row.</p><p>Barbie pushed the sleeve of her soft cashmere sweater up her arm and hung her purse over her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t get too comfortable,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurry on my account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>When she entered the lobby again, she saw that Tessa was working behind the concession stand. The girl looked curiously in her direction and Barbie nodded. She grabbed some napkins to wipe her hands, then walked over to wait her turn. She made an impulsive purchase, smiling as she did.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Tessa asked, handing her the change.</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to leave.\u201d</p><p>Tessa seemed worried. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to, are you?\u201d</p><p>Barbie shook her head. \u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>Tessa nearly rubbed her hands together with glee. \u201cThis is so cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>The teenager shrugged. \u201cWell, you know. You and my uncle Mark. He needs someone in his life. He doesn\u2019t think so, but...well, it\u2019d just be so cool if that someone was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up, Tessa.\u201d Barbie felt obliged to warn her. \u201cI\u2019d better get back. The movie\u2019s about to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him give you any crap,\u201d the girl advised. \u201cOops, I mean attitude.\u201d</p><p>Barbie grinned and gave her a thumbs-up.</p><p>Attitude was the right word, she mused as she made her way into the theater. It wasn\u2019t hard to figure out that his surliness was an attempt to protect himself from pain and rejection. If there was one thing she knew about, it was dealing with the insecurities of the adolescent male. And if she had her guess, he\u2019d reverted to that kind of negative behavior after his accident. Beneath all the hostility, he was as lonely and lost as she was.</p><p>The film was just beginning as she reached their row. She stood in the aisle, waiting for him to roll his chair back.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said when he pretended not to notice. \u201cI\u2019d like to sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust you?\u201d he asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cYes, I must.\u201d Taking the initiative, she raised her leg and attempted to climb over his lap. He got the message fast enough when she presented him with an excellent view of her rear. He shot back with enough force to bolt into the empty space two rows back.</p><p>Barbie reclaimed her seat, then tossed him a chocolate bar. \u201cOh, here,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought this might sweeten your disposition.\u201d</p><p>He tossed it back. \u201cMy disposition is as good as it gets. Chocolate isn\u2019t going to change it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll eat it then.\u201d</p><p>From that point on, she ignored him and he ignored her.</p><p>The movie, another romantic comedy, was delightful and Barbie quickly got involved in the plot. She and Mark didn\u2019t exchange a word until the credits were rolling and the lights came back on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was really good,\u201d she said to no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cIt was sappy,\u201d Mark muttered.</p><p>\u201cNaturally you\u2019d say that,\u201d she protested. \u201cDon\u2019t you believe in the power of love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>So why had he chosen this movie? \u201cWell, I happen to believe in it,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d He wheeled back and started out of the theater, with Barbie keeping pace five steps behind him. Tessa, still at the concession stand, glanced at her eagerly. She gave the teenager another thumbs-up, and the girl returned a huge grin.</p><p>Just outside the complex, he unexpectedly wheeled around and confronted her. \u201cAre you going to make a habit of this?\u201d he demanded. The corners of his mouth curled scornfully.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d she asked, playing dumb.</p><p>\u201cMonday night at the movies. The only reason you\u2019re here is to irritate me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had to pay money to do that. Couldn\u2019t I just sit out here and do it for free?\u201d</p><p>He pinched his lips tightly closed.</p><p>\u201cI enjoy the movies and Monday\u2019s a good night for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome another night,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Frustration showed in his face. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d she asked, again feigning innocence. \u201cYou mean coming to the movies two weeks in a row on a Monday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like I said, Monday evenings are good for me and movies are my favorite form of entertainment.\u201d</p><p>One look told her he didn\u2019t believe a word of it. \u201cThen how come you picked the same movies I did?\u201d</p><p>She tried to pretend she was bored with the subject. \u201cIf memory serves me, I was seated first last week. You\u2019re the one who invaded my space.\u201d</p><p>He frowned as if he\u2019d forgotten that. \u201cMaybe so, but this week was no accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have an inflated opinion of your charms.\u201d His mouth opened and he seemed about to launch a comeback, but she didn\u2019t give him a chance. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going home. Good night, Mark.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI asked. I\u2019m Barbie, by the way. Barbie Foster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbie,\u201d he repeated and snickered. Then he laughed outright. \u201cBarbie. It figures. You\u2019re about as plastic as they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re about as rude as any man I\u2019ve ever had the misfortune to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay away from me and we\u2019ll both be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said flippantly as she reached for her car keys, buried deep inside her giant purse. \u201cAnd maybe not. I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d She left him then, with a decided sway to her hips. It was an image she hoped would stay with him for a long time.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Tuesday was a good sales day at the bookstore, which wasn\u2019t typical. Anne Marie had worked out a careful method of maintaining inventory, balancing the number of mainstay and classic books she kept on the shelf with the new ones. It was crucial to have a wide range of titles. Relatively new to the business, she was learning as she went. Past experience had come from a part-time job at the University of Washington campus bookstore. Her previous career, as a customer service rep at a national insurance company, had taught her some valuable skills, too\u2014but she hadn\u2019t loved it and was glad enough to give it up, at Robert\u2019s suggestion, to work in the bookstore, with an eye to eventually buying it.</p><p>The store was independent and needed an edge to compete with the large chains. Each bookstore, whether a chain store or an independent, was important in its own way. Blossom Street Books served the community. Over the past four years, since the renovations to the entire neighborhood, the store had developed a following and earned the loyalty of local residents. Anne Marie hadn\u2019t wanted to specialize, like some independents did, in mystery fiction or cookbooks or children\u2019s books; she preferred to meet all her customers\u2019 book-buying needs. She ordered books for them, ran several reading groups, offered competitive discounts on bestsellers and provided a cozy, intimate atmosphere. She\u2019d made the store as inviting as possible, with comfortable chairs, a gas fireplace and warm lighting.</p><p>Her clientele depended on Anne Marie for recommendations and updates on authors and publishing houses. She\u2019d managed the store before she bought it, to make sure she really wanted to take on her own business, and in the process familiarized herself with the industry.</p><p>Even as a child, Anne Marie had been an inveterate reader. She\u2019d found her adventures in the pages of a book. Never outgoing, or one to stand out in a crowd, she\u2019d been her husband\u2019s opposite in personality. Robert had been gregarious and sociable, and they\u2019d complemented each other well. He was fun to be around, and that had attracted her from the beginning. Their age difference had never concerned her because he didn\u2019t seem older. Except when it came to having another child...</p><p>Rather than sink into depression again, Anne Marie focused on creating a fresh display for the front table. Bookstores were a low-margin business, and the real profits came from notecards, stationery, games and other accessories. She was working on a St. Patrick\u2019s Day exhibit, featuring books like How the Irish Saved Civilization and fiction by Maeve Binchy, Marian Keyes, Edna O\u2019Brien and other popular Irish novelists. Around the books she arranged packages of greeting cards with shamrocks on them, green candles and St. Patrick\u2019s themed paper napkins. She stepped back, pleased with the result.</p><p>The previous owner, Adele Morris, had a bookstore in the Fremont neighborhood, and when there was an opportunity for a second store on Blossom Street, Adele took it. Because of the renovation, she\u2019d been offered a favorable rent and for the first couple of years she\u2019d divided her time between the two stores. That proved to be too difficult, and Anne Marie had joined as manager soon afterward; later she purchased the business with Robert\u2019s encouragement. In her husband\u2019s eyes, the bookstore, like Baxter, was a solution to their dilemma. If Anne Marie was preoccupied with the store, she might forget about having a baby.</p><p>At one-thirty Theresa came in and for an instant Anne Marie couldn\u2019t remember why she\u2019d shown up for work on a Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cEllen!\u201d She said the child\u2019s name aloud as the memory rushed in. She was supposed to be at the school for Ellen\u2019s performance.</p><p>Theresa nodded. \u201cYou told me your Lunch Buddy was in some function at the school that you wanted to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Rushing into the office, she grabbed her purse and threw on her jacket. She gave Theresa some last-minute instructions for her meeting with the children\u2019s book sales rep. Then she hurriedly left the shop via the back entrance, where she\u2019d parked her car.</p><p>Thankfully the school was relatively close, and it only took her ten minutes to drive there. But when she arrived she discovered that the parking lot and nearby streets were jammed with vehicles and she wondered if every parent in a three-state area had decided to come for the performance. After another ten minutes she located a parking space three blocks from the school. She locked the car and ran toward Woodrow Wilson Elementary.</p><p>The music had already started by the time she entered the large gymnasium, sweaty and out of breath. The place was packed with parents and students, and if there was an available seat she couldn\u2019t find it.</p><p>Every adult in the room seemed to be in possession of a camera. Anne Marie hadn\u2019t even thought to bring one and wanted to kick herself. Ellen\u2019s grandmother would\u2019ve appreciated a photograph of her granddaughter on stage.</p><p>Muttering her excuses, Anne Marie slipped past several people until she squeezed herself into a tight space where she had a good view. Sure enough, she could see Ellen standing on a riser with the other members of the chorus. She wore her Sunday best\u2014a dress one size too small and white patent leather shoes. The stage set consisted of two large painted trees and a castle. The artwork had apparently been done by the students, as well. If she\u2019d been told the name of the production, Anne Marie didn\u2019t remember. Clearly, though, it was the retelling of some classic fairy tale.</p><p>Anne Marie watched Ellen, who looked awkward and uncomfortable standing front row center, with two rows of children behind her.</p><p>As if she felt Anne Marie\u2019s eyes on her, Ellen glanced in her direction. When she saw Anne Marie, the girl\u2019s entire face was transformed by the beauty of her smile. Seeing how happy her presence had made Ellen, Anne Marie was glad she\u2019d taken the trouble to show up. She sent the girl a small wave. Ellen waved back.</p><p>The music died down as the singing director stepped in front of the choir and raised both hands. The children on the risers instantly came to attention.</p><p>The performance, which turned out to be a rather inventive version of \u201cSnow White,\u201d lasted forty minutes. No one was going to mistake it for professional theater. But the dwarves were hilarious and the singing was lively. Anne Marie nodded her head to the beat.</p><p>When the performance was finished, the principal came forward and announced that juice and cookies would be served in the children\u2019s rooms. Anne Marie checked her watch. She really should be getting back to the store. Then again, a few more minutes wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>As she started toward Ellen\u2019s classroom, she nearly bumped into Helen Mayer, the school counselor.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the play was very well done,\u201d she said warmly. \u201cThank you for telling me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>With a quick smile, she hurried off in the opposite direction.</p><p>Anne Marie was standing by Ellen\u2019s desk when the child walked into the room, her eyes bright with happiness. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you hear me sing?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie hadn\u2019t been able to discern Ellen\u2019s small voice among so many others. But in this case she figured a white lie was appropriate. \u201cI did, and you were terrific.\u201d</p><p>Ellen blushed at the praise.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you like to sing.\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded. \u201cMrs. Maxwell said I have a good voice. She\u2019s the music teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many other second-grade students were part of the choir?\u201d Anne Marie asked, although she already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cI was the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you?\u201d Anne Marie feigned surprise.</p><p>\u201cYup, just me. Mrs. Maxwell said maybe by the time I\u2019m in fourth or fifth grade I might get to sing a solo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen, that\u2019s wonderful. Congratulations.\u201d Anne Marie had never seen the girl this excited.</p><p>The classroom had begun to fill up with other children and parents.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some juice?\u201d Ellen asked politely. The juice and cookies were set up on a table in the front.</p><p>Anne Marie noticed that the other students were delivering refreshments to their parents.</p><p>\u201cThat would be very nice. Thank you, Ellen.\u201d</p><p>The child waited for her turn and poured Anne Marie a small paper cup full of juice, which appeared to be some watered-down fruit punch. She also brought her two small cookies, definitely a store-bought variety. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get anything for yourself,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re supposed to serve your guests first,\u201d Ellen informed her solemnly.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Anne Marie murmured. \u201cI must\u2019ve forgotten my manners.\u201d</p><p>Silently Ellen stood next to her.</p> <p>Anne Marie bent down and whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Ellen said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to drink your juice and eat your cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Anne Marie sampled a cookie, which crumbled in her mouth at the first bite. She washed it down with a gulp of juice that was far too sweet. Ellen waited until Anne Marie had finished before she returned to the refreshment table and poured a second cup of juice and took two small cookies for herself.</p><p>\u201cBaxter wanted me to tell you hello,\u201d Anne Marie said when she came back.</p><p>Ellen swallowed the cookie she was chewing and nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s a good dog.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little spoiled, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach him how to roll over the next time you bring him to school,\u201d Ellen promised. \u201cI got a book from the library and I read about teaching dogs tricks. Baxter\u2019s smart and I know how to get him to roll over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you can show me how to teach him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Ellen said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to teach Baxter new tricks, but he doesn\u2019t seem to understand the concept.\u201d Anne Marie felt it only fair to warn Ellen; she didn\u2019t want to discourage the girl, nor did she want her to think it would be an easy task.</p><p>One of the other mothers glanced speculatively at Anne Marie and Ellen and moved toward them. \u201cAre you Ellen\u2019s mom?\u201d she asked Anne Marie.</p> <p>\u201cActually, no, I\u2019m her friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie is my Lunch Buddy,\u201d Ellen explained proudly. \u201cShe brought her dog for me to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The other woman drew a tiny long-haired girl close to her side. \u201cI\u2019m Shelly Lombard and this is my daughter, Cassie. She\u2019s friends with Ellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Shelly, Cassie,\u201d Anne Marie said, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to ask if Ellen could come over for a play date one afternoon. Would that be possible?\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t something Anne Marie could answer. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask her grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen lives with her grandmother, then?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded.</p> <p>\u201cOh...well, I don\u2019t know if that would work. I was actually hoping we could exchange play dates once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that occasionally I have an appointment after school and it\u2019s difficult to find someone to look after Cassie for just an hour or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always ask her grandmother,\u201d Anne Marie said a second time.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, but if she couldn\u2019t arrange to come for Ellen\u2019s performance, it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019d be up to looking after an extra child.\u201d</p><p>Shelly had a point. Anne Marie remembered Ellen\u2019s saying that her grandmother slept a lot, which made her wonder if the woman was ill.</p><p>Shelly drifted away to chat with another parent. Anne Marie wanted to leave but she could tell that Ellen was desperate for her to stay. She searched for a topic of conversation.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to show me your schoolwork?\u201d Anne Marie asked. She remembered that during her brief orientation, this was an option suggested for Lunch Buddies.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen sat in her small chair and opened her desk to retrieve a notebook. Everything inside was impeccably organized.</p><p>Ellen set the notebook on top and flipped it open for Anne Marie to examine. On nearly every page the teacher had written a comment praising Ellen\u2019s work.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an excellent student,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>\u201cGrandma Dolores makes me study every night.\u201d Ellen didn\u2019t seem happy about this.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Ellen shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThen you get to watch TV, right? That\u2019s what you told me before.\u201d</p><p>She bobbed her head. \u201cWe watch shows on the religion channel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about cartoons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma Dolores doesn\u2019t think cartoons are good for kids. She saw South Park once and got upset. She hid my face in her apron and started praying to Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie bit her lip, trying not to smile.</p><p>A buzzer rang, announcing the end of the school day. In short order, children and parents began to vacate the classroom. Ellen looked up at Anne Marie. \u201cI need to catch my bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to walk outside with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>While Ellen put on her coat and gathered her things, Anne Marie went to introduce herself to the teacher. Ms. Peterski smiled at Anne Marie. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased you could come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d she said and she meant it.</p><p>She and Ellen walked out to the schoolyard, negotiating their way through the laughing, shouting throngs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow at lunchtime,\u201d Anne Marie said as they neared the area where the children lined up for their buses.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming tomorrow, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our lunch date, remember?\u201d</p><p>Ellen blinked hard, apparently overwhelmed that Anne Marie would come to see her two days in a row.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bring Baxter, though,\u201d Anne Marie reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d They approached the bus stop, and suddenly Ellen slipped her hand into Anne Marie\u2019s.</p><p>It felt as if the warmth of that small hand reached all the way to her heart.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Wednesday evening as Anne Marie prepared for bed, her phone rang. At the time she was brushing her teeth. Frowning, she turned off the tap and spit into the sink, then wiped her mouth before she went into the kitchen.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even guess who\u2019d be phoning after eleven o\u2019clock. Caller ID told her nothing. It said Private Caller, which meant it was probably one of the widows. If Elise, Lillie or Barbie was calling her this late, that meant trouble of some kind, although she couldn\u2019t imagine what.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Anne Marie answered cautiously. Nighttime phone calls usually brought bad news, and she\u2019d had enough of that.</p><p>\u201cThis is Anne Marie?\u201d The voice, that of an older woman, was barely audible.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie Roche?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need...help.\u201d The woman, this stranger on the other end of the line, was close to panicking.</p><p>\u201cWho is this, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDolores. Dolores Falk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen\u2019s grandmother.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie sucked in her breath as a dozen disturbing possibilities ran through her mind. \u201cIs Ellen all right?\u201d she asked, fighting down a sense of panic.</p><p>\u201cYes...no. It\u2019s me who needs help...I wouldn\u2019t call you if there was anyone else.\u201d Each word seemed labored.</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t know what she could possibly do. \u201cDo you want me to call someone?\u201d she asked, wondering how she might assist the older woman. Surely she had a neighbor or a friend she could contact. Anne Marie was a stranger.</p><p>\u201cNo, the aid car is on its way.\u201d The woman\u2019s breathing became harsh and irregular. \u201cJust come...please. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t understand. \u201cAre you saying you want me to come to your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Just...hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d How did Ellen\u2019s grandmother get her phone number? And what did she want? She was clearly in distress, but how could Anne Marie help?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anyone else to take Ellen,\u201d Dolores gasped.</p><p>\u201cMe? You want me to take Ellen? But I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d It was out of the question. Anne Marie didn\u2019t have room for a child.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to bring me to the hospital. Please. I\u2019ll refuse to let them unless you come.\u201d</p><p>Talk about emotional blackmail! In just the few minutes Anne Marie had been on the phone with Ellen\u2019s grandmother, she\u2019d realized the older woman was badly in need of medical attention. As much as she resented this, Anne Marie didn\u2019t have a choice. She\u2019d have to go and then try to sort out the situation later.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the address?\u201d</p><p>Dolores gave it to her with the added pressure of, \u201cHurry, please hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d Exasperated, she replaced the phone and exhaled sharply. How had she ended up in this predicament? She\u2019d volunteered to be a Lunch Buddy, not a...she didn\u2019t know what.</p><p>Pulling on jeans and a shirt, Anne Marie complained to Baxter, then promised to return as quickly as possible. With the address scribbled on a grocery-store receipt, she headed for her car. All she needed right now was to get attacked in the alley.</p><p>The alley was actually well lit, not that it would help her any if someone decided to leap out of the dark and mug her. Unlocking her car with shaking fingers, she climbed inside and started the engine.</p><p>Anne Marie considered herself the least capable person to deal with someone else\u2019s problems. If she\u2019d had the school counselor\u2019s home number, she would\u2019ve called Ms. Mayer and handed the whole mess over to her. Rescuing her Lunch Buddy in the middle of the night was not what she\u2019d signed up for.</p><p>Dolores Falk\u2019s house was only about four miles away, but the neighborhood, an older working-class area, was unfamiliar. By the time Anne Marie arrived, the aid car was parked out front. A fire truck was there, too, plus paramedics. Several neighbors stood on their porches watching all the activity.</p><p>Anne Marie parked across the street, well away from the emergency vehicles. Purposefully she trudged over to the house.</p><p>The instant Ellen saw her, she bolted down the porch steps, then raced across the yard and threw her arms around Anne Marie\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Anne Marie asked, placing her hands on the child\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThese men are taking Grandma to the hospital,\u201d Ellen sobbed, clinging to Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re going to help her. Isn\u2019t that what we want?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cN-o-o! She-e-e mi-gh-t d-i-e,\u201d the girl wailed.</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to them,\u201d she said and gently loosened the child\u2019s arms. She walked Ellen back to the porch and left her sitting on the bottom step, still sobbing.</p><p>\u201cAre you Anne Marie Roche?\u201d an emergency medical technician asked as he stepped out of the house.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. The grandmother refused medical treatment until you got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask her that yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me talk to her.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d prefer if you did that at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only need a minute,\u201d she insisted stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cThe grandmother told us you\u2019d be taking the child,\u201d the paramedic said as he started into the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her Lunch Buddy.\u201d She wanted to explain that her entire role in this child\u2019s life was to have lunch with her once a week. She\u2019d met her exactly four times, if you included the brief orientation the previous month. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lunch. That was supposed to be the full extent of her commitment.</p><p>No one had said anything about taking Ellen home with her. That was probably against the rules, anyway, and there seemed to be a lot of those.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there someone else?\u201d she asked, following the EMT into the house.</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d He hurried to a bedroom in the back, Anne Marie directly behind him.</p> <p>She discovered Dolores Falk on a stretcher. The woman\u2019s complexion was sickly and gray, and every rasping breath seemed to cause her pain. Her hand rested on her heart, her eyes tightly shut. Ellen had said her grandmother was over fifty; in Anne Marie\u2019s observation, she had to be in her mid-sixties but looked older.</p><p>\u201cWheel her out,\u201d the EMT instructed the other two.</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Anne Marie rushed to tell her.</p><p>Dolores reached out and grabbed Anne Marie\u2019s hand in a grip that was shockingly strong. \u201cDon\u2019t let them put Ellen in a foster home. I\u2019ll lose her if they do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, Mrs. Falk...Where do you want me to take her?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes closed again. \u201cHome. Take her home with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me? I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to...\u201d</p><p>The EMT came in then and they rolled the stretcher down the hallway and out of the house. Anne Marie trailed behind, watching helplessly as the emergency crew loaded Ellen\u2019s grandmother into the aid car and drove off, sirens screaming.</p><p>With her hands covering her face, Ellen sobbed as she huddled on the steps, her shoulders trembling. Her pitiful cries were drowned out by the screeching aid car.</p> <p>Anne Marie crouched so they were at eye level. \u201cYour grandmother\u2019s going to see the doctors and they\u2019re going to make her well again.\u201d She prayed with all her heart that this was true.</p><p>Ellen nodded tearfully. \u201cWhen will Grandma be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, sweetheart.\u201d She was so far out of her element here that she was breaking into a cold sweat.</p><p>\u201cWhere will I go?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>\u201cFor tonight,\u201d Anne Marie said, mustering as much enthusiasm as she could, \u201cyou get to come home with me.\u201d</p><p>Ellen dropped her hands long enough to look up at Anne Marie. \u201cWith you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s why your grandmother called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Baxter there?\u201d</p> <p>Anne Marie nodded. She should\u2019ve thought of that sooner. Ellen loved Baxter and he\u2019d help take the child\u2019s mind off what was happening to her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cBaxter\u2019s waiting for us to get back to my apartment so he can see you. Didn\u2019t you say you wanted to teach him to roll over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes-s-s.\u201d For the first time since Anne Marie had arrived, the eight-year-old stopped weeping. She bit her lip and managed to control her sobs.</p><p>\u201cWe should pack a few things for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my backpack,\u201d Ellen said, looking small and lost and terrified.</p><p>\u201cGood idea. We\u2019ll put what you need in there.\u201d Taking the child by the hand, Anne Marie went into the house. It was an older single-story home, probably built soon after the Second World War. The floors were linoleum and the furniture shabby and dated. The hallway led to three bedrooms.</p><p>Ellen\u2019s room was the farthest down the hall on the right-hand side. It was furnished with a single bed, a dresser and a child-size desk and chair. The closet was narrow but more than big enough for Ellen\u2019s few clothes.</p><p>\u201cJust get what you\u2019ll need for school tomorrow,\u201d Anne Marie said. In the morning she\u2019d drive Ellen to Woodrow Wilson Elementary, then she\u2019d talk to Ms. Mayer and find out what could be done for the child.</p><p>\u201cI brushed my teeth already,\u201d Ellen said. Kneeling down on the braided rug next to her bed, she stuffed a pair of neatly ironed jeans and a pink sweater into her backpack.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget your shoes and socks,\u201d Anne Marie told her. Ellen was wearing bedroom slippers and well-worn pajamas over which she\u2019d pulled a sweatshirt. \u201cDid you have any homework?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded and hurried to the kitchen, returning with a small binder. \u201cIt\u2019s math,\u201d she explained as she added that to the pouch, along with her tennis shoes and a pair of socks.</p><p>\u201cThis is way past your bedtime,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>\u201cGrandma said she wasn\u2019t feeling well when I got home from school,\u201d Ellen told her. \u201cShe said I could have cornflakes for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>Ellen shook her head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hungry.\u201d</p><p>Most likely Ellen was too worried about her grandmother to have an appetite. \u201cWho called for the aid car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma didn\u2019t look good and she didn\u2019t answer me when I talked to her and I got scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a smart thing to do.\u201d Anne Marie had to credit the child with fast thinking. \u201cDo you know how your grandmother got my phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ellen lowered her eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad she did.\u201d</p><p>Now that she\u2019d seen the situation for herself, Anne Marie was glad, too, and grateful she\u2019d come when she had. She could only imagine how much greater the trauma of this evening would\u2019ve been for Ellen if she\u2019d been handed over to Child Protective Services and placed in temporary foster care.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded solemnly and reached for Anne Marie\u2019s hand. The child turned off all the lights on the way out. She stopped on the porch and took out the house key, hidden beneath a ceramic flowerpot, then locked the front door. When she\u2019d finished, she replaced the key.</p><p>\u201cWill I be able to visit Grandma in the hospital?\u201d she asked, staring up at Anne Marie with huge eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out for you in the morning, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, and the plaintive little voice broke Anne Marie\u2019s heart.</p><p>As they drove back to Blossom Street, Anne Marie suspected the girl would fall asleep on the silent ride there, but Ellen appeared wide-awake. When they got to the bookstore, Anne Marie pulled into the alley behind it.</p><p>\u201cThis is your house?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a small apartment above the bookstore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live over a bookstore?\u201d she whispered, as if Anne Marie resided in some enchanted castle.</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019ll bet Baxter\u2019s standing by the door, too.\u201d The Yorkshire terrier seemed to recognize the sound of her car and waited eagerly by the back entrance.</p><p>Sure enough, the minute Anne Marie unlocked the door Baxter rushed forward, leaping up and down with excitement.</p><p>\u201cBaxter!\u201d Despite the anguish of the evening, Ellen couldn\u2019t hide her delight at seeing the dog again. She fell to her knees and the terrier welcomed her, licking her hands and face.</p><p>\u201cEllen\u2019s spending the night,\u201d Anne Marie told him. Turning to the girl, she said, \u201cLet me show you your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Reluctantly leaving the dog, Ellen followed Anne Marie through the apartment.</p><p>The second bedroom, which served as Anne Marie\u2019s home office, wasn\u2019t set up as guest quarters. But thankfully she had a sofa that folded out into a bed. Taking a set of sheets from the hall closet, she quickly made it up and added a couple of blankets and a pillow.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some warm milk?\u201d she asked when the bed was ready. \u201cIt might help you sleep.\u201d</p><p>Ellen made a face and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSounds dreadful, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d The only reason she\u2019d offered was that her own mother used to give it to her. She hadn\u2019t liked it, either.</p><p>\u201cWould it be okay...\u201d Ellen hesitated.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould Baxter sleep with me?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie smiled. She should\u2019ve suggested it herself. \u201cThat would be just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie yawned. She was exhausted and knew Ellen must be, too. \u201cLet me tuck you into bed,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ll put Baxter up there with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ellen whispered. She slipped off her sweatshirt and slippers and climbed into the newly made bed.</p><p>Once she was under the covers, Anne Marie folded them around her shoulders. She set her Yorkie on the bed. As if understanding that the child needed a friend, Baxter immediately curled up next to her.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Ellen,\u201d Anne Marie said, about to leave the room.</p><p>\u201cWould you say a prayer with me?\u201d the child asked.</p><p>\u201cA prayer?\u201d Anne Marie couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d prayed.</p><p>\u201cGrandma always does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but you say the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen dutifully closed her eyes and although her lips moved, she didn\u2019t speak out loud. After a moment, she said, \u201cAmen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Anne Marie repeated.</p><p>\u201cI prayed for my grandma,\u201d Ellen told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure God listens to little girls\u2019 prayers,\u201d Anne Marie said, choosing to believe that He did. She turned off the light, then realized she didn\u2019t know when Ellen was supposed to be at school. \u201cEllen,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat time does school start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight-twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set the alarm for seven. That\u2019ll give us plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie left the room and eased the door partially closed so she\u2019d hear if Ellen needed her during the night. She found a night-light for the bathroom and plugged it in.</p><p>Sitting at her small kitchen table, Anne Marie inhaled a deep, calming breath. Elise Beaumont had a lot to answer for\u2014and she planned to let her know it. This Lunch Buddy business had become a far more complicated proposition than Anne Marie had been led to expect.</p><p>She liked Ellen and she was happy to help\u2014well, happy might be an exaggeration. She felt obliged to help, especially since the child\u2019s grandmother claimed she didn\u2019t have anyone else to ask. But in the morning, Anne Marie was driving Ellen to school and getting the name of the contact person listed for emergencies.</p><p>This was standard practice. The school would have the name of a responsible adult who\u2019d take Ellen while her grandmother was in the hospital. Someone far more qualified than Anne Marie. Someone better equipped to look after a frightened child.</p><p>Anne Marie had her own problems. And as much as she wanted to help, she wasn\u2019t prepared to be the child\u2019s guardian for more than one night.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Anne Marie woke before the alarm buzzed at seven and discovered Ellen sitting up in bed petting Baxter and talking to him in a voice that quavered slightly.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Anne Marie said as cheerfully as she could. She stretched her arms high above her head.</p><p>Ellen didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some orange juice?\u201d</p><p>The girl shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take Baxter for a short walk. Do you want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen climbed out of bed and sat on the floor, where she\u2019d left her backpack. While the child got dressed, Anne Marie prepared a pot of coffee and put on a pair of sweat pants and a fleece top. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her usual morning routine was to take Baxter out while the coffee brewed, getting a few minutes of exercise at the same time. Their route never varied: down Blossom Street for two blocks, crossing over to a small park, going around the park twice and then back. The entire walk took twenty minutes. Once she was home again, Anne Marie always showered, changed clothes and did her hair and makeup. On a good day, everything could be accomplished in under an hour.</p><p>Ellen was ready by the time Anne Marie finished her first cup of coffee and pulled on her jacket.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to hold the leash?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p> <p>As they headed outside, she asked Ellen a few more questions but the girl remained glum and uncommunicative. She wanted to ask Ellen what was wrong but figured it was obvious. The poor kid was worried about her grandmother, of course, and her own future. Anne Marie couldn\u2019t blame her for that, so she decided to tread carefully. If Ellen didn\u2019t want to talk, she shouldn\u2019t have to.</p><p>\u201cWhen I take you to school this morning, I\u2019m going to see the school counselor,\u201d Anne Marie said as they returned to the apartment.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any relatives close by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy aunt Clarisse.\u201d</p> <p>That was a big relief, although Anne Marie had to wonder why Ellen\u2019s grandmother hadn\u2019t called her instead. Of course, there could be any number of reasons. Clarisse might\u2019ve been out of town or at work or not answering her phone or...she ran out of excuses.</p><p>Anne Marie was confident that as soon as Clarisse learned that Dolores had been hospitalized, she\u2019d be eager to have Ellen. Some of the tension left her now that she had the name of a responsible adult who\u2019d step in and take care of the child.</p><p>When they entered the apartment, Anne Marie checked her watch. Twenty-four minutes so far. That was good, especially with an eight-year-old in tow.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like for breakfast?\u201d Anne Marie asked as they stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>Ellen shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any kid cereals, but I do have shredded wheat. Would you like that?\u201d Ellen had to be hungry, since she\u2019d gone without dinner the night before.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>While Anne Marie got two bowls, the cereal and milk, Ellen made her bed and brushed her hair. It was straight and dark, parted in the middle with bangs that needed to be trimmed. If she\u2019d had any little-girl hair clips, Anne Marie would\u2019ve used them.</p><p>Ellen ate only a small portion of her breakfast and then placed her bowl in the sink. It was a bit early to drop her off at school, but Anne Marie wanted to be sure she had plenty of time to talk to the counselor.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ellen replied. \u201cWill you find out about Grandma Dolores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll phone the hospital this morning,\u201d Anne Marie promised. She\u2019d do it before ten, when the bookstore opened.</p><p>When Anne Marie and Ellen arrived at the school, the playground was already crowded with youngsters. The yellow buses had started to pull up, and students in bright jackets leaped down the few steps, like water cascading over a ledge. They all wore gigantic backpacks that threatened to topple them.</p><p>\u201cWould you show me where the office is?\u201d Anne Marie asked Ellen. She wanted the little girl to feel needed.</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen silently led the way down the school\u2019s wide corridor.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to play with your friends now?\u201d</p><p>Ellen hesitated as if uncertain.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d Anne Marie assured her. \u201cI\u2019ll call about your grandmother and let you know later.\u201d</p><p>Ellen\u2019s eyes brightened and she nodded, then ran off.</p><p>Watching Ellen join her friends, Anne Marie walked into the office; she asked to speak to Helen Mayer and within five minutes was escorted into the other woman\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Helen asked immediately, a small frown between her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot really...\u201d Anne Marie described the events of the night before.</p><p>Incredulous, the counselor stared at her. \u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you can imagine, this has all been a shock.\u201d Anne Marie pinned her gaze on the other woman. \u201cI wonder how she got my phone number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I gave it to her,\u201d Helen admitted a bit sheepishly. \u201cShe phoned last week and asked for it and I couldn\u2019t see any reason not to tell her. She said she wanted to talk to you about Ellen.\u201d</p><p>To be fair, the school counselor couldn\u2019t have known that Dolores would call in the middle of the night and place Anne Marie in such an awkward position. \u201cI\u2019m going to need the emergency contact number in Ellen\u2019s file,\u201d Anne Marie told her.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Helen turned to her computer and began to type. After a couple of minutes, she said, \u201cThe name is Clarisse McDonald.\u201d She reached for a pen and quickly wrote down the number.</p><p>Anne Marie took the piece of paper. As soon as she learned about Dolores\u2019s condition, she\u2019d be in touch with Ellen\u2019s aunt.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what hospital the paramedics took Dolores to?\u201d the counselor asked.</p><p>At the time Anne Marie hadn\u2019t been thinking clearly enough to inquire, but she\u2019d heard one of the EMTs mention Virginia Mason Hospital, which wasn\u2019t far from Blossom Street.</p><p>She was telling Helen Mayer this when a bell rang in the distance, indicating the start of classes. The sound caught Anne Marie off guard and she jerked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou get used to the bell,\u201d Helen said. \u201cAfter a while you don\u2019t even hear it.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou were telling me Dolores is at Virginia Mason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d Anne Marie would visit the hospital first. If she hurried, she should be able to make it there and get back to the store before ten.</p><p>She stood. \u201cI\u2019ll call you as soon as I know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Helen said as she walked Anne Marie to the office door.</p><p>Before Anne Marie left the building, she decided to check on Ellen. She stood by the classroom door and peeked in to see Ellen chatting with her friends as if nothing was awry. Relieved, she went out to the parking lot.</p><p>When Anne Marie reached Virginia Mason Hospital it was already nine-fifteen. She explained her situation to the woman at the information counter, who gave her Dolores Falk\u2019s room number.</p><p>She took the elevator to the correct floor and found Dolores alone in her room, hooked up to IV tubes. Her color seemed improved, Anne Marie thought. When she walked in, Dolores opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling, Mrs. Falk?\u201d she asked as she approached the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing better. How\u2019s Ellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry about her.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in the older woman\u2019s eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for taking my granddaughter. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if you hadn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to help out.\u201d Never mind that it wasn\u2019t entirely true.</p><p>Dolores\u2019s chest rose with a sigh. \u201cThe doctor says I\u2019m going to need heart surgery.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie squeezed the woman\u2019s hand. \u201cThey have excellent doctors here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried for me,\u201d Dolores said, cutting her off. \u201cMy only concern is Ellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just concentrate on getting well. I have the number for Ellen\u2019s aunt Clarisse and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Dolores cut her off again. Her fingers tightened on Anne Marie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the emergency contact you gave the school. So I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClarisse is in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrison?\u201d Anne Marie swallowed her gasp of shock.</p><p>\u201cFraud.\u201d Dolores closed her eyes again, as if admitting this to Anne Marie embarrassed her. Anne Marie was sure it did.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ellen\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>Tears rolled from the corners of the woman\u2019s eyes and fell onto the pillow that supported her head. \u201cHer mother is a drug addict. The state of California took Ellen away from her when she was three years old. I\u2019d lost contact with my daughter\u2014I didn\u2019t even know about Ellen. By the time I learned I had a granddaughter, Ellen had gone through a series of foster homes. It took me a year to get that child to sleep through the night. I won\u2019t put her back in the system. I won\u2019t do that to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear...\u201d Anne Marie said weakly. There didn\u2019t seem to be an adequate response.</p><p>\u201cWhatever happens to me, don\u2019t let them put her in foster care.\u201d Her agitation grew and Anne Marie began to worry. \u201cPromise me,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cPromise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d What else could she say?</p><p>Dolores relaxed a little after that.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her father?\u201d</p><p>Dolores shook her head grimly. \u201cMy daughter probably doesn\u2019t even know who fathered this child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps her mother\u2019s clean and sober now.\u201d Anne Marie hated to sound desperate, but the options were dwindling fast.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not. Last year she rescinded all rights as Ellen\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Anne Marie could feel what was coming. Dolores would ask her to watch Ellen while she was in the hospital. A rush of excuses, a dozen valid reasons she couldn\u2019t do it, were on the tip of her tongue. She couldn\u2019t make herself say them.</p><p>\u201cThat child is the only good thing I have in my life,\u201d Dolores whispered brokenly. \u201cMy daughters have both chosen paths that led to spiritual and emotional ruin. I pray for them every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand where I went wrong. Their father left us twenty years ago, and I raised them alone. I tried to show them the right way...\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie murmured a few comforting words, although she knew there was no comfort to be had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a proud woman all my life,\u201d Dolores continued. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked the government for help, even when I was entitled to.\u201d</p><p>With her free hand Anne Marie gripped the steel bar along the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking for your help now.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie swallowed. \u201cBut...I\u2019m a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen talks about you constantly. You and Baxter.\u201d The faint hint of a smile came to her then.</p><p>Anne Marie was surprised she got a mention. She\u2019d assumed the real attraction had been the dog. \u201cBut...I\u2019m just her Lunch Buddy,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re much more than that,\u201d Dolores told her. \u201cPlease take my precious Ellen and look after her for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Anne Marie didn\u2019t know what to say. Her place wasn\u2019t set up to take care of a child. She didn\u2019t even have a real bed for Ellen. After living alone all these months\u2014more than a year now\u2014she wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d adjust to living with someone else. With a child.</p><p>At her obvious reluctance, Dolores said, \u201cThe doctor said once I have the surgery I should be good as new.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need recuperation time.\u201d Mentally Anne Marie tried to calculate how long that might be. A week? Two? Maybe a month. She couldn\u2019t possibly deal with this awkward situation for a whole month.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll need time to heal,\u201d Dolores agreed, \u201cbut it\u2019ll go much faster if I know Ellen is well taken care of.\u201d She gazed up at Anne Marie with wide, imploring eyes. When Anne Marie didn\u2019t immediately respond, Dolores added, \u201cPlease. I\u2019m asking you from my heart. I\u2019m begging you not to let them take my granddaughter away from me.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie couldn\u2019t refuse. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said, hoping she didn\u2019t sound begrudging\u2014or afraid.</p><p>Dolores released a huge sigh. \u201cThank you, Lord.\u201d She pointed to the side table next to her bed. \u201cI\u2019ve written out a statement that gives you permission to see to any medical needs Ellen might have. I also wrote a statement authorizing you to keep Ellen while I\u2019m in the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>An orderly stepped into the room. \u201cReady, Mrs. Falk?\u201d he asked far too cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking her?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>The young man raised his eyebrows. \u201cSurgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cAbsolutely fine.\u201d</p> <p>Anne Marie felt dreadful; she should\u2019ve been the one consoling the other woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of Ellen,\u201d she promised with a sense of desperation. \u201cJust get well.\u201d</p><p>The young man directed Anne Marie to the nurses\u2019 station, where she was given a phone number to check on Dolores\u2019s progress after the surgery. Anne Marie held on to that piece of paper as if it were a winning lottery ticket. \u201cShe\u2019ll be okay, won\u2019t she?\u201d she asked the male nurse.</p><p>The burly man sent her a stoic look. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure she\u2019s home again as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>That was supposed to reassure her? \u201cThank you,\u201d she said lamely. \u201cI\u2019ll phone later this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have an update for you then. Ask for Dana.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will. Thank you.\u201d She put the phone number, plus the signed papers Dolores had mentioned, in her purse and left the hospital.</p><p>By the time she got to her car, Anne Marie\u2019s stomach was so tense she actually felt nauseous. Yesterday afternoon she\u2019d been working out at Go Figure, the women\u2019s gym on Blossom Street, with Barbie Foster. Less than a day later, she was responsible for the care and well-being of an eight-year-old child.</p><p>At the bookstore, Anne Marie turned over the Open sign and counted out cash for the register. She had a constant flow of customers until about one o\u2019clock, when she called the school and spoke to Helen Mayer.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen\u2019s grandmother had heart surgery this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone at the hospital yet. I wanted to update you, though\u2014Ellen will be staying with me while her grandmother recuperates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you? What about her aunt Clarisse?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently she...she\u2019s moved and can\u2019t be reached.\u201d That was reasonably close to the truth and should spare Dolores some humiliation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>Not nearly as sorry as Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good of you to look after the child. I\u2019m surprised you agreed to it.\u201d</p><p>As much as she\u2019d like to see Ellen with someone else, Anne Marie couldn\u2019t tell a sick woman that she preferred not to take care of her only granddaughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be picking Ellen up from school this afternoon and making arrangements for her to catch the bus on Blossom Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that for you,\u201d Helen Mayer told her. \u201cIf you need me to do anything else, just let me know. I think it\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019re willing to help out like this.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie ended the conversation and then called the hospital. Dolores had made it through surgery without a problem, Dana informed her. She was currently in recovery, and if there were any changes, he\u2019d call. Anne Marie gave him her phone numbers.</p><p>Fortunately Steve Handley, who worked on Thursday afternoons, was able to come in an hour early despite the short notice, which freed Anne Marie to drive to the elementary school and get Ellen. The child\u2019s face brightened when she saw her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my grandma?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the hospital, and the doctors and nurses are taking good care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will she be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d Anne Marie bent down to look into the little girl\u2019s eyes. \u201cUntil your grandmother\u2019s home again, would you like to stay with me?\u201d</p><p>Ellen didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cI guess that would be okay.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t exactly an overwhelming affirmation, but it was good enough. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to stop by your house this evening and pack a bigger suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Baxter come with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought the book from the school library,\u201d Ellen announced.</p><p>It took Anne Marie a moment to realize the book she meant was the one about dog tricks.</p><p>They drove back to Blossom Street in silence, Ellen staring straight ahead. After dinner, they\u2019d return to the house and collect her things.</p><p>Dinner.</p><p>Anne Marie hadn\u2019t given it a moment\u2019s thought. No more skipping meals. No more pity parties, either. She had to be strong for Ellen\u2019s sake. She had to hold her life together for a couple of weeks. Anne Marie figured she could manage that.</p><p>Two weeks. Maybe three.</p><p>Four at the most.</p><p>The time would pass quickly. She hoped.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Thanks to her list of Twenty Wishes, Barbie Foster was thinking harder, doing more and experiencing life with greater excitement. Her list was nearly complete, and she loved the way it helped her analyze what she really wanted. For years, her focus had been on Gary and the twins. But with her sons away at school, she\u2019d been at loose ends, never quite adjusting to the change in her routine. She missed her husband so much, even now. He\u2019d always be a part of her\u2014and yet she was only forty, with a lot of life yet to be lived.</p><p>Instead of working at the dress shop this Saturday, Barbie decided to take a day off and go to the St. Patrick\u2019s Day concert in Freeway Park. Anne Marie Roche had arranged for the afternoon off, as well, and the two of them planned to make an occasion of it. They\u2019d met a couple of times at Go Figure, and she\u2019d enjoyed getting to know her better.</p><p>Her friendship with Anne Marie had deepened since their Valentine\u2019s gathering. Until that night, Barbie had viewed Anne Marie as reserved, a bit standoffish. All of that had changed when they started talking about their Twenty Wishes.</p><p>She\u2019d begun to see Anne Marie as a kindred spirit and discovered a wry sense of humor. Her liking had turned to respect when she learned that Anne Marie was looking after eight-year-old Ellen Falk while her grandmother recuperated from heart surgery.</p><p>Barbie had met Ellen at the bookstore the day before, when she\u2019d come in to buy a couple of romances. The child was sweet and unpretentious; she obviously idolized Anne Marie and was completely in love with her dog, Baxter. Barbie had watched with some amusement as Ellen struggled to teach the Yorkie to roll over, with no success.</p><p>Ellen was joining them for the St. Patrick\u2019s Day concert that afternoon. When Barbie met her and Anne Marie at the bookstore shortly after twelve, they were ready and waiting.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d the little girl asked, fastening the buttons on her light-green coat, which looked brand-new. Thankfully it wasn\u2019t raining; that was good news, since March was notorious for drizzle in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re attending a concert with Irish music,\u201d Anne Marie explained to the youngster. \u201cThen afterward we\u2019re visiting my mother in Ballard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we visit Grandma Dolores, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Anne Marie buttoned up her own jacket. \u201cRight after we see my mother.\u201d</p><p>The child nodded thoughtfully. \u201cWhat\u2019s Irish music sound like?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie hesitated. \u201cWell, it\u2019s usually pretty fast and...\u201d She shrugged, and Barbie laughed as she gave up trying to describe it. \u201cJust wait. You\u2019ll hear it soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I like it?\u201d Ellen asked, tilting her head curiously.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Anne Marie told her. \u201cI like it a lot.\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded firmly. \u201cThen I will, too.\u201d</p><p>Because Freeway Park was relatively close to Blossom Street, they decided to walk. The air was crisp, the sky clear and bright. They moved at a slow pace to accommodate Ellen\u2019s shorter steps. Barbie noticed that the child took in everything around her with huge inquisitive eyes.</p><p>When they reached Freeway Park, above Interstate 5, it was already crowded. Finding a spot to sit was difficult, although they eventually did when a couple of teenagers were kind enough to share their space. Anne Marie had remembered to bring a blanket, which she smoothed out on the grass. A platform had been built for the performance, and they had a good view of the stage.</p><p>Ellen sat cross-legged on the blanket. Barbie and Anne Marie arranged themselves close to her. Barbie hadn\u2019t done anything like this since before she\u2019d lost Gary. It reminded her of family expeditions when the kids were little, and she felt a quiet joy, an awareness that she could be happy again.</p><p>After the accident, her primary concern had been for her children. Now that they were away at school, she was no longer insulated from the pain and the loss. It was this same loss she sensed in Mark Bassett, and one reason she was so drawn to him.</p><p>For her mother, widowhood had been a different story. They\u2019d never really discussed it, but Barbie knew about her father\u2019s indiscretions. Lillie had chosen to ignore them. And because her mother said nothing, Barbie didn\u2019t, either. She knew that Lillie grieved for David. She\u2019d loved him, but in some ways Barbie thought his death might have been a release for her mother\u2014although she\u2019d never so much as hint at such a thing.</p><p>\u201cWhen will it start?\u201d Ellen asked after sitting quietly for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Barbie asked.</p><p>The girl shook her head and tucked her hands beneath her thighs.</p><p>There was festive chatter all around them; everyone seemed to be in a cheerful mood, exchanging greetings, laughing, talking.</p><p>\u201cEllen likes to sing,\u201d Anne Marie told her.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Barbie asked, turning to the child.</p><p>At the question, Ellen\u2019s face grew red. \u201cAnne Marie says I\u2019m a good singer. She heard me sing in the school play.\u201d The child obviously put great stock in the compliment.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Anne Marie can teach you a few Irish songs,\u201d Barbie suggested.</p><p>A look of such profound sadness flashed into her friend\u2019s eyes that Barbie instantly placed her hand on Anne Marie\u2019s forearm.</p><p>\u201cI used to sing, but I don\u2019t anymore. I...can\u2019t,\u201d Anne Marie mumbled, staring down at the blanket. \u201cI lost my voice after Robert died.... I thought it would return, but it hasn\u2019t yet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Barbie felt she had to apologize because it so clearly upset her friend.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I mean, for heaven\u2019s sake, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Recovering quickly, Anne Marie dismissed her concern with a quick shake of her head.</p><p>Ellen gazed up at her, frowning. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you can\u2019t sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ellen,\u201d Anne Marie murmured. \u201cI will again.\u201d</p> <p>Because Ellen was restless and maybe because Anne Marie wanted to change the subject, the two of them went for a short walk around the park before the music started. As they left, Barbie saw that the little girl stuck close to Anne Marie\u2019s side. Being with so many people was probably overwhelming for a child. Barbie had to credit her friend; it couldn\u2019t have been easy to bring this child into her home, even for a short while.</p><p>In fact, Barbie thought Anne Marie seemed softer now, less cynical and more open. Being with such a vulnerable child, having to take responsibility for her, meant that Anne Marie was less focused on her own sorrows. Wasn\u2019t that what Elise kept saying? Doing something for someone else made you feel better about yourself.</p><p>The group of Irish singers was introduced, and the crowd instantly broke into applause. Ellen and Anne Marie hurried back to the blanket just as the performance began.</p><p>The singers, the fiddlers and dancers were thrilling, and Barbie loved every minute. The music was infectious. And the dancing\u2014it was so vigorous, yet disciplined, too. Ellen sat through the entire hour mesmerized. She seemed to absorb the music, every note of it. When the performance was over, her face glowed.</p><p>\u201cThat was so good,\u201d she said, looking at Anne Marie and Barbie. \u201cI want to sing like that someday. Do you think I can?\u201d she asked plaintively.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Anne Marie told her in a confident voice. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can.\u201d</p><p>People had started to leave the park. The exodus was slow moving, but Barbie wasn\u2019t in any hurry. Besides, her feet hurt. That was what she got for wearing designer shoes; she\u2019d chosen them because they were the perfect complement to her black linen pants and green silk blouse. The sun warmed the day, and she\u2019d left her raincoat open, the belt dangling at her sides.</p><p>As she and Anne Marie waited patiently for the crowd to thin, Barbie saw a flash of chrome from the corner of her eye. She turned to look and then caught her breath. She grabbed Anne Marie\u2019s elbow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him....\u201d She could barely get the words out. Feeling self-conscious, she dropped her hand.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>Barbie couldn\u2019t tell her because she hadn\u2019t told anyone about her attraction to Mark Bassett, the man in the wheelchair. She looked again, just to be sure. He was alone, or appeared to be, apparently waiting for the crowd to disperse. Maneuvering his wheelchair would be difficult with so many people pressing in around him.</p> <p>\u201cYou know someone here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Barbie tried to calm the wild beating of her heart. This was an unexpected surprise, a bonus. She was pleased now that she\u2019d taken care with her outfit and makeup.</p><p>If Mark had seen her\u2014and she couldn\u2019t tell either way\u2014he refused to acknowledge her. Barbie bit down hard on her lower lip to keep from raising her hand and calling out to him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know that guy in the wheelchair?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cI...not exactly. I bumped into him recently.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention the part about emptying her soda in his lap.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s certainly a striking man.\u201d</p><p>He was. Barbie had trouble taking her eyes off him. The crowd had mostly disappeared by then and only a few stragglers remained.</p><p>\u201cCan we go see Grandma Dolores soon?\u201d Ellen asked.</p> <p>Anne Marie smiled at the girl. \u201cAfter we visit my mom, okay?\u201d</p><p>Her patience with Ellen impressed Barbie.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d better head out,\u201d Anne Marie said, glancing down at her watch. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting my mother for a late lunch, and after that we\u2019re going to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, no problem,\u201d Barbie told her. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans myself.\u201d</p><p>They left, which worked out well because now she was free to confront Mark. Barbie didn\u2019t have a single idea as to what she\u2019d do or say once she reached him. She\u2019d figure that out when the time came.</p><p>He\u2019d managed to leave Freeway Park and was moving steadily down the sidewalk. Barbie raced after him, having some difficulty with her shoes. \u201cHello, again,\u201d she called out cheerfully.</p><p>He ignored her.</p><p>\u201cRemember me?\u201d</p><p>At her second attempt, Mark spun his wheelchair around. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to enjoy the music, just like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know there\u2019d be a concert,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you wouldn\u2019t have come if you had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you enjoyed it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Barbie didn\u2019t understand him\u2014and she didn\u2019t believe he hadn\u2019t been affected by the music. \u201cWhy are you such a grouch?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI like being a grouch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Oscar.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOscar the Grouch from Sesame Street.\u201d Her sons had often watched it when they were young. She planted herself directly in front of his wheelchair, blocking him off.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t amused.</p><p>She\u2019d never been so rude in her life, but Barbie wasn\u2019t about to let him escape.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Now that he\u2019d asked, she wasn\u2019t entirely sure. To get his attention, yes, but she couldn\u2019t admit that. \u201cTo talk, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He tried to wheel around her, but once again she hindered his progress. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in talking, nor am I the least bit interested in you.\u201d</p><p>Barbie sighed deeply. \u201cThat is so refreshing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>She smiled down at him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how many guys constantly hit on me. Not you, though, and yet we seem to like the same movies. You know, we might actually have something in common.\u201d</p><p>He wagged his index finger at her. \u201cI\u2019m on to your game. You and Tessa are in cahoots\u2014you have to be. That\u2019s how you knew which movie I\u2019d be watching last week. Well, that won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Barbie felt her blood surge with excitement. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it. You can\u2019t tell me which movie to see or not to see.\u201d</p><p>He scowled back at her. \u201cDon\u2019t count on me being there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no guarantee we won\u2019t bump into each other somewhere else,\u201d Barbie said, changing tactics. \u201cWe met here, didn\u2019t we? I think it must be fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s bad luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mark, honestly.\u201d</p><p>His scowl grew darker.</p><p>\u201cYour niece seems fond of you,\u201d Barbie said conversationally.</p><p>His hands were on the wheels of his chair. \u201cI\u2019d like to get out of here if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She raised both hands in a gesture of defeat. \u201cHave it your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mark said gruffly and as soon as she stepped aside, he wheeled past her.</p><p>Despite his dismissive tone, Barbie followed him. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d she began.</p><p>Mark disregarded her, apparently a habit of his. His speed was surprising and in an effort to catch up with him, Barbie was nearly trotting. Her heel caught on a crack in the sidewalk and she went flying forward, landing hard on her hands and knees.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d she cried at the sudden sharp pain. Momentarily stunned, she sat back and brushed the grit from her hands. Blood seeped through her pants and tears smarted her eyes.</p><p>Mark stopped, then reluctantly spun around to face her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked, none too sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cI tripped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Look, there\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I call 911?\u201d</p><p>He was making fun of her, but Barbie didn\u2019t care. She peeled up her pant leg to examine her knee.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for wearing those ridiculous shoes.\u201d</p><p>She let the insult pass.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help getting up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can manage.\u201d When she scrambled to her feet, she discovered that she\u2019d broken the heel off her left shoe. \u201cWould you look at this?\u201d she cried. \u201cIf you knew what I paid for these shoes, you\u2019d be as outraged as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time don\u2019t go chasing after me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not interested, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cFine with me, too.\u201d He started to roll away from her.</p><p>Barbie sniffled and limped off. She\u2019d made an idiot of herself and now she was paying the price. So much for this supposed bond between them. He wanted nothing to do with her. Well, she got his message, loud and clear.</p><p>Her progress was slow with her knee aching and her broken shoe.</p><p>\u201cMiss, Miss.\u201d</p><p>Barbie turned to find a woman with a first aid kit in her hand. \u201cI heard that you fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man in a wheelchair stopped in my store and said you might need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d So Mark wasn\u2019t as hard-edged as he\u2019d like her to believe. He was concerned about her but he didn\u2019t want to show it. \u201cI\u2019m okay. My pride hurts a lot more than my knee. It was my own fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t help you?\u201d</p><p>Barbie thanked the woman with a smile. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just go home.\u201d She\u2019d call her mother for sympathy and then have a cup of hot tea.</p><p>\u201cThe man told me you\u2019d probably say that. If you\u2019ll sit down, I\u2019ll take a look at your knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any glue, do you?\u201d she asked, holding up her broken shoe.</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry.\u201d</p><p>Barbie thanked her again and left, hobbling back to Blossom Street, where she\u2019d parked her car. The injury to her knee was nothing more than a scrape but the blow to her pride would take much longer to heal.</p><p>Her one consolation was the fact that, despite everything, Mark had sent someone to check on her. It wasn\u2019t a lot, but it was something. A tiny fracture in his resistance. It gave her hope.</p><p>By Monday evening, Barbie\u2019s knee was healing nicely. Although she didn\u2019t need to, she wore a huge bandage over it and a short skirt, short enough to reveal her bandaged knee.</p><p>Tessa was at the ticket window when Barbie approached.</p><p>\u201cSo, which movie should I see?\u201d Barbie asked, the same as she had the week before.</p><p>Tessa\u2019s dark brown eyes searched hers. \u201cHe isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean not yet, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Mark\u2019s not coming, period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Barbie couldn\u2019t have disguised her disappointment if she\u2019d wanted to.</p><p>\u201cHe figured out that I was the one feeding you information.\u201d Tessa sounded as disgruntled as Barbie felt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because she was holding up the line, Barbie stepped aside until there was a break.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tessa murmured. \u201cHe told me he won\u2019t be coming to the movies again and that I should make sure you knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Barbie murmured. \u201cDo you see him outside the movies very often?\u201d</p><p>Tessa shrugged. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNext time you do, tell him I think he\u2019s a coward.\u201d</p><p>Tessa\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Barbie insisted. \u201cTell him that for me.\u201d</p><p>She purchased her ticket, plus popcorn and a soda. Although she sat through the entire movie, she couldn\u2019t remember a single scene.</p><p>Chapter 14</p> <p>Monday evening Anne Marie put a meat-loaf-and-potato casserole in the oven. It was a favorite recipe of her mother\u2019s and one she hadn\u2019t made in years. The meat mixture baked with sliced raw potatoes, both covered in tomato sauce. Anne Marie had liked it when she was around Ellen\u2019s age and she hoped Ellen would, too.</p><p>As she closed the oven door, she noticed Ellen approaching the large oak desk where she kept the scrapbooking materials for her Twenty Wishes book.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Ellen asked, looking over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy Twenty Wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty Wishes,\u201d the girl repeated. \u201cWhat are those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, on Valentine\u2019s Day, my friends and I had a small party. We started talking about all the things we\u2019d wished for in our lives and then we each decided to make a list.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust twenty?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie laughed. So far, coming up with twenty had been hard enough, and in fact, she was only halfway there. \u201cThis is fine for now. I\u2019ll think of more later on,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m still working on my first twenty.\u201d She had a total of nine: the five she\u2019d written earlier, plus her most recent additions.</p><p>6. Find a reason to laugh</p><p>7. Sing again</p><p>8. Purchase a home for me and Baxter</p><p>9. Attend a Broadway musical and learn all the songs by heart</p><p>She was considering a line dancing class, which was a wish she\u2019d erased earlier. The St. Patrick\u2019s Day performance had inspired her interest in dancing again.</p><p>\u201cThe wishes don\u2019t need to be practical,\u201d Anne Marie went on to explain. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re called wishes instead of resolutions or goals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t necessarily expect them all to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t expect them to happen,\u201d Ellen asked, regarding her quizzically, \u201cthen why are you writing them down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re wishes,\u201d Anne Marie said. Finding a pen, she added a wish she\u2019d erased two or three times.</p><p>10. Travel to Paris with someone I love</p><p>That encompassed the essence of what she sought\u2014love, adventure, new experiences.</p><p>Ellen stared down at the recently entered wish. \u201cCan anyone make a list like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Anne Marie set the timer on the oven. They\u2019d gotten into a routine, the two of them, during the past five days. It felt as if Ellen had been with her much longer. One obvious difference in her life was that Anne Marie now regularly cooked dinner.</p><p>Ever since she\u2019d started living alone, she\u2019d fallen into the habit of grabbing something quick and easy or skipping dinner altogether, which she could ill afford to do. But Ellen needed regular nutritious meals and a daily structure. With everything else in the girl\u2019s life in upheaval, Anne Marie could at least offer her that.</p><p>The phone rang and Anne Marie picked it up immediately before Call Display could even register the number. She was expecting to hear from Elise, whom she\u2019d been trying to reach all afternoon. \u201cHello.\u201d She figured Elise wanted to share her news, which Anne Marie had already heard via the neighborhood grapevine. Elise had taken a part-time job working for Lydia at A Good Yarn.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie, it\u2019s Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandon! It\u2019s great to hear from you,\u201d she said with genuine pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to call you for a couple of weeks,\u201d he went on. \u201cMelissa told me what she did. I can\u2019t believe my sister sometimes. And as for my father...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine.\u201d That was mostly true.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Brandon pressed. \u201cTo be fair to Melissa, I doubt she realized how hard you\u2019d take that business about Dad. And she was pretty devastated herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Anne Marie lied, brushing off his concern. The last thing she wanted was to talk about her husband\u2019s indiscretion\u2014or even think about it. She felt a rush of pain whenever she remembered and constantly guarded herself against the image of Robert with Rebecca. In his office, on the couch...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked again. He didn\u2019t seem convinced.</p><p>\u201cYes. Positive.\u201d As much as possible she made light of the incident.</p><p>Her stepson hesitated a moment, then blurted out, \u201cLet me take you to dinner tonight. I know it\u2019s short notice, but we could talk and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She hoped he\u2019d take her at her word, not force her to explain.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Brandon\u2019s voice fell with disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI have a visitor.\u201d</p><p>Her announcement was met with a short silence. \u201cAnne Marie, are you seeing someone?\u201d he asked somberly.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not!\u201d The question amused her. \u201cMelissa asked me the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not? Why say it like that? You\u2019re young and beautiful and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with a...friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the mystery intensifies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a mystery,\u201d she said, smiling at his teasing banter. \u201cIt\u2019s Ellen. She\u2019s eight and she\u2019s living with me for the next week or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have an eight-year-old living with you? Is she a relative of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I met her through a nearby school\u2014the Lunch Buddies program. Why don\u2019t you join us?\u201d she said impulsively. \u201cI just put a casserole in the oven and it won\u2019t be ready for another forty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so shocked. I did a lot of cooking in my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019d like that. Thanks. Give me a few minutes to finish up here and I\u2019ll drive straight over. You\u2019re still living above the bookstore, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d She really did hope to purchase a house, and soon. Spring, especially May and June, were the best months to look. As soon as Ellen was back with her grandmother, Anne Marie had every intention of beginning her search.</p><p>\u201cBrandon, one thing...Melissa\u2019s and my conversation...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss it, all right?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she told him, keeping her voice firm.</p><p>Anne Marie hung up the phone and turned around to discover Ellen perched on a chair at the kitchen table, staring blankly into space. She had the end of a pencil clamped between her teeth.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing your homework?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>Ellen shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m making a list of Twenty Wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded. \u201cDo you want to hear what I have so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d Anne Marie pulled out the chair next to her and sat down.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d Ellen announced with great formality. \u201cPlant a garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlowers,\u201d Ellen said. \u201cI read the book you gave me about that garden, remember?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie smiled approvingly. Of course. On Sunday she\u2019d given her a copy of the Edwardian children\u2019s classic, The Secret Garden. Ellen was an advanced reader and had no difficulty with comprehension. Occasionally she\u2019d asked about the meaning of a word. She\u2019d loved the idea of the walled garden, hidden from the world, and had instantly identified with the story\u2019s orphaned young heroine.</p><p>\u201cIs there any other kind of garden than flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegetables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can grow tomatoes?\u201d Ellen asked in an excited voice. \u201cI like tomatoes a lot, especially when they\u2019re warm from the sun. I like them with salt.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie looked at her curiously. \u201cDid you ever have a garden before?\u201d</p><p>Ellen lowered her gaze. \u201cNo...Grandma Dolores told me about warm tomatoes with salt. I\u2019ve never had one but I know they\u2019d be really good because my grandma said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like tomatoes, too.\u201d Anne Marie closed her eyes at the memory of working in her garden at the house she and Robert had owned. The smell of earth, the sun warm on her back...\u201cLast summer I grew tomatoes right here, on my balcony.\u201d</p><p>The child seemed thoroughly confused by that.</p><p>\u201cIt was a container garden because I didn\u2019t have anywhere to plant an actual garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about corn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be a challenge, but I\u2019ll check into it. If you like, we can plant seeds in egg cartons and then once your grandmother\u2019s home again, I\u2019ll help you clear a small space in her yard for your very own garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The girl\u2019s face shone with uncomplicated joy. \u201cA garden,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cAnything else on your list?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded. \u201cI want to bake cookies with Grandma Dolores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always said we could, but then she\u2019d get tired or she wouldn\u2019t be feeling well and we never got to do it.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie slipped her arm around Ellen\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhen your grandmother\u2019s back from the hospital, she\u2019ll be feeling much better and have a lot more energy, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll want to bake cookies with you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOatmeal and raisin are my favorites.\u201d Ellen set the pencil down. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about something whimsical?\u201d</p><p>Ellen turned to her, expression blank.</p><p>\u201cWhimsical means fanciful\u2014a wish that\u2019s not...serious, I suppose you could say. Something lighthearted, just for fun.\u201d</p><p>The end of the pencil returned to Ellen\u2019s mouth. \u201cDo you have anything whi-whimsical on your list?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Good question. \u201cNot yet. Let\u2019s think about it.\u201d She stood to get three plates from the cupboard.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Anne Marie murmured. She looked at the child, then walked over to her own list.</p><p>11. Dance in the rain in my bare feet</p><p>\u201cWhat did you write?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>Anne Marie told her.</p><p>Ellen started to giggle. \u201cThat\u2019s silly. Aren\u2019t you afraid your clothes will get wet? Or you\u2019ll get mud between your toes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t care, especially if I was dancing with someone I loved.\u201d She opened the refrigerator and removed a bag of romaine lettuce and other salad ingredients. Anne Marie occasionally made salad for dinner; she wasn\u2019t afraid to add unusual ingredients, like walnut bits, cranberries, raw green beans, Chinese noodles, sunflower seeds, pickle slices, beets...Her inventions weren\u2019t always successful\u2014the chopped anchovies came to mind\u2014but they were usually interesting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For Ellen\u2019s sake, she chose more conventional makings of cherry tomato, shredded carrots, cucumber and green pepper. Then, because she couldn\u2019t resist, she added crushed pretzels, guessing Ellen would enjoy that.</p><p>As she and Ellen set the table with a white cloth and some leftover St. Patrick\u2019s Day napkins, Anne Marie explained who Brandon was and said he\u2019d be coming over for dinner. Ellen seemed a little nervous about meeting him and, perhaps, about sharing their private time together.</p><p>There was a knock at the back door just as Anne Marie put the salad in the middle of the table. \u201cThat\u2019s Brandon,\u201d she said, walking to the door as Baxter barked excitedly.</p><p>Her stepson entered the small apartment, both hands behind his back. With a sweeping gesture, he produced a bottle of her favorite wine and a bouquet of flowers. He kissed Anne Marie on the cheek, then presented the flowers to Ellen. \u201cYou must be the lovely Ellen. These are for you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ellen gave Brandon a tentative smile. \u201cI like flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to thank Brandon?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ellen.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie found a vase and helped Ellen arrange her bouquet. Then, without being asked, Ellen opened the silverware drawer and counted out what they needed, while Anne Marie got two wineglasses and one for juice. When they sat down to dinner, Ellen said grace.</p> <p>Brandon\u2019s eyes met Anne Marie\u2019s as he bowed his head, and he murmured \u201cAmen.\u201d Ellen insisted on saying a prayer before all their meals. Her grandmother had taught her that and it always made Anne Marie wonder how the woman\u2019s two daughters, presumably raised the same way, had turned out so badly.</p><p>Brandon raved about the casserole. \u201cThis is really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecret family recipe,\u201d Anne Marie told him with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cWill you give it to my grandma?\u201d Ellen asked, scraping up the last of the casserole from her plate.</p><p>\u201cIf you want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like it, too,\u201d Brandon added. \u201cHey, I\u2019ll give it to one of my girlfriends to make.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, make it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>They finished their wine; then Brandon and Ellen cleared the table, while she made a pot of coffee.</p><p>\u201cMay I go to my room and read?\u201d Ellen asked. She\u2019d just started the Laura Ingalls Wilder series and Anne Marie knew she was eager to return to Little House in the Big Woods.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ellen, you may.\u201d</p><p>They watched as Ellen retreated to her bedroom, Baxter close behind. Brandon turned to Anne Marie, leaning casually back in his chair. \u201cYou\u2019d make a good mother,\u201d he said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, but it was a moot point. If she was going to have a child, there had to be a father, and she was nowhere near ready for another relationship. In a few months she\u2019d be thirty-nine and soon after that it would simply be too late. She had no intention of doing what a few women she\u2019d heard of had done\u2014get pregnant via a willing \u201csperm donor,\u201d a man who would play no role in their babies\u2019 lives.</p><p>When the coffee had brewed she filled a mug for Brandon and one for herself before joining him at the table.</p> <p>\u201cHave you talked to Rebecca yet? My dad\u2019s assistant?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He certainly hadn\u2019t delayed in getting to the point, even though she\u2019d explicitly said she\u2019d prefer not to discuss it. Anne Marie let the question slide for a moment as she busied herself with the cream and sugar.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Brandon said with teasing sarcasm.</p><p>She sighed, giving up. \u201cThe short answer is no. The long answer is I\u2019m not sure I ever will. If she comes forward and acknowledges the child is Robert\u2019s...then I\u2019ll deal with it. Not before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d Brandon said after a long moment. \u201cI want you to know that Mel genuinely regrets what happened.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie shrugged it off. \u201cHow is your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talk every now and then. I have to say she seems a lot more serious now. More mature, you know?\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhen I called her last week, she told me she\u2019s on the outs with Mom.\u201d</p><p>That surprised Anne Marie. As far as she knew, Melissa and Pamela were close. Robert\u2019s ex-wife lived in England, where she worked for an international hotel chain. According to Robert, her devotion to her career had led directly to their divorce. Pamela had accepted a position that involved frequent travel, even though Robert had asked her to wait until the children were out of school. She\u2019d refused and left him and their family for months on end.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong between Melissa and her mother?\u201d</p><p>Brandon shrugged. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t tell me. When I pressed the issue, she changed the subject. She obviously doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, but she made it sound like she\u2019s busy with school and she probably is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s graduating this year, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Melissa was completing an MBA program; she then planned to follow in her mother\u2019s footsteps, moving into hotel management.</p><p>Robert had always been proud of his children, and he\u2019d often said they were the only good thing to come out of his marriage to Pamela.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she should be done in June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she still seeing Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know. He\u2019s a good guy. I like him better than any of the other guys my sister\u2019s gone out with. Some of them were...well, put it this way.\u201d He reached for his coffee again. \u201cMelissa\u2019s made some strange choices.\u201d</p><p>Before Anne Marie could respond, Ellen stepped into the room, a pad and pencil in her hand. \u201cIs having a goldfish a wish or a goal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a little of both, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were reading,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ellen looked down, a tendency she had when she was afraid she might be in trouble. \u201cI was reading, but then I thought of another wish. I want twenty, the same as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only have eleven written down so far.\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded. \u201cCan I put dancing in the rain with bare feet on my list, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Anne Marie grinned. \u201cJust remember, there\u2019s no need to rush. Think carefully about each wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen returned to the bedroom, muttering quietly to herself.</p><p>That interruption generated a series of questions about Anne Marie\u2019s Twenty Wishes. She didn\u2019t mind Brandon\u2019s interest; in fact she was grateful for the change of subject and explained in detail what she and the other widows were doing.</p><p>A half hour later, after Brandon had finished his coffee, he left. It was eight-thirty, time to get Ellen ready for bed.</p><p>\u201cGrandma sounded tired when I talked to her this afternoon,\u201d Ellen said, sliding her nightgown over her head, thin arms raised.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be tired for a long time. Heart surgery takes a lot out of a person. She\u2019s going to need plenty of rest.\u201d</p><p>Ellen seemed distressed by that. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to go home to your grandmother soon,\u201d Anne Marie promised quickly. She received daily updates on Dolores\u2019s condition and everything was progressing exactly as it should. In two or at most three weeks, she\u2019d be back in her own home, with a visiting nurse to look in on her. Ellen would be returning to the only stable life she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Pulling back the sheets, Anne Marie tucked the child into bed.</p><p>\u201cCan we say our prayers?\u201d Ellen asked sleepily.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I say the words out loud or should I just say them in my heart?\u201d Ellen murmured. Most nights she\u2019d prayed in silence, mouthing the words as Anne Marie watched.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you usually do with your grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes me to say them out loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it like that,\u201d Anne Marie said. The child\u2019s simple faith touched her, reminding her of a time when she, too, had prayed. Anne Marie couldn\u2019t remember when she\u2019d stopped or why. She\u2019d just...gotten out of the habit, she supposed.</p><p>Ellen studied her. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to hold my hands and close your eyes. That\u2019s what Grandma Dolores does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She clasped Ellen\u2019s hands in hers and shut her eyes.</p><p>Apparently she\u2019d satisfied Ellen, because the youngster began to speak. \u201cGod, it\u2019s me, Ellen, again.\u201d She prayed for her grandmother and thanked God for her teacher and her friends and went through a long list of subjects, from hoping she\u2019d do well on tomorrow\u2019s spelling test to thanking God for her new green raincoat.</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t want to interrupt, but she was the one who\u2019d supplied the coat, not God.</p><p>\u201cAnd thank you most of all for Anne Marie, so I didn\u2019t have to go to a foster home and amen,\u201d Ellen whispered.</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Anne Marie echoed. Her knees had started to hurt and she rose awkwardly to her feet. On impulse she bent over and kissed Ellen\u2019s forehead. \u201cGood night, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>About ten, she took Baxter for a five-minute walk, keeping the apartment in sight. When she got back, the phone rang; it was Elise Beaumont. \u201cI wondered when we\u2019d connect,\u201d Anne Marie said after her initial greeting.</p><p>\u201cSorry to call so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last couple of times I stopped by the bookstore, you were busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to ask how the conversation with Rebecca Gilroy went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That question just didn\u2019t seem to go away. \u201cI heard you\u2019re working for Lydia now,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to distract me. Have you spoken to Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t understand why everyone seemed to think it was her responsibility to confront the other woman.</p><p>\u201cYou have spoken to her, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She had good reasons for not contacting the woman who\u2019d been sleeping with her husband\u2014reasons that were no one\u2019s business but her own.</p><p>Why would she want to talk to this woman, who\u2019d likely given birth to Robert\u2019s child?</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Anne Marie tossed and turned all that night, and when she got up at seven, she doubted she\u2019d had even two hours\u2019 sleep. Whenever she started to drift off, she\u2019d jerk awake, unable to escape the image of Robert and his assistant together, arms and legs entwined. Anne Marie had only met Rebecca Gilroy a few times but remembered her well. Tall and curvy, auburn-haired and in her twenties. As she struggled to sleep, all she could see was the other woman with her swollen belly. Pregnant.</p><p>With Robert\u2019s child.</p><p>Ever since the dinner with Melissa, Anne Marie had tried hard to keep busy, not to think, not to dwell on the pain that threatened to swallow her whole. But then it would come back, refusing to leave until she acknowledged it.</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t confront Rebecca Gilroy. She couldn\u2019t see the purpose of exposing herself to that reality if she could avoid it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With Baxter on his leash, Anne Marie walked Ellen to the bus stop, where a small group of youngsters waited, her eyes smarting from lack of sleep. She took her dog home and did a few household chores before going down to the bookstore at ten and officially opening it.</p><p>Lillie was there at five after. As soon as she saw Anne Marie, she frowned. \u201cYou look terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Anne Marie said wryly. \u201cGood morning to you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Lillie asked.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep very well last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but thanks for offering.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to discuss this with one more person, even a friend as caring and sympathetic as Lillie.</p><p>Anne Marie turned on her computer to do an inventory check while Lillie roamed the shelves. A little while later, she brought an armload of books to the counter; she was a voracious reader and usually purchased hardcovers. Anne Marie could count on Lillie to buy as many as ten books a month. Her most recent selection included a couple of romances. This was a switch; her friend tended to read mysteries and thrillers. Anne Marie added up her purchases, which Lillie paid for with a debit card.</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to Elise lately?\u201d Lillie asked as she slipped her card back into her wallet.</p> <p>\u201cShe called last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she mention her Twenty Wishes?\u201d</p><p>Elise and Anne Marie had chatted about a number of things; however no topic had stayed in her mind beyond the first one Elise had brought up. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Lillie shook her head. \u201cWe really need to meet again and update one another. I\u2019ve taken action and I know you have, too. Sharing our lists would be an encouragement, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie wasn\u2019t convinced of that, but arguing about it required more energy than she had. Lillie suggested a day and time, and Anne Marie agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet at my house next Thursday, the twenty-seventh,\u201d Lillie said, consulting an elegant little calendar she pulled out of her purse.</p><p>Anne Marie agreed to that, too.</p> <p>\u201cBarbie told me you\u2019re looking after a young girl,\u201d Lillie said next. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie was beginning to feel guilty accepting all this praise. The fact was, had there been any other alternative for Ellen, she would\u2019ve been grateful.</p><p>\u201cMy wishes are coming along nicely,\u201d Lillie said, continuing the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m taking this very seriously, you know. It was exactly what I needed.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI find myself thinking more and more about the things I\u2019d like to do, to experience.\u201d She placed one hand over her heart. \u201cI have a sense of...of expectation that I haven\u2019t felt in years. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve finally given myself permission to do what I want.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie hadn\u2019t felt any of that. Most of her wishes had to do with recovering from Robert\u2019s death. To sing, to laugh, to dance. None of those had come to pass yet and in her current frame of mind, she wasn\u2019t sure they would.</p><p>Feeling obliged to say something, she said, \u201cDid I tell you I bought scrapbooking supplies and a binder for my wish list?\u201d</p><p>Lillie straightened. \u201cYou did, and I like the idea very much. I\u2019ve been planning to do it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d Anne Marie urged. She didn\u2019t hold an exclusive on the idea.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019d all profit from making a Twenty Wishes binder, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Anne Marie nodded with a tired smile.</p><p>Lillie left a few minutes later, carrying two large bags, and the day crawled from that point on. Anne Marie could hardly make the effort to smile. She could\u2019ve phoned Theresa to fill in for her but didn\u2019t. Ever since Ellen had come to live with her, she\u2019d called on her three part-time employees again and again. Since her other two were college students, they were in class on and off during the day. She didn\u2019t want to take advantage of Theresa\u2019s kindness, although she would gladly have gone upstairs and crept into bed, craving the oblivion of sleep.</p><p>When the school bus dropped Ellen on Blossom Street, the girl dashed into the bookstore, her eyes sparkling. \u201cI got an A on my spelling test!\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie tried to show her how pleased she was and wondered if she\u2019d succeeded.</p><p>Ellen didn\u2019t seem to notice her exhaustion. \u201cCan I show my grandma?\u201d she asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said we could visit her again on Tuesday, remember?\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately Anne Marie did. \u201cSure,\u201d she said, taking a deep breath. Too many promises made to Ellen had been broken, and she refused to be guilty of that herself. Robert had promised to take her to Paris one day. And he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d promised to love her and be faithful. He hadn\u2019t done that, either.</p><p>She allowed Ellen to bring Baxter down to the store, and the two of them curled up in one of the big chairs. Ellen spelled each of the words from her test for the Yorkie, who appeared to listen intently.</p><p>At four Steve Handley arrived. He usually worked from four to six Monday to Wednesday and four to eight on Thursday and Friday. He often closed for her, and Anne Marie trusted him implicitly.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019d handed everything over to Steve, she, Ellen and Baxter retreated to the apartment. Not up to making dinner, Anne Marie heated yesterday\u2019s leftover casserole for Ellen, adding an apple and a store-bought oatmeal cookie. Her own appetite was nonexistent.</p><p>The child ate silently, then placed her dishes in the sink.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>Ellen turned to face her, eyes wide and hopeful. \u201cI can visit Grandma Dolores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly can.\u201d God would bless her for this, Anne Marie told herself.</p><p>Ellen raced into her room and hurried back with her spelling test clutched in one hand. All the way to the hospital Ellen talked excitedly, about Baxter\u2019s progress with his new tricks and how she\u2019d almost spelled puzzle with one z and a hundred other things she planned to tell Dolores. Anne Marie felt wretched. She\u2019d been so consumed by her own troubles that she\u2019d failed to realize how desperately the child missed her grandmother.</p><p>Ellen needed reassurance that Dolores was on the mend and that everything would soon return to normal. Anne Marie wasn\u2019t the only one whose life had been disrupted. The child must feel so lost and adrift without her grandmother\u2019s love and guidance.</p><p>Anne Marie had kept in touch with Dolores Falk by phone, and she\u2019d called the hospital every day for information on the older woman\u2019s condition. Dolores was improving at a steady rate. The last time she\u2019d spoken with the head nurse, Anne Marie had learned that Dolores would be transferred from the hospital to a nursing facility for at least a week before she went home.</p><p>Anne Marie was fortunate enough to find a parking space on the street and decided to view that as a reward for thinking of Ellen\u2019s needs rather than her own. Holding the child\u2019s hand, she walked briskly toward the hospital\u2019s main entrance.</p><p>\u201cWill Grandma be able to talk more?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>On their first visit the previous Saturday Dolores had a tube in her throat that prevented her from speaking in anything other than a hoarse whisper. \u201cThe tube\u2019s out, so she should be able to talk normally again,\u201d Anne Marie explained.</p><p>Dolores had slept through most of that visit, and afterward Ellen had seemed quieter than usual. The contrast between the child who\u2019d listened to the Irish singers and the child who\u2019d walked out of the hospital later that afternoon was striking. Anne Marie had tried to tell her that Dolores was doing well, but all Ellen saw was a very sick woman.</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother\u2019s going to be so proud of you for getting an A,\u201d Anne Marie told her now.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ellen said solemnly.</p><p>They passed the gift shop.</p><p>\u201cShould we bring her flowers again?\u201d Ellen asked, looking at the floral arrangements displayed in the window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the ones we brought on Saturday are still fresh.\u201d After the concert on Saturday, they\u2019d purchased white tulips and yellow daffodils from Susannah\u2019s Garden, the flower shop next to the bookstore. Dolores had hardly seemed aware of the bouquet, which, given the circumstances, was understandable.</p><p>They walked directly to the elevator and Ellen pushed the button for the fifth floor, which was reserved for surgical patients. The doors opened in front of the nurses\u2019 station.</p><p>When they entered the room, Dolores was sitting up in bed, watching the television mounted on the wall. The flowers in their vase rested on the stand beside her bed. Although the room was a semi-private, she was the only patient. The moment she saw Ellen, Dolores\u2019s expression changed to one of rapture. \u201cOh, my little Ellen, my little love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma! Grandma!\u201d Ellen rushed toward the hospital bed with such enthusiasm she bounded into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ellen, it\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d Dolores turned off the TV, focusing on her visitors, and held out both arms.</p><p>Anne Marie lifted Ellen up for a moment so she could gently hug her grandmother. She was moved almost to tears by the deep affection between them. This was love in its purest form. A child and her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cI got an A on my spelling test,\u201d Ellen said, thrusting the paper at Dolores.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ellen! I\u2019m so pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe studied hard,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>\u201cThis was all the spelling words since Christmas, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the words?\u201d Dolores\u2019s eyes widened with appreciation.</p><p>\u201cYup, and Stevie Logue and me were the only kids who got an A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s excellent, honey.\u201d Dolores reached for her pitcher of water. \u201cEllen,\u201d she said, \u201ccould you do me a favor? Would you please go to the nurses\u2019 station and ask if I can have some more ice?\u201d</p><p>The little girl nodded and took the pitcher, obviously gratified to be performing this important task for her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d Dolores asked urgently.</p><p>Anne Marie smiled at her. \u201cReally well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I could trust you,\u201d Dolores said as tears filled her eyes. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even met you, but I knew you were the one from everything Ellen had to say about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to help.\u201d Anne Marie discovered this was the truth, that it had become the truth.</p><p>\u201cEllen likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anything happens to me...\u201d Dolores continued, leaning forward to clasp Anne Marie\u2019s arm.</p><p>Shock bolted through her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had bad news, have you?\u201d Surely the medical staff would\u2019ve told her if that was the case. Still, she wasn\u2019t family, and she didn\u2019t know how liberal the hospital\u2019s policies were in regard to non-relatives.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m doing well, according to the doctor,\u201d Dolores said.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank goodness!\u201d Anne Marie couldn\u2019t hide her relief.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not a new dishwasher.\u201d Dolores smiled, releasing her grip on Anne Marie. \u201cThat\u2019s what the young woman who operated on me said. I don\u2019t come with a guarantee that all my parts are going to work perfectly for the next five years.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course not.

She wondered if Robert had any premonition when he woke up that it would be the last day of his life. She wondered if he\u2019d experienced any warning signs. Had there been any pain? Nausea? Tingling in his fingertips? Had his left arm ached? Did he assume the pressure in his chest was just heartburn? If she\u2019d been living with him at the time, would she have recognized what was happening and been able to help?</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t have the answers to any of those questions and they would forever haunt her.</p><p>\u201cOne never knows,\u201d she echoed bleakly.</p><p>\u201cI gave birth to two daughters,\u201d Dolores told her.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI tried to be a good mother after their father left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Anne Marie said again.</p><p>Once more there were tears in the older woman\u2019s eyes. \u201cI have no idea where I failed and there\u2019s no going back. Candace and Clarisse,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSuch beautiful girls. And now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Anne Marie spoke soothingly, seeing how distressed Dolores was.</p><p>Dolores seemed to reach some decision. She turned to Anne Marie and took her arm again. Her eyes were fierce. \u201cYou have to promise that if anything happens to me you won\u2019t let Ellen go back to her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not up to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s on meth,\u201d Dolores broke in. \u201cThe last time I saw her was in court. Her hair was falling out and her teeth were rotting in her head and she\u2019s barely thirty years old. My daughter is killing herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have sole custody of Ellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Promise me you won\u2019t let Ellen go back to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the Child Protective Services wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d Dolores insisted, her hand tightening on Anne Marie\u2019s forearm.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t rest until I know Ellen will be with someone who loves her. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie could see that it would do no good to argue. \u201cI promise.\u201d She suspected the state would never allow it, but she had to calm the woman down and there was no other way to do it.</p> <p>Dolores relaxed her hold on Anne Marie\u2019s arm. \u201cThank you,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to raise Ellen,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get well and Ellen will go home....\u201d</p><p>\u201cClarisse.\u201d Dolores\u2019s voice cracked.</p><p>Anne Marie already knew the second daughter was in prison.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s as bad as her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Dolores looked away. \u201cMaybe I should\u2019ve had tighter control of them when they were teenagers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did my best but it wasn\u2019t enough. They got in with a bad crowd and before I knew it, they dropped out of school and started doing drugs....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Anne Marie wished she could think of something else to say. Something more useful.</p><p>\u201cThe state might try to give Ellen to Clarisse once she\u2019s out of prison. Ellen can\u2019t go with her, either. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d Anne Marie had no idea how she was supposed to prevent it, should the state make that decision. She decided not to worry about any of this, since Dolores would probably live for years and would be taking care of Ellen herself.</p><p>As though suddenly exhausted, Dolores closed her eyes and fell back against the pillow.</p><p>Just then Ellen returned, escorted by one of the nurses, who left right afterward. Ellen held the plastic pitcher filled with ice and carefully set it on the stand next to the flowers. \u201cIs Grandma sleeping?\u201d she asked in a loud whisper.</p><p>When Dolores didn\u2019t open her eyes, Anne Marie figured she\u2019d either drifted off or was close to it. Their conversation had drained her of strength; she was, after all, recovering from surgery. And\u2014perhaps even more of a factor\u2014she\u2019d been recalling the bitterest regrets of her life.</p><p>\u201cI got ice,\u201d Ellen said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll thank you later,\u201d Anne Marie told the girl. \u201cBut at least you had a chance to show her your test. Didn\u2019t you see how proud she was of you?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWe should let her sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Still Ellen didn\u2019t seem ready to leave. \u201cWould it be all right if I sat with her for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>There was only one chair by the bed, and Anne Marie was sitting there. Soon Ellen had climbed onto her lap. The even rise and fall of Dolores\u2019s chest, the regular cadence of her breathing, lulled Anne Marie into closing her eyes, too.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been dozing there when her head slumped forward and she realized Ellen had cuddled up in her arms with one cheek pressed against her shoulder. The child\u2019s weight was warm and oddly comfortable, and she would\u2019ve been content to stay that way for a while.</p><p>\u201cDid Grandma Dolores tell you who my daddy is?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>Anne Marie wondered what had prompted that question. \u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sighed with disappointment.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember him, Ellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ellen sounded so sad that Anne Marie wrapped her arm more securely around the girl\u2019s thin shoulders. \u201cHe\u2019s on my wish list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want to see him.\u201d</p><p>Dolores had said that Candace, Ellen\u2019s mother, probably didn\u2019t even know who the father was. Anne Marie didn\u2019t want to encourage Ellen to pursue something that would bring her more unhappiness. But as Dolores had also said, you never knew. The man just might make an appearance in the child\u2019s life when she needed him most.</p><p>\u201cWe can look on your birth certificate, I guess.\u201d Perhaps the school had a copy, although Anne Marie wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d show it to her.</p><p>\u201cI have six wishes now,\u201d Ellen stated proudly.</p><p>Six wishes.</p><p>Six reasons to hope.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go home?\u201d Anne Marie asked. It was nine o\u2019clock now, and she was surprised they hadn\u2019t been told that visiting hours were over.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Ellen climbed down from her lap. \u201cThank you for bringing me to see Grandma Dolores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for telling me about the wishes, too.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded. For some reason the gloom of depression had lightened and the image of Robert and Rebecca had receded. Holding this child in her arms made everything else seem less important, less immediate.</p><p>Dolores snored softly on. Anne Marie held Ellen\u2019s hand and flicked the switch, darkening the room, and they returned to Blossom Street.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Lillie Higgins was meeting Jacqueline Donovan, her dearest friend on earth, for lunch. She wore a beige linen skirt and a jacket that showed off the pearls David had bought her in Hong Kong. Lillie was well aware that some transgression had elicited her husband\u2019s generosity.</p><p>The three-strand necklace was a guilt offering. She didn\u2019t know what had happened while he was in the Far East\u2014or with whom\u2014and she preferred it that way. Her husband generally gave her expensive gifts when he felt remorseful about something. That something always involved another woman.</p><p>Lillie had rarely worn the pearls until after David\u2019s death. Now it didn\u2019t seem to matter. They really were lovely and it didn\u2019t make sense to hide them in a drawer. She had no reason to feel guilty, so she\u2019d begun to wear them regularly.</p><p>As she fastened the matching pearl earrings the phone rang. Lillie hesitated, tempted to let it ring. But Jacqueline was usually ten or fifteen minutes late, so Lillie decided to take the call.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Higgins?\u201d</p><p>Lillie instantly recognized the voice of Hector Silva, the service manager at the BMW dealership.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Silva,\u201d she said, unable to disguise her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m phoning you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I\u2019m delighted.\u201d And that was the truth. She hadn\u2019t expected him to contact her, and this came as a marvelous surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling to thank you for speaking to Mr. Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Sullivan owns the dealership. You phoned and left a message about me and the good service you received.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Lillie remembered that now. \u201cYou went above and beyond my expectations, and I wanted Mr. Sullivan to realize what a valuable employee he has in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Silva, please, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s indebted to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector,\u201d he said. \u201cWe agreed to use first names,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She smiled at the genuine warmth in his voice. \u201cAnd I\u2019m Lillie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to inform you, Lillie, that as a direct result of your comments I was named employee of the month for February.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you deserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...ah...\u201d He hesitated and seemed about to say something more. \u201cI know it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d Again he paused, as if unsure how to proceed.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Lillie\u2019s heart was in her throat. It might be presumptuous of her, but she had the distinct feeling that he was about to suggest they meet again.</p><p>\u201cI hope you have a pleasant day,\u201d he finished in a rush.</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to hide her disappointment. Then, hoping to encourage him and let him know she\u2019d welcome an invitation, she added, \u201cWas there anything else, Hector?\u201d</p><p>Her question was followed by a long pause. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cCalling Mr. Sullivan was very nice of you,\u201d he said, rushing his words again. \u201cI hope you\u2019re enjoying your new car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much, thank you, Hector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Lillie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hang up right away and neither did she. Lillie closed her eyes, willing him to speak, willing him to suggest they see each other again. He didn\u2019t, and after a short pause she heard him disconnect. Her heart sank about as far as it could go. Well, that was that, she supposed. It was probably for the best\u2014although it didn\u2019t feel that way\u2014but she had to be reasonable. His social status was too different from hers and financially they were worlds apart. Hector understood that even if she didn\u2019t.</p><p>If she had a relationship with him, her friends would think she\u2019d lost her mind. Well, maybe she had. Maybe she was tired of all the pretense that surrounded her life. She\u2019d loved her husband, but her marriage had been a sham. When David had his affairs, she\u2019d politely turned her head and looked the other way. Lillie had carried the knowledge and the shame that the man she loved, and had been completely faithful to, treated his marriage vows as if they were merely suggestions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She fingered the pearls at her throat. She remembered the night David had given them to her. He\u2019d stood behind her as she sat at her dressing table and draped them around her neck. In that moment it was all she could do not to rip them off. Although David could well afford the pearls, their price had been too high.</p><p>She and Hector Silva were little more than acquaintances, but Lillie instinctively recognized that this man would never cheat on his wife. Unlike David, Hector was a man who took his emotional commitments seriously. Anyone might ask how she could possibly know this about a man she\u2019d only met a few times. But Lillie knew. Call it intuition or whatever you wanted. She just knew.</p><p>Feeling melancholy, she sighed, removing the car keys from her purse. She wouldn\u2019t hear from him again.</p><p>Lillie left the house to meet Jacqueline Donovan at the exclusive Seattle Country Club. The two of them had been members for years. They\u2019d worked on any number of charitable projects together and been co-chairs of the Christmas Ball more times than she could recall.</p> <p>When the news came that David and Gary had been killed in the plane crash, the one person Lillie had turned to for solace and advice had been Jacqueline. Barbie had her own intense grief to cope with and her sons to comfort; those three had formed a closed circle in the weeks after the accident. Jacqueline had stayed by Lillie\u2019s side for days, helping her deal with the multitude of immediate decisions. Her love and concern didn\u2019t end there, either. Jacqueline remained her friend while others had drifted away. She was also the only person Lillie had confided in about David\u2019s affairs.</p><p>Lillie pulled up in front of the club building and was instantly greeted by a valet. He didn\u2019t give her a voucher. None was necessary. Every employee of the club recognized her and her new vehicle.</p><p>\u201cMs. Donovan arrived two minutes ago,\u201d the valet told her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jason,\u201d she murmured and headed inside.</p><p>Sure enough, Jacqueline sat at their usual table, glancing over the menu. She wore her hair in her customary French roll and had chosen a Venetian glass necklace in teal and gold that stood out against her black pants and jacket. She put down the menu and smiled.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you to be late,\u201d she said when Lillie joined her. She\u2019d already ordered a bottle of their favorite wine, a New Zealand sauvignon blanc that the club kept in stock primarily for them.</p><p>\u201cI answered the phone on my way out the door,\u201d she said, reaching for the menu, although she practically had it memorized. Naturally, it didn\u2019t include prices. A bill would be mailed at the end of the month with the accumulated charges.</p><p>\u201cNothing important, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Lillie considered mentioning Hector but quickly dismissed the thought. Of all her friends, she trusted Jacqueline most, and yet...</p><p>A waiter came to their table, and Lillie decided on the Oriental salad; Jacqueline ordered blackened scallops.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jacqueline said, swirling the wine in her glass. \u201cWhat\u2019s new with your Twenty Wishes?\u201d</p> <p>The last time they\u2019d met for lunch, Lillie had been full of enthusiasm about her list. She\u2019d talked nonstop, extolling the idea and describing her wishes\u2014starting with the red BMW.</p><p>\u201cThe widows are meeting next week. We\u2019re going to talk about our wishes and the progress we\u2019ve made.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline sipped her wine. \u201cThis is such a good idea. Ever since you told me about it, I\u2019ve been planning to make my own list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d Lillie said, nodding vigorously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly given you a new lease on life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you look this happy in years.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to say something, to explain that the Twenty Wishes weren\u2019t entirely responsible for this \u201cnew lease on life.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t; she had to accept that she wouldn\u2019t be hearing from Hector again. Ironically, he was the embodiment of her most longed-for wish\u2014a decent, honorable man. A man she couldn\u2019t have. A wish she might never fulfill. The whole thing was just so hopeless.</p> <p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve met someone.\u201d Lillie couldn\u2019t imagine what had made her say that. She wanted to snatch the words back the instant they left her mouth.</p><p>Jacqueline nearly tipped over her wineglass. \u201cWhen? How? Who? You haven\u2019t said anything about this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Lillie drew in a deep breath. \u201cBefore you get all excited, let me say this isn\u2019t anyone you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a member of the club?\u201d Much of their social life revolved around the country club, although both had plenty of friends outside it.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the big secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a big secret. I should never have mentioned it.\u201d Lillie could feel her face heating up. \u201cForget I said a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! You\u2019re dying to tell me, I know you are. Spill it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been on a date with him, so there\u2019s nothing to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline frowned. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, he hasn\u2019t asked and...and, well, I doubt he ever will, so there\u2019s no point in discussing this any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s younger, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Wipe that silly grin off your face, Jacqueline Donovan. It\u2019s not like that at all. He\u2019s shy and I think he\u2019d like to ask me out but he hasn\u2019t.\u201d She was saying more than she\u2019d ever intended and desperately wished she\u2019d never introduced the subject.</p><p>Jacqueline leaned back in her chair and a smile quivered at the edges of her mouth. \u201cYou should ask him out,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. In our generation, the men always did the asking, but times have changed. If you\u2019re interested in this man\u2014this stranger you refuse to tell your very best friend about\u2014then all I can say is that you need to take the initiative.\u201d</p><p>Lillie stared across the table at her, and Jacqueline stared right back. \u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>That went against every dictate of her upbringing. Ask Hector out on a date? It was a preposterous suggestion. An outrageous idea.</p><p>Jacqueline simply shook her head. \u201cYou can ask him, and you will. Or...or I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d</p><p>At that Lillie giggled. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that ridiculous? You\u2019re a lovely woman, Lillie, and a beautiful person besides. You deserve happiness. Isn\u2019t that what the Twenty Wishes are all about? Going after the things you want in life. Places to see, people to meet, experiences to live. Don\u2019t hold back now. Go for it!\u201d</p><p>Could Jacqueline be right?</p><p>Without some kind of pledge from her, Jacqueline was never going to shut up about this. \u201cI\u2019ll consider it.\u201d That was the best she could do for now.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jacqueline nodded, obviously pleased.</p><p>Lillie relaxed, wondering how she could possibly approach Hector. Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake, what did she know about such things? If David was alive, she could\u2019ve asked him. He was the one with all the dating experience. That thought produced a hysterical giggle that she tried, unsuccessfully, to swallow.</p><p>Jacqueline regarded her closely. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed, Lillie shook her head. \u201cYou\u2014saying I should contact my friend and ask him out.\u201d She waved her hand. \u201cI was just thinking\u2014Never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, tell me,\u201d Jacqueline insisted.</p><p>So she did, and soon they were both laughing.</p><p>The waiter brought their lunch and automatically refilled their glasses.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do it,\u201d Jacqueline said firmly, leaving no room for argument. She reached for her fork.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Jacqueline returned. \u201cYou want to see this man, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lillie gave a barely perceptible nod.</p><p>\u201cIf you need me standing by to encourage you, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Lillie felt a moment\u2019s hope. No, it was impossible. Even if she did find the courage, she didn\u2019t know what kind of outing to suggest. Perhaps a movie? Barbie seemed to be going to the movies a lot these days.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking serious now,\u201d Jacqueline said.</p><p>\u201cHe might refuse,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cI might\u2019ve completely misread him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Her friend shrugged as if this was an insignificant concern. \u201cNothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop,\u201d Jacqueline said.</p><p>Lillie had yet to try a single bite of her salad. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right.\u201d She picked up her fork, then laid it down again. \u201cThe problem is, we don\u2019t have a single thing in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the fact that you\u2019re attracted to him and I assume he is to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, I am attracted to him. I really am. I go to sleep thinking about him. I yearn for him...\u201d Her face flushed with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cHave you analyzed what\u2019s so attractive about him?\u201d</p><p>She knew the answer immediately. \u201cOh, yes\u2014he\u2019s kind and gentle and honorable. He loves his children and I\u2019m positive he was a faithful husband.\u201d Just talking about Hector was enough to bring tears of longing to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou want him?\u201d Jacqueline whispered the question.</p><p>\u201cNot the way you\u2019re thinking.\u201d This wasn\u2019t merely physical desire, although he was a good-looking man and late at night she\u2019d fantasized about his mouth, his hands.... What she felt was, above all, emotional\u2014that need for true kinship, that recognition of another\u2019s soul. She tried to explain her feelings to her friend.</p><p>\u201cThis must be one helluva man,\u201d Jacqueline commented.</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t wait, Lillie,\u201d Jacqueline said earnestly. \u201cI wasted too many years of my life before Reese and I...\u201d</p><p>She let the rest fade, but Lillie knew what she meant. Jacqueline\u2019s marriage had been like her own. She and Reese had lived as strangers for years. Jacqueline had reason to believe her husband had a mistress, and as a result she\u2019d moved into a spare bedroom. They\u2019d remained stiffly polite, ignoring each other as much as possible in the privacy of their home, acting like a loving couple outside it. No one had suspected. No one knew the truth about them.</p><p>Except Lillie.</p><p>She\u2019d been able to identify the signs because she\u2019d lived the same scenario.</p><p>Then, shortly before David\u2019s accident, something changed between Jacqueline and Reese. Almost overnight they set aside their differences and became lovers again. They\u2019d even traveled to Greece on a second honeymoon. The love was back in their marriage and in their lives.</p><p>Lillie never learned exactly what had brought about the change, although she suspected that Tammie Lee, the Donovans\u2019 daughter-in-law, had something to do with it. When Paul had first brought home his young bride from Louisiana, Jacqueline had been horrified. Tammie Lee, with her southern drawl, wasn\u2019t the daughter-in-law she\u2019d wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Personally, Lillie had instantly liked the young woman. She was sweet and genuine and good-humored, even if she did talk about recipes for pickled pigs\u2019 feet and boiled peanuts.</p><p>It\u2019d taken Jacqueline months to accept the idea of her only son married to Tammie Lee and then gradually, the relationship between the two women had undergone a shift. Not long after that, the relationship between Jacqueline and her husband had improved, too. She and Reese had clearly achieved some sort of reconciliation.</p><p>For a while Lillie had been jealous. She wanted the same happiness Jacqueline had rediscovered in her marriage. She\u2019d hoped for that kind of turnaround in her own\u2014but it never happened.</p><p>And yet, it wasn\u2019t too late for a change in her life. It wasn\u2019t too late to fulfill a wish...</p> <p>She\u2019d do it.</p><p>She\u2019d defy her upbringing and find a way to ask Hector Silva on a date.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Monday morning Anne Marie was finishing up the sale of a hard-cover novel for one of her favorite customers, Larry Barber, a retired accountant, when Lillie and Barbie entered Blossom Street Books. Mother and daughter had never looked better. In fact, Anne Marie caught herself staring. A transformation had taken place in both women and while it might not be apparent to anyone else, Anne Marie noticed. Trying to discern what was different about them, she decided it was a new sense of life. They seemed to shimmer with it.</p><p>They talked animatedly to each other while Anne Marie completed the sale.</p> <p>As Larry signed the charge slip, Anne Marie smiled a warm welcome at her friends. He wasn\u2019t in any hurry to leave. Since his wife had died, he was lonely and came to the store for conversation with Anne Marie as much as he did for reading material. When business was slow, Anne Marie didn\u2019t mind. She knew what it was to be alone and to crave companionship. This morning, however, she was impatient to be with Lillie and Barbie.</p><p>Larry must have realized the other women wanted to talk to her and, reaching for his purchase, thanked Anne Marie and headed out the door.</p><p>The minute he left, Barbie shimmied up to the counter. \u201cI found a belly dancing class,\u201d she announced and threw her arms in the air as if she was about to give a demonstration.</p><p>\u201cBelly dancing?\u201d Anne Marie repeated. \u201cYou talked about that during our Valentine\u2019s get-together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on my wish list,\u201d Barbie informed her. \u201cI\u2019m so excited I can hardly stand it.\u201d</p><p>Lillie rolled her eyes playfully. \u201cMy daughter sometimes shocks even me.\u201d</p> <p>Barbie waved off her mother\u2019s comment. \u201cOh, honestly, Mother, I\u2019ve wanted to learn how to belly dance for ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said anything to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014I thought about it a lot, but it seemed so...oh, I don\u2019t know, silly, I guess. Then, when I read about a class at the Fitness Center, I decided to learn how to do this. I\u2019m not putting it off any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Anne Marie said. She had an announcement of her own. \u201cI signed up for a knitting class.\u201d On Saturday, Lydia had told her that the long-delayed beginners\u2019 class would start the following Wednesday at twelve-thirty.</p><p>\u201cIs Elise teaching the class?\u201d Lillie asked.</p><p>Anne Marie nodded. Elise had told her that working at the yarn store had been one of her wishes.</p><p>These lists of Twenty Wishes were influencing all their lives\u2014and those of others, too. For instance, Elise\u2019s wish had been a solution to Lydia\u2019s problem of teaching too many classes. It seemed that every time Anne Marie went into A Good Yarn, Margaret was complaining that Lydia shouldn\u2019t be taking on as much as she did. Now Elise would fill in as sales help when necessary and teach three classes. In addition to the beginners\u2019 class, she\u2019d be teaching a session on knitting with beads and another on felted purses.</p><p>For the moment, Anne Marie was content with the beginners\u2019 class. Once she learned the basics, she\u2019d venture out into more complicated techniques and projects.</p> <p>Already she could see that knitting was something she\u2019d enjoy. At noon she\u2019d go and choose her yarn for the first class, two days from now. Timing would be tight, since Anne Marie was still joining Ellen for lunch on Wednesdays, even though the girl was living with her.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I\u2019d have everyone over for dinner,\u201d Lillie murmured, breaking into Anne Marie\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>She must have responded with a blank look because Lillie immediately said, \u201cFor our meeting? To discuss our wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Thursday still okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d Anne Marie returned with some hesitation. \u201cBut remember Ellen will be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Lillie said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Anne Marie could probably find someone to watch Ellen if she had to.</p><p>\u201cOf course she can come,\u201d Lillie was quick to tell her. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have Ellen.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie grinned, remembering how intently Ellen had worked at compiling her own list. \u201cDid I mention Ellen\u2019s got Twenty Wishes, too?\u201d</p><p>Mother and daughter shared a smile.</p><p>\u201cMy friend Jacqueline Donovan is making one, as well,\u201d Lillie added. \u201cThe minute I mention the idea to anyone, they decide to make their own. Jacqueline told me the first wish on her list is to ride a camel in Egypt and see the pyramids. She also wants to sleep under the desert sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacqueline? Camping?\u201d Barbie said incredulously. \u201cThat woman likes her luxuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, that was my reaction, too.\u201d Lillie shrugged in amusement. \u201cWho knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s like me and belly dancing,\u201d Barbie said. \u201cIt was in the back of my mind, just a vague...whimsy, I guess you could say, but it didn\u2019t enter my consciousness until I started working on my list of wishes. Sometimes I think we\u2019re afraid to admit we want certain things. Especially things that contradict the image we have of ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the way others think of us,\u201d Lillie said.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>A customer walked in the door.</p><p>Lillie glanced over her shoulder and then back at Anne Marie. \u201cThursday night, then. Shall we say six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d And she was. Her list of wishes was growing and it wasn\u2019t as difficult to come up with ideas as it had originally been. All at once a whole world of wishes, of desires and possibilities, had opened up to her, ideas that had seemed beyond the scope of her imagination only a few weeks ago. Perhaps her heart had finally, gradually, begun to mend. She had fifteen wishes now.</p><p>12. Take a cake-decorating class and bake Ellen a huge birthday cake</p><p>13. Practice not-so-random acts of kindness at least once a week</p><p>14. Ride the biggest roller coaster in the world at Six Flags in New Jersey</p><p>15. Visit the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg and then go to Amish country</p><p>That evening as Anne Marie put away the dinner dishes, Ellen sat at the kitchen table, doing her homework. Her ankles were demurely crossed, her entire demeanor intent.</p><p>Ellen had spoken with her grandmother before dinner, and so had Anne Marie. Dolores was regaining her strength. It wouldn\u2019t be long before Ellen could return to her home and all that was familiar.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to go over your spelling with you?\u201d Anne Marie offered as she wiped the countertop.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a test tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I already memorized all the words,\u201d Ellen said proudly.</p><p>\u201cOn the very first day?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded. \u201cI did that after I took Baxter for a walk when I got home.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie wasn\u2019t sure how Baxter would do when Ellen went back to her grandmother\u2019s. The eight-year-old had completely spoiled him. Every day after the school bus dropped her off, Ellen ran up the stairs to their apartment and lavished Baxter with love and attention. Anne Marie walked her dog twice every day and once in the evening. Now, however, Ellen took over for her in the afternoon. Anne Marie used to take him to the alley behind the store. Not Ellen. She paraded him up and down Blossom Street with all the ceremony of visiting royalty. Needless to say, Baxter loved their excursions.</p><p>Cody, Lydia\u2019s stepson, had recently come by with his dog, Chase, and the two dogs and children had quickly become friends. The dogs made quite a pair; Chase was a hefty golden retriever and Baxter was tiny by comparison. Like many small dogs, Baxter wasn\u2019t intimidated by the bigger dog\u2019s size, and the two of them marched side by side, looking for all the world like Laurel and Hardy.</p><p>In addition to Lydia, Ellen had made friends with several of the other business-owners. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for her to return with a carnation given to her by Susannah or a cookie from Alix at the French Caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cCan I watch TV when I finish my homework?\u201d Ellen asked, glancing up from her arithmetic.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Anne Marie was looking forward to sitting down in front of the TV, too. She\u2019d gone to A Good Yarn on her lunch break to buy the necessary knitting supplies. With the extra classes and increased business, the shop was now open six days a week. Elise had helped Anne Marie select her yarn and needles. The choices seemed endless, and after much debate, she\u2019d decided on a soft washable wool in lavender to make a lap robe for Dolores Falk.</p><p>Because Anne Marie was so eager to learn, Elise had taught her how to cast on and showed her the basic knit stitch. To her delight, Anne Marie had picked it up without a problem.</p><p>An hour later, Anne Marie and Ellen sat together on the sofa, watching the Family Channel. Wanting to practice what she\u2019d learned, Anne Marie took out the needles and a skein of yarn.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>\u201cKnitting,\u201d she said, adding \u201cI hope,\u201d under her breath.</p><p>\u201cGrandma Dolores used to knit.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019d teach me.\u201d</p><p>Again Anne Marie acknowledged the comment with a slight inclination of her head as she concentrated on casting on stitches.</p><p>\u201cIs it hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I watch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Ellen scooted closer and stared fixedly as Anne Marie attempted what Elise called a knitted cast-on. The term didn\u2019t mean anything to her; all she wanted to do was get stitches onto the needle.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s knitting?\u201d Ellen said.</p><p>Anne Marie paused. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>Ellen removed her shoes and stood on the sofa to get a better view. Suddenly she bounded off the sofa and dashed into her bedroom. She was back an instant later with a pad and paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d Anne Marie asked as the youngster skidded to a stop, barely missing the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cMy Twenty Wishes. I want to learn how to knit, too.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie grinned at her. \u201cHow about if I teach you what I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean now?\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes grew round.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen leaped back onto the sofa, sitting close beside Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Elise...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Beaumont?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, Mrs. Beaumont. There are actually only two basic stitches. The first is called the knit stitch and the second is a purl stitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ellen said again, nodding sagely.</p><p>\u201cSo far, I just know how to do the knit stitch. I\u2019ll learn how to purl in the first class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t taken a real class yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m signed up, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, Ellen, I don\u2019t know all that much, but I\u2019m willing to show you what I can do. If you like it, I\u2019ll take you to the yarn shop and let you pick out your own needles and yarn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Ellen was beside herself with excitement. \u201cReally? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really,\u201d Anne Marie responded, smiling.</p> <p>For the next forty minutes, the television show was forgotten as Anne Marie showed Ellen what Elise had taught her that day. Ellen didn\u2019t catch on as easily as Anne Marie, but she was, after all, only eight.</p><p>Anne Marie was pleased with the child\u2019s determination to learn. Before the evening was over, Ellen was every bit as proficient as Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cI want to knit something for Grandma Dolores,\u201d Ellen stated. \u201cSomething pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a scarf?\u201d Anne Marie suggested. She\u2019d seen several exquisite ones at the shop. Elise had explained that these elaborate scarves had been knit using only the basic stitch she\u2019d taught Anne Marie that very day.</p><p>\u201cFor her to wear to church,\u201d Ellen continued excitedly. \u201cI\u2019ll give it to her when she comes home from the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very good idea.\u201d</p> <p>Ellen finished the row and was about to start another when Anne Marie noticed the time. The evening had simply slipped away. It used to be that the hours she spent in the apartment moved so slowly she seemed aware of every passing minute.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nine o\u2019clock,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve been in bed half an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it nine already?\u201d Ellen protested, but she couldn\u2019t hold back a yawn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. We\u2019ll knit again tomorrow night,\u201d Anne Marie promised.</p><p>Ellen set down the needles and yarn and stumbled toward her room, yawning every step of the way.</p><p>\u201cCall me when you\u2019re ready for your prayers, sleepyhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...kay.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, Ellen called out that she was ready. They followed the same routine as when Ellen lived with her grandmother, which meant that Anne Marie listened to the girl\u2019s prayers. She\u2019d been saying them aloud for the last while.</p> <p>Kneeling by the sofa bed, Anne Marie propped her elbows on the mattress, closed her eyes and bowed her head. Ellen\u2019s prayers didn\u2019t vary much. First, she asked God to help her grandmother get better. Then she asked Him to bless a number of people, Anne Marie and Baxter included, with lengthy descriptions of each. Finally, she gave thanks for the day\u2019s small triumphs. At the end of the seemingly interminable list, she said \u201cAmen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Anne Marie echoed. \u201cGood night, Ellen.\u201d She drew the covers more firmly around her and was about to get up when Ellen threw both arms around Anne Marie\u2019s neck and hugged her tightly. \u201cThank you for teaching me to knit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said, hugging her back. Getting to her feet, she turned out the light, then tiptoed out of the room. As was her habit, she left the door slightly ajar.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Anne Marie had stepped into the hallway that she realized something\u2014this was the first time Ellen had actually hugged her. The night Anne Marie had gone to Dolores Falk\u2019s home, Ellen had fallen weeping into her arms, but that wasn\u2019t a real hug. Not like the one she\u2019d just received.</p><p>Anne Marie stood right where she was and savored the moment. She felt loved and needed in a way she never had before.</p><p>It was like the return of warmth after the coldest winter of her life.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>\u201cYou came!\u201d Tessa Bassett said with unrestrained glee when Barbie stepped forward to purchase her movie ticket. The teenager\u2019s face was flushed with excitement, and she leaned forward, lowering her voice. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark?\u201d Barbie could hardly believe it. She hadn\u2019t expected this, but it shouldn\u2019t surprise her. Mark was definitely intrigued, even if he resisted her. Despite his hostility he hadn\u2019t really wanted to scare her off. Or maybe he was testing her interest. At any rate, Barbie saw the first substantial crack in that impervious exterior of his.</p><p>Mark was back. For that matter, so was she.</p><p>\u201cHe said he wasn\u2019t going to ever come on a Monday again\u2014but now he has. I wanted to call you but I didn\u2019t know your last name, so I couldn\u2019t. I just hoped you\u2019d be back and you are.\u201d This was all said in one breath. While she was speaking, Tessa slipped her the movie ticket and held out her hand for the money.</p><p>\u201cWhat movie am I seeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA horror flick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like horror movies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tessa\u2019s face fell. \u201cDo you want to see something else? You don\u2019t, do you? Because I think my uncle Mark likes you. Only he\u2019s afraid \u2019cause, after the accident, his wife divorced him and he\u2019s never heard from her again. You\u2019re the first woman he\u2019s even noticed since then.\u201d</p><p>Barbie stared at her, appalled. This ex-wife of his sounded like a shallow, selfish woman. Whatever happened to \u201cfor better, for worse\u201d? Marriage vows didn\u2019t become null and void if one of the partners got sick or hurt. She knew without a second\u2019s hesitation that she and Gary would have stuck by each other, regardless of circumstances.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI suppose I could watch a horror movie,\u201d she said. \u201cHow bloody is it?\u201d</p><p>Tessa grimaced, wrinkling her nose. \u201cReal bloody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there dismembered body parts?\u201d That was the worst, in Barbie\u2019s opinion.</p><p>Tessa nodded reluctantly. \u201cBut he came back! That\u2019s big.\u201d</p><p>Undecided, Barbie chewed on her lower lip. Tessa was right; neither of them had expected Mark to return. Barbie wasn\u2019t sure why she\u2019d come\u2014force of habit? Hope?</p><p>\u201cJust go,\u201d Tessa urged. \u201cDon\u2019t look at the screen. Close your eyes and plug your ears. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>Other than the thought of having to watch the dispersing of gore and guts, choreographed to loud, pounding music, Barbie couldn\u2019t have said what was stopping her. So the movie wasn\u2019t exactly her choice. So what? She\u2019d be with Mark and wasn\u2019t that the whole point of being here?</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said with a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrific!\u201d</p><p>She just prayed she wouldn\u2019t have nightmares for the rest of her life.</p><p>\u201cLet me know what happens, okay? With Uncle Mark, I mean.\u201d Tessa said. \u201cMy parents and my grandmother want to know, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d That meant the whole family was in on this, which was encouraging.</p><p>Barbie took her time, waiting until the last possible minute before slipping into the darkened theater. She purchased her popcorn and soda and lingered in the lobby until the show was about to start.</p><p>When she walked into the theater, the previews had already begun. She made her way to the row where Mark had parked his wheelchair, the same as usual. As she had previously, she sat one seat away from him.</p><p>He turned and stared at her in feigned surprise. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She could act as well as he could. \u201cOh, hello,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cIs that you again?\u201d</p><p>For a moment she suspected the hint of a smile. She turned back to the screen just in time to see an ax-murderer heave his weapon of death into a wall next to a trembling woman\u2019s head. Unable to stop herself, she gasped aloud and nearly dropped her popcorn.</p><p>\u201cFrightens you, does it?\u201d Mark asked in a far too satisfied tone. \u201cMight I remind you these are only the previews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d She gritted her teeth.</p><p>Mark laughed, causing a woman behind him to make a shushing sound. \u201cYikes,\u201d he repeated, lowering his voice. \u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I remind you I have sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a lady, right?\u201d He spoke as if he intended that to be an insult.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes,\u201d she said stiffly. \u201cI know all the words you do. I merely choose not to say them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d he muttered, then settled back in his wheelchair to watch the movie, which was just getting started.</p><p>He gave every appearance of enjoying it, but as far as Barbie was concerned, this was torture. She\u2019d always avoided being around when her sons watched horror DVDs with the bloodthirsty gusto of teenage boys. Now she squirmed in her seat, covered her face frequently and dashed out of the theater twice. It was even worse than she\u2019d expected. Special effects being what they were, little was left to the imagination.</p><p>Barbie knew very well that Mark had planned this. He\u2019d guessed\u2014and guessed right\u2014that she\u2019d hate a movie like The Axman Cometh and had intentionally subjected her to an hour and a half of disgusting violence. The more she thought about it, the more irritated she became. And yet, she was determined to prove she could take it. Even if she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>After her second escape, when she\u2019d hurried into the foyer to avoid watching another horrific scene, Mark leaned toward her and asked, \u201cAre you going to finish that popcorn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you possibly eat?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>His grin seemed boyish as he reached for her bag and helped himself to a huge handful. Oh, yes, she thought grimly, he was enjoying her discomfort.</p><p>The movie wasn\u2019t actually all that long but it seemed to drag on for hours and hours and hours. The music, the tension, the blood, the stupidity was simply too much. By the time the movie ended, Barbie felt drained. The lights came up and the twenty or so viewers filed out of the theater. Mark stayed put and so did Barbie.</p><p>Finally she turned to him. \u201cYou did that on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>Barbie wasn\u2019t fooled. She also decided that if this was a test, she\u2019d failed. He knew she wanted to be with him, and because of that she\u2019d endure this...this torture. She began to wonder if Tessa and her family had it all wrong. Maybe Mark wasn\u2019t attracted to her. Maybe he was just trying to punish her. Barbie began to mistrust her own intuition, her certainty that he reciprocated her interest. If he meant to signal that he didn\u2019t want her to bother him again, perhaps she should listen.</p><p>Fine. She would.</p><p>Barbie stood and, without another word, walked out of the theater.</p><p>Tessa, who\u2019d been busy both times she\u2019d fled into the lobby, was waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d the girl asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if I ever see your uncle again,\u201d Barbie said flatly.</p><p>Tessa\u2019s mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou heard me. He\u2019s rude and arrogant and...and...\u201d She tried to think of a word that adequately described him. \u201cMean,\u201d she concluded. Making her sit through that debacle of a movie was downright mean.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Tessa demanded, trotting alongside her.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to say anything. I got the message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Tessa pleaded. \u201cMy mom and grandma are gonna bug me if I don\u2019t tell them what happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me put it succinctly. Mark isn\u2019t interested. Period. If you think he is, then you and your family are sadly mistaken.\u201d Hearing his wheelchair behind her, Barbie whirled around to face him, ignoring the curious bystanders arriving for the next movie. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Mark?\u201d</p><p>Mark was silent.</p><p>\u201cYou like her, don\u2019t you, Uncle Mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see a movie,\u201d he responded, his voice impassive. \u201cIf I wanted to find my perfect match, I would\u2019ve gone online. She is right. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>Barbie tossed the girl an I-told-you-so look and stalked out. She was all the way to the exit when Mark called her name.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked angrily. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she told him before he could say a word. \u201cI won\u2019t make the mistake of sitting next to you again\u2014at any movie.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, then shrugged as if it made no difference to him. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Over the years, Barbie had come to hate that word and its connotation of teenage apathy. With as much dignity as she could gather, she continued toward the parking lot.</p><p>She was surprised when Tessa ran out of the building after her. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cHow would he know you hated scary movies? He just wanted to find out if you\u2019d be willing to see something besides a romantic comedy. The least you can do is give him another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you trying so hard?\u201d Barbie asked. She was willing to accept that she\u2019d made a mistake and move on. As attractive as she found Mark, she wasn\u2019t going to invite his rejection over and over again.</p><p>\u201cYou have to give him another chance,\u201d Tessa said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Tessa paused, then answered on a heavy sigh. \u201cBecause my uncle Mark deserves to be loved.\u201d Her eyes pleaded with Barbie\u2019s. \u201cThis is new to him. He married his high school girlfriend and never loved anyone else and then she dumped him after the accident....\u201d She gulped in a breath. \u201cI\u2019m positive he likes you\u2014only he doesn\u2019t know how to show it.\u201d</p><p>Barbie hesitated. If anything about this entire evening astonished her, it was that Mark hadn\u2019t come outside and insisted his niece mind her own business. Delving inside her purse, she searched for a business card. \u201cOkay, fine. Give him this and tell him the next move is his.\u201d</p><p>Tessa\u2019s face shone with eagerness as she nodded. \u201cGreat! Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. You won\u2019t be sorry, I promise.\u201d</p><p>That remained to be seen.</p><p>Feeling wretched, Barbie did what she always did when she needed solace\u2014she drove to her mother\u2019s house.</p><p>Lillie opened the door and immediately asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Without delay she led her into the kitchen. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the boys, is it?\u201d</p><p>Barbie swallowed hard and shook her head.</p> <p>Hands on her hips, Lillie stood in the middle of her beautiful, gleaming kitchen. \u201cShould I put on coffee or bring out the shot glasses?\u201d</p><p>Barbie managed to smile. \u201cThis time I think I need both.\u201d</p><p>Lillie took a whiskey bottle from the small liquor cabinet in the kitchen, then started a pot of coffee. That involved first grinding beans, a production Barbie lacked the patience to bother with.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me what happened,\u201d Lillie said when she\u2019d made two Irish coffees. She sat on the stool at the counter next to Barbie and they silently toasted each other with the mugs.</p><p>\u201cI saw Mark again.\u201d</p><p>Her mother nodded. \u201cThe man you met at the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hadn\u2019t told Lillie much about him, and with good reason. As soon as her mother learned he was in a wheelchair, she\u2019d find a dozen reasons to dissuade her from pursuing him.</p><p>Barbie already knew a relationship with Mark wouldn\u2019t be easy. She\u2019d done her homework. All right, she\u2019d looked up a few facts about paraplegics on the Internet. Even his anger with the world wasn\u2019t unusual. Until this evening, she\u2019d assumed she was prepared to deal with it. Apparently not.</p><p>Lillie gestured for Barbie to continue. \u201cAnd...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he...he isn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>Lillie cast her a look of disbelief. \u201cThat can\u2019t be true. You\u2019re gorgeous, young, accomplished\u2014and a lovely person. Is something wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d A half truth.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mother, he\u2019s not gay. Or married.\u201d Barbie wondered how much more she should explain.</p><p>Lillie studied her and raised one elegantly curved eyebrow. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>Barbie should\u2019ve known her mother would see straight through her prevarication.</p><p>Lillie\u2019s voice grew gentler. \u201cWhat is it, honey?\u201d</p><p>Barbie sighed. \u201cIf I tell you, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll discourage me, and I don\u2019t think I could bear that just now.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment her mother didn\u2019t respond. \u201cIt\u2019s odd you should say that, seeing I have something I wanted to discuss with you and...and haven\u2019t, for the very same reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Barbie\u2019s curiosity was instantly piqued. She couldn\u2019t imagine her mother keeping anything from her. They were each other\u2019s support system, especially since David and Gary had died. But then, she\u2019d never supposed she\u2019d ever hide secrets from Lillie, either. Obviously they were both guilty of deception.</p><p>Lillie cleared her throat. \u201cI...I recently met someone myself.\u201d</p><p>Barbie was stunned. \u201cYou haven\u2019t said a word.\u201d</p><p>Her mother avoided eye contact. \u201cI\u2019m afraid if I mention...my friend, you\u2019ll discourage me.\u201d She picked up her coffee and took a deep swallow. \u201cThis man I met\u2014I believe we\u2019re both afraid of what others will think,\u201d she added. \u201cJacqueline urged me to ask him out, since he seems reluctant to approach me. But women of my generation don\u2019t do things like that. Yet I find the idea so appealing, I\u2019m willing to put aside everything I\u2019ve had ingrained in me all these years just for the opportunity to spend time with him again.\u201d</p><p>Lillie\u2019s cheeks were flushed and her hands trembled slightly as she raised the mug to her lips. It might\u2019ve been the whiskey, but Barbie doubted that. There was more to this. Her mother was the most competent, composed woman she\u2019d ever known and her being so flustered and unnerved over a man was completely out of character.</p><p>\u201cMom, you don\u2019t need to worry what I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do. You\u2019re my daughter and, well...okay, I\u2019m just going to blurt it out.\u201d Lillie straightened her shoulders. \u201cHe\u2019s the service manager at the car dealership.\u201d</p><p>Barbie couldn\u2019t help it; her jaw dropped. Her mother was attracted to a mechanic\u2014a man with grease under his fingernails? Lillie Higgins, society matron, and a mechanic? Instantly warnings rose in her mind. This man must know that her mother had money. Lillie was lonely and vulnerable, easy prey. Her usual common sense had evidently deserted her, and she needed protection from this gigolo or whatever he was.</p><p>Barbie saw that her mother was waiting for her reaction, so she said, \u201cI...see.\u201d</p><p>Lillie downed the last of her Irish coffee. \u201cHis name is Hector Silva.\u201d</p><p>This was as shocking as the fact that he was a mechanic. \u201cHe\u2019s Hispanic? Is he legal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Of course! Hector\u2019s a citizen. He\u2019s decent and hardworking and kind.\u201d She hiccuped once, then covered her face. \u201cThis is even worse than I thought it would be,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom, really, I apologize. That was a stupid question. It\u2019s just...I don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d She\u2019d assumed her mother couldn\u2019t surprise her; she\u2019d assumed wrong. Of all the men who\u2019d love to date her mother, Lillie had fallen for a mechanic?</p><p>Lillie dropped her hands. \u201cI believe I know what you\u2019re trying to say,\u201d she said in a cold voice. \u201cAnd I\u2019m disappointed in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Barbie mumbled. But the image of her mother with this man refused to take shape in her mind.</p><p>Her mother motioned toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what the problem is with this Mark. Why you didn\u2019t want to say anything. Is he too old? Too young? Some kind of addict?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of those.\u201d Like her mother, she squared her shoulders and expelled her secret in a single breath. \u201cHe\u2019s paralyzed from the waist down.\u201d</p><p>Lillie closed her eyes briefly. \u201cOh, Barbie.\u201d</p><p>It was just as she\u2019d expected. Annoyed, she slid off the stool. \u201cI knew it! I should\u2019ve realized you\u2019d react like this. I wish I hadn\u2019t said anything.\u201d Her annoyance turned to disillusionment and then just as quickly to pain. \u201cYou\u2019re the one person in the world I trust to understand me and all you can say is Oh, Barbie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t exactly a great encouragement to me, either,\u201d Lillie muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. A mechanic? You want to ask a mechanic out for a date and you expect me to cheer?\u201d All the frustration and anger of the evening burst from her. She stood with her hands knotted into fists at her sides. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell Jacqueline who this man is, did you? What\u2019s the appeal? Do you think he\u2019ll be good in bed? Is that it?\u201d Her own words shocked her, but not nearly as much as they did her mother.</p><p>Lillie stood frozen, her eyes wide with horror. Then she did something she\u2019d never done in her whole life.</p><p>She slapped her.</p><p>Stunned into silence, Barbie pressed her hand to her cheek. Tears sprang to her eyes.</p><p>When her mother spoke, her voice shook with fury. \u201cAt least Hector could take me to bed.\u201d</p><p>Barbie gasped at the implication, grabbed her purse and shot out of the house. Over the years they\u2019d quarreled\u2014every mother and daughter did\u2014but never anything like this.</p><p>A sick feeling engulfed her as she drove to her own house, less than two miles away. Pulling into the garage, she sat in her car and hid her face in both hands. The urge to break into heaving sobs of rage and pain and regret nearly overwhelmed her. But she refused to give in to the swell of grief, refused to allow the ugliness that had come between them to disintegrate her emotions any further.</p><p>Barbie didn\u2019t sleep that night or the next.</p><p>Nor did she speak to her mother. Ten times at least she reached for the phone. Normally they spoke every day, often more than once. Now the silence was like a vast emptiness.</p><p>As far as Barbie was concerned, her mother owed her an apology. Lillie had struck her\u2014her own daughter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the end of the second day, Barbie could hardly stand it. She missed her mother. She needed her.</p><p>The dinner for the widows\u2019 group was scheduled for Thursday night. Barbie was determined to go, but as Tuesday passed and then Wednesday, that resolve weakened.</p><p>This was ridiculous, she told herself. They\u2019d both been at fault. They\u2019d both said things they regretted. It was time to apologize and put this behind them.</p><p>Late Thursday afternoon, a floral delivery truck parked in front of her dress shop just as Barbie was about to close for the day. The man carried in a huge floral arrangement from Susannah\u2019s Garden. This had to be a hundred-dollar order. It took up nearly half the counter space.</p> <p>The driver handed her a clipboard, and Barbie signed her name as a rush of relief came over her. She didn\u2019t need to look at the attached card to know her mother had sent the flowers. Like her, Lillie was sorry. She was apologizing, trying to restore what they\u2019d lost. Smiling, Barbie removed the small envelope and opened it.</p><p>She was wrong; Lillie hadn\u2019t sent the flowers.</p><p>Only one word was written on the card.</p><p>Mark.</p><p>Chapter 19</p> <p>Anne Marie and Ellen were both looking forward to dinner at Lillie\u2019s that night. Earlier, Anne Marie had called to ask what she could contribute to the meal.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d her friend had insisted. \u201cJust bring yourselves.\u201d As she replaced the receiver, Anne Marie thought that Lillie didn\u2019t sound like herself. Ever since they\u2019d made their wish lists, Lillie\u2019s spirits had been high. But following their conversation, she wondered if she\u2019d misread Lillie\u2019s feelings. Her voice had been flat, emotionless, devoid of her usual enthusiasm.</p><p>Anne Marie was afraid this dinner might be too much work for her. Later in the day she phoned Lillie again, to make sure everything was all right.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s perfectly fine,\u201d Lillie said, although her tone belied her words. \u201cActually, I\u2019m really enjoying myself. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve cooked for a dinner party.\u201d Anne Marie heard a timer in the distance, and Lillie told her she had to get off the phone.</p><p>Still, Anne Marie wondered. She sensed that something was off, but Lillie obviously wasn\u2019t going to tell her. All she could do was accept her word and hope that if there was a problem, it would soon be resolved.</p><p>The school bus rolled past the shop window and Anne Marie knew Ellen would appear in a few minutes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tonight, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ellen said happily as she bolted into the store. She released one strap and allowed her backpack to slip carelessly over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTonight\u2019s the night,\u201d Anne Marie concurred. Being invited to someone else\u2019s home for dinner seemed to be a new experience for the eight-year-old. Although Ellen had always displayed good manners, Anne Marie reviewed them with her, just to be on the safe side.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t talk with my mouth full or interrupt the conver...conver\u2014\u201d she stumbled over the word \u201c\u2014the conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Anne Marie smiled at her. \u201cYou can bring your knitting if you want.\u201d</p><p>At that suggestion, Ellen raced up the stairs to the apartment as if they were heading out the door that very moment. Such exuberance made Anne Marie smile again.</p><p>They were both making progress with their knitting. Anne Marie\u2019s first official class the day before had gone well. In teaching Ellen, she\u2019d learned more about the basic knit stitch than she\u2019d realized. After school on Tuesday, Anne Marie had taken Ellen to A Good Yarn and allowed her to purchase yarn and needles of her own. Lydia had chatted with Ellen for quite a while; by now, as Lydia said, the two of them were old friends. That evening, after the dinner dishes and Ellen\u2019s homework, they\u2019d sat side by side, helping each other. Anne Marie couldn\u2019t avoid reflecting that this was something she\u2019d never had the chance to do with her stepdaughter. Even as a ten- or eleven-year-old, Melissa had rejected all her attempts to work on projects together, whether it was reading or baking or gathering autumn leaves for a scrapbook. Whatever Anne Marie suggested was deemed \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201cboring.\u201d The memory had produced a sadness she found hard to forget.</p><p>In the knitting class, Anne Marie had learned how to purl and she had about three inches of the lap robe finished. Ellen was half done with the scarf for her grandmother; the girl had a good eye for color and had chosen a soft pink yarn and a peach. The combination was lovely. They were colors Anne Marie would never have thought to put together.</p><p>Lydia had praised her color choice, too, and Ellen glowed with pleasure at the compliment.</p> <p>\u201cAre you bringing your Twenty Wishes binder?\u201d Ellen asked now.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d</p><p>Ellen slipped her knitting into her backpack. \u201cShould I bring my list?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie hesitated, a little worried that Ellen might inadvertently dominate the conversation. \u201cMaybe next time, okay? For tonight I want you to sit and listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Running up the stairs with her backpack, Ellen collected an excited Baxter for his walk, the requisite plastic bag tucked into her jeans\u2019 pocket.</p><p>At four, Steve Handley came into the shop for his shift. Anne Marie didn\u2019t have time to shower, but went upstairs to refresh her makeup. The day was overcast, so she decided to put a forest-green knit vest over her cream-colored long-sleeved blouse.</p><p>Ellen was modeling the new denim skirt Anne Marie had bought her when the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cWant me to answer?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>Anne Marie hesitated. \u201cLet me check who it is first.\u201d She glanced at the phone as Caller ID flashed Melissa\u2019s name and number.</p><p>Instinctively Anne Marie backed away. She still hadn\u2019t recovered from her last conversation with her stepdaughter. Another heart-to-heart might just finish her off.</p><p>The phone rang again and then again. After the fourth ring, voice mail came on. Anne Marie listened to the brief message. Melissa identifed herself, then said, \u201cCall me,\u201d without explaining why.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie?\u201d Ellen spoke tentatively, staring up at her with worried eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, forcing some enthusiasm into her voice. \u201cI thought we had a dinner date. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded eagerly.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>On the short drive to Lillie\u2019s, they sang camp songs. Or rather, Ellen sang. Anne Marie tried to sing and once again her voice sounded as if someone was strangling her. After the first few lines, she stopped and simply listened. Ellen truly was gifted and she loved to sing. After the first song, she immediately started a second one\u2014\u201cThis Little Light of Mine,\u201d a song she told Anne Marie she\u2019d learned in church.</p><p>Which reminded Anne Marie that one thing she hadn\u2019t done was take Ellen to church. It wasn\u2019t part of her normal practice, not that she had anything against religion. Although, at the moment, she didn\u2019t exactly feel God had dealt her a fair hand. Yet she realized that if she was going to maintain the routine Ellen had with Dolores, she should probably be taking her to Sunday-school class.</p><p>Just as Ellen\u2019s song came to an end, Anne Marie pulled up outside Lillie\u2019s house. This was the first time she\u2019d been invited here. She parked in the circular drive, gaping at the sprawling Tudor-style house, which must have seven or eight thousand square feet. The outdoor lighting revealed a sweeping, verdant lawn and, closer to the house itself, an arrangement of flower beds filled with tulips of all colors, daffodils and delicate narcissus.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Anne Marie whispered.</p><p>\u201cDoes Mrs. Higgins live in a castle?\u201d Ellen asked in a hushed voice.</p><p>\u201cIt seems so.\u201d</p><p>Barbie arrived then, pulling into the drive behind them, and they all walked into the house together, followed a moment later by Elise. As soon as Barbie greeted her mother, Anne Marie could tell that something was amiss, although both Barbie and Lillie struggled to hide it. Instead of the usual camaraderie, the teasing and joking, they were stiffly polite with each other.</p><p>They must\u2019ve had an argument or a falling-out. No wonder Lillie had seemed upset.</p><p>Lillie had arranged a small buffet with everything on a sideboard in the formal dining room. The buffet started with a selection of cheeses, olives, brie-stuffed dates and three different salads\u2014a seafood pasta, a Caesar with home-made croutons and a fruit salad. For the entr\u00e9e, Lillie presented them with ricotta-filled chicken breasts and scalloped potatoes.</p><p>Elise shook her head. \u201cMy goodness, Lillie, you must\u2019ve been cooking for days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother is a tremendous cook,\u201d Barbie said quickly.</p><p>Lillie turned to her daughter. \u201cThank you. I enjoy spending time in the kitchen\u2014it takes my mind off other concerns.\u201d</p><p>The comment seemed to be directed at Barbie, whose cheeks flushed as she looked away.</p><p>Anne Marie helped Ellen prepare her plate and then served herself. The five of them assembled around the table, which seated twelve. Anne Marie noticed that Lillie didn\u2019t have much of an appetite; for that matter, neither did Barbie. They barely seemed to touch their meals. Anne Marie, Ellen and Elise, however, savored every bite.</p><p>Conversation was general at first, with everyone asking Ellen about school and which classes she liked best. Reading, spelling and math, she\u2019d answered, providing examples of what she\u2019d recently learned.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of classes, did you sign up for belly dancing?\u201d Anne Marie asked Barbie.</p><p>Barbie jerked her head up, apparently caught unawares. \u201cBelly dancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was one of your wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. No, I haven\u2019t. Not yet at least. I will, though...probably.\u201d She sat straighter in her chair, chasing the food around her plate before she set her fork aside.</p><p>\u201cWhat else is on your list?\u201d Elise asked her.</p><p>Barbie reached down for her purse and withdrew a sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cI started a binder like Anne Marie but left it at home this morning. I have my list here, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left my binder at home, too. At Anne Marie\u2019s house,\u201d Ellen said in a comforting voice as if to reassure Lillie\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I thought skinny-dipping would be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that would be fun, too,\u201d Anne Marie murmured. She\u2019d forgotten all about it until now.</p><p>Ellen tugged at her sleeve and when Anne Marie bent close, the girl whispered, \u201cIs skinny-dipping a new diet? Grandma Dolores talked a lot about diets.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, something like that.\u201d</p><p>For the first time that evening a smile tweaked the edges of Barbie\u2019s mouth. \u201cI am going to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Elise asked as she and Lillie entered the dining room with dessert\u2014platters of brownies, cookies and tarts.</p><p>\u201cSkinny-dipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbie!\u201d her mother gasped.</p><p>\u201cAt night, Mother. In what you\u2019d call a controlled environment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the moonlight,\u201d Elise added softly. \u201cMaverick and I\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly and her face turned bright pink.</p><p>\u201cYou and Maverick went skinny-dipping?\u201d Barbie asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was years ago....\u201d She paused. \u201cWell, to be honest, it happened shortly after we reunited.\u201d Elise shook her head fondly. \u201cThat man was full of crazy ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you loved him so much,\u201d Barbie whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, I did, I did. I regret all the years we wasted. Maverick wouldn\u2019t let me talk about my regrets, though. He said we had to make up for lost time and we did everything in our power to squeeze thirty years of life into three.\u201d The expression on her face showed both happiness and loss and was almost painful to watch.</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s eyes filled with tears, and she stared down at her binder. \u201cWhat about you, Lillie?\u201d she asked, wanting to draw attention away from Elise so the older woman could compose herself.</p> <p>\u201cYou first,\u201d Lillie insisted, offering Ellen some dessert. The girl studied the platter carefully and chose a blueberry tart.</p><p>Anne Marie smiled, then glanced down at her binder again. The sheet she\u2019d turned to had a picture of the Eiffel Tower. \u201cI want to go to Paris with someone I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so nice,\u201d Barbie murmured.</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t mention that this was one of Robert\u2019s promises. She\u2019d felt the lure of France, of Paris in particular, from her high school days, when she\u2019d taken two years of French. Robert had spun wonderful stories of the adventures they\u2019d have...someday. It was always in the future, always around the corner. Next month. Next season. Next year. And whenever they made tentative plans, his job interfered.</p><p>She tried to dismiss the thought. Her life was her own now and if there was happiness to be found, it was up to her to seek it. She couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, rely on anyone else ever again.</p> <p>Because she\u2019d loved and supported her husband, Anne Marie had never complained. Now it became clear that she\u2019d lived her entire marriage based on tomorrow\u2014on well-intentioned promises, directed toward the future.</p><p>\u201cI believe you talked about that one before,\u201d Elise reminded her. \u201cIt must be important to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s stopping you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go alone.\u201d</p><p>Ever practical, Elise said, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s not just about seeing Paris. It\u2019s also about falling in love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true. I want to be in love again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Lillie said quietly. Her gaze drifted down the table to her daughter.</p><p>Anne Marie was shocked to see tears glistening in Lillie\u2019s eyes. \u201cI have Twenty Wishes but only one is important,\u201d Lillie said next. \u201cNone of the others means a thing without the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Elise asked. \u201cAs if I can\u2019t guess.\u201d</p><p>Lillie smiled briefly at Elise\u2019s remark. \u201cI want to fall in love again,\u201d she said, \u201cwith a man who\u2019s honorable. A man respected by his peers. A man of principle who values me as a woman...A man who\u2019ll be my friend as well as my lover.\u201d A tear rolled down the side of her face. \u201cI have lived most of my life trying to please others. I don\u2019t think I can do that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor should you,\u201d Barbie said. \u201cYou deserve to find that man, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Lillie\u2019s voice shook. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Then to everyone\u2019s astonishment, Barbie burst into tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mom, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>Lillie pushed back her chair and a moment later, mother and daughter were hugging each other, weeping together.</p><p>Anne Marie looked at Elise, who shrugged. Once again Ellen tugged at the cuff of her blouse. \u201cWhy are they crying?\u201d she asked in a loud whisper, leaning toward Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they be okay?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie placed her arm around Ellen\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI think so,\u201d she said.</p><p>As quickly as Lillie and Barbie had burst into tears, they started to laugh, dabbing their eyes with the linen napkins, smearing their mascara and giggling like teenagers.</p><p>Ellen began to giggle, too. Soon Elise joined in. After a while she got up and carried her dinner dishes into the kitchen and set them on the counter.</p><p>Anne Marie collected her plates and Ellen\u2019s and did the same thing. This evening had been cathartic for all of them in some way. Except for Ellen, but Anne Marie knew the experience had been valuable for her, too.</p><p>Before she left she picked up her binder and as she shut it, her gaze fell on the Paris postcard she\u2019d glued next to the cut-out picture of the Eiffel Tower.</p><p>One day she would go to Paris\u2014and she wouldn\u2019t go alone. Because the love of her life would be with her.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>When the official-looking woman in the no-nonsense suit walked into Blossom Street Books, Anne Marie knew she was the same one who\u2019d called earlier in the day. She\u2019d introduced herself as Evelyn Boyle, a social worker from Washington State Child Protective Services. She\u2019d sounded calm, professional and reassuring; otherwise Anne Marie might have been alarmed. She had the paperwork Dolores Falk had given her before the surgery, and Ellen and Anne Marie spoke with Dolores frequently.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand why a social worker was involved now. In a few days, Dolores would be released from the care facility and Ellen would return to her. If the state was concerned about Ellen, it was too little, too late.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Ms. Boyle,\u201d Anne Marie said as she stepped around the counter. Thankfully Theresa, who worked Friday afternoons, had arrived a few minutes earlier.</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be Anne Marie.\u201d The social worker came forward and thrust out her hand. \u201cPlease call me Evelyn.\u201d</p><p>Despite the woman\u2019s tranquil demeanor, Anne Marie was nervous.</p><p>\u201cIs there someplace private where we could visit?\u201d Evelyn asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Anne Marie momentarily left her and walked over to Theresa, who eyed her speculatively.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Theresa whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she whispered back. In slightly louder tones, she added, \u201cI\u2019ll be upstairs if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Theresa nodded.</p><p>Anne Marie led Evelyn up the narrow stairway to the apartment. Now that Ellen was more comfortable living with Anne Marie, she\u2019d left a pair of rubber boots on the steps. Anne Marie grabbed them on her way up the stairs.</p><p>Baxter stood there waiting for her, tail wagging wildly. He cocked his head to one side, as though curious about her unexpected appearance. After she\u2019d paid Baxter the required amount of attention, he sniffed the social worker\u2019s shoes, then returned to his bed in a corner of the kitchen.</p><p>Without asking, Anne Marie walked to the stove and put on water for tea. Evelyn pulled out a chair at the table, then set her briefcase on it and withdrew a yellow legal pad.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know Ellen was staying with me?\u201d Anne Marie asked. She assumed Dolores hadn\u2019t told Social Services, which meant it was either the hospital or someone from Woodrow Wilson Elementary, probably Helen Mayer.</p><p>\u201cI received a call from Ellen\u2019s school,\u201d Evelyn said, confirming Anne Marie\u2019s guess as she dug around the bottom of her purse for a pen.</p><p>Anne Marie stood with her back to the kitchen counter, hands behind her. \u201cEllen\u2019s grandmother wrote a statement that gives me full guardianship of Ellen while Dolores is recuperating.\u201d How legally binding that scribbled, almost illegible document was remained uncertain. Considering how desperate the poor woman had been for someone, anyone, to look after Ellen, she would\u2019ve signed the girl\u2019s care over to practically anyone.</p><p>\u201cI gather you were originally supposed to have Ellen for only a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Anne Marie wanted to say more but restrained herself. In instances such as this, the less said the better. \u201cDolores made me promise Ellen wouldn\u2019t go into a foster home.\u201d</p><p>Evelyn Boyle glanced up. \u201cThere are many excellent foster homes in this area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut in essence, Anne Marie, Ellen is already in one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m someone Ellen knows and trusts,\u201d Anne Marie said quickly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. It\u2019s exactly what I mean. You are her foster mother.\u201d Evelyn waited a moment. \u201cI do understand the situation correctly, don\u2019t I? You and Ellen are not related in any way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d she responded. But the question hovered in the air, swirling up doubts and fears.</p><p>The teakettle\u2019s whistle offered a welcome respite. Anne Marie concentrated on pouring water into the pot. She covered it with a cozy and set it in the middle of the table to steep while she got two matching cups and saucers.</p><p>Her good dishes were packed away in the storage unit, and the apartment cupboard was filled with mismatched place settings. It had never bothered her before, but it did now. Logically she knew that Social Services wouldn\u2019t pull Ellen from her care because her dishes didn\u2019t match. Still, Anne Marie discovered that she didn\u2019t want to take any chances.</p><p>She poured two mugs of tea, hating the way her hand trembled.</p><p>\u201cI should tell you I stopped by the school before I drove over here.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie couldn\u2019t decide if that was reassuring or not. \u201cDid you speak to Ellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Evelyn said as she reached for the sugar bowl and added a heaping teaspoon. \u201cShe had nothing but wonderful things to say about you. She told me about your visits to her grandmother and how you\u2019ve bought her several pieces of clothing. Have you been to the house recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice,\u201d Anne Marie replied. \u201cEllen needed some of her stuff, and I told Dolores I\u2019d check on the place for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension seeped away.</p><p>Evelyn raised her cup. \u201cIs it true you taught Ellen to knit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we sort of taught each other. Ellen\u2019s knitting a scarf for her grandmother and I\u2019ve started a lap robe. The various colors don\u2019t match and Dolores won\u2019t be able to wear one near the other. Mine\u2019s a shade of lavender and Ellen went with a peach and pink combination. It\u2019s really lovely. I mean, who would\u2019ve guessed...well, I suppose that isn\u2019t important.\u201d Anne Marie knew she was rambling and forced herself to stop. And yet, she couldn\u2019t resist bragging about Ellen\u2019s accomplishments.</p><p>Pushing back her chair, she hurried into the other room and got Ellen\u2019s scarf, still on the needles. \u201cLook how even her stitches are,\u201d she said, displaying the child\u2019s efforts. \u201cMy own aren\u2019t half as neat. Ellen loves to knit and she\u2019s already taught three of her friends. Her teacher was so impressed she thought it might be a good idea for the whole class to learn.\u201d</p><p>Evelyn nodded approvingly. \u201cEllen\u2019s teacher mentioned that to me. She said knitting will help the children with math concepts and learning patience. It\u2019ll also give them a sense of achievement. I think it\u2019s a terrific idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Anne Marie couldn\u2019t hold back a smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen I spoke to Ellen, she also told me something about Twenty Wishes. What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...oh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to Ellen. She has a book she drags to and from school in her backpack.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t realize Ellen brought it with her. \u201cShe does?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom what I understand, half the class is making lists as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d Anne Marie took a sip of her tea. \u201cA group of my friends and I decided it would be fun, that\u2019s all.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to explain anything beyond that; it was too complicated and too private.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d Evelyn said, her enthusiasm unmistakable.</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s gaze shot toward the other woman. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes. In fact, I immediately started thinking about what I\u2019d put on my own list.\u201d</p> <p>Anne Marie relaxed a little.</p><p>\u201cWhen I spoke to Ms. Peterski, she said there\u2019s been a marked improvement in Ellen in the last three weeks. Her grades have always been good but she had problems in other areas. Her social skills have vastly improved and she\u2019s making new friends and reaching out to others.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded. Although she had no personal reason to feel such overwhelming pride, it was difficult not to.</p><p>\u201cEllen is happy, too. This arrangement has obviously worked out well,\u201d the social worker said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an easy child,\u201d Anne Marie told her. True, it had taken them a few days to find their footing, but they\u2019d adjusted to living together with surprisingly few problems.</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s done very well,\u201d Evelyn murmured.</p> <p>\u201cDid Ellen tell you she taught Baxter\u2014my dog\u2014to roll over?\u201d Anne Marie asked. Ellen had worked with the dog for weeks and had only recently accomplished that goal.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, she did,\u201d Evelyn said with a glance at Baxter, who snored softly in the corner.</p><p>\u201cI believe I mentioned that I spoke to the staff at the nursing facility where Dolores Falk is currently residing, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Evelyn continued.</p><p>In her nervousness, Anne Marie didn\u2019t recall. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Dolores tells me she\u2019s recovering nicely. She said she\u2019d be released sometime next week. Wednesday, she thought.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Boyle hesitated before responding. \u201cI understand Mrs. Falk is making excellent progress. She confirmed that you and Ellen visit frequently. And she waits every day for that brief telephone chat with her granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe see Dolores as often as we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, and I applaud your conscientiousness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree to four times a week,\u201d she added. She made the effort to fit those visits into her schedule because she appreciated how important it was for Ellen\u2014and, of course, Dolores.</p> <p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m doing my best.\u201d</p><p>Evelyn sipped her tea. \u201cI can see that, and the proof is in Ellen. Her teacher\u2019s delighted. Ms. Mayer, the school counselor, sang your praises, too.\u201d</p><p>This conversation wasn\u2019t nearly as difficult as Anne Marie had feared it would be. She was beginning to relax.</p><p>\u201cGetting back to Mrs. Falk...\u201d The words hung in the air like an unanswered question.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Anne Marie put down her cup.</p><p>\u201cDid I hear you say she\u2019s going to be released next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Ellen and I were by on Wednesday after school and Dolores said she\u2019d talked to one of the nurses about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s wishful thinking on Mrs. Falk\u2019s part,\u201d Evelyn Boyle said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke with the doctor\u2019s office as well as the head nurse.\u201d</p><p>A chill raced down Anne Marie\u2019s spine. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be all right, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Evelyn assured her. \u201cThe healing process is coming along well. But don\u2019t forget she had major heart surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Fortunately there didn\u2019t seem to be any significant complications.</p><p>\u201cHowever...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there problems with her recovery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Boyle\u2019s hand lingered on her cup and she ran her index finger along the rim. \u201cUnfortunately it will be some weeks before she\u2019ll be able to return to her own home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeeks?\u201d Anne Marie repeated. This was a shock and she knew Ellen would be terribly disappointed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...many weeks?\u201d Anne Marie asked, wondering how she\u2019d explain this to Ellen. \u201cCan you tell me how much longer it\u2019ll be before Dolores can go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a physician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the doctor say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was told,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you mean an additional two weeks, right?\u201d Anne Marie exhaled slowly.</p><p>\u201cYes. Are you okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. I\u2019m just afraid this is going to be upsetting for Ellen. The child loves her grandmother very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen\u2019s been marking off the days until she can move back in with Dolores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand this will be a setback for the child. I also understand that it\u2019s far and above what you agreed to when Ellen came to stay with you,\u201d Evelyn said. \u201cIf you feel it\u2019s too much, I could probably find a temporary home for Ellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would upset her even more,\u201d Anne Marie said, dismissing the offer out of hand. \u201cIt was difficult enough for Ellen to be separated from her grandmother. Placing her in another completely foreign environment would be doubly traumatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u201d</p><p>At least they saw eye to eye on that, Anne Marie thought with relief.</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t mind keeping Ellen for another two weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Any other option wasn\u2019t worth considering.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019d like to leave some forms for you to complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of forms?\u201d Anne Marie didn\u2019t like the sound of this.</p><p>Evelyn Boyle took a sheaf of papers out of her briefcase. \u201cSince Ellen\u2019s been with you for more than two weeks already and is likely to remain for an additional two, I\u2019d like you to apply for your license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy license for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be Ellen\u2019s foster parent,\u201d she said as if this was perfectly logical.</p><p>An automatic objection rose in her throat, but Anne Marie bit down on her tongue rather than argue. The best thing to do was to appear compliant. However, she had no intention of becoming a foster parent. What was the point? By the time she finished applying, Ellen would be back with her grandmother and it would be irrelevant.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Anne Marie said, accepting the papers.</p><p>She stood and took the teapot and cups to the sink. \u201cI appreciate your coming by,\u201d she said, since the interview was clearly over.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Baxter got up from his dog bed and walked them to the stairs, as though that was one of his prescribed duties. He stood silently at the top while the two women climbed down.</p><p>Anne Marie was saying goodbye to the social worker when she noticed a lone figure in the overstuffed chair, her head drooping, hair half-covering her face. The woman appeared to be asleep. Anne Marie glanced at her again, and suddenly realized who she was.</p><p>Her stepdaughter, Melissa Roche.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>As if aware of Anne Marie\u2019s scrutiny, Melissa opened her eyes and sat up, looking self-consciously around. Anne Marie wished now that she\u2019d returned her phone call. Even from a distance, she could see that Melissa was in distress.</p><p>For the moment she ignored her and accompanied Evelyn Boyle to the door. She thanked her for the visit and agreed to read over the paperwork\u2014and read it was all Anne Marie intended to do. Evelyn obviously didn\u2019t want to remove Ellen from her temporary custody any more than Anne Marie wanted to let the child go.</p><p>She had to admit she felt ambivalent about this latest information concerning Dolores. On the one hand, she knew Ellen would be disappointed; on the other hand, she herself wasn\u2019t unhappy about the girl\u2019s extended stay.</p><p>By the time Evelyn Boyle had gone and Anne Marie turned back to the shop, Melissa was standing uncertainly beside the chair. She seemed to be waiting for Anne Marie.</p><p>Anne Marie spoke with Theresa for a few minutes about some special orders, then walked toward her stepdaughter. \u201cHello, Melissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t return my phone call. I left a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was out last night. I didn\u2019t get in until late.\u201d</p><p>Melissa seemed confused. \u201cYou\u2019re not dating anyone, are you?\u201d</p><p>Why would she ask that question again? Anne Marie couldn\u2019t even think about another relationship so soon after losing Robert. \u201cNo. I was with a group of women friends, although that isn\u2019t really any of your concern,\u201d she said brusquely. \u201cI intended to call back this evening.\u201d Actually, Melissa had phoned more than once. Caller ID had shown three calls, all from her stepdaughter, although she\u2019d left only the one message.</p><p>\u201cCould I buy you lunch?\u201d Melissa asked in a surprisingly tentative voice.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but I\u2019ve already eaten.\u201d</p><p>Melissa blinked as if she hadn\u2019t expected that despite the fact that it was nearly two in the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, I\u2019m not eager to visit another restaurant with you.\u201d</p><p>Melissa blanched. \u201cI said I was sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded. \u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am, I really am! Sometimes I do stupid stuff. I don\u2019t know why I thought I should tell you what I saw. Brandon about bit my head off. He said\u2014well, never mind.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie could see this wasn\u2019t going to be a quick visit, so she motioned for Melissa to sit down again, then took the chair next to hers. The shop wasn\u2019t busy and Theresa was handling what business there was without a problem.</p><p>The two women sat silently for several seconds. Anne Marie was determined not to speak first. After all, Melissa had sought her out. She was the one with the agenda and frankly, Anne Marie was curious as to what it might be.</p><p>\u201cBrandon said he came by a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cHe said there\u2019s a child living with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a temporary situation.\u201d</p><p>Melissa acknowledged the comment with a slight nod. \u201cHe said that, too, and that\u2014Allie, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that Ellen\u2019s a real sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d Anne Marie wished Melissa would get to the point. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure you aren\u2019t here to discuss my child-care activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her stepdaughter agreed, fidgeting nervously with her hands. \u201cDid Brandon tell you Mom and I aren\u2019t getting along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom\u2019s really upset with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any particular reason?\u201d</p><p>She responded with a shrug. \u201cSeveral, actually. For one thing, it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019ll be able to graduate on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa!\u201d Anne Marie couldn\u2019t help the gasp of shock. Robert had bragged about Melissa\u2019s making the Dean\u2019s list; Anne Marie doubted that the problem, whatever it was, had anything to do with her grades.</p> <p>\u201cI...I dropped out of school.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cBut...why?\u201d she asked incredulously.</p><p>Melissa didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Anne Marie saw that the younger woman\u2019s eyes had filled with tears. Gazing down at her hands, Melissa murmured something Anne Marie couldn\u2019t quite hear.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>Melissa raised her chin. She inhaled and then said more loudly, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie sagged against the back of the chair. \u201cPregnant,\u201d she repeated, doing her best to hide her stunned surprise.</p><p>\u201cMom is furious with me.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie could well imagine. Pamela had big plans for her daughter. Melissa\u2019s career path had been paved very nicely by her mother, who worked in upper management for an international chain of hotels based in London. According to Brandon, Pamela had secured a middle management position for Melissa as soon as she received her MBA. With the position came the opportunity to live in England.</p><p>\u201cShe wants me to get rid of it\u2014that\u2019s how she put it. To have an abortion.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie hardly knew what to say. She couldn\u2019t believe Pamela wanted to \u201cget rid of\u201d her first grandchild. Robert would\u2019ve been horrified by that, she thought.</p> <p>\u201cThe baby is your boyfriend\u2019s? Michael\u2019s?\u201d Anne Marie asked as she tried to sort through her own emotions.</p><p>Melissa nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he want you to do?\u201d</p><p>Melissa closed her eyes. \u201cI...I haven\u2019t told him yet.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, Anne Marie clasped Melissa\u2019s hand.</p><p>Sobbing, her stepdaughter held on tightly. \u201cI broke up with him.\u201d</p><p>In her fear and panic, Melissa suddenly seemed very young to Anne Marie. \u201cMichael has a right to know,\u201d she whispered gently.</p><p>Melissa sniffed piteously. \u201cI realize that, and I will tell him. It\u2019s just that...Everything\u2019s so messed up, and I\u2019m not sure what to do. I didn\u2019t tell him because I was afraid he\u2019d try to influence me one way or the other, and I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you broke off the relationship?\u201d</p><p>Melissa bit her lip. \u201cStupid, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Uncertain how to respond, Anne Marie squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never missed my dad more than I do right now. I\u2019m so confused, and my mother\u2019s so angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she say?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cShe e-mails me two and three times a day with what she calls advice, except it reads more like a court order. I made a mistake, according to Mom, but that mistake doesn\u2019t need to screw up the rest of my life. She told me to make an appointment at one of those clinics and terminate the pregnancy before it\u2019s too late. She said if I lose this chance to work in England, I\u2019ll always regret it\u2014that I\u2019ll never get a chance like this again.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie had to struggle to keep from saying what she thought of that advice.</p><p>\u201cShe made it sound like I wouldn\u2019t regret making a hasty decision about my baby. I don\u2019t think I can do it, Anne Marie.\u201d The tears made wet tracks down her pale cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered, still clutching Anne Marie\u2019s hand. \u201cThe thing is, I talked to a lady at the Pregnancy Crisis Clinic, and there are a lot more options than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should explore all your options before you make such an important decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d Melissa sobbed. \u201cI only have a few more days while it\u2019s still legal to have an abortion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far along are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver three months.\u201d She pulled her hand free and scrabbled in her purse for a tissue. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t believe I could possibly be pregnant. I mean, I\u2019ve never had regular periods, anyway, and there wasn\u2019t any reason to...to think I might be. Michael and I used protection and, well, apparently it wasn\u2019t a hundred percent effective, because here I am.\u201d She gestured weakly, then wiped her nose.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been to a doctor?\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cNot yet. But a technician at the pregnancy clinic did an ultrasound and I actually saw my baby move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to your friends? Or Brandon?\u201d</p><p>Melissa shook her head. \u201cNo one knows, other than you and my mother. I just couldn\u2019t face anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Anne Marie asked, wondering why Melissa had turned to her. But the reasons for her stepdaughter\u2019s change of heart didn\u2019t matter, Anne Marie told herself. She would do whatever she could.</p><p>\u201cI need...I need someone who can help me decide.\u201d</p><p>Melissa had difficulty making decisions; that was clear, since she\u2019d made a number of spectacularly bad ones. But perhaps some of them could be reversed.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Anne Marie began, taking a deep breath. \u201cFirst, I don\u2019t see that there\u2019s any reason to drop out of school, especially this close to graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That was just as stupid as breaking up with Michael, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what you can to get back on course for graduation. Your father would\u2019ve wanted you to complete your education.\u201d</p><p>Melissa nodded; she seemed to appreciate the advice. \u201cSeveral of my professors have asked to talk to me, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my mother?\u201d Melissa asked, looking anxiously at Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cThis is your decision, not hers.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again, as if she needed to be reminded of that. \u201cIf I don\u2019t go to England...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom said I couldn\u2019t have the job unless I aborted the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t mean that,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cThe news shocked her, that\u2019s all.\u201d She remembered Robert confessing that he\u2019d gotten Pamela pregnant before they were married. Apparently she was afraid her daughter would repeat her own mistakes by marrying too young\u2014and in Pamela\u2019s view, marrying the wrong man.</p><p>\u201cI should tell Michael right away, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a good idea.\u201d Anne Marie could see this was something Melissa wanted to do. \u201cThe two of you can talk it over together. Do you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...A friend told me she saw him with someone else.\u201d She paused, tears running unchecked down her face. \u201cIf he loved me, he wouldn\u2019t be dating again so soon, would he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows why men do anything?\u201d Anne Marie asked, hoping to inject a bit of humor into the conversation.</p><p>Melissa responded with a wobbly smile. A moment later, she whispered, \u201cThank you, Anne Marie. I never thought I\u2019d turn to you for anything and now I feel you\u2019re the only person I can talk to.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been a time, a long time, when Anne Marie would\u2019ve done anything to win her stepdaughter\u2019s approval. Little did she realize it would come after Robert\u2019s death.</p><p>They hugged and arranged to meet for lunch the following week. As they broke apart, Anne Marie recognized that Melissa wanted to say something else. She looked away and then back at Anne Marie, her eyes intent.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry about the last time we met\u2014you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded.</p><p>\u201cHave you...?\u201d She didn\u2019t complete the thought, almost as though she was weighing the advisability of even asking.</p><p>\u201cHave I what?\u201d</p><p>Melissa shrugged. \u201cContacted Rebecca? Have you asked her about the...baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Anne Marie kept her voice as flat as possible.</p><p>Her stepdaughter accepted that without further comment. With a wave and a \u201cSee you next week,\u201d she headed for the door.</p><p>Anne Marie waited until Melissa had left the bookstore before she collapsed onto the overstuffed chair and pressed one hand over her eyes. This nightmare that had become her life just wasn\u2019t going away. She was the one who wanted a child.</p><p>Not Rebecca.</p><p>Not Melissa.</p><p>Anne Marie.</p><p>Her longing for a baby had led to her separation from Robert\u2014a desperate attempt to impress on him how serious she was. Not that it had done her any good. Instead, Robert\u2019s personal assistant now had a baby, most likely his, and his daughter had turned to Anne Marie for advice about an unwanted pregnancy.</p><p>But there was no baby for her.</p><p>No love, either.</p><p>She sensed someone at her side and opening her eyes, found Theresa standing there. Her employee rested one hand on Anne Marie\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBad news?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Forcing a smile, Anne Marie shook her head. \u201cThat was Robert\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>Knowing the history between them, Theresa stared at her. \u201cMelissa? Is she okay? Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe...she misses her father.\u201d</p><p>So did Anne Marie, even more than she\u2019d thought possible.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>On Monday evening Barbie purposely stayed away from the movies. It wasn\u2019t easy, but she felt she had no option. Last week she\u2019d left her business card with Tessa; now Barbie felt the next move had to come from him.</p><p>In a way Mark had made the next move by having flowers delivered, although she considered that an indirect, even cowardly approach. The flowers were a lovely gesture, but she\u2019d been looking for more\u2014like an apology or an invitation to meet again. By ordering the floral arrangement he\u2019d managed to communicate his interest, yet keep his pride intact.</p><p>Maybe...the gesture was enough. For the moment.</p><p>She recognized what he was trying to tell her. He\u2019d made a move in this elaborate game of theirs; the next one was hers.</p><p>She knew a little more about him after a Google search. He was an architect with an independent practice and lived in a downtown condo he\u2019d designed himself.</p><p>Barbie felt encouraged by his interest. No, she was ecstatic. Still, she had to restrain herself, not let him have the upper hand. She decided she\u2019d return to the movies again, but not right away.</p><p>Tuesday afternoon, she thought she\u2019d register for the belly dancing class being held at the Seattle Fitness Center. This was her first trip here, and she was surprised to find an Olympic-size pool, along with a huge gymnasium and several activity rooms. As she walked down the hallway to the office, she passed a shop that sold workout clothes, swimsuits and other exercise paraphernalia.</p><p>After filling out the paperwork and paying her fee, Barbie began to leave the building, feeling positive and determined. She was making her wishes come true. Smiling to herself, she rounded the corner and stopped abruptly as a man in a wheelchair moved toward the pool. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mark Bassett.</p><p>Coincidence? Fate? Barbie wasn\u2019t about to question it. Her heart felt as if it had shot all the way up into her throat. Without conscious thought she did an about-face and headed back, toward the shop. Within five minutes, she\u2019d purchased a swimsuit and towel. Gaining entrance to the pool was a bit more difficult; before she was allowed to swim, she had to buy a six-month fitness membership. She slapped her credit card down on the counter, impatient to get into the water before Mark.</p><p>He had to believe this meeting wasn\u2019t staged\u2014which, in truth, it wasn\u2019t. Okay, so her showing up at the pool might be a bit manipulative, but when life presented you with an advantage, you had to grab it with both hands.</p><p>Barbie changed into the swimsuit, a sleek blue one-piece, in the women\u2019s dressing room and walked out as though she was strolling along a Caribbean shore. The suit, thankfully, was a perfect fit. She squared her shoulders and silently thanked her mother for every lesson she\u2019d taken at that expensive charm school.</p> <p>Using the railing, she lowered herself into the water and cringed at the temperature. Her own swimming pool was kept at a comfortable eighty-five degrees. This was eighty, eighty-one maximum, and in her opinion downright cold.</p><p>When she\u2019d entered the pool area, the attendant had explained that this was the adult lap swim. As soon as she got into the water, Barbie realized these noontime swimmers were serious about their workout. They wore goggles and bathing caps, and to her they resembled nothing so much as a bunch of insects with their smooth shiny heads and large round eyes.</p><p>Barbie refused to allow her hair to get wet. She needed to go back to work right afterward, and she couldn\u2019t arrive with dripping hair.</p><p>The minute she broke away from the side of the pool, another swimmer streaked past her, quickly followed by a second. It was quite apparent that no one appreciated her rather lazy form of breaststroke.</p><p>A third swimmer went by, kicking wildly, splashing her face and hair. Barbie swallowed a mouthful of chlorinated water and choked violently. She felt like she was about to cough up her tonsils. So much for making a sophisticated appearance.</p> <p>She muttered a curse, treading water for a moment while she caught her breath. When she could breathe normally again, she wiped the water from her eyes. She\u2019d given up even trying to keep her hair dry.</p><p>As she finally reached the other end of the pool, she saw Mark hanging on to the side, watching her. Clearly her antics were a source of amusement to him. His gaze found hers and he actually smiled.</p><p>Mark had smiled at her!</p><p>Since her hair was already ruined, Barbie stopped worrying about it and started swimming for all she was worth, face fully in the water. Her mascara was probably running, too, but she no longer cared.</p><p>Mark was waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cFancy meeting you here,\u201d she said, hoisting herself up on the side of the pool. She gave him what she hoped was a dazzling smile.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, some coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here often?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEvery day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she lied. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve never run into each other before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day?\u201d He arched his eyebrows in disbelief. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t fooling him, so she might as well own up to the truth.</p><p>\u201cSince today.\u201d</p><p>He not only smiled at that, he laughed. The sound was deep, pleasant to the ear. She had the impression that he hadn\u2019t done a lot of laughing in the last few years.</p> <p>\u201cI come here to swim,\u201d Mark told her. \u201cKeep up if you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re going to have to catch me,\u201d she shouted after him.</p><p>That was a joke if there ever was one.</p><p>Mark took off and with impressive upper body strength sliced through the water. His ease and grace were mesmerizing. Barbie didn\u2019t make the slightest effort to catch up with him. When he\u2019d passed her twice, he stopped, waiting for her in the deep end. By then, Barbie had swum two laps and was too exhausted to swim anymore. Her breath came in shallow gasps. She grabbed the edge of the pool and felt her heart pounding hard against her ribs.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me why you\u2019re really here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBelly dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d He sounded incredulous, and she wondered if he thought she was making fun of him.</p><p>\u201cI signed up for a belly dancing class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the Fitness Center?\u201d</p><p>Propping her elbow on the ledge, Barbie pushed the hair away from her face. \u201cJust as I was leaving, I saw you and had the overwhelming urge to take a dip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a member?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>Almost everyone had left the water. Barbie looked around, astonished to discover that only the two of them were still in the pool. When she glanced back at Mark, she saw him frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Barbie didn\u2019t know how to answer him. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel it?\u201d she asked him instead. Judging by his puzzled expression, he either didn\u2019t understand or didn\u2019t want to, so she continued. \u201cThat first night in the theater...I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re imagining things,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to let him lie to her, let alone himself. The attraction between them was too intense to ignore.</p><p>\u201cI realize you\u2019re not happy about this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ve made that pretty obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I just...can\u2019t.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant to reveal so much, but the words slipped out before she could stop herself. Their eyes met, and she could see the warring emotions inside him.</p><p>Using his free arm, he reached for her and slid his hand behind her neck and then slowly, as if fighting her every inch of the way, he brought his mouth to hers. He gave her ample opportunity to pull back.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>Barbie wanted his kiss, hungered for it. She opened her mouth to welcome him, and then she was crushed in his embrace, arms and legs entwined, mouths joined.</p><p>Their kiss was better than she ever would have dreamed. They abandoned the effort to stay afloat and started to sink. Clinging to each other they sank far below the surface, their mouths straining, searching, devouring.</p><p>By the time they broke the surface again, Barbie was gasping for air. Because his legs were paralyzed, Mark needed to move his arms to remain afloat. All Barbie needed to do was kick her feet.</p><p>The sheer exhilaration of his kiss overwhelmed her. But he didn\u2019t seem to share her enthusiasm. His look was fierce, angry...afraid. He glared at her in much the same way he had the evening they\u2019d first met.</p><p>\u201cThat was wonderful,\u201d she said reverently. It was very different from any sensual experience she\u2019d shared with Gary, and she felt no guilt, no regret. Only gratitude.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cMark?\u201d His name was a soft plea on her lips. She couldn\u2019t bear it if he said or did something to destroy what she\u2019d found to be an intensely moving experience.</p><p>Without speaking he kissed her a second time, and they sank into the clear blue water, wrapped in each other\u2019s arms. After a moment, they bobbed to the surface again.</p><p>Mark released her and Barbie sagged breathlessly against him, her head on his shoulder. It\u2019d been so long since a man had held her or kissed her....</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d he whispered, but even as he spoke the words, he caressed her wet hair. He was braced against the side of the pool and she held on to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant idea! Stop arguing with me.\u201d The sheer joy of being in his arms rang in her voice.</p><p>\u201cBarbie\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shushed him with a kiss. \u201cI mean it. Stop arguing.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again, the sound echoing in the cavernous room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m turning into a prune,\u201d she said, \u201cand I love every second of it and all because I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cEven with wrinkled skin and mascara running down my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you only knew...\u201d Then, seeming to reach some kind of decision, he slowly exhaled. \u201cListen, Barbie, this is all very flattering, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him again, kissing him full on the mouth, using her lips and tongue to steal his very words. After coming this far, she didn\u2019t plan to let him get cold feet and a cold heart now.</p><p>His eyes were still closed when she broke off the kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re letting yourself in for. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tolerate a man making decisions for me. If you think I\u2019m going to allow you to decide what I do and don\u2019t know, then you\u2019re sadly mistaken.\u201d</p><p>The edges of his mouth quivered with the effort of suppressing a smile. \u201cSo you know everything there is to know about my disability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her response. \u201cYou read a few things on the Internet and you think you know it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...okay, I read a few things.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>A flush rose in her cheeks. \u201cMainly, I was interested in how we\u2019ll make love.\u201d</p><p>Mark gasped\u2014or perhaps it was a groan, she couldn\u2019t tell which. \u201cYou\u2019re getting way ahead of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut that\u2019s what I was most curious about.\u201d</p><p>His face somber and apprehensive, he smoothed a wet tendril from her cheek. \u201cI should tell you...I haven\u2019t...since the accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s about time.\u201d Barbie couldn\u2019t believe they were having this conversation. Even more unbelievable was the fact that she could speak so openly and boldly about lovemaking with a man she barely knew.</p><p>Mark held her gaze a long moment. \u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>A smile twitched his lips. \u201cNow, that\u2019s a leading question if I ever heard one.\u201d</p><p>She slapped his shoulder. \u201cWhat I mean is we should probably get to know each other a little better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust we?\u201d he asked with pretended chagrin.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go to bed first and ask questions later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that kind of woman.\u201d Although considering the way he kissed, she might think about converting.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou swim every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d This schedule change was going to take some adjustment. \u201cExcept Monday and Wednesday, when I\u2019ll be in my belly dancing class. Okay, I\u2019ll swim two or three times a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could meet you afterward.\u201d Her staff was going to be putting in a lot of extra hours. That wasn\u2019t a problem; Barbie had been planning to give them more hours, anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d Mark didn\u2019t seem convinced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive and if you ask me once more, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you want to punish me, all you have to do is press that perfect body of yours against mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice to know.\u201d She moved closer and slid her right leg between his thighs. Her breasts brushed his chest as she spread eager kisses along his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you stop now,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThere\u2019s a seniors\u2019 class coming in soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019m thanking you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe flowers you sent.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t have found the courage to confront him this afternoon if he hadn\u2019t made that move.</p><p>Mark went very still. \u201cI didn\u2019t send you flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...the card had your name on it.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something she couldn\u2019t completely hear; she caught the gist of it, though. Mark\u2019s sister or perhaps his mother was responsible for that bouquet.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you didn\u2019t send the flowers,\u201d she confirmed.</p><p>Mark wound his fingers into her hair and dragged her mouth to his. \u201cLet\u2019s just pretend I did.\u201d</p><p>Barbie was more than willing to do exactly that.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Lillie Higgins stared at the phone, then groaned in frustration and turned away. This should be easy. Everyone seemed to think there was nothing to it. But try as she might, Lillie couldn\u2019t make herself call Hector.</p><p>In desperation, not knowing how else to manage this, she\u2019d contacted the dealership instead, with a list of imaginary complaints about her car. The receptionist she spoke with made her an appointment for Thursday morning at ten. By the time she arrived at the service department, her stomach was tied up in knots a sailor couldn\u2019t untangle.</p> <p>A man she didn\u2019t recognize came out to discuss the trouble her car had supposedly been giving her.</p><p>\u201cCould you explain again what the problem is?\u201d he asked, studying his clipboard.</p><p>Lillie had a panicky moment before she remembered what she\u2019d told the receptionist yesterday when she\u2019d made the appointment. \u201cThere seems to be a hesitation....\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing from a full stop?\u201d he asked, glancing up from his notepad.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it. From a full stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often has this happened?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to overplay the situation. \u201cA couple of times.\u201d</p><p>He jotted that down. \u201cJust twice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, more. Four or five times.\u201d Her hands were clammy and her mouth had gone dry and she had the most compelling urge to turn tail and run. If she hadn\u2019t handed her car keys over to the mechanic, she would\u2019ve made an excuse and left before she looked like an even bigger fool.</p><p>He wrote something else on the chart.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t take long, will it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Inside the waiting area, Lillie got a cup of coffee from the machine and picked up that day\u2019s paper. Although she\u2019d come for the express purpose of seeing Hector again, now she prayed she wouldn\u2019t. How could she possibly explain what she\u2019d done?</p><p>Lillie liked to think of herself as mature and sensible. Never in all her life, not even as a teenager, had she indulged in such a ridiculous deception over a man. Her face burned with mortification. She\u2019d lied about her car\u2014told an outright lie in a futile effort to see Hector Silva again.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the receptionist came to tell her that her vehicle was ready. She immediately went to pay the bill but found there was no charge. Eager to be on her way, Lillie hurried out of the building to the lot, where her car was waiting for her.</p><p>She nearly stumbled when she saw Hector standing next to it.</p><p>\u201cLillie,\u201d he said, his smile warm. \u201cI\u2019ve personally checked out the car and I can\u2019t find anything wrong with it. I thought if we took a drive, the problem might reappear and I could analyze it.\u201d</p><p>The offer to spend time with him was tempting, but she\u2019d frittered away enough of his morning. \u201cIf you say it\u2019s in fine working order, then I\u2019m sure it is. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind, Lillie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector.\u201d Her face shone as brightly as a lighthouse beacon. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with my vehicle,\u201d she said, making a spontaneous decision. \u201cI apologize. I shouldn\u2019t have wasted your time.\u201d The most important thing at the moment was getting away with her dignity\u2014or what remained of it\u2014intact.</p><p>Hector nodded. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to test your car, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He opened the driver\u2019s door for her, and she climbed in. Her hand trembled as she inserted the key in the ignition. The door was still open.</p><p>\u201cDo you...have you ever gone bowling?\u201d The words came at her in a rush.</p><p>\u201cBowling?\u201d she repeated, frowning. \u201cOh, sure, of course.\u201d This must be a day meant for lies. In her entire life, she\u2019d never even stepped inside a bowling alley.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s short notice...I hope you don\u2019t mind my asking...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d How eager she sounded. Her heart did a silly dance while she tried to disguise her excitement at his invitation.</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She mentally reviewed her closet filled with Misook and St. John suits. What did one wear bowling? Barbie would know. Barbie would help her. Then she realized she couldn\u2019t tell Barbie. Not yet. Later maybe, after she\u2019d gone out with Hector.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cPerhaps we should meet there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Anywhere was fine.</p><p>With a verve that was almost boyish, he shut her door, but not before giving her the address of the bowling alley. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to seeing you this evening,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lillie didn\u2019t know if she was going to dissolve into tears or giggles. Either way, her actions today had been embarrassing\u2014but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She was going to see Hector tonight, and they wouldn\u2019t be talking about cars, either.</p><p>That evening, thanks to her navigation system, Lillie located the bowling alley and got there at ten minutes to six. She wore beige linen slacks and a soft teal cashmere sweater with a floral silk scarf around her neck. Earlier in the afternoon, she\u2019d purchased tennis shoes and white cotton socks. With her makeup she\u2019d gone for a light, natural look, and she\u2019d worn her hair neatly tied back. Every detail of her appearance had been closely scrutinized.</p><p>Hector, dressed in a suit and tie, was waiting outside the entrance, and when he saw her, his eyes lit up. Lillie knew exactly how he felt, because she felt the same happiness at seeing him.</p><p>As she approached, he held out his hands to her, and for a moment neither of them spoke. \u201cThank you for agreeing to meet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for asking me.\u201d A little worried, she glanced at his suit. He looked as if he was about to attend a wedding. Lillie hadn\u2019t realized bowling was such a formal sport.</p><p>\u201cShould I change my clothes?\u201d</p><p>Hector shook his head. \u201cNo, no, you look perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re wearing a suit....\u201d</p><p>His cheeks reddened slightly. \u201cMy daughter said I should never have suggested bowling. She said you must think me a buffoon. Would you care to dine with me, Lillie? I apologize if I offended you by offering to take you bowling. It\u2019s been many years since I invited a woman out. I don\u2019t know how such things are done now.\u201d</p><p>All Lillie really wanted was to be with Hector. It didn\u2019t matter to her if they were in a five-star restaurant or knocking down pins in a bowling alley. \u201cHmm. That\u2019s quite a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we have coffee and then decide?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>Next they needed to figure out where to have coffee. They chose the caf\u00e9 in the bowling alley, since that was the simplest alternative. Hector led her to a booth in the corner. The menu was shaped like a bowling pin and the salt and pepper shakers were empty beer bottles. Lillie was enchanted.</p><p>He slid into the booth across from her as she glanced happily around. The atmosphere reminded her of a fifties diner, the kind of place where the day\u2019s special was a double bacon cheeseburger with greasy fries. When she read the chalkboard, she saw that the special here was actually two cheese enchiladas with rice and beans.</p><p>Hector raised his hand and the waitress brought coffee.</p><p>Lillie leaned forward. \u201cThere was nothing wrong with my car.\u201d She\u2019d told him as much earlier, but she wanted him to understand the reason for her pretense.</p><p>\u201cOh, I knew that all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d That made it even more embarrassing. \u201cI wanted to see you again,\u201d she said bluntly.</p><p>Hector spooned sugar into his coffee. \u201cI wanted to see you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t phone, you didn\u2019t ask.... My daughter and my friends urged me to contact you. They say that\u2019s how it\u2019s done nowadays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call me.\u201d</p><p>She avoided eye contact. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure how. I\u2019ve never called a man\u2014well, other than a professional or a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter said if you agreed to see me after tonight, it would be a miracle. She crossed herself when I told her I invited you to go bowling.\u201d</p><p>Lillie laughed. The cheerful clatter from the bowling alley made her curious and she noticed that everyone seemed to be having fun. \u201cI have another confession to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo confessions in a single night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve never been bowling.\u201d</p><p>This didn\u2019t appear to surprise him, either. \u201cWould you like to learn?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re going to be my teacher.\u201d</p><p>From across the table he grinned at her and she was mesmerized. He\u2019d captured her imagination and her senses with his unfailing courtesy, genuine charm and with his kindness.</p><p>When they finished their coffee, Hector procured them a lane, fitted her with rented shoes, and then proceeded to show Lillie how to bowl.</p><p>By the end of the evening, Lillie had to admit she hadn\u2019t laughed this much in twenty years. It was gratifying\u2014and completely unexpected\u2014to discover that she had a certain knack for the sport. What they both found nothing short of hilarious was the fact that her ball rolled at the speed of an earthworm. She\u2019d release it just the way Hector instructed, return to her seat and wait while the bowling ball slowly but surely trundled down the narrow lane. After what seemed like minutes, the ball would connect with the pins. They\u2019d fall lazily over, one at a time, almost in slow motion, knocking into one another.</p><p>People stopped to watch when the ball finally made contact and the pins started to tumble. Once she managed to knock down nine pins, and the people in the next alley actually broke into applause.</p><p>Hector\u2014who was obviously an accomplished bowler, as his succession of strikes made clear\u2014claimed he\u2019d never seen anything like it. Apparently, no one else had, either. The place was growing crowded, and Lillie was unaccustomed to all the attention, which embarrassed her. All she could do was laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And when she laughed, Hector did, too.</p><p>In the last frame of their final game, Lillie achieved her first strike. It took nearly a minute for all the pins to fall and when the last one spun around and around and eventually toppled, she jumped up and down like a schoolgirl. Hector hugged her and then self-consciously stepped back.</p><p>After that, they turned in their bowling shoes and balls. She could hardly remember a time she\u2019d enjoyed more. When they left the lanes, it seemed the most natural thing in the world for him to take her hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked, dangling his suit jacket over his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cFamished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too. Do you have a favorite restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she said and smiled over at him. \u201cIt\u2019s right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillie, please allow me to take you to a real restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one looks real.\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated. \u201cMy daughter suggested Gaucho\u2019s. She said they have an extensive wine list and a pianist who plays classical music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you planning to wine and dine me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s what you deserve. I want only the best for you.\u201d</p><p>It was such a sweet gesture, but she couldn\u2019t let Hector spend that kind of money. Besides, she wasn\u2019t dressed for anyplace formal. \u201cI\u2019d love some cheese enchiladas,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Hector squeezed her fingers. \u201cIf you insist, but if my daughter asks, please tell her the choice was yours, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRita?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Before I left this evening, she gave me a long list of things I should and shouldn\u2019t do. When I dated my wife, it was nothing like this.\u201d He stopped abruptly. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to imply...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI feel just as nervous as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou mean you can\u2019t tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He seemed genuinely surprised. \u201cI have a confession to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Well, she\u2019d already made two of her own.</p><p>\u201cWhen I look at you,\u201d he said in a low voice, \u201cI forget to breathe.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if he realized the effect his words had on her\u2014or that she felt the very same way.</p> <p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she whispered. She might have said more but a booth became available and they slid inside.</p><p>They each ordered the enchiladas and lingered over coffee, chatting until after one in the morning. Only when Lillie couldn\u2019t hold back a yawn did Hector suggest they call it a night.</p><p>He walked her to her car, which was one of the four or five still in the parking lot. The entire time Lillie prayed Hector would want to see her again. When he didn\u2019t mention it, she was sure this would be their one and only date.</p><p>\u201cI had a lovely evening,\u201d she said, fumbling for her keys.</p><p>\u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for everything.\u201d She opened the car door and got in.</p><p>He nodded, stepping away as she started the engine.</p><p>Lillie\u2019s heart was in her throat.</p><p>\u201cSaturday,\u201d he blurted out just as she was ready to drive away.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to attend a lecture at the museum with me this Saturday?\u201d</p><p>The relief was so overwhelming, she nearly broke into tears. \u201cThat would be wonderful, Hector.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful didn\u2019t begin to describe it.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Wednesday afternoon, the sun was shining and the wind off Puget Sound was warm. This was a perfect spring day, and Anne Marie suddenly realized she felt...good. She\u2019d almost forgotten what that was like. The comfort of the sun, the freshness of the breeze, the company of others\u2014they all contributed to her sense of well-being. Most of all, though, she felt a contentment she hadn\u2019t experienced since before her separation from Robert.</p><p>She\u2019d just finished a knitting class with Elise Beaumont. Three other women had signed up, and the session had been fun, with plenty of banter as Elise reviewed their work.</p><p>While she was at the yarn store, Colette Dempsey came by with her infant daughter. At first Anne Marie had been afraid that seeing her friend with the baby would be painful; it wasn\u2019t. Even though the world seemed to be full of surprise pregnancies and secret ones, too, she managed to distance herself from destructive emotions like envy.</p><p>She found she could genuinely delight in Colette\u2019s joy. They talked for an hour, and the visit passed with barely a ripple of pain.</p><p>Anne Marie was saddened by the news that Colette and her husband, Christian, would be moving to California at the end of June for business reasons. Christian owned a successful importing firm and would be opening a second office in San Diego.</p><p>She recalled that only a year ago, Colette had been a widow like her, and that was something they\u2019d had in common. But Colette had been hiding a pregnancy and she\u2019d struggled with a painful dilemma that had been dramatically resolved.</p><p>Nothing dramatic had happened to Anne Marie in the last two months. Nothing had really changed, either; certainly not her circumstances, other than the fact that Ellen was living with her but that was only a temporary situation. The only difference was in Anne Marie\u2019s attitude.</p><p>She still had to make an effort to maintain that attitude. Her Twenty Wishes had helped, because she now felt she had some control over her emotions. Doing something for someone else\u2014Ellen\u2014had, without a doubt, made the biggest difference.</p><p>To be honest, avoiding the question of Rebecca Gilroy had helped, too. One day soon, she\u2019d ask who had fathered her son. But not until she felt ready to accept the answer.</p><p>After her knitting class, Anne Marie did a few errands and then collected Baxter so the two of them could meet Ellen\u2019s school bus. The girl\u2019s spirits had been low since she\u2019d learned that her Grandma Dolores wouldn\u2019t be home as quickly as they\u2019d hoped.</p><p>Anne Marie decided a leisurely walk, maybe stopping somewhere for something to eat, might improve Ellen\u2019s mood. As she waited on the street corner, the big yellow bus rumbled down Blossom Street. When it stopped and Ellen hopped out, Baxter strained against his leash, whining excitedly.</p><p>\u201cHow was school?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>The noncommittal reply was typical. Generally it wasn\u2019t until later in the evening, usually over dinner, that Ellen began to talk more freely. She appeared to need time to assimilate the day\u2019s events and perhaps figure out how much to share.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d take Baxter for a walk together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Ellen rarely showed much enthusiasm when Anne Marie suggested an outing. She revealed her pleasure in other ways. Anne Marie suspected she was afraid to let anyone know she was happy about something, for fear that the object of her happiness would be taken away.</p><p>\u201cIf you want, you can leave your backpack in the shop with Theresa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen raced ahead and Anne Marie watched her employee place the heavy bag behind the counter. A minute later, Ellen was back.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>Baxter certainly was. Her Yorkie pulled at the leash; apparently Anne Marie wasn\u2019t walking briskly enough to satisfy him. The dog had places to go, territory to mark and friends to greet, especially the friends who kept special treats just for him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk down to Pike Place Market and have dinner at one of the sidewalk caf\u00e9s,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cDoes that sound good?\u201d</p><p>Ellen shrugged. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr would you rather go down to the waterfront and get fish and chips?\u201d</p><p>Ellen didn\u2019t seem to have an opinion one way or the other. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie had to think about it. \u201cPizza,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI haven\u2019t had it in ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThin crust with lots of cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pepperoni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if we can find a restaurant where we can order pizza and eat outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>On a mission now, they trudged down the steep hill toward the Seattle waterfront. Pike Place Market was a twenty-minute hike, but neither complained. Baxter didn\u2019t, either, although this was new territory for the dog. Once they reached the market, Anne Marie picked him up and cradled him in her arms.</p><p>Ellen and Anne Marie strolled through the market, where they watched two young men toss freshly caught salmon back and forth for the tourists\u2019 benefit. Ellen\u2019s eyes grew huge as she gazed at the impromptu performance. When they left the market building, the little girl slipped her hand into Anne Marie\u2019s and they walked down the Hill Climb stairs to the waterfront. Baxter was back on his feet by then, taking in all the fascinating smells around him.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to the Seattle Aquarium?\u201d Anne Marie asked when the building came into view.</p><p>\u201cMy class went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded eagerly. \u201cI got to touch a sea cucumber and it felt really weird and I saw a baby sea otter and a real shark.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d liked it, all right, if she was willing to say this much. After investigating several stores that catered to Seattle tourists, Anne Marie located a pizza place. While they waited for their order, they sipped sodas at a picnic table near the busy waterfront. They both ate until they were stuffed and still had half the pizza left over.</p><p>\u201cShall we save it?\u201d Anne Marie asked. Ellen agreed. It seemed a shame to throw it out, but she suspected that if they brought it home, it would sit in the refrigerator for a few days and end up in the garbage, anyway.</p><p>Anne Marie carried the cardboard box in one hand and held Baxter\u2019s leash in the other. They\u2019d just started back when Ellen noticed a homeless man sitting on a bench, his grocery cart parked close by. Tugging at Anne Marie\u2019s arm, she whispered something.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Anne Marie asked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks hungry,\u201d Ellen said a bit more loudly. \u201cCan we give him our pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely idea. I\u2019ll ask if he\u2019d like some dinner.\u201d Impressed with Ellen\u2019s sensitivity, Anne Marie gave her the leash and approached the man on the bench.</p><p>He stared up at her, disheveled and badly in need of a bath. Despite the afternoon sunshine, he wore a thick winter jacket.</p><p>\u201cWe have some pizza,\u201d Anne Marie explained, \u201cand we were wondering if you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>The man frowned suspiciously at the box. \u201cWhat kind you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, cheese and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like them anchovies,\u201d he broke in. \u201cIf you got anchovies on it, I\u2019ll pass. Thanks, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie assured him the pizza contained no anchovies and handed him the box. He lifted the lid and frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d They\u2019d gone about a block when the absurdity of the question struck her. She started to giggle.</p><p>Clearly puzzled, Ellen looked up at her.</p><p>That was when Anne Marie began to laugh, really laugh. Her shoulders shook and tears gathered in her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d she repeated, laughing so hard her stomach ached. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t want anchovies.\u201d Why she found the man\u2019s comments so hilarious she couldn\u2019t even say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ellen continued to study her. \u201cYou\u2019re laughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s on your list, remember?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s laughter stopped. Ellen was right. She wanted to be able to laugh again and here she was, giggling hysterically like a teenage girl with her friends. This needed to be documented so she pulled out her cell phone and had Ellen take her picture.</p> <p>Then she dashed back and piled all the change and small bills she had\u2014four or five dollars\u2019 worth\u2014on the pizza box.</p><p>Another wish\u2014an act of kindness. The man grinned up at her through stained teeth and rheumy eyes.</p><p>It came to her then that she was happy.</p><p>Truly happy.</p><p>Deep-down happy.</p> <p>Anne Marie had felt good earlier in the day, but that was the contentment that came from a sunny day, seeing old friends, spending a relaxing hour with her knitting class.</p><p>Granted, her newly formed optimism had a lot to do with these feelings. But her unrestrained amusement was something else\u2014the ability to respond to life\u2019s absurdities with a healthy burst of laughter.</p><p>It meant the healing had begun, and she was well on her way back to life, back to being herself, reaching toward acceptance.</p><p>When they returned to the apartment, it was still light out. Ellen had a number of small tasks to perform. She watered the small tomato, cucumber and zucchini seedlings they\u2019d planted in egg cartons last Sunday. Once Ellen was home at her grandmother\u2019s, Anne Marie would help the girl plant her own small garden. They\u2019d already planted a container garden on Anne Marie\u2019s balcony, with easy-care flowers like impatiens and geraniums.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019d finished the watering, Ellen phoned her grandmother. Anne Marie spoke to the older woman, too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why these doctors insist on keeping me here,\u201d Dolores grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m fit as a fiddle. Ready to go home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be long now,\u201d Anne Marie told her.</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so.\u201d She sobered a bit. \u201cHow\u2019s Ellen doing? Don\u2019t whitewash the truth for me. I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe misses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course she does. I miss her, too.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie smiled. \u201cActually, she\u2019s doing really well.\u201d</p><p>Dolores Falk sighed expressively. \u201cGod love you, Anne Marie. I don\u2019t know what Ellen and I would\u2019ve done without you.\u201d</p><p>The praise embarrassed her. She was the one who\u2019d truly benefited from having the child.</p><p>When Ellen had done her homework, the two of them knit in front of the television. Ellen had completed the scarf for her grandmother and started a much more ambitious project, a pair of mitts. After an hour\u2019s knitting, she had a bath and put on her brand-new pajamas. She crawled into her bed. Prayers were shorter than usual that night, since Ellen was especially tired, and then Anne Marie read to her. They were now on the third \u201cLittle House\u201d book and rereading these childhood favorites gave Anne Marie great pleasure. Ellen fell asleep listening.</p> <p>When Anne Marie got down from the bed, Baxter hopped up to take her place.</p><p>The small apartment was quiet now, and a feeling of peace surrounded her. As always, she kept the bedroom door partially ajar for Ellen, who was afraid of the dark.</p><p>Tiptoeing down the hallway to her own bedroom, Anne Marie opened her binder of Twenty Wishes. She wanted to document the fact that she\u2019d laughed. As Ellen had said, that was, indeed, one of her wishes.</p><p>She turned the pages in the binder and reviewed her list. She added a few more.</p><p>16. Go to Central Park in New York and ride a horse-drawn carriage</p><p>17. Catch snowflakes on my tongue and then make snow angels</p><p>18. Read all of Jane Austen</p><p>Lillie and Barbie had both said they wanted to fall in love again. Anne Marie wasn\u2019t sure she did. Love had brought her more grief than joy. She\u2019d loved Robert to the very depths of her soul, and his sudden death had devastated her.</p><p>Then to learn he\u2019d had an affair with his personal assistant...The betrayal of it still felt like a crushing weight.</p><p>Anne Marie closed her eyes at the pain.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cStop it right now.\u201d</p><p>She felt suddenly angry with herself. It was as if she\u2019d set out to dismantle the positive attitude she\u2019d so carefully created and destroy all the happiness she\u2019d managed to find by thinking of everything that had gone wrong. No, she wouldn\u2019t do it; she refused to let herself reexamine the pain of the last months.</p><p>Turning a page, she looked at the picture of the Eiffel Tower.</p><p>Someday she\u2019d go.</p><p>Someday that wish, too, would be fulfilled.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Anne Marie entered the small neighborhood park at the end of Blossom Street, where she walked Baxter every morning. Her stepdaughter sat on a bench waiting for her.</p><p>The weather had taken a turn for the worse since Wednesday, when she\u2019d gone to the waterfront with Ellen and Baxter. This afternoon the sky was overcast and the scent of rain hung in the air.</p><p>Melissa had suggested they have lunch in the park. Anne Marie appreciated not having any reminder of their last restaurant meeting.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Melissa said as Anne Marie sat down beside her.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Strange\u2014after years of avoidance, they were now seeking each other\u2019s company. Anne Marie was curious about what Melissa had decided since they\u2019d last talked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having yogurt for lunch,\u201d Melissa announced. \u201cI don\u2019t even like it, but Michael says it\u2019s good for me and the baby.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie took out a tuna sandwich she\u2019d slapped together that morning. \u201cYou told Michael, then.\u201d</p><p>Melissa peeled off the foil top on the yogurt container and discarded it in her sack. \u201cI went to see him right after you and I met, just like you said, and I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d She paused. \u201cHe was definitely shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d She grew quiet. \u201cHe didn\u2019t believe me at first.\u201d</p><p>This angered Anne Marie on her stepdaughter\u2019s behalf. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember I was the one who broke up with him, and I hurt him pretty badly. I should never have done that. I should\u2019ve told Michael right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all make mistakes,\u201d Anne Marie said. She\u2019d certainly made hers. Late at night she sometimes wondered if she\u2019d been wrong to give Robert an ultimatum, if she should\u2019ve tried to work things out in a different way.</p><p>\u201cI could see he wanted to talk to me, but he was scared I\u2019d hurt him again, so he kept looking away.\u201d Melissa\u2019s voice became more animated. \u201cI kept asking him to look at me and he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It must have been terribly frustrating. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Melissa appeared to be studying her yogurt, but Anne Marie could see she was smiling. \u201cI kissed his neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael\u2019s a lot taller than I am and that\u2019s as far as I could reach. I said I loved him and that I was sorry. I put my arms around him and told him the reason I broke up with him was because I was afraid.\u201d She unwrapped the plastic spoon. \u201cTo tell you the truth I was even more scared then. My friend, the one who told me she\u2019d seen Michael with some one else, had some other news, too, and I was sure I\u2019d lost him for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019d seen him in a jewelry store, looking at diamond rings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor this other girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, go back. Tell me what happened when you told Michael about the baby.\u201d</p><p>Some of the happiness left Melissa\u2019s eyes. \u201cLike I said, he didn\u2019t believe me. He thought I was making it up, which made me so mad I almost walked away. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would he even think that?\u201d</p><p>Melissa shrugged. \u201cHe didn\u2019t trust me, and I can\u2019t blame him.\u201d She met Anne Marie\u2019s eyes. \u201cI said I\u2019d never make anything like this up and to prove it I showed him the ultrasound I got from the pregnancy center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet that got his attention.\u201d</p><p>Melissa laughed. \u201cIt sure did. He nearly fainted. All he could do was look at that little picture of our baby and walk around in circles. He was so pale I thought he was going to pass out. It took him a few minutes to get used to the idea, and then he asked me what I intended to do. I said that was why I\u2019d come to see him. I felt this was a decision we should make together.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded. She didn\u2019t speak, not wanting to interrupt the flow of Melissa\u2019s story.</p><p>\u201cOne thing I did, which I regret now, was to tell him that Mom wanted me to get rid of the baby. Michael got really, really upset. Basically I\u2019d already decided that there are so many other options, an abortion would be my last resort.\u201d</p><p>Although she didn\u2019t remember Michael from the funeral, Anne Marie felt warmly disposed toward him, sure she\u2019d approve of this obviously responsible young man.</p><p>\u201cHe said a baby needs a mother and a father,\u201d Melissa went on, \u201cand naturally I agreed because I believe that, too.\u201d She dipped her spoon into the yogurt and put it in her mouth. \u201cDo you want to know how bad my sense of timing is?\u201d she said a moment later.</p><p>Anne Marie grinned at her wry tone. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night I broke up with Michael was the very same night he was going to propose to me. He had an engagement ring in his pocket and everything. The diamond he\u2019d been buying when my friend saw him was for me. And the other girl was just a study partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Melissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing each other practically every night. Oh, and I\u2019m back in school.\u201d She smiled confidently. \u201cYou can bet he\u2019s doing all his studying with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great! But there\u2019s something I need to know. Are you going to marry Michael?\u201d She knew marriage was what Robert would\u2019ve wanted for his daughter.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, I am. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself again.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie took the first bite of her sandwich. Robert would\u2019ve been thrilled at the prospect of grandchildren. That was always his excuse when he refused to consider having a baby with Anne Marie. He said he didn\u2019t want children and grandchildren the same age. Nor, he claimed, did he want his children to be mistaken for his grandchildren.</p><p>But it was useless to review their arguments now. What she recalled most strongly was Robert\u2019s anticipation of his children\u2019s children. Unlike Pamela, he would\u2019ve been thrilled with the news of this baby.</p><p>Apparently Pamela had yet to be won over. But Anne Marie had to assume it wouldn\u2019t be long before the baby stole his or her grandmother\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I talked to Michael, we decided to get engaged,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cThen I called my mother.\u201d Melissa frowned. \u201cUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t a pleasant conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to be positive. I told her I\u2019d discussed the baby with Michael and right off, that upset her. Mom said the decision was mine and mine alone, and by dragging him into it I was only complicating what should be a simple decision.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, dear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this side of my mother before. She\u2019s totally convinced I should take that job and move to England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still could, I guess.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I ever really wanted a job in London. Mom keeps telling me what a fabulous opportunity this is, the chance of a lifetime and all that. But it would mean leaving Michael and I don\u2019t want that, baby or no baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t he come with you?\u201d With Pamela\u2019s resources, it might be possible to get Michael employment, as well.</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s going to work in his father\u2019s carpet business. He\u2019ll eventually take over the company. It isn\u2019t like he could just pack up and follow me to another country. He\u2019d like to go to Europe one day, but Seattle is home.\u201d</p><p>That made sense to Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever realized how much Mom had her heart set on me joining her in the corporate world.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie could understand Pamela\u2019s disappointment. Her marriage to Robert had disintegrated when Pamela accepted a position that often took her out of the country. The arrangement had suited Pamela and, although Robert was involved in his own career, he loved his children and willingly looked after their needs. Pamela cared about her kids, too, of course, but she had her own vision of what was best for them. Whether they actually agreed with that vision seemed irrelevant to her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your mother\u2019s afraid you might be repeating her mistake\u2014or what she sees as one,\u201d Anne Marie said as gently as she could. She didn\u2019t want to suggest the marriage had been a mistake, although in retrospect it probably was.</p><p>\u201cShe started yelling at me and said I\u2019d regret this for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Pamela\u2019s temper was legendary.</p><p>\u201cI asked her if she regretted having Brandon and me and she said...\u201d Melissa swallowed hard. \u201cShe said if she had to do it over again, she wouldn\u2019t have had either one of us because we\u2019ve done nothing but let her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t mean that! She couldn\u2019t mean it.\u201d Anne Marie was horrified by such a cruel remark, even if Pamela had lashed out, unthinking.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Melissa said in a small voice. \u201cAfterward she e-mailed me and apologized, but she still said she wanted no part of the wedding.\u201d</p> <p>The wedding. Melissa and Michael were going to have a wedding. Of course they were.</p><p>\u201cWill you come to our wedding?\u201d Melissa asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! I wouldn\u2019t miss it for anything.\u201d</p><p>Melissa smiled, and Anne Marie saw tears in her eyes. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe this, you know,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat your mother said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, me coming to you for advice. And support. A year ago, even three months ago, I would never have done that. I...I thought I hated you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try to forget all that, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI blamed you for the divorce, although I know it wasn\u2019t your fault at all. Brandon and I had a long talk about you, and he\u2019s helped me figure things out. Emotions can become habits,\u201d she said haltingly as she wiped her eyes. \u201cBut habits can be changed.\u201d</p> <p>There was a silence, and Anne Marie found herself blinking back tears of her own. \u201cCan I help with the wedding?\u201d she finally asked, diverting the subject from herself and their painful past.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but I never expected...I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make time.\u201d Anne Marie wanted to help Melissa. The possibility filled her with hope and a kind of exultation. For nearly thirteen years her relationship with her stepdaughter had been nothing less than turbulent. Then, for reasons she didn\u2019t completely understand, it had begun to change.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell you, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d Melissa glanced at her suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking knitting classes and I bought yarn for a baby blanket.\u201d</p><p>Melissa smiled tremulously. \u201cYou did that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be a stepgrandma, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Melissa nodded, and tears coursed down her cheeks unrestrained. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how wonderful you\u2019ve been to me.\u201d Melissa reached for her hand and squeezed it. \u201cThank you, Anne Marie,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Anne Marie put aside her half-finished sandwich. \u201cEllen picked out the yarn,\u201d she said, clearing her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s a variegated one with yellow, pink, pale blue and lavender.\u201d Anne Marie was eager to start. As soon as she\u2019d finished the lap robe for Dolores, she\u2019d knit the blanket for Melissa and Michael\u2019s baby. Her stepgrandchild.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll treasure it. And please thank Ellen. I hope I can meet her soon.\u201d Melissa used a napkin to mop her face as she spoke. Except for her reddened eyes, she looked as beautiful as ever.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll arrange something,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cNow, have you and Michael set a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuly twelfth.\u201d</p><p>It was almost the middle of April. That didn\u2019t leave them much time, especially with Melissa and Michael both graduating from college in the next month.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re reinstated in your classes, but what about the work you missed? Have you caught up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom,\u201d Melissa said with a laugh.</p><p>Anne Marie was beginning to feel like a parent, or rather Melissa was letting her feel like one. Melissa\u2019s stepmom. Darn it, she loved how that felt.</p><p>Robert would be so proud of them. This was what he\u2019d always wanted for her and Melissa. How sad that it hadn\u2019t happened until he was gone. Somehow, though, she had the feeling he knew and approved.</p><p>\u201cYour father would\u2019ve wanted you to get your degree,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Melissa said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s discuss the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Melissa sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit overwhelming. We have no idea where to start. Michael\u2019s mother said we should set a date and get the minister first, but I don\u2019t know any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. Alix Turner, who works at the French Caf\u00e9, is married to a minister. Would you like me to get his phone number for you?\u201d</p><p>Melissa nodded. \u201cThat would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your dress?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>Another deep sigh. \u201cI haven\u2019t even thought about that yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do some research\u2014a friend of mine owns a dress shop, and if she doesn\u2019t have what you need, she\u2019ll know someone who does. Then I\u2019ll make an appointment with Alix over at the French Caf\u00e9 so we can check out a catering menu and look at wedding cake designs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you have time for all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, Melissa, yes,\u201d Anne Marie told her. \u201cEllen will help, too. It\u2019ll be good to get her mind off her grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Melissa whispered with a watery smile.</p><p>She might not ever be a mother, Anne Marie realized, but she was a stepmom and she\u2019d make a wonderful grandmother for Melissa\u2019s baby.</p><p>She\u2019d learned two things from Melissa. The habits of a lifetime could be changed. And family could come about in the most unexpected ways.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>When Barbie approached the ticket window at the movie complex, she was pleased to note that Tessa was handling sales again that night. As soon as she\u2019d advanced to the front of the line, Tessa broke into a huge smile.</p><p>\u201cUncle Mark left a ticket for you.\u201d</p><p>Barbie hesitated. \u201cHe bought my ticket?\u201d So far, they\u2019d met at the pool four times for the adult lap swim session\u2014and that was it. Although they\u2019d kissed that first day in the water, they hadn\u2019t since. Not for any lack of desire, at least on Barbie\u2019s part. But the circumstances weren\u2019t ideal; their privacy the first time hadn\u2019t been repeated, and she wasn\u2019t interested in giving the seniors\u2019 swim class an eyeful.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date,\u201d Tessa said, as if she needed to clarify.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me we\u2019re not seeing another horror movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tessa assured her. \u201cIt\u2019s a courtroom drama. Lots of talking. You don\u2019t have to worry about being scared out of your wits.\u201d</p><p>But Barbie was scared. She\u2019d fallen for Mark and fallen hard. The wheelchair didn\u2019t frighten her, but the man who sat in it did. Their relationship wouldn\u2019t be easy and the realities of a future with him were intimidating. Yet the strength of her attraction overcame her doubts.</p><p>He was slowly letting her into his life, and that thrilled her. As was her custom, she purchased popcorn and a soda and entered the theater.</p><p>\u201cHowdy,\u201d she said as she slipped into the seat directly beside Mark\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He didn\u2019t look in her direction.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her bag of popcorn in his direction and he took a handful. \u201cAs Tessa pointed out, this is like a real date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we both a bit old for that nonsense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope not,\u201d Barbie said. \u201cMy mother has a male friend and they\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel like that to you? In some ways it does to me.\u201d In good ways. She woke each morning with a sense of happy expectation. Mark was in her thoughts when she drove to the dress shop and then at noon when she dashed to the fitness center. He\u2019d never asked for her phone number, which she would willingly, gladly, have given him. It would\u2019ve been sheer heaven to lie in bed and talk to him on the phone, like she had with her high school boyfriend. And then with Gary...</p><p>\u201cYeah, it feels like high school.\u201d Mark snorted. \u201cIn all the stupid ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She feigned shock. \u201cI never would\u2019ve guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d he said, his voice clipped. \u201cI don\u2019t expect this to last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re obviously an optimist, as well,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Mark still wouldn\u2019t look at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you expect to get out of this relationship, because I haven\u2019t got much to give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop?\u201d This little speech of his sounded rehearsed.</p><p>\u201cLet me finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, have your say and then I\u2019ll have mine.\u201d She tilted the popcorn in his direction again.</p><p>He stared at it. \u201cI can\u2019t eat very much of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He had eaten it earlier, so it wasn\u2019t a food allergy.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of limitations, Barbie. For instance, I can\u2019t eat whatever I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFew of us can eat whatever we want. You know what? Everyone has limitations. Okay, so yours are more obvious than some people\u2019s. But I have several of my own, which I\u2019m doing my best to keep under control.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me guess.\u201d He pressed his index finger to his lips. \u201cFirst, you have one hell of a temper.\u201d</p><p>She laughed outright at that. \u201cHow kind of you to remind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say,\u201d he continued, \u201cis that this relationship is doomed. You apparently get some kind of emotional kick out of flirting with me, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good for the ego, and mine\u2019s been in the gutter so long that this is a refreshing change. But I\u2019m not a fool. A woman like you can have any man she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude here. However\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It hasn\u2019t stopped you in the past.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cTrue. Just let me finish, okay?\u201d</p><p>She motioned with her hand. \u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the way I figure it. For reasons beyond my comprehension, you\u2019re attracted to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it a one-way attraction?\u201d For the sake of her own ego, she needed to find out. \u201cAnswer this one question and I promise I won\u2019t interrupt you again.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou already know. You pretty much turn me inside out every time I see you.\u201d</p><p>Barbie clasped her hands, still clutching the bag of popcorn. \u201cDo I really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbie, please, you\u2019re making this difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sorry.\u201d But her heart was leaping with joy.</p><p>\u201cListen, for whatever reason, you feel safe with me. I\u2019m not a threat to you. I don\u2019t know what went on in your marriage, and frankly, I don\u2019t want to know. Whatever happened then or since has really rattled you. So a guy in a wheelchair\u2019s a safe bet. Fine. The truth is, I can\u2019t seem to forget you and I\u2019m tired of fighting my attraction to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor your information, I had a very good marriage.\u201d Barbie wasn\u2019t sure where all this talk was leading. \u201cI think you\u2019re looking for an excuse to avoid a relationship with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said again, exhaling slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ignoring what I just said.\u201d</p><p>For the first time he glanced in her direction. As soon as he did, his eyes softened. \u201cOkay. For now I\u2019m willing to do things your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure what that meant either. \u201cCould you explain that?\u201d</p><p>He sighed loudly. \u201cWe play this by ear. When you want out, you get out. Don\u2019t prolong it. Do me a favor and just leave, okay?\u201d</p><p>Barbie had to think for a moment. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I want out, then I need you to respect my wishes in the same way that I intend to respect yours.\u201d</p> <p>That sounded fair. Still, she hated the idea of planning their breakup. \u201cCan\u2019t we just take this one day at a time?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cOne date at a time?\u201d she said and then leaned over and kissed his ear, running the tip of her tongue over the smooth contours and nibbling on his lobe. \u201cOne kiss at a time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, his voice husky with desire. \u201cI told you earlier\u2014you turn me inside out.\u201d</p><p>The theater darkened, and the previews started. Barbie put her popcorn and soda on the floor at her feet. To her surprise and delight, Mark reached for her hand and entwined their fingers. She leaned closer and a few minutes into the movie, rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>Mark snickered softly. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s high school all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it is or not.\u201d</p><p>In response, he raised their clasped hands to his lips and kissed the back of her hand. A chill of pleasure slid down her spine.</p><p>At the end of the movie, she walked next to his wheelchair as they left the theater. She half expected him to ask her out for coffee. The movie might be over, but that didn\u2019t mean their evening had to be. When he didn\u2019t suggest it, she did.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tonight.\u201d He didn\u2019t offer an excuse.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps another night, then.\u201d She did her best to hide her disappointment.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you call me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d He didn\u2019t seem pleased by the prospect.</p><p>\u201cTonight before you go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cBarbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple request. If you can do it, fine. If not...if not, I\u2019ll lie awake all night wondering why you didn\u2019t phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wasn\u2019t about to deny it.</p><p>He muttered something she couldn\u2019t quite decipher and from the gruffness of his voice, she figured she was better off not knowing. \u201cGive me your phone number,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Reaching inside her purse for a pen and pad, she wrote out her home number and tore off the sheet.</p><p>Mark crumpled it and stuffed it in his shirt pocket. \u201cIf you\u2019re loitering here because you expect me to kiss you, don\u2019t. I never kiss in public.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t remind him that he\u2019d kissed her at the pool and at the theater. \u201cWant to go someplace private, then?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll take a rain check on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d What she\u2019d learned from their brief conversation before the movie was that Mark was as terrified as she was. He didn\u2019t want to be attracted to her. He\u2019d rather chase her away, only he hadn\u2019t succeeded in that. Yes, he desired her, but he wouldn\u2019t risk any kind of dependence on her. Insofar as he was willing to get involved, he wasn\u2019t letting her any too close. She had a mental image of a heavily armed guard standing watch over his heart.</p><p>Several hours later, Barbie lay on her bed, waiting for Mark\u2019s call. It was almost eleven before the phone finally rang.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d His voice was impatient. \u201cI phoned like you asked me to. Now what is it you want to know?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t actually thought the call required a purpose. \u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on to your game! You\u2019re asking me that because you want me to ask you the same question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing an ivory silk gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, full-length. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the point of this, and I\u2019m not interested in silly games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to want me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d She heard him snort disbelievingly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to work nearly this hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark,\u201d she whispered, nearly purring his name. \u201cLoosen up. We hardly know each other. I thought we could use this time to talk, to get acquainted.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for maybe ten seconds, although it felt more like ten minutes. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d She already knew, but wanted him to tell her, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an architect.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate or describe any of the buildings he\u2019d designed. Nor did he say where he worked or where he\u2019d gone to school or anything else regarding his professional life. Barbie was beginning to understand him. The less he revealed about himself, the less likely she was to hurt him.</p><p>\u201cI have twin sons,\u201d she said, moving the conversation into more personal realms.</p><p>\u201cIdentical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My husband was killed in a plane crash three years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You aren\u2019t the only one who uses the Internet. Both your husband and your father worked for a huge perfume conglomerate. You never said anything about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I? Mom and I don\u2019t really have anything to do with the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do smell good most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the time?\u201d she flared.</p><p>\u201cChlorine isn\u2019t one of your better scents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know you\u2019re the only man in the world who could get me into a public swimming pool. I live in mortal fear that my hair\u2019s going to turn green in that overchlorinated water and it\u2019ll be entirely your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And miss getting splashed by you? It\u2019s the highlight of my week!\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and in her mind she saw the mercenary who stood guard over his feelings lay down one weapon in his arsenal.</p><p>They spoke for two hours. Before they said good-night, Mark admitted he\u2019d been in bed a full thirty minutes before he phoned. He wouldn\u2019t have called at all, he said, if not for the fact that he couldn\u2019t sleep. Every time he closed his eyes, the thought of her waiting in bed taunted him until he couldn\u2019t tolerate it anymore.</p><p>On Thursday afternoon, after her belly dancing class, Barbie met her mother for lunch. Lillie had already arrived at the upscale hotel restaurant and was reviewing the menu when Barbie joined her. Lillie did an immediate double take.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, you look wonderful! I know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but you\u2019re positively glowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just sweat. This belly dancing is hard work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s more.\u201d Lillie set the menu aside. \u201cIs it that...man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Mark and yes, now that you mention it, he and I have been talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really like him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Barbie was crazy about him, but she wasn\u2019t ready to let her mother know that. She didn\u2019t want to ruin their lunch; so far, Lillie had been accepting of the situation and Barbie wanted it to stay that way.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come to talk about Mark. I want to know how things are developing between you and Mr. Silva.\u201d</p><p>Lillie smiled, her eyes warm. \u201cIf I tell you something, you have to promise not to laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I won\u2019t laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been bowling twice in the last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBowling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s a bowler. I\u2019m calling Jerry Springer,\u201d Barbie teased.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it,\u201d Lillie said and blushed.</p><p>\u201cAll you do is bowl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens, no. We\u2019ve gone for long walks and we attended a lecture at the Seattle Art Museum and signed up for a Chinese cooking class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, has he kissed you?\u201d</p><p>Lillie lowered her eyes. \u201cYes. We might be over sixty, but we aren\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201d In fact, her mother looked more alive than she had in years. \u201cI think this is great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you and Mark?\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much to tell. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked for the past three nights.\u201d Mark had confessed he generally didn\u2019t enjoy chatting on the phone. Still, they\u2019d talked nearly two hours every time. Gradually, he was opening up to her and he became as engrossed in their conversations as she did.</p><p>When Barbie returned from lunch that afternoon, a large floral arrangement had been delivered. \u201cWho sent the flowers?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. The card\u2019s addressed to you,\u201d one of her employees announced.</p><p>Eagerly she removed the small envelope and tugged out the card. Mark had written his name, together with a short note. This time the flowers really are from me.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>The big day had finally come. Dolores Falk was going home after nearly a month away, first in the hospital and then a nursing facility. According to her physicians, the heart surgery had been a complete success and Dolores had many good years left.</p> <p>Certainly Anne Marie had noticed a definite improvement in the older woman. Every day Dolores seemed to regain more of her strength and her spirit. She was as eager to get home as Ellen was to join her there.</p><p>Thursday morning at breakfast, Ellen talked incessantly about moving back with her grandmother. The instant she got home from school, she ran upstairs to pack her bag. Anne Marie could hear her telling Baxter that she\u2019d visit him soon. Ellen had him repeat the tricks they\u2019d practiced\u2014rolling over and playing hide-and-seek with his tennis ball\u2014a few times for good measure. \u201cSo you won\u2019t forget,\u201d she told him sternly.</p><p>Anne Marie drove the child to her old neighborhood. \u201cRemember, your grandmother\u2019s been very sick,\u201d she cautioned her.</p><p>\u201cI know. I won\u2019t do anything to upset her,\u201d Ellen promised.</p><p>She glanced at the girl sitting in the passenger seat, the dog on her lap. \u201cYou can come see Baxter whenever you want,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cCan I see you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you still be my Lunch Buddy?\u201d</p><p>Ellen must\u2019ve asked the same questions ten times since they\u2019d been told that Dolores was being released. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cGoody.\u201d And then as if she\u2019d almost forgotten something important, Ellen added breathlessly, \u201cWhat about Lillie and Barbie and Mrs. Beaumont? What about Lydia and Margaret and Susannah and Theresa?\u201d she asked. \u201cWill I be able to visit them, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that can be arranged.\u201d Her friends and neighbors didn\u2019t know yet that Ellen was moving back with her grandmother. As soon as they heard, they\u2019d send their love to Ellen, and to Dolores.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll still knit every day,\u201d Ellen assured her. She had a knitting bag now, the same as Anne Marie\u2019s. Young as she was, the child had proven to be an adept knitter.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Anne Marie said. She\u2019d finished the lap robe for Dolores earlier and had given it to her during their most recent visit; she\u2019d completed Melissa\u2019s baby blanket, as well. For her third project she planned to knit Ellen a sweater and had chosen a simple cardigan pattern. The girl had picked out a soft rose-colored yarn. Ellen was working on a pair of mittens. She wanted to knit Anne Marie a sweater but Lydia had wisely suggested she knit one for Baxter first and then try a larger project. Ellen had agreed.</p><p>As she neared the street where Dolores lived, Anne Marie examined the neighborhood more closely than she had before. It consisted of mostly older homes, many of them in ill repair. Now Anne Marie couldn\u2019t help wondering if this was a safe place for Ellen\u2014or Dolores for that matter.</p><p>It\u2019d been weeks since she\u2019d seen the Falk home, which seemed even shabbier and more run-down now that she really looked at it. The front porch tilted, indicating the foundation had eroded on one side. The roof had a plastic tarp over part of it. Funny, Anne Marie hadn\u2019t noticed that before. The yard needed some serious attention; the flower beds sprouted weeds and a lone rosebush struggled for survival, choked off by the encroaching lawn. A pang went through Anne Marie at leaving Ellen here. Yet, this was her home....</p><p>\u201cAfter we say hello to your grandmother, I\u2019ll need your help carrying in the groceries.\u201d Before heading over to Dolores\u2019s house, Anne Marie and Ellen had picked up some necessities. She didn\u2019t think Dolores would be up to a trip to the grocery store anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ellen agreed. She\u2019d already put Baxter in the back and unfastened her seat belt.</p><p>With a smile, Anne Marie watched Ellen dash out of the car and fly across the yard. She threw open the front door, then barreled inside. By the time Anne Marie entered the house, she found Ellen in her grandmother\u2019s arms, both of them a little teary. For an instant Anne Marie felt like an intruder.</p><p>Dolores Falk looked up at Anne Marie. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for taking care of my girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was glad to do it,\u201d Anne Marie said simply.</p><p>Holding on to her grandmother, Ellen said, \u201cAnne Marie\u2019s still going to be my Lunch Buddy and she said I can see Baxter anytime I want. We\u2019re growing seeds and she taught me to knit and we knit every night after dinner when I\u2019m finished my homework.\u201d</p><p>Dolores had heard about Ellen\u2019s knitting at least a dozen times. The child was more animated today than Anne Marie had ever seen her.</p><p>Breaking away from her grandmother, Ellen raced toward the hallway. \u201cI want to see my room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have an actual bed for her at my place,\u201d Anne Marie explained. \u201cShe slept on a pull-out sofa.\u201d She wished now that she\u2019d purchased a bed for Ellen, but it hadn\u2019t seemed logical at the time. She couldn\u2019t possibly have known the girl would be with her a full month.</p><p>Obviously fatigued, Dolores sank into her recliner. \u201cI\u2019m just so grateful for everything you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss her.\u201d The apartment, tiny though it was, would seem empty without her.</p><p>Ellen tore back into the living room. \u201cShould we bring my clothes in now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Anne Marie said briskly. For a moment she\u2019d forgotten about Ellen\u2019s bags and the groceries. \u201cWe got a few things we thought you\u2019d need for the first couple of days,\u201d she told Dolores. \u201cEnough to last until you can get to the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>Dolores seemed about to weep. \u201cGod bless you.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie shrugged off her appreciation and, with Ellen at her side, returned to her vehicle. Baxter, lying in the backseat, didn\u2019t seem pleased to be left out of the action.</p><p>\u201cCan I take Baxter for a walk?\u201d Ellen asked as she pressed her nose to the car window.</p><p>\u201cHelp me first and then you can take him. Just be sure his leash is secure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>They collected Ellen\u2019s various bags, unloaded the groceries and brought everything inside. Anne Marie sorted through the cartons of milk and juice, the vegetables, cereal, cheese and bread, and organized them as logically as she could so Dolores wouldn\u2019t have any problem locating what she needed.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d she asked Dolores once Ellen had come back with the dog.</p><p>\u201cNo, no\u2014you\u2019ve done far more than I would\u2019ve thought to ask.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie moved toward the front door, reluctant to leave. \u201cEllen, finish your homework, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d Anne Marie said, trying to swallow the lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen hugged Baxter goodbye, then ran across the living room to throw her thin arms around Anne Marie, holding tight. Her shoulders trembled with her sobbing.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Anne Marie said, bending down. \u201cThis is your home, remember? You\u2019re back with your Grandma Dolores. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...\u201d Ellen sniffled. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too, but we\u2019ll see each other often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise, and I always keep my promises,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d She rubbed Ellen\u2019s back gently as the child nodded. \u201cIn fact, why don\u2019t I stop by tomorrow evening to see how everything\u2019s going?\u201d Glancing over at Dolores, she asked, \u201cIf that\u2019s okay with your grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be just fine,\u201d Dolores said.</p><p>Anne Marie left a few minutes later. As she drove away from the bedraggled little house, she experienced an overwhelming sense of loss. For one wild moment, she felt a compelling urge to turn back. She couldn\u2019t imagine what she\u2019d say if she did. Ellen belonged with her grandmother; Dolores deeply loved this child. So did she. Anne Marie realized it with a shock that galvanized her.</p><p>She understood now that what she\u2019d seen as affection, caring, a feeling of responsibility\u2014all emotions she\u2019d readily acknowledged\u2014added up to one thing. Love.</p><p>She loved this little girl and wanted to be part of her life for as long as she could.</p><p>\u201cWell, Baxter,\u201d she murmured, sighing loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me again.\u201d</p><p>Her Yorkie, who\u2019d been sitting up in the backseat, turned in a circle several times, then dropped down. He curled up, nose to tail, and Anne Marie thought he seemed as despondent as she was.</p><p>When she reached her quiet apartment, she roamed from room to room, feeling restless. Dissatisfied. Living here was only supposed to be a temporary situation. The apartment was empty when she\u2019d separated from Robert and it had seemed the logical place to live while they sorted out their differences. It really was time to look for a house, a home for her and Baxter. She might see if she could find one in the same area as Ellen, a fixer-upper she could keep for a while and then sell for a nice profit.</p><p>As she moved into the kitchen to prepare a sandwich, Anne Marie stopped abruptly, recognizing something about herself. She was different than she\u2019d been a month ago. She\u2019d gradually changed into a woman who could make her own wishes come true. A woman who was ready to move on with her life. This was the gift Ellen had given her. She\u2019d opened Anne Marie\u2019s eyes to the many ways she\u2019d been blessed, despite her losses, and the many possibilities that still existed.</p><p>Preparing for bed, she paused in the doorway to Ellen\u2019s room. The bed was a sofa again, and Baxter had nestled on the cushion and gone to sleep, as if he expected the little girl to return.</p><p>The room was neat and orderly. Nothing of Ellen remained, and yet Anne Marie felt her presence. Many a night she\u2019d stood right here, watching Ellen sleep. That ritual would come to an end now. But she couldn\u2019t be sad about it because Ellen was where she wanted and needed to be, with the grandmother who adored her.</p><p>\u201cSleep tight, sweetie,\u201d she whispered, then went to her own room to read before turning out the light.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>Lillie was as nervous as a bride the night before her wedding. Hector was coming to pick her up and bring her to his place for dinner. They\u2019d seen each other a number of times, but this was different.</p><p>Hector had invited her to his home.</p><p>Lillie felt as if she\u2019d passed some test, and that the invitation to visit his home was Hector\u2019s way of saying he trusted her and was willing to reveal more of his life.</p><p>When the doorbell rang, she pressed her hand over her heart and took a deep breath before walking to the front door and opening it. As always Hector was punctual.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Lillie,\u201d he said, bowing his head slightly. \u201cI hope you had a pleasant afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, yes, I had a lovely afternoon.\u201d Rather than explain her initial response, she gathered up her sweater, made of silver-blue cashmere, and her purse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d agonized over whether to ask him in, self-conscious about her wealth and her luxurious house. But it wasn\u2019t an issue, since he immediately asked if she was ready to leave.</p><p>After she\u2019d locked her door and set the alarm, he led her to his car, parked in her driveway. His manners were impeccable as he escorted her and made sure she was comfortably seated. His courtesies came from a soul-deep regard for others, a true considerateness; she knew that with absolute certainty. This was nothing as superficial as charm. It was a mark of respect.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry,\u201d he was saying once he\u2019d joined her in the vehicle.</p><p>Lillie was far too nervous to be hungry. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to this all day,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>He glanced over at her, his dark eyes intense. \u201cI have, too.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach pitched. From the first moment they\u2019d met, he\u2019d had an unprecedented effect on her. She felt things with him that she hadn\u2019t felt before. David had never shared much with her; he\u2019d been what her women\u2019s magazines now referred to as \u201cemotionally inaccessible.\u201d His affairs were part of that, of course. It wasn\u2019t until after his death that she\u2019d recognized how withdrawn she\u2019d become through the years. There had been a price to pay for ignoring his betrayals, for turning a blind eye to his shortcomings as a husband and lover. The price had been much higher than she\u2019d realized. Only now was she beginning to understand how repressed her feelings had become. She\u2019d learned to subdue her own emotions as well as her expectations.</p><p>Hector was talking about dinner, and she shook off her pensiveness.</p><p>\u201cYou made everything yourself?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter offered advice.\u201d</p> <p>Hector and his daughter seemed to be especially close. Like everything else about this man, she found that endearing\u2014and she couldn\u2019t help comparing it to David\u2019s relationship with Barbie. At first he\u2019d been disappointed not to have a son, but Barbie had quickly wrapped him around her little finger. He\u2019d accepted Lillie\u2019s inability to have other children and lavished his attention on his daughter. David could be generous and loving; he\u2019d certainly shown Barbie that side of himself. But Lillie considered him both uncommitted and morally weak in his emotional life. Yet he\u2019d been a scrupulously honest businessman.... She supposed that was a result of his skill at \u201ccompartmentalizing,\u201d which men were said to be good at, again according to her magazines.</p><p>\u201cI need to mention something about my home,\u201d Hector said, looking straight ahead as he concentrated on traffic. \u201cI don\u2019t live in a fancy neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour home is beautiful, Lillie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector, are you telling me you\u2019re ashamed of your home?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen please don\u2019t apologize for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou apologized for yours, remember?\u201d</p><p>She had. She\u2019d feared that once Hector saw her opulent home, the differences between their financial situations would discourage him. She\u2019d been wrong. He wasn\u2019t easily intimidated. At least, she didn\u2019t think so until he\u2019d brought up the subject of his own neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cPeople might talk about us, Lillie,\u201d Hector added. \u201cHowever, Rita\u2019s aware that I\u2019m seeing you and has been most supportive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter has been, too.\u201d Lillie didn\u2019t mention their initial conflict and the painful few days that had followed their disagreement.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told my sons about you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might not be as understanding as Rita.\u201d</p> <p>Lillie glanced at him. \u201cWill their opinion make a difference?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cI would like to tell you it wouldn\u2019t. The truth is, I don\u2019t know. My family is important and I trust that my children love me enough to want to see me happy. And you, Lillie, make me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Hector.\u201d His sincerity touched her heart. \u201cYou make me happy, too,\u201d she whispered in return.</p><p>Hector reached for her hand.</p><p>As soon as they turned onto Walnut Street, Lillie knew instantly which home was his. The yard was beautifully maintained, the flower beds splashed with brilliant color. When he pulled into the driveway of the house she\u2019d guessed was his, it was all Lillie could do not to congratulate herself.</p><p>Hector helped her out of the car and led her to the front door of the white-painted two-story house. The first thing she saw inside was a multitude of family pictures. They covered the walls and the top of the piano. The wall next to the stairs was another gallery of photographs. Lillie\u2019s gaze went to a portrait of Hector and his deceased wife. Angelina, maybe fifty in the picture, had been a slender, elegant woman.</p><p>\u201cThese are my children,\u201d he said, pointing to college graduation photos of his daughter and his two sons. \u201cThis is Manuel,\u201d he said, tapping the picture of his oldest son.</p><p>\u201cThe attorney,\u201d Lillie murmured. The young man in the cap and gown, proudly displaying his diploma, had serious eyes and a fierce look. Lillie could picture him in a courtroom vanquishing his opponent.</p><p>\u201cLuis,\u201d he continued, tapping one finger on the next photograph.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor.\u201d Unlike his brother, Lillie observed, Luis had gentle eyes that reminded her of Hector\u2019s. \u201cHe looks the most like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Hector said. \u201cAngelina and I always knew he\u2019d work in the health field. From the time he was a little boy, he wanted to help anyone in pain.\u201d</p><p>Yes, this son was most like his father.</p><p>\u201cAnd Rita,\u201d Hector said, going down the line of photographs.</p><p>His daughter was a true beauty who resembled her mother. There was an engaging warmth in her smile.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lovely,\u201d Lillie whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s a popular teacher.\u201d</p><p>The smells coming from the kitchen were enticing, and suddenly Lillie felt ravenous. Once she\u2019d torn her gaze from the photographs, she noticed that Hector had set the dining table with his best dishes; a small floral centerpiece sat in the middle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d He escorted her into the dining room.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. You\u2019re my guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector, I want to help.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated but finally agreed. \u201cIf you insist. You can cut the bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never did tell me what you\u2019re serving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a classic Mexican dish,\u201d Hector teased as he opened a drawer and pulled out a bread knife. \u201cIt\u2019s spaghetti. My daughter gave me the recipe. She even went to the store with me and chose the ingredients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to go to all that trouble,\u201d Lillie said, although she was flattered that he had. \u201cWe could eat potato chips and it would taste like ambrosia to me because I\u2019m here with you.\u201d</p><p>Hector grinned, then took a step closer. \u201cI have been lonely for a long time,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>Lillie had spent most of her marriage being lonely. \u201cI have, too,\u201d she told him.</p><p>For just a moment it seemed that he was about to kiss her. Their first kiss had been the evening they\u2019d attended the Frida Kahlo lecture at the Seattle Art Museum. At the end of the evening, he\u2019d dropped her at home; he\u2019d declined coffee but walked her to the door. It\u2019d been an awkward moment and by unspoken agreement they\u2019d each leaned forward and kissed. Lillie was eager to repeat the experience. Their kiss had been polite, almost chaste, but very satisfying....</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just reheating the sauce,\u201d he said, wielding a large wooden spoon.</p><p>\u201cHector?\u201d Lillie drew in a deep breath before plunging ahead.</p><p>The way she said his name seemed to alert him to the fact that she had something important to say.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lillie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it feels right to you, I hope you\u2019ll kiss me again.\u201d She didn\u2019t want him wondering\u2014or worrying\u2014about what her response might be.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His eyes sparkled with delight. \u201cI shall keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the bread knife and carefully sliced the loaf of French bread, arranging the pieces neatly on a serving plate.</p><p>After stirring the sauce, Hector boiled the spaghetti noodles; when they were ready, he placed them inside a beautiful hand-painted ceramic dish. Next he poured the meat-and-tomato sauce over the noodles. The salad, waiting in the refrigerator, was already mixed. Lillie put it on the table, along with the bread.</p><p>Hector opened a bottle of red wine that he told her Rita had recommended. Then he seated her at the table and sat across from her.</p><p>They toasted each other, touching glasses, and began the meal. She discovered that Hector preferred his food spicier than she did but he\u2019d made the sauce fairly mild, adding chili peppers to his own. Another example of his thoughtfulness.</p><p>In the beginning their conversation was tentative. But it wasn\u2019t long before the hesitation dissolved and they found any number of topics to discuss. They agreed on political issues and surprisingly had enjoyed some of the same films and novels. Hector bragged about his grandchildren and she told stories about her grandsons. The conversation flowed naturally from one subject to the next as they lingered over their wine. Afterward, despite Hector\u2019s protests, Lillie helped with the dishes. Her shoes hurt her feet, so she took them off and tucked a dishtowel into her waistband as she moved effortlessly around his kitchen.</p><p>Hector put on some easy-listening music from the \u201970s, and soon they were dancing about the room, twirling and laughing. He kissed her once, twice, and it was as natural as breathing. His touch left her with the most inexplicable urge to weep. Rather than allow him to see the effect his kisses had on her, she buried her face in his shoulder.</p><p>Hector released her and they both went back to cleaning the kitchen, dancing around each other as they did.</p><p>He was about to kiss her again when the back door opened and Manuel walked inside. Lillie recognized him from his photograph. \u201cDad, I need to borrow your\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly. \u201cDad!\u201d he barked, shouting to be heard above the music.</p><p>Instinctively Lillie stepped closer to Hector. He leaned over to turn off the CD player on the counter, and the resulting silence was almost shocking.</p><p>Hector straightened, putting his arm around Lillie\u2019s waist. \u201cSon, this is my friend, Lillie Higgins. Lillie, this is Manuel.\u201d</p><p>Manuel nodded politely in her direction but addressed his father. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you had a woman friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s told me quite a bit about you,\u201d Lillie said, feeling guilty although she wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>\u201cFunny, he hasn\u2019t said a word about you.\u201d Manuel gave her a cold look.</p><p>Hector placed one hand on her shoulder and spoke gently. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I will talk to my son privately.\u201d He ushered Manuel out of the room.</p><p>She nodded and finished wiping the kitchen counter. She rinsed and wrung out the cloth, then draped it over the faucet and removed her makeshift apron. Slipping on her shoes, she stood in the kitchen and waited for Hector. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Manuel left without saying anything else to Lillie and she could see from the look in Hector\u2019s eyes that the conversation hadn\u2019t gone well. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered and walked into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who owes you an apology,\u201d he murmured, holding her close. \u201cMy son was inexcusably rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Hector shook his head, obviously unwilling to repeat what his son had said. Lillie closed her eyes and remembered Barbie\u2019s immediate response when she\u2019d told her she was interested in a man who worked for a car dealership.</p> <p>\u201cGive him time to adjust to the idea,\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s the best thing to do.\u201d</p><p>He took Lillie home soon after that; they were both quiet during the drive. When they reached her house, Hector walked her to the door. She thanked him for dinner, they kissed goodnight and then he left. Not until she was inside did she realize that he hadn\u2019t asked to see her again.</p><p>Lillie felt sick.</p><p>This was the end; she was sure of it. His family and their opinion mattered more to Hector than his own happiness. Even if he was torn, and she knew he was, Hector would appease his children rather than fight for a relationship with her.</p> <p>When she didn\u2019t hear from him the next day or the day after that, Lillie decided to make this as painless as possible for them both. She wrote him a letter.</p><p>She\u2019d only intended to write a brief note but by the time she finished she\u2019d written three full pages. She described her list of Twenty Wishes and said that one of her wishes had been to meet an honorable man. She\u2019d found that man in him.</p><p>In the last paragraph she explained that she had no desire to damage his relationship with his children and felt it was best that they not see each other again.</p><p>With tears in her eyes, she dropped the letter off at the post office. After a quick phone call to Barbie, she booked a trip to the coast.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Anne Marie was fortunate enough to nab a spot in the Woodrow Wilson parking lot. She was back to the routine of Lunch Buddy dates and had brought Baxter with her for this visit.</p> <p>Yesterday, when Ellen and Anne Marie had spoken, the eight-year-old had told her how much she missed her canine friend.</p><p>Bringing Baxter today was a surprise, and Anne Marie could hardly wait to see the child\u2019s face light up.</p><p>The transition from Anne Marie\u2019s home to her grandmother\u2019s had gone smoothly. Anne Marie wished she could say Ellen\u2019s departure had been as straightforward for her. The apartment just wasn\u2019t the same without Ellen; it was still too quiet, too empty. Her life felt that way, too. The child had found a vulnerable space in her heart, and Anne Marie had discovered how much she craved love. She wanted to give it as well as receive it.</p><p>Of course, she was in regular touch with Ellen and would continue to be so. She\u2019d already arranged a trip to Woodland Park Zoo for that Saturday. Anne Marie was looking forward to it and she knew Ellen was, too. Dolores needed the break and seemed to appreciate Anne Marie\u2019s interest in the girl.</p><p>Ellen\u2019s grandmother was a pitiable woman. She blamed herself for what had become of her two daughters, and all the love in her heart was reserved for her only granddaughter. Dolores lived for Ellen. Since she\u2019d been released from the hospital, Dolores had told Anne Marie that she\u2019d searched for more than a year before she\u2019d found Ellen. Once she did locate the child in the California foster care program, it had taken nearly another year to convince Child Protective Services to grant her custody of the little girl. Ellen had been with her grandmother for three years now, and the older woman had given her the security she so desperately needed.</p><p>As Anne Marie headed into the school, with Baxter on his leash, she saw Helen Mayer, the counselor, hurrying toward her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am that you\u2019re here,\u201d Helen said. \u201cThe woman who answered the phone at the bookstore told me you were on your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong? Is Ellen okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease\u2014come into my office.\u201d</p><p>With a growing sense of panic, Anne Marie picked up Baxter and followed Helen into the building. She couldn\u2019t imagine what had happened, but all her instincts said it was bad.</p><p>The counselor waited until Anne Marie was inside her office, then closed the door and walked slowly to her desk. She sat down and turned to look at Anne Marie.</p><p>Tension twisted Anne Marie\u2019s stomach as she lowered herself into a chair. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, placing Baxter on the floor near her feet.</p><p>\u201cWe received word this morning that Dolores Falk died sometime last night.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie gasped and covered her mouth with her hand. \u201cDid...Ellen find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently she overslept because her grandmother didn\u2019t wake her for school. According to what I learned, she made her own breakfast and decided to let her grandmother sleep. On her way to school she met a neighbor who inquired about Dolores. Ellen explained that her grandmother wasn\u2019t feeling well and that she was still in bed. A short while later, the neighbor went to check on her and when she couldn\u2019t rouse Dolores, she called 911.\u201d</p><p>At least the child was spared the trauma of discovering the body. Anne Marie thanked God for that. But this probably meant Ellen didn\u2019t know yet.</p><p>\u201cIs she here?\u201d Anne Marie knew how hard Ellen would take the news. Although she dreaded telling her, Anne Marie thought she was the best person to do so. Poor Ellen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Helen Mayer said.</p><p>Anne Marie barely heard her. \u201cI\u2019ll make arrangements to get her things and bring her home with me.\u201d She wondered if Dolores had made funeral arrangements; she\u2019d have to find out.</p><p>After burying Robert, Anne Marie had some experience in such matters. The staff at the funeral home had been both kind and respectful. Anne Marie would like them to handle the arrangements for Dolores, too, if that was possible.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you heard me,\u201d the other woman said. \u201cEllen isn\u2019t at school.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie stared at her, uncomprehending. \u201cWhere is she then?\u201d</p><p>Helen Mayer placed her hands on the desk and leaned forward. \u201cAbout an hour ago, Child Protective Services took her away.\u201d</p><p>The words hardly made sense. \u201cWhat? What do you mean they took her away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean they came to the school, told us Ellen\u2019s grandmother had died and that they had to find a home for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>Helen Mayer gestured helplessly. \u201cThe only other relatives Ellen has are her mother, who has relinquished all parental rights, and her aunt, who is apparently incarcerated.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie was well aware that Ellen had no one else. That was the very reason the child had come to live with her while Dolores was hospitalized.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been placed in a foster home.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I realize it\u2019s a shock. I tried to contact you but you didn\u2019t answer your cell. The woman at the bookstore said you\u2019d be here soon.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie felt disoriented but she had to focus on Ellen. The girl must be terrified. She had to get to her, reassure her that everything would be all right. \u201cI have the name of the social worker assigned to her. She gave me her business card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Helen asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring Ellen back to live with me.\u201d There was no question about that.</p><p>The counselor sighed with relief. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie was on her feet, ready to take action. She committed half a dozen traffic violations in her rush to get back to the bookstore. She prayed she hadn\u2019t thrown out the social worker\u2019s card. In her agitation she couldn\u2019t even recall the woman\u2019s name.</p><p>With Baxter at her heels, Anne Marie ran up the stairs. Heart pounding, she stood in the middle of her kitchen while she tried to remember where she\u2019d put the woman\u2019s card.</p><p>Suddenly she remembered. She hurried into her bedroom and jerked open the top drawer of her nightstand. Yes\u2014it was there, and the woman\u2019s name was Evelyn Boyle. She collapsed onto her bed and grabbed the phone.</p><p>Her hand trembled as she punched out the number. She listened to an automated system that requested the extension, which Anne Marie dutifully supplied. The phone rang five times before Evelyn\u2019s voice mail came on.</p><p>\u201cThis is Anne Marie Roche,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m calling about Ellen Falk. Please contact me at your earliest convenience.\u201d She gave three phone numbers\u2014home, work and cell\u2014afraid the woman would give up too easily if she couldn\u2019t reach her on the first try.</p><p>The waiting was intolerable.</p><p>Anne Marie paced, she cleaned out drawers, then paced some more. When she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, she drove to Dolores\u2019s house. The place was locked up. The neighbor who\u2019d found her said the coroner\u2019s office had already removed the body. No one knew anything about Ellen or where she might be. Anne Marie gave the woman her numbers, desperate to learn whatever she could.</p><p>When her cell phone finally did ring, it was after four and Anne Marie nearly ripped it out of her purse in her haste.</p><p>\u201cThis is Anne Marie Roche,\u201d she said, the words tumbling over each other.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie, this is Evelyn Boyle returning your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ellen?\u201d she cried. The child must be frantic. Anne Marie was close to panic herself. Ellen needed her and Anne Marie needed to be with Ellen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but the only thing I could do was place her in a temporary foster home. It\u2019s a short-term solution until I can find a permanent home for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her,\u201d Anne Marie blurted out. \u201cBring her to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could. If you recall, when I visited the bookstore I suggested you apply for a license to become Ellen\u2019s foster parent. I didn\u2019t hear from you after that.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie wanted to kick herself for not following through. Had she been able to look into the future, of course, she would\u2019ve started the paperwork that very day. How was she to know? Dolores had been doing so well.</p><p>\u201cI promised Dolores Falk that Ellen would never go back into the foster care system. What can I do now? How long will it take to be approved?\u201d Her fear was that the paperwork would still take months. By then, Ellen might have been moved any number of times. Ms. Boyle had said the home where she was currently placed was temporary, which implied that Ellen would be transferred soon.</p><p>She remembered Dolores Falk telling her it had taken a year to find Ellen once she\u2019d learned she had a granddaughter, although Anne Marie didn\u2019t know how much of that time had been spent searching in other states.</p><p>\u201cWe can have a background check done on you in twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Ellen can come and live with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We want what\u2019s best for Ellen and I feel that\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>The relief was enough to flood her eyes with tears. \u201cThank you. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The social worker explained the process. Anne Marie tried to pay attention but her mind kept darting off in different directions. One thing that did register was that there\u2019d be a home study, which hadn\u2019t been scheduled yet. The apartment, small as it was, hardly seemed suitable. That would mean an immediate move. Anne Marie didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d do whatever was necessary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf everything checks out, I should be able to deliver Ellen to you sometime tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie tried to recall any possible blemish on her record. She had a speeding ticket, but thankfully, nothing of any real importance.</p><p>All the next day, Anne Marie waited. The tension was almost more than she could bear. She left three messages for Evelyn Boyle, wanting to make sure there weren\u2019t any problems with her background clearance. The social worker didn\u2019t return any of the calls.</p><p>Had Anne Marie known where Ellen was staying, she would\u2019ve driven there and parked outside the house.</p> <p>When she hadn\u2019t heard anything by five o\u2019clock on Thursday afternoon, Anne Marie was positive something had gone wrong. She\u2019d been useless the entire day, too nervous and jittery to concentrate.</p><p>Just as she was about to give up in despair, the door to the bookstore opened and Evelyn Boyle came in with Ellen at her side.</p><p>Ellen looked at Anne Marie and burst into tears as she bolted toward her.</p><p>Anne Marie fell to her knees, her arms open for Ellen.</p><p>They clung tearfully to each other. \u201cYou promised, you promised,\u201d Ellen sobbed against her shoulder. \u201cYou said\u2014you said...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Anne Marie whispered, brushing Ellen\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re here now, and no one\u2019s going to take you away from me.\u201d</p><p>Ellen sniffled. \u201cGrandma Dolores went to live with Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anyone who loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ellen,\u201d Anne Marie whispered, tears streaking her face. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be my little girl from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can live with you?\u201d</p> <p>Anne Marie couldn\u2019t speak, so she just nodded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to go back to the foster house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not ever again.\u201d</p><p>Still sobbing, Ellen tightened her arms around Anne Marie\u2019s neck. \u201cEveryone I love goes away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore, Ellen,\u201d she promised. \u201cNot if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved my mommy and she...she did bad things and she left me and then Grandma Dolores d-died and then you left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t leave you,\u201d Anne Marie insisted. \u201cI would never leave you.\u201d</p><p>They continued to hold each other until Baxter started to bark at the foot of the stairs. Anne Marie released Ellen who ran to open the door. The dog immediately did a dance of joy at the sight of his friend.</p> <p>Wiping the tears from her face, Anne Marie stood to find Evelyn Boyle watching her.</p><p>\u201cI believe we have a good placement for Ellen,\u201d she said, her own eyes moist.</p><p>Anne Marie wasn\u2019t going to make another mistake. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t want to be Ellen\u2019s foster parent.\u201d</p><p>A look of shock broke out across the other woman\u2019s face. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to adopt her,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to make Ellen my legal daughter.\u201d The child was already her daughter in every way that mattered. It was time to make that official.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Anne Marie said, speaking softly into the receiver. It was late Monday evening, and Ellen had just gone to sleep. The poor kid still wasn\u2019t sleeping well, so Anne Marie didn\u2019t want to risk waking her. Every night since Dolores\u2019s death, Ellen had ended up crawling into bed with Anne Marie and crying herself to sleep. The girl had suffered yet another loss. Being taken out of school, informed that her grandmother was dead and then shuffled off to a foster home hadn\u2019t helped.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie?\u201d her mother murmured. \u201cMy goodness, I haven\u2019t heard from you in weeks. Is something wrong? There must be if you\u2019re phoning me this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve called earlier.\u201d Handling the funeral arrangements and looking after Ellen had kept her busy. But the truth was, it hadn\u2019t occurred to her to contact her mother until that night.</p><p>Even now she hesitated, fearing her mother\u2019s reaction once she learned that Anne Marie was going to adopt Ellen. Her mother had made her disapproval known when she decided to marry Robert. She\u2019d been equally negative when Anne Marie purchased the bookstore. Laura wasn\u2019t a risk-taker and she\u2019d been convinced that Anne Marie would be throwing away her investment. She generally believed in living a cautious, conventional life, although she wouldn\u2019t have put it in those terms.</p><p>Despite her mother\u2019s reactions in the past, Anne Marie felt compelled to seek her out. Perhaps it had to do with becoming a mother herself....</p><p>Might as well just blurt it out. \u201cI thought I should tell you that you\u2019re about to become a grandmother.\u201d</p><p>A strained silence followed her announcement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...pregnant?\u201d Once again, Laura Bostwick\u2019s reproach was evident. \u201cI know you want a baby, Anne Marie, but I don\u2019t think you have any idea what life\u2019s really like for a single mother. Oh, dear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t...I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d Anne Marie didn\u2019t get the opportunity to explain before her mother interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, who\u2019s the father? No, don\u2019t tell me. Obviously there\u2019s a problem, otherwise you would\u2019ve married him. You aren\u2019t secretly married, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to know any more about him. He\u2019s married, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry. I said not to tell me and then like a fool I ask. It\u2019s none of my business. Well, you\u2019re going to have a child. When are you due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit more complicated than that,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, you haven\u2019t done anything stupid, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Anne Marie asked, a little taken aback.</p><p>\u201cArtificial insemination, that\u2019s what. I heard about it at the hairdresser\u2019s. Apparently a lot of women are using artificial methods to get pregnant. Please don\u2019t tell me you went to one of those fertility clinics and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, I\u2019m adopting.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d finally shocked her mother into total silence.</p><p>\u201cRemember Ellen Falk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was her Lunch Buddy. You met her the Saturday before St. Patrick\u2019s Day. We had lunch with you.\u201d Surely her mother hadn\u2019t forgotten.</p><p>There was another silence. Then Laura said, \u201cLet me see if I have this straight. This second-grade girl you agreed to have lunch with once a week is the one you\u2019re going to adopt?\u201d Her mother sounded incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom. She came to stay with me, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, and I told you I thought it was rather nervy of that girl\u2019s grandmother to call you in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDolores Falk died.\u201d</p><p>This information appeared to unsettle Laura. \u201cOh...dear. That is a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen doesn\u2019t have anyone else,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fond of the child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her as though I\u2019d given birth to her myself,\u201d Anne Marie confessed. \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to the social worker and asked to be considered as Ellen\u2019s adoptive mother.\u201d She closed her eyes, certain her mother would discourage her, as she had with every important decision Anne Marie had ever made, from the school she\u2019d chosen to the man she\u2019d married.</p><p>\u201cOh, Anne Marie...\u201d</p><p>She waited for it.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a wonderful thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw fell so fast and hard, Anne Marie was surprised she hadn\u2019t dislocated it. \u201cYou...think I\u2019m doing the right thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear girl, you\u2019re old enough to decide what you want to do with your own life. If this child means so much to you, then by all means bring her into the family.\u201d</p><p>As far as Anne Marie could remember, this was the first time in her adult life that her mother had supported her choices. She didn\u2019t understand it, other than to assume the child had won over her mother\u2019s heart in the hour or two they\u2019d spent together.</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be any legal problems, will there?\u201d Laura went on to ask.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Evelyn Boyle had to do a search for Ellen\u2019s birth certificate and find out who was listed as the father. He would need to be contacted and given the opportunity to state his wishes.</p><p>Anne Marie was pretty sure Ellen\u2019s biological father didn\u2019t even know she existed. But if Evelyn managed to track him down...He could decide to declare his parental rights and Anne Marie would have no option but to relinquish Ellen. The thought made her feel ill.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her biological mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave up all rights to her daughter three years ago when Ellen went to live with her grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean the mother can\u2019t change her mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that. Anyway, if it wasn\u2019t for Dolores, Ellen might\u2019ve been put up for adoption years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe social worker was encouraging.\u201d The fact that Ellen was living with Anne Marie and that they\u2019d so obviously bonded was a hopeful sign. However, the issue of Ellen\u2019s biological father still had to be resolved.</p><p>Anne Marie suddenly remembered something. \u201cThe wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d her mother said. \u201cStop mumbling, Anne Marie. How many times do I have to tell you? Speak up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom. I was just thinking out loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about wishes? That\u2019s what you said, isn\u2019t it? It certainly sounded like wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen has a list of wishes. Twenty wishes.\u201d Anne Marie had no intention of referring to her own list or those of the other widows. Her mother would no doubt throw scorn on the idea or dismiss it as childish.</p><p>\u201cChildren do that sort of thing,\u201d her mother said, confirming her suspicion. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give it any mind. I suppose she wished for a mother and father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no...nothing like that.\u201d Then, because she felt she had to explain after bringing it up, she said, \u201cEllen wants to meet her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery child wants that. My guess is she\u2019s well rid of him.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the conversation made no impact on Anne Marie. A few minutes after she ended the call, she wandered into Ellen\u2019s tiny bedroom and watched the child as she slept, one hand flung out and resting on the dog, who was cuddled up close beside her. The poor kid was exhausted and seemed to be lost in her dreams.</p><p>Earlier, in between working at the store and looking after Ellen, Anne Marie had called the school. She\u2019d updated Helen Mayer, who\u2019d cheered when Anne Marie told her about adopting Ellen. She\u2019d even offered a character reference should any be needed in the adoption process.</p><p>Anne Marie was just afraid the proceedings might not get that far.</p><p>On Saturday morning, three days after Dolores\u2019s death, they\u2019d visited the funeral home and arranged for a small private service. A short obituary written by Anne Marie appeared in the paper. Several neighbors stopped by on Sunday to pay their respects. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The house was a rental property and Anne Marie had until the end of the month to get it cleaned out and ready for the next tenants.</p><p>That afternoon, with a few friends gathered around, Anne Marie and Ellen had laid Dolores Falk to rest. Throughout the service, Ellen stayed by Anne Marie\u2019s side. She didn\u2019t weep, although her eyes filled with tears more than once. Afterward, they\u2019d returned to the apartment alone.</p><p>\u201cI think Grandma Dolores was ready to live with Jesus,\u201d Ellen had said calmly as she reached for her knitting bag. She seemed to find solace in knitting.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d glanced up. \u201cI saw it in her eyes. She told me she was tired.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie had thought her heart would break.</p><p>Late Tuesday afternoon, Anne Marie and Ellen were in the apartment, planning a visit to Dolores\u2019s house to sort out what to keep and what to give away, when the phone rang. It was Cathy in the bookstore. \u201cThe social worker\u2019s here to talk to you. Should I send her up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Evelyn Boyle had said she\u2019d hoped to attend the memorial service the previous day; she\u2019d also said she had a court date and wasn\u2019t sure how long that would last.</p><p>Anne Marie waited anxiously for her at the top of the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cHow did everything go yesterday?\u201d Evelyn asked, taking the steps one by one.</p><p>\u201cIt was very nice.\u201d Several of Dolores\u2019s neighbors had attended, and Helen Mayer from the school had been there, too, along with Lydia, Elise and Lillie. Dolores had requested that her remains be cremated; Anne Marie and Ellen would receive the ashes at a later date.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I couldn\u2019t be there.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie bit her lip until it hurt. \u201cDo you have news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d The middle-aged woman paused on the landing and placed her hand over her heart. \u201cStairs are God\u2019s way of telling me I\u2019m not getting any younger.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie resisted the urge to shake her by the shoulders and demand to know what she\u2019d learned. \u201cCome in, please,\u201d she invited, doing her best to disguise her nervousness.</p> <p>The social worker stepped into the kitchen. Ellen sat at the table knitting, with Anne Marie\u2019s notes for the disbursement of Dolores\u2019s belongings scattered about. \u201cMy goodness,\u201d Evelyn murmured, \u201cwho taught you to knit so well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie,\u201d Ellen said without looking up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ms. Boyle, but I can\u2019t talk now. I\u2019m counting stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could move into the living room so Ms. Boyle and I can chat. Okay?\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d With the ball of yarn under her arm, Ellen carried her wool and needles into the other room and, Anne Marie hoped, out of earshot.</p><p>Evelyn Boyle pulled out a kitchen chair and sat down as Anne Marie gathered up her notes and put them in a loose pile. Evelyn placed her briefcase on the table and opened it, then ceremoniously removed Ellen\u2019s file.</p><p>Anne Marie sat across from her. Waiting...</p><p>\u201cI located a copy of Ellen\u2019s birth certificate and the father is listed\u2014\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s heart slammed hard against her ribs. She hadn\u2019t expected this. \u201cYou have a name?\u201d Okay, she\u2019d deal with it. No matter what, Anne Marie would find a way to be part of Ellen\u2019s life and she didn\u2019t care what it cost.</p> <p>Evelyn frowned. \u201cIf I\u2019d been allowed to finish, you would\u2019ve heard me say that Ellen\u2019s father is listed as unknown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means...\u201d Anne Marie was too excited to complete the question.</p><p>\u201cIt means that as far as the State of Washington is concerned, you\u2019re free to adopt Ellen Falk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Anne Marie whispered, her throat thickening with emotion. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you said anything to Ellen?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie had n\u2019t felt she could until she had all the facts. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s tell her now.\u201d The social worker called out to the eight-year-old. \u201cEllen, would you please join us in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Ellen immediately came inside and sat down in the chair next to Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ellen.\u201d</p><p>The child regarded the social worker suspiciously. Anne Marie didn\u2019t blame her; it was Evelyn Boyle who\u2019d taken her out of class and uprooted her entire life with the news of her grandmother\u2019s death.</p><p>Hoping to reassure Ellen, Anne Marie leaned over and gently touched her arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you think if Anne Marie became your mother?\u201d Evelyn asked. \u201cWould you like that?\u201d</p><p>Ellen didn\u2019t answer right away. Then she turned and looked at Anne Marie. \u201cWould I call you Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cOr you could call me Anne Marie. Whatever you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I have play dates with my friend Cassie if you were my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Anne Marie remembered the day of the school concert, when she\u2019d been approached by the mother of Ellen\u2019s friend about a possible exchange of play dates.</p><p>Ellen looked from Anne Marie to the social worker. \u201cWould it mean no one could ever take me away again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one, not ever,\u201d Anne Marie promised.</p><p>Ellen shrugged. \u201cI guess it would be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d Anne Marie teased. \u201cYou guess?\u201d</p><p>Ellen\u2019s face lit up with a huge smile. \u201cI\u2019d like it a whole lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would, too,\u201d Anne Marie told her.</p><p>Ellen bounded out of her chair and threw her arms around Anne Marie\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Evelyn Boyle whispered. \u201cThis is just perfect. It\u2019s cases like this that make everything else worthwhile.\u201d She opened the file again. \u201cI have all the paperwork with me. Be warned, though, the process will take about six months.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t care how long it took. The paperwork was a mere formality.</p><p>She already had her daughter, and Ellen had her mother.</p><p>Nothing would ever come between them again.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>\u201cTell me where we\u2019re going,\u201d Mark said, wheeling his chair alongside Barbie on 4th Avenue. They\u2019d left Seattle Fitness and, after some pestering on her part, Mark had agreed to join her. She refused to allow his mood to taint this lovely May afternoon. The sun was shining, and she was in love. Mark loved her, too, although he wasn\u2019t ready to admit it yet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret. But we\u2019re going to meet a couple of my friends first,\u201d she explained. He knew that and had already agreed. \u201cStop acting so cranky.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. \u201cYou might not have noticed, but I don\u2019t do well with most people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you\u2019ll like Anne Marie and Ellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark, please, we\u2019ve been through this.\u201d She found it difficult to hold back a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou cheated,\u201d Mark grumbled. \u201cYou lured me here under false pretenses, telling me you had a surprise for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have a surprise for you,\u201d she said, ignoring his protests. \u201cBesides, a deal is a deal.\u201d</p><p>Mark slowed his pace. \u201cI might be in a wheelchair, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wheelchair doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this.\u201d They\u2019d struck a bargain, and she was going to ensure he kept his part of it. She\u2019d promised him dinner and an evening for just the two of them\u2014after he\u2019d met her friends. She hadn\u2019t told him yet that dinner would be at her house.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play fair,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. You agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I remind you that you had your legs wrapped around my waist at the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did I?\u201d She loved being in the pool with Mark, especially when they had the entire area to themselves. It was never more than ten or fifteen minutes at the end of a session, and it didn\u2019t always happen. But when it did...The water seemed to free him, allowing him to show his need for her in ways he never would while sitting in his chair. They played in the water, teased and kissed and chased each other. Gradually, the barriers Mark had erected against her, against the world, were coming down.</p><p>\u201cThese are two of your gal pals who also have a list of Twenty Wishes, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Anne Marie has a list and I believe Ellen\u2019s got one, as well.\u201d</p><p>Mark still wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cBut why do I have to meet them?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cDo you need a reason for everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, I do,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cThat\u2019s just how I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re making such a fuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, but at least tell me where we\u2019re going now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you must know,\u201d she said, and smiled down at him, \u201cwe\u2019re meeting them at a Burger King.\u201d She\u2019d been looking forward to introducing him to Anne Marie for quite a while.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t eat fast food.\u201d</p><p>Barbie knew Mark was a real stickler about his diet. For one thing, he had to be careful about his weight.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t eating there. I\u2019m making dinner at my place.\u201d</p><p>Mark\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cI can\u2019t get into your house,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cMark,\u201d she said, coming to a halt. \u201cWould I invite you if you couldn\u2019t get your wheelchair into my home?\u201d</p><p>He studied her closely. \u201cYou have a ramp?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>His eyes revealed his shock. \u201cYou\u2019re serious about us. You must be, if you\u2019re going to all this trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you finished arguing with me now?\u201d She started walking again and had gone several feet before she realized he hadn\u2019t budged. \u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he wheeled toward her. \u201cYou really know how to get to a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you think so.\u201d The joy that coursed through her was enough to send her dancing through the streets.</p><p>When they reached the Burger King restaurant, Barbie held open the door. As soon as they were inside, Ellen skipped toward her. \u201cBarbie! Barbie\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly when she saw Mark.</p><p>\u201cEllen, this is my friend Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Ellen said and solemnly held out her hand, which Mark shook. \u201cI saw you before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the St. Patrick\u2019s Day party in Freeway Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I see you?\u201d</p><p>Ellen shrugged. \u201cYou were watching Barbie.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the way Barbie remembered it. \u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even watch the singers,\u201d Ellen elaborated, studying Mark. \u201cThe whole show, all you did was look at Barbie.\u201d</p><p>Mark shifted uncomfortably and was saved from having to respond by Anne Marie who\u2019d just joined them.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Mark,\u201d she said. \u201cBarbie\u2019s told me about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she really?\u201d He twisted around to stare up at her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only said the most flattering things,\u201d Anne Marie told him with a grin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>True, Barbie thought; she hadn\u2019t made a secret of how she felt about Mark.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just finishing our meal.\u201d Anne Marie led them to the table littered with the remains of their dinner. They\u2019d evidently ordered hamburgers and fries.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie and I signed up for karate lessons,\u201d Ellen explained, her excitement unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cKarate?\u201d Barbie repeated. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s on my list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I decided I might as well join her,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>\u201cWe already had one lesson. We\u2019re going to the karate place right after we have our drinks.\u201d She pointed at a carton of chocolate milk.</p><p>\u201cKarate, huh? I wouldn\u2019t want to meet either of you alone in a dark alley,\u201d Mark teased. \u201cI can picture it now. You\u2019ll warn me off by telling me you\u2019ve had two\u2014count \u2019em, two\u2014karate lessons. I\u2019ll be shaking in my boots.\u201d</p><p>Ellen giggled.</p> <p>Barbie noticed that Mark was grinning, too. He so rarely showed any emotion, and it pleased her to know he liked her friends. But then, she\u2019d predicted that he would.</p><p>Mark turned to Anne Marie. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who started this Twenty Wishes business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour of us\u2014all widows\u2014came up with the idea together,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any wishes?\u201d Ellen asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSeveral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever made a list?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I have, Ellen. Do you recommend it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Ellen returned seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful if you have a real list. Otherwise you might forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Mark concurred.</p><p>\u201cYour heart has to let your head know what it wants,\u201d the child added.</p><p>\u201cYou sound very wise for one so young,\u201d Mark said, raising his eyebrows. \u201cWhere did you learn this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie told me. It\u2019s true, too. I didn\u2019t even know how much I wanted a mom until I put it on my list of Twenty Wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wrote that down?\u201d Anne Marie asked, apparently surprised by this revelation.</p><p>Ellen nodded, her eyes downcast.</p> <p>\u201cYou never showed me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d the girl said. \u201cI wrote your name in pencil beside my wish \u2019cause if I could choose my own mom, I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie slid her arm around Ellen. \u201cIf I could have any little girl in the world, it would be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie\u2019s adopting Ellen,\u201d Barbie explained for Mark\u2019s benefit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better scoot.\u201d Anne Marie smiled. \u201cLike Ellen said, we\u2019re on our way to karate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKarate Kid and Mom, the sequel,\u201d Barbie joked.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, we\u2019re going to see Melissa and help her work on wedding plans,\u201d Ellen said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my stepdaughter,\u201d Anne Marie told Mark.</p><p>\u201cI might get to be in the wedding! Melissa said she needs a little girl to help serve the cake and Anne Marie said what about Ellen and Melissa said she thought that was a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a grand idea myself.\u201d Barbie knew the difficult relationship Anne Marie had with her stepdaughter and was delighted by the way things had changed.</p><p>They left, and Barbie sat down in one of the chairs vacated by her friends. \u201cSo,\u201d she murmured, \u201cyou only had eyes for me last March, huh?\u201d She reached for a leftover French fry and dipped it in ketchup.</p><p>Mark avoided her gaze. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d let that pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was just the third time we met.\u201d If it took all night, she\u2019d force him to admit how he felt about her.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re crazy about me,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cI already told you I\u2019m willing to go along for the ride, however long it lasts.\u201d His voice didn\u2019t betray a hint of sentiment.</p><p>\u201cMonday-night movies.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged casually. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLap swims on Tuesday and Thursdays.\u201d</p><p>He sloughed that off, as well. \u201cWe could both use the exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner at my house tonight.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cSure. Why not?\u201d</p><p>Barbie took a crumpled hamburger wrapper and smoothed it out. Then with the ketchup-dipped fry, she drew a heart. \u201cWhat am I getting out of this relationship?\u201d she asked in conversational tones. \u201cSo far, I seem to be the one doing all the giving.\u201d</p><p>Mark tensed. \u201cI\u2019ve asked myself that from the start. I told you anytime you want out, all you need to do is say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d she asked and snapped her fingers.</p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d Mark echoed, snapping his own.</p><p>\u201cNo regrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cNo explanations?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo looking back, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on my end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if that isn\u2019t enough for me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His face tightened and his eyes went hard. \u201cLet\u2019s clear the air right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what do you want from me?\u201d he demanded, none too gently.</p><p>Taking the same French fry, she scribbled out the heart. This discussion wasn\u2019t one she\u2019d intended to have and yet she couldn\u2019t stop herself. Her pulse raced. She was afraid that by pressuring him for a response she\u2019d put everything on the line. She\u2019d chosen the one sure way to lose Mark.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I want,\u201d she replied, unable to look at him.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d he countered, \u201cotherwise we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy list of wishes...\u201d she said, and her voice faltered.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, those Twenty Wishes you and your friends have.\u201d His tone had a mocking quality, which made her furious.</p><p>\u201cYou might think they\u2019re silly, but they\u2019re not!\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say they were,\u201d he said calmly. He could be so difficult to talk to sometimes. Squaring her shoulders, she met his eyes. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll tell you what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I was hoping you would.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t like this. The truth would probably scare him off. Still, it was a risk Barbie had to take. \u201cI want to be loved,\u201d she said. There, it was out.</p><p>\u201cBy me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one I love.\u201d She might as well go for broke, and he could either reject her right now or accept her.</p><p>For a long time Mark didn\u2019t say anything, and when he did, regret weighted each word. \u201cI don\u2019t want to love you,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>So that was how it was going to be.</p><p>Barbie swallowed painfully. Hard as it was, she\u2019d rather he was honest. \u201cThank you for not leading me on,\u201d she managed to say through quivering lips. She stood up to leave.</p><p>Mark caught her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to love you,\u201d he repeated, \u201cbut I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d She could hardly believe it, yet she knew it was true. He let his love shine from his eyes and his fingers tightened around hers.</p><p>\u201cI have practically from the first moment I saw you at that theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to kick me out, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you scared me to death,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cBut regardless of what I said or did, you wouldn\u2019t go away.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a shaky smile and sat back down, dragging her chair close to him, their knees touching.</p><p>\u201cThen before I knew it,\u201d Mark muttered, his eyes closed, \u201cI was dreaming about you.\u201d</p><p>Barbie savored every word.</p><p>\u201cFor the first time since the accident, I\u2019d wake up each morning with a sense of...hope. I\u2019d go to the movies and hope you\u2019d stay away and at the same time, I\u2019d hope you\u2019d show up\u2014and then I\u2019d curse myself for being so stupid. Acting like that, I was just looking for more heartache.\u201d</p><p>Breathless, Barbie didn\u2019t trust herself to speak. This was everything she\u2019d craved, everything she wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful you came into my life,\u201d Mark said and all his intensity was focused on her. \u201cI can\u2019t say it any plainer than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean forced my way into your life, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and then grew serious again. \u201cYou want my heart? You\u2019ve got it, Barbie. You\u2019ve had it all along.\u201d Then he did something completely out of character. Reaching for the paper crown left behind by a birthday group, he placed it on his head and leaned over to kiss her.</p><p>Barbie leaned back and stared at him as a chill raced down her arms. With tears blinding her eyes, she held both hands to her lips. Despite all her efforts, she doubled over and started to weep.</p><p>\u201cBarbie?\u201d Mark touched her back. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She straightened and noticed that the paper crown sat crookedly on his head. Her wish. She\u2019d wanted to be kissed by a prince. She\u2019d known it was a ridiculous request\u2014yet it had been fulfilled.</p><p>Mark was her prince. He loved her.</p><p>And she loved him.</p><p>Slipping her arms around his shoulders, she hugged him with such exuberance she nearly toppled his wheelchair. \u201cI\u2019m going to love you for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNow do you think we can get out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Is the aroma of those burgers getting to you and weakening your resolve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing getting to me is you. I think it\u2019s time you showed me what you learned on the Internet.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. Mark didn\u2019t need to remind her what she\u2019d looked up weeks ago.</p><p>All she needed to know was that he loved her.</p><p>As much as she loved him.</p><p>Everything else they\u2019d figure out with a little inventiveness and a lot of time.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>Thursday afternoon, Anne Marie waited for her pulse to slow before she called Robert\u2019s office. Even after nearly two years, the number was ingrained in her memory.</p><p>Anne Marie knew she finally had to see Rebecca Gilroy. She didn\u2019t want to show up without warning, so she\u2019d decided to phone Robert\u2019s assistant and make a formal appointment first.</p><p>She had to know the truth before she could put this behind her\u2014or at least in perspective.</p><p>Was the child Robert\u2019s? If so, she wondered why Rebecca hadn\u2019t come forward. Robert\u2019s son deserved part of his estate, was entitled to an inheritance. Despite the circumstances, that was only right.</p><p>Her heart in her throat, she made the call. A moment later, she heard Rebecca\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cThis is Rebecca Gilroy. How may I help you?\u201d The young woman, now presumably an assistant to one of the other partners, sounded businesslike and professional.</p><p>Anne Marie took a deep breath. \u201cHello, Rebecca,\u201d she said, speaking quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s Anne Marie Roche, Robert\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca\u2019s tone softened instantly. \u201cAnne Marie, of course. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d Which was true. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBusy.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie couldn\u2019t tell if this was a brush-off or an indication that Rebecca couldn\u2019t speak now.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t keep you then,\u201d she said, following the other woman\u2019s lead. \u201cI was hoping we could get together soon. Would that be possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me?\u201d Rebecca didn\u2019t bother to conceal her surprise, or her reluctance.</p> <p>\u201cCould we meet for lunch? When it\u2019s convenient for you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose lunch would work. How about tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>A strange calm settled over Anne Marie. A day from now she\u2019d know the truth, whatever it might be. She\u2019d make this as painless as she could for all involved. Two months ago, when Melissa had told her about this, she\u2019d wanted to hate Robert\u2019s assistant, to view her as the manipulative other woman. She still tended to see Rebecca as a gold digger who saw her big chance when Robert and Anne Marie separated. And yet...she\u2019d never approached the family for child support.</p><p>Rebecca suggested a small, upscale restaurant close to Pike Place Market. Anne Marie knew it well; Robert had taken her there on a number of occasions. It catered to businessmen who wanted privacy to conduct negotiations over lunch or dinner\u2014and the deals they negotiated obviously weren\u2019t all business.</p><p>Rebecca said it would have to be an early lunch and asked if eleven-thirty was okay. Anne Marie agreed.</p> <p>Rebecca must know why Anne Marie had called her. The choice of restaurant told her so. Anne Marie tried not to imagine the younger woman and Robert at the dark corner table, the one he used to reserve for their intimate lunches.</p><p>On Friday Anne Marie arrived at eleven-fifteen, fifteen minutes early. Theresa had promised to substitute for her at the bookstore for the rest of the day. In an effort to pack as much into one free afternoon as she possibly could, Anne Marie was going shopping with Melissa after lunch.</p><p>The wedding plans consumed every free moment Melissa had and much of Anne Marie\u2019s time, as well. Unfortunately Melissa\u2019s mother continued to shun her, but Anne Marie believed that once the baby was born, Pamela would have a change of heart. How could she not love her very own grandchild?</p><p>The hostess led Anne Marie to a quiet table near the window. The restaurant typically wasn\u2019t busy until noon and she appreciated the privacy. So far, only one other table was filled, with three men and a woman engaged in some intense discussion. Anne Marie ordered iced tea while she waited. She nervously squeezed lemon into the tea as she rehearsed her remarks.</p><p>Rebecca got there right at eleven-thirty and was escorted to the table. \u201cHello again,\u201d the other woman greeted her. She pulled out the chair across from Anne Marie.</p><p>What struck her all over again was how very young Robert\u2019s assistant was. Young and lovely. Her hair was a rich auburn, shoulder-length and naturally thick. She wore an olive-green skirt and matching jacket with a white silk blouse. An antique cameo\u2014a family heirloom? a gift from Robert?\u2014was pinned at her throat.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for taking the time to join me,\u201d Anne Marie said, keeping her voice neutral.</p><p>Rebecca didn\u2019t respond; she opened the menu and scanned it, saying, \u201cPerhaps we should order first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Anne Marie said, eager to do anything to delay this uncomfortable conversation. \u201cBy the way, this is on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Rebecca said with cool politeness, \u201cbut thanks.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie amended her assessment of Rebecca Gilroy. She might be young and vulnerable-looking, but she had a self-confidence that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place in someone much older.</p><p>When the waitress came to take their order, they both chose a soup and salad combination.</p><p>\u201cI expect you\u2019re here to discuss what happened between Robert and me,\u201d Rebecca said, leaping headfirst into the conversation Anne Marie had been avoiding\u2014until today.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d Rebecca kept her eyes lowered and toyed with the spoon, belying the confidence she\u2019d shown just moments before.</p><p>\u201cDid Robert lead you to believe we were divorced?\u201d Anne Marie asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you been...physically involved before the two of us separated?\u201d</p><p>Rebecca shook her head. \u201cNo. We...we weren\u2019t actually involved at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, physically\u2014as you put it\u2014we were.\u201d Rebecca shrugged. \u201cI knew the two of you were going through some difficulties and that you were working toward a reconciliation. Mr. Roche didn\u2019t share much of his personal life with me, or anyone else for that matter. I learned you were living apart quite by accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Her own fingers moved to the silverware. She caressed the tines of the fork as she listened.</p><p>\u201cWe were both working lots of extra hours.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in Anne Marie\u2019s throat tightened, in nervous anticipation of what Rebecca was about to tell her.</p><p>\u201cIt was a bad time emotionally for us both. I\u2019d recently broken up with my boyfriend, and I knew you and Robert weren\u2019t living together anymore.\u201d</p><p>That was no excuse for what they\u2019d done! Anger and pain raged within her, but Anne Marie dared not let either emotion show.</p><p>The waitress chose that moment to bring their meals. The soup, tomato basil, smelled delicious and was accompanied by a Caesar salad with homemade croutons. Anne Marie waited until Rebecca reached for her spoon before she did.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Rebecca said, picking up the conversation. \u201cBoth Robert and I were at a low point in our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd spending a lot of time together,\u201d Anne Marie added.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was...natural for you to be attracted to each other.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>Any appetite Anne Marie might have had vanished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not proud of what happened,\u201d Rebecca said, \u201cand I believe Robert was...ashamed of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did this affair last?\u201d Anne Marie didn\u2019t know what had prompted the question other than the fact that she was obviously looking for more pain. \u201cHow...many times did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d She stared down at the table.</p><p>Well, yes, it does, she wanted to say but didn\u2019t. That night she and Robert had slept together, shortly before his death\u2014was he still involved with Rebecca then?</p><p>\u201cAfterward everything changed between us,\u201d Rebecca was saying. \u201cWe\u2019d had a great working relationship and that was completely ruined by the affair. We tried to keep it quiet and except for that one time when Melissa walked in on us, I don\u2019t think anyone knew.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head and Anne Marie could see that this was as embarrassing for Rebecca as it was for her.</p><p>Rebecca raised her head. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Melissa told you. That\u2019s how you found out, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe...she was very upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert was, too. He was mortified. His biggest fear was that you\u2019d learn the truth.\u201d</p><p>That news was of little comfort. \u201cHad...did he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he what?\u201d Rebecca pressed.</p><p>It was increasingly difficult even to speak. \u201cDid he see other women? Were there others?\u201d As his personal assistant, Rebecca was in a position to know.</p><p>Her hesitation said it all.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d She would never have believed it. She felt shocked, grieved, that she\u2019d misjudged him so completely.</p><p>\u201cOne, I think,\u201d Rebecca admitted reluctantly. She seemed unwilling to divulge any more.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Anne Marie said urgently. \u201cI need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had me make a reservation at a hotel by the ocean under a different name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRedford?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Rebecca\u2019s gaze widened. \u201cYou know about her?\u201d</p><p>Her throat muscles relaxed. \u201cThat was me. Us. We...played this game.\u201d A smile came and went, tinged with humor and relief. Memories of their getaway weekend immediately came to mind. Happy, playful memories that were in stark contrast to what she\u2019d just experienced.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, like I said, that\u2019s the only other time. And it turns out he wasn\u2019t cheating on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Anne Marie whispered, and she meant it.</p><p>\u201cI should tell you that the night Melissa caught us was the last time.\u201d She paused. \u201cDeep down, I know that if we could do everything over again, neither of us would\u2019ve done it.\u201d Her eyes held Anne Marie\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m not just saying that, either. It\u2019s the truth. If Robert were here, he\u2019d agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there...\u201d The moment had come, and still Anne Marie couldn\u2019t make herself ask the question. \u201cDid he ever tell you why we\u2019d separated?\u201d she asked, taking another route to the question that burned in her heart.</p><p>Rebecca looped a strand of thick auburn hair around her ear. \u201cActually, we didn\u2019t talk about you very often.\u201d</p><p>That made sense. \u201cRobert was a private person,\u201d Anne Marie murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted a baby,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>Rebecca looked away. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that. I guess Robert didn\u2019t want another child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He...he was opposed to starting a second family and I felt that if I could show him how important this was to me, he\u2019d change his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were getting back together,\u201d Rebecca said.</p><p>Anne Marie suddenly realized something. She knew why Robert had left after that night they\u2019d spent together. He\u2019d been gone in the morning, and the callous way he\u2019d simply disappeared without a word or even a note had devastated her. For the first time, Anne Marie understood why he\u2019d done it. Robert had been overcome with guilt. He was sorry about the affair with Rebecca. He\u2019d probably wanted to tell her and ask her forgiveness, and at the last second he\u2019d backed down. She assumed the affair was over by then; if not, she felt certain he would\u2019ve ended it.</p><p>\u201cYou had a baby,\u201d Anne Marie said without flinching.</p><p>\u201cA son. I named him Reed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the baby\u2019s father\u2014is this Robert\u2019s child?\u201d The question was out at last. Much as she feared the answer, she needed to know.</p><p>\u201cRobert\u2019s?\u201d Rebecca repeated, looking stunned. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course Reed isn\u2019t Robert\u2019s! Oh, my goodness, that\u2019s what this lunch is all about? You thought I\u2019d had Robert\u2019s child. No, no, no. Reed\u2019s father is my ex-boyfriend. Denny cheated on me and I found out the same week I discovered I was pregnant. I should\u2019ve explained. The only reason I slept with Robert was because I was trying to hurt Denny. It was just so twisted and stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenny knew about Robert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he knows about Reed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, and so far he\u2019s been a good father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! I\u2019m not an idiot. If Denny couldn\u2019t keep his pants zipped before the wedding, he won\u2019t afterward. I\u2019m seeing someone else now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Anne Marie had to resist hugging the other woman and thanking her for not giving birth to Robert\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve heard about Robert and me and then learned I was pregnant and thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if that was the case, don\u2019t you think I would\u2019ve contacted his attorney? I mean, Reed would\u2019ve been a legal heir once paternity was established.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wondered why you hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was for a very good reason. Reed isn\u2019t Robert\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s heart soared with relief and, even more than that, with joy.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Robert all that well,\u201d Rebecca told her. \u201cBut I know one thing about him\u2014he loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved me,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p> <p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Rebecca concurred with a smile.</p><p>That was all that mattered. Robert wasn\u2019t going to win any Husband of the Year award. The pain of his betrayal would always be with her but he\u2019d loved her. It was what she\u2019d known all along, despite the doubts and the mistakes they\u2019d both made.</p><p>Yes, that was all that mattered.</p><p>The past wouldn\u2019t change.</p><p>But the way Anne Marie saw the future would.</p><p>Chapter 33</p> <p>Lillie estimated that it\u2019d been three weeks since Hector had received her letter. She hadn\u2019t heard from him, and after all this time, she didn\u2019t expect to. The last thing she wanted was to cause problems between Hector and his children.</p><p>After mailing the letter, Lillie had spent a week by the ocean and found solace. The ocean had always been her escape. Whenever she learned about another of David\u2019s affairs, she\u2019d booked a visit to her favorite ocean resort. She\u2019d gone there three or four times every year, often enough that she had her own room, and the staff knew her by her first name. Although it\u2019d been well over three years since her last visit, she\u2019d been greeted warmly. Her regular room was ready and waiting for her.</p><p>She\u2019d regained her emotional equilibrium walking along the beach. Every morning, she\u2019d strolled in the sand, letting the waves lap against her bare feet, thinking, meditating, praying. After a while, the ache would gradually diminish as she was reminded that her worth as a woman, as a human being, didn\u2019t depend on David. His actions couldn\u2019t demean her. Her husband, sad though it was to admit, was a man without honor.</p><p>When she returned from the ocean, Lillie carefully sorted through the mail, searching for a response from Hector. There was none. She\u2019d hoped he\u2019d answer her note, although she hadn\u2019t really expected it.</p><p>On Monday, the twelfth of May, Lillie spent the morning working in her garden. She loved her Martha Washington geraniums, and with the rhododendrons in full bloom and the azaleas as well, her garden had never looked better. Her neighbors hired landscape specialists and Lillie had a company that performed the more demanding physical tasks, such as mowing. The flower beds, however, were her domain. Her personal joy.</p><p>At noon, she took a break and went inside for a glass of iced tea. The mail had been delivered and, as she drank, she leafed through the few advertisements and set the bills aside. A hand-addressed envelope caught her attention.</p><p>She didn\u2019t immediately recognize the writing. Curious, she opened it to discover an invitation to a retirement party for Hector Silva.</p><p>Lillie read it twice.</p> <p>The party was planned for that very evening and when she studied the handwriting a second time, she realized the envelope had been personally addressed to her by Hector. She recognized his penmanship from the work order on her car.</p><p>All the necessary details were there. Date. Time. Place.</p><p>Lillie inhaled sharply. The party would be held at the dealership at seven that night, and she had every intention of attending.</p><p>By six forty-five, Lillie was dressed in a semiformal knee-length linen dress with a cropped jacket. Barbie phoned just as she was about to walk out the door and Lillie explained where she was going.</p><p>\u201cI was sure Hector would be in touch,\u201d her daughter said in that gleeful way of hers when she knew she was right. \u201cHave a wonderful evening, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Lillie promised.</p><p>They spoke for a few more minutes and then it was time for Lillie to go. Although she was nervous, she had a strong intuition that this was going to be one of the most magical evenings of her life. Happiness spread through her and she felt so light it was as though she could float.</p><p>When Lillie arrived at the dealership, the retirement party was in full swing. The showroom floor was decorated with banners and balloons, the counters spread with bottles of champagne and trays of lovely hors d\u2019oeuvres. Surrounded by his children, customers and coworkers, Hector didn\u2019t see her right away. As soon as he did, his eyes flew wide open and he said something to his daughter, whom Lillie recognized from the photographs she\u2019d seen in his home. Hector broke away from the group and hurried toward her.</p><p>\u201cLillie.\u201d He held out both hands.</p><p>\u201cHello, Hector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased you came.\u201d His gaze seemed to devour her, and she couldn\u2019t doubt the sincerity of his words.</p><p>Her own eyes were equally hungry for him. \u201cThank you for the invitation, and congratulations on your retirement.\u201d Words hardly seemed necessary. All she wanted to do was stare at him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His hands firmly clasped hers. Then, as if he\u2019d forgotten himself, he asked, \u201cCan I get you some champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>But Hector didn\u2019t need to leave her. Rita, his daughter, brought over a champagne flute and offered it to Lillie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Rita,\u201d she said unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as lovely as your pictures,\u201d Lillie said as she accepted the flute and impulsively hugged his daughter. Rita hugged her back, her expression welcoming.</p><p>\u201cThis is Andy, my fianc\u00e9,\u201d she said, introducing the man at her side. \u201cDad wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d come. I told him you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve stayed away if I\u2019d tried,\u201d Lillie confessed.</p><p>Hector stood close by as his two sons, Manuel and Luis, walked toward them, their progress hindered by the crowd. Manuel studied Lillie, his eyes devoid of emotion; that, to her way of thinking, was an improvement over the hostility he\u2019d shown at their previous meeting. A lovely red-haired young woman\u2014obviously pregnant\u2014was with him.</p><p>\u201cYou came,\u201d Manuel said, not bothering with any form of greeting.</p><p>\u201cManuel,\u201d Hector warned in low tones. \u201cI won\u2019t have you disrespecting Lillie.\u201d</p><p>His oldest son conceded with a nod. \u201cWelcome, Ms. Higgins,\u201d he said. He introduced his wife, Colleen.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Manuel. Nice to meet you, Colleen. Both of you, please call me Lillie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my son Luis,\u201d Hector said, gesturing toward the second young man.</p><p>Luis and Lillie exchanged a friendly greeting under Hector\u2019s watchful eye\u2014and Manuel\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou made my father very happy by accepting his invitation,\u201d Manuel told her when Luis had drifted off to talk to someone else.</p><p>\u201cHe made me happy by sending it to me.\u201d</p><p>Manuel gave her a tentative smile.</p><p>Lillie smiled back. She hoped that in time the two of them could be friends.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going to dinner after the party,\u201d Hector said, leaning closer. \u201cCan you join us?\u201d</p><p>Lillie readily agreed.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to introduce you to my friends,\u201d Hector said and led her away. As they moved from one group to another, she became even more aware of how greatly he was respected and loved. His coworkers told story after story about Hector, embarrassing him since he was a modest man. Lillie enjoyed every word. If she needed confirmation that this man was everything she\u2019d imagined, then she received it tonight, many times over.</p><p>The party started to break up at about eight-thirty. She\u2019d remained at Hector\u2019s side, either clasping his hand or with his arm about her waist. There could be no doubt that they were together.</p><p>At the Mexican restaurant a little later, Lillie met more members of his family. A brother and sister, nieces and nephews, various in-laws. The table seated at least thirty, and the names flew past her, although she made a determined effort to remember each one. She sat between Hector and Manuel.</p><p>Music and laughter filled the room. Children ducked under the table and raced around the chairs while their parents\u2014Hector\u2019s nieces and nephews\u2014did their best to contain them. Although Hector introduced Lillie to everyone in his extended family, it seemed they already knew her. They accepted her without question and seemed genuinely pleased to make her acquaintance.</p><p>When the food arrived, it was served family style. Manuel passed Lillie the first dish, holding the heavy platter of rice while she helped herself. Next came chilaquites, which seemed to be some kind of tortilla casserole, followed by corn tamales, chili rellenos and another dish Lillie didn\u2019t hear the name of.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s in love with you,\u201d Manuel said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe showed me your letter. You love him, too, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lillie could see no reason to deny it. \u201cVery much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man of strong feelings,\u201d Manuel said. \u201cHis family is important to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d That was the reason she\u2019d decided to break off the relationship; she refused to place Hector in the impossible position of choosing between his family and her.</p><p>Manuel acknowledged her statement. \u201cYes. He was willing to give you up for our\u2014my sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already had.\u201d She couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cCan you tell me what changed?\u201d</p><p>Rita slapped her brother\u2019s arm. \u201cHey, Manuel, what\u2019s the holdup here? You\u2019re supposed to be passing the food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Manuel handed the dish to his sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen my father this miserable,\u201d Manuel informed Lillie.</p><p>\u201cEven when Mom was ill, the entire family counted on our father to keep up our spirits and he did. He nursed Mom, cared for her, held her when she breathed her last and loved her to the very end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still loves her.\u201d Lillie blinked hard as tears welled up in her eyes. This was how she wanted to be loved.</p><p>\u201cAfter Mom died it was Dad who held our family together. Don\u2019t misunderstand me\u2014he grieved for our mother. But her death was also a release from terrible pain. Dad understood that better than anyone. He was lonely and lost but he found ways to cope. Through work, family\u2014and now you.\u201d</p><p>Mesmerized by Manuel\u2019s words, Lillie passed plate after plate without serving herself.</p><p>\u201cAfter receiving your letter, my father wept.\u201d Luis, who\u2019d been listening avidly, spoke from across the table while Hector was busy talking to a nephew on his other side.</p><p>\u201cHe...did?\u201d</p><p>Manuel frowned at him, but he acknowledged Luis\u2019s words. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d He paused to take a gulp of his Corona. \u201cI knew then that you were no ordinary woman,\u201d he resumed, \u201cand that I\u2019d made a mistake. If my father loves you, then I need to be willing to look past my own prejudices and give you a chance, as well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That did it. Tears spilled down her cheeks. \u201cThank you, Manuel.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and passed her another dish.</p><p>Lillie wondered why Hector had waited so long to reach out to her. As if reading her thoughts, Manuel added, \u201cRather than repeat what happened with me, Dad decided he needed to let the family know. So he went to everyone and explained that he\u2019d met someone very special.\u201d</p><p>No wonder his family behaved as though they already knew her.</p> <p>\u201cMy fear was that you\u2019d break his heart,\u201d Manuel murmured. \u201cUnfortunately my attitude toward you was what did that. I hope you can look past our rather...difficult beginning and start again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said and when the next dish was handed to her, she scooped up a huge helping of chili conqueso and placed it on Manuel\u2019s plate before serving herself.</p><p>Manuel grinned and then winked at her.</p><p>After dinner, the music began, and Hector took Lillie\u2019s hand and led her onto the dance floor. \u201cYou and Manuel seemed to be deeply involved in conversation,\u201d he said as he turned her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She leaned her forehead against his and closed her eyes, grateful that this was a slow number.</p> <p>\u201cHe apologized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said you loved me.\u201d</p><p>Hector exhaled noisily. \u201cI never expected to fall in love a second time and certainly not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, either. Blame the wishes if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Twenty Wishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote that I wanted to be loved by an honorable man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are loved, my Lillie. By me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you back.\u201d</p><p>His hold on her tightened briefly. \u201cManuel still has doubts that it\u2019ll work out between you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least he\u2019s agreed not to interfere.\u201d</p><p>Hector nodded. \u201cHe said he\u2019d be willing to wait and see\u2014after he told me there\u2019s no fool like an old fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we be foolish together?\u201d</p><p>Hector laughed. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>Lillie lifted her head. \u201cAre we a pair of fools, Hector?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d rather be foolish with than you, my Lillie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>With their eyes closed, they continued dancing until the music ended. When the last note faded, they reluctantly broke apart in order to applaud politely. To Lillie\u2019s astonishment, the entire Silva family had formed a circle around them and started to clap.</p><p>Lillie blushed profusely and Hector laughed.</p><p>It was a relief when the musicians began again. This time, his family joined them on the dance floor. The mariachi music was lively, punctuated by slow, plaintive songs. Hector and Lillie danced every dance and stayed until the restaurant was ready to close.</p><p>Hector drove them back to the dealership, where Lillie had left her car. There, in the shadows, he kissed her. Lillie slipped her arms around him and leaned into his embrace, letting her actions tell him of all the love in her heart.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I\u2019d come to the party?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI prayed you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I hadn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I would have come to you. Most men don\u2019t find a love this good, this pure, once in a lifetime\u2014let alone twice. I wasn\u2019t letting you go, Lillie, not without a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you already had,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said swiftly. \u201cI needed time to regroup and to reason with my son. You were always with me, always in my heart.\u201d He took her hand and pressed her palm against his chest. \u201cYou inspired me, my Lillie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have my own list of Twenty Wishes now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He paused to kiss her again. \u201cAnd every one of those wishes is about you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>The small chapel adjacent to the Free Methodist Church off Blossom Street reverberated with the traditional wedding march as Brandon Roche escorted his sister down the center aisle.</p><p>Standing in a pew at the front of the chapel, with Ellen at her side, Anne Marie felt her heart swell with joy. When Melissa walked past her, she turned to look at Anne Marie and mouthed the words \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Robert would\u2019ve been so proud of them, she thought, not for the first time. So proud and so delighted by the change in their relationship. For all the pain his betrayal with Rebecca had caused, it had a positive\u2014if inadvertent\u2014effect. It had brought Anne Marie and Melissa together.</p><p>Anne Marie gazed after her stepdaughter. The wedding was small, with only a maid of honor and best man. As promised, Ellen would serve wedding cake at the reception, a role to which she attached great importance.</p><p>Melissa looked lovely in her pale pink floor-length dress. A halo of flowers adorned her head, with flowing white ribbons cascading down her back, and she carried a small bouquet of white roses. The pregnancy was just starting to show.</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s one disappointment was Pamela. It would\u2019ve meant so much to Melissa if her mother had relented enough to attend her wedding. Unfortunately, she remained upset and angry, and Anne Marie couldn\u2019t help thinking she should have put her daughter\u2019s needs ahead of her own feelings. But then, Pamela hadn\u2019t come to Robert\u2019s funeral, either, although her children could have used her support. Anne Marie hoped they\u2019d eventually be able to resolve their differences.</p><p>With the maid of honor and the best man, both close friends, standing beside them, Melissa and Michael approached the young minister. Jordan Turner, Alix\u2019s husband, would be performing the ceremony. He\u2019d agreed as long as Melissa and Michael were willing to participate in marriage counseling classes. Even with all the busyness of college graduation, the couple had gone to every session, which boded well for their marriage, Anne Marie thought.</p><p>When the ceremony began, Ellen leaned forward, absorbing every word. This was her first wedding and she didn\u2019t want to miss a single detail. Anne Marie had enjoyed watching Ellen line up her dolls and stuffed animals the night before and then carefully choose two\u2014a Barbie and a panda\u2014to march down the makeshift aisle. Later, Anne Marie had found her at the kitchen table writing furiously in a tablet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she\u2019d asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting a new wish on my list,\u201d Ellen explained. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a big wedding with lots of people and a dress with lace and pearls and a long veil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your husband?\u201d</p><p>Ellen chewed on the end of her pencil. \u201cHe\u2019ll be handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that important?\u201d</p><p>The eight-year-old considered her response carefully. \u201cI want to marry a man who\u2019s handsome on the inside, too,\u201d she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cAnd if he\u2019s good-looking on the outside, that would be a bonus, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Ellen had said.</p><p>Now as Melissa and Michael exchanged their vows, Ellen studied them attentively, dreaming of her own wedding one day.</p><p>Anne Marie gazed protectively at this child who would legally become her daughter. The greatest desire of her life was to be a mother and that wish had been fulfilled\u2014but not in the way she\u2019d expected.</p><p>As the ceremony continued, Anne Marie felt Dolores Falk\u2019s presence. The older woman had nurtured the child to the best of her ability. She\u2019d given her love and security. In the end, Ellen\u2019s grandmother had handed her over to Anne Marie.</p><p>Anne Marie believed Dolores had recognized that the two of them belonged together, that they needed each other. Once the bond between them was established, and Anne Marie had promised to keep Ellen if anything happened to her grandmother, Dolores had been able to die in peace, knowing Ellen would be loved and cared for by Anne Marie.</p><p>Anne Marie placed her hand lightly on Ellen\u2019s shoulder. The child joined fervently in the applause when Jordan Turner pronounced Michael and Melissa husband and wife.</p><p>\u201cThis is so nice,\u201d Ellen whispered as the music crescendoed. Then Melissa and Michael walked back down the aisle together, their arms linked and their faces bright with joy.</p><p>\u201cIt is lovely,\u201d Anne Marie agreed, struggling to hold back tears. It wasn\u2019t only Dolores Falk\u2019s presence she felt, but Robert\u2019s, too. She knew Melissa felt him there, as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens next?\u201d Ellen stared up at Anne Marie with wide, curious eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow we go to the wedding reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goody! When do I serve the cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot till later on.\u201d</p><p>The reception was at a restaurant on Lake Washington. Lillie had secured the banquet room, and Melissa\u2019s friends had decorated it and prepared everything for the small reception. Anne Marie had volunteered to help and Melissa was grateful but said she\u2019d already done so much. Besides, her friends had everything under control.</p><p>When they arrived, Anne Marie could see that was true. The room, which was separate from the main part of the restaurant, had a sweeping view of Lake Washington. Sailboats with their multicolored spinnakers glided across the choppy waters. A lush green lawn sloped from the restaurant down to the waterfront, bordered by rows of blooming perennials. Double-wide French doors opened onto a stone patio.</p><p>Because the day was overcast, Melissa and Michael had decided to hold the reception indoors. Lillie had chosen the perfect location, Anne Marie thought gratefully.</p><p>The room itself was strung with white streamers, twisted from the center of the ceiling, where a large paper wedding bell hung. The streamers fanned out in every direction. White and silver balloons were tied behind each chair.</p><p>The cake, topped with the traditional bride and groom, sat on a table with an array of gifts surrounding it. Alix Turner had baked and decorated it herself. The restaurant had supplied an elegant buffet, for which Brandon, Anne Marie and Michael\u2019s parents had split the expense.</p><p>Entering the room with her husband, Melissa looked radiantly happy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of my little sister as married,\u201d Brandon said, claiming the chair next to Anne Marie and Ellen. \u201cMom\u2019s going to regret not flying over for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded. Pamela would have to accept that Melissa had her own path to follow. \u201cIn time I believe she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Ellen asked, then added, \u201cIs this for adult ears or kids\u2019 ears?\u201d</p><p>Brandon laughed outright. \u201cIt\u2019s for adult ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at Anne Marie.</p><p>The buffet line formed, and after they\u2019d filled their plates and sat down again, Michael\u2019s parents, Jim and Paula Marshall, joined them.</p><p>\u201cThis turned out to be such a lovely wedding,\u201d Paula said, watching her son with pride. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. What is it with children these days? So much happening at once. Michael graduated from college, married and a father-to-be. It\u2019s enough to make my head spin.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie agreed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to knit first, a baby blanket or a garter for her wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knit?\u201d Paula asked with real interest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only just learning. I\u2019ve been taking classes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was one of our wishes,\u201d Ellen told her gravely.</p><p>Anne Marie explained and marveled anew at the changes in Ellen since the child had come to live with her. When they\u2019d first met, only three months ago, the youngster had barely spoken a word. These days it was difficult to get her to stop.</p><p>\u201cHave I introduced you to Ellen?\u201d Anne Marie asked Jim and Paula and tucked her arm around the child\u2019s waist. \u201cThis is my daughter, Ellen Falk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a new name soon,\u201d Ellen said, looking at Anne Marie.</p> <p>\u201cA new name?\u201d Paula repeated. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m adopting Ellen,\u201d Anne Marie said, \u201cand when I do her last name will be Roche, the same as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations to you both,\u201d Jim said, sampling the lobster salad.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie\u2019s going to be my new mother,\u201d Ellen said amicably. \u201cI have an old one, but my grandmother told me my real mom couldn\u2019t take care of a little girl, which is why I get a new one. I\u2019m glad my new mother is Anne Marie.\u201d</p><p>The conversation moved on to pets when Ellen lovingly described Baxter, now \u201cour\u201d dog, and lauded his intelligence. The Marshalls contributed stories about their own badly behaved but much-loved dog, Willow. Everyone laughed a great deal, and Anne Marie was thrilled that Ellen responded so naturally and well to adult company.</p> <p>Halfway through the reception, Lillie Higgins and Hector Silva came in. Anne Marie had met Lillie\u2019s friend a couple of times previously. He was everything Lillie had promised and obviously adored her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we\u2019re late,\u201d Lillie began as she approached Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d Hector said. \u201cMy oldest grandson had a soccer game and wanted me there to see him play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I play soccer, too?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>Anne Marie nodded. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve moved into the new house, we\u2019ll see about signing you up for soccer.\u201d</p><p>Ellen clasped her hands, her expression rapturous. \u201cAnd I want to join Girl Scouts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne thing at a time, Ellen,\u201d Anne Marie said gently. She didn\u2019t want to squelch the child\u2019s enthusiasm, but didn\u2019t want her overwhelmed by too many activities, either. She already took karate lessons and if she added soccer and Girl Scouts to that, there wouldn\u2019t be enough time just to sit and read or knit or play imaginative games with her dolls.</p><p>\u201cI got your message,\u201d Lillie said. \u201cYou found a house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! We move August first.\u201d The house was in a good neighborhood close to Woodrow Wilson Elementary, which meant Ellen wouldn\u2019t need to change schools. With all the upheaval in the child\u2019s life, Anne Marie had wanted to keep her there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a real bedroom, too,\u201d Ellen inserted.</p><p>\u201cAnd a real bed,\u201d Anne Marie said. Ellen hadn\u2019t complained once about sleeping on the fold-down sofa in the tiny apartment. One of her first purchases would be a bedroom set for Ellen, with a matching dresser, bookcase and computer desk.</p><p>She looked forward to getting her own things out of storage. She\u2019d delayed for a long time, preferring to live in the small apartment rather than move. Her fear was that the household goods that had belonged to her and Robert would trigger too many memories.</p><p>A few months ago, Anne Marie hadn\u2019t felt strong enough to deal with the past. Her grief had been too raw, too close to the surface. She\u2019d purposely kept the furniture in storage, convinced she\u2019d never find the courage to sit at the table where she\u2019d shared so many meals with her husband. Every item, everything she\u2019d so carefully packed away, was linked to Robert.</p><p>But the memories of her life with him no longer tormented her. Even knowing of his betrayal, she continued to love him and always would.</p> <p>Michael and Melissa ceremonially cut the first slice of cake, and Melissa beckoned to Ellen.</p><p>\u201cCan I serve cake now?\u201d Ellen asked, eyeing the slices Melissa\u2019s friends were placing on colorful plates. \u201cIs it time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like it,\u201d Brandon said. They stood up and headed for the table, where the plates had been set out.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to throw the bouquet?\u201d Alicia, the maid of honor, asked Melissa.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, I almost forgot.\u201d Melissa turned her back to her group of friends and hurled the bouquet over her shoulder.</p><p>Anne Marie hadn\u2019t been part of that group. She didn\u2019t mean to participate, but when the bouquet shot directly at her, she instinctively grabbed it.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie!\u201d Melissa cried, laughing delightedly. \u201cYou caught the bouquet!\u201d</p><p>Ellen squealed with excitement, a plate of cake in each hand.</p><p>\u201cThis means,\u201d Melissa told her, \u201cthat Anne Marie will be the next one to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Anne Marie tried to pass the bouquet to one of Melissa\u2019s college friends, who refused to take it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure,\u201d Melissa chided good-naturedly. \u201cYou never know when love\u2019s going to tap on the door.\u201d</p><p>Frankly, Anne Marie wasn\u2019t interested in falling in love again. She had everything she needed for happiness. Ellen was part of her life now, and she\u2019d made peace with the past. She had Blossom Street Books. Her eyes fell on Lillie and Hector, and she immediately added dear friends to her list of blessings.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Ellen said, tugging at her sleeve. She pointed at the French doors.</p><p>Music swirled in from the piano player in the nearby bar.</p><p>Anne Marie bent down. \u201cWhat am I supposed to be looking at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s raining.\u201d</p><p>It was more of a mist than rain but Anne Marie didn\u2019t point that out. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wish,\u201d Ellen reminded her.</p><p>What wish?</p><p>Then Anne Marie remembered.</p><p>Taking Ellen\u2019s hand, she walked out to the small patio. With the music playing softly in the background, they removed their shoes and stepped onto the wet grass.</p><p>Ellen slipped one arm around Anne Marie\u2019s waist and together they spun \u2019round and \u2019round.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re dancing barefoot in the rain.\u201d Ellen giggled.</p><p>Throwing back her head, Anne Marie giggled, too.</p><p>The music grew louder and their movements became more sweeping as the rain fell and people gathered at the open doors to watch them.</p><p>She saw Brandon giving them a thumbs-up and Michael and Melissa waving. Lillie and Hector smiled.</p><p>Anne Marie Roche had made Twenty Wishes and they\u2019d brought her love.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>November</p><p>The courtroom was crowded as Anne Marie and Ellen waited patiently for their turn to come and stand before the judge. When their names were called, Anne Marie stepped forward with Ellen beside her. Evelyn Boyle, Ellen\u2019s social worker, moved to the front of the court.</p><p>Judge Harold Roper read over the paperwork, which included a home study and background check. This was actually a formality; Child Protective Services had already approved the adoption. The six months had passed quickly. They\u2019d moved into their new home, and Ellen was a third-grader now, getting top marks in her classes.</p><p>\u201cSo, Ellen, you\u2019re going to have a new mother,\u201d Judge Roper said.</p><p>\u201cYes, Judge,\u201d Ellen answered politely.</p><p>\u201cYour Honor,\u201d Anne Marie whispered.</p><p>\u201cYour Honor,\u201d Ellen repeated.</p><p>She placed her hand in Anne Marie\u2019s and edged closer to her side.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d the judge said and signed his name at the bottom of the document.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all there is?\u201d Ellen asked in a whisper.</p><p>Anne Marie was surprised herself. \u201cApparently so.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s mother wept noisily at the back of the court room. The next name was called, and Anne Marie and Ellen hugged and left the room. Laura Bostwick continued to sob, dabbing at her eyes with at issue as they walked out into the hallway. The heavy door closed behind them.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t come to the party, Mom?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come by later if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I want you to meet my friends.\u201d</p><p>Catching her off guard, Laura awkwardly hugged Anne Marie. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a wonderful mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Ellen Roche,\u201d Ellen announced to a guard who strolled past.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice name,\u201d the uniformed man told her.</p><p>\u201cEllen Dolores Roche,\u201d she said. \u201cDolores was my grandmother\u2019s name. She\u2019s with Jesus now.\u201d</p><p>The man smiled at Anne Marie and kept on walking.</p><p>\u201cThis is my new mother,\u201d Ellen called after him. \u201cShe loves me a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen,\u201d Anne Marie murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to tell someone I have a new name,\u201d she whispered, lowering her head.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to tell Barbie and Mark?\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded eagerly. \u201cLillie and Hector, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll all be at the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Mrs. Beaumont and Lydia and Cody and all my friends from Blossom Street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa and Michael, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d This shouldn\u2019t be news to Ellen, who knew all about the party at Blossom Street Books after court.</p><p>But Anne Marie understood. Ellen was happy and excited, and she had to express that happiness. She mattered to all these people, belonged to their community as Anne Marie did. Her daughter...Anne Marie\u2019s mind came to a sudden halt.</p><p>Ellen was her daughter.</p><p>Her daughter.</p><p>Unexpected tears gathered in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie?\u201d Instantly Ellen was concerned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014I\u2019m just happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Grandma Laura?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Anne Marie squeezed her hand. \u201cJust like Grandma Laura.\u201d</p><p>By the time they got to the bookstore, it seemed the entire street was there to celebrate. Susannah from the flower shop had come, but could only stay briefly. She brought a number of small floral bouquets to commemorate the adoption and a pretty pink corsage for each of them to wear.</p><p>Soon after their arrival, Alix Turner carried in a tray of freshly baked cookies, compliments of the French Caf\u00e9. Lydia and her sister, Margaret, came over in turns, so as not to leave the store unattended. They\u2019d brought several bottles of champagne for the adults\u2014Veuve Clicquot, of course\u2014and sparkling lemonade for the kids. Lydia\u2019s husband, Brad, dropped in later, bringing their son, Cody. Michael and a heavily pregnant Melissa showed up, too, and Ellen was doubly excited.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a girl, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be her big sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it,\u201d Melissa said. She was due anytime and Michael remained close to her side. They didn\u2019t stay long as they had a birthing class to attend, their final one before her due date.</p><p>Theresa, Cathy and Steve, her part-time employees, helped serve, and Ellen mingled with the crowd, reminding everyone that she had a new name and a new mother.</p><p>Late in the afternoon, both Evelyn Boyle and Anne Marie\u2019s mother stopped by, but could only stay for a few minutes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe were thinking of holding a mommy shower for you,\u201d Barbie said around five o\u2019clock. Almost everyone had come and gone by this point. The ones who remained were the original members of the widows\u2019 group\u2014with the addition of Mark and Hector. It was hard to believe nearly a year had passed since that bleak Valentine\u2019s evening, when they\u2019d started their lists of Twenty Wishes.</p><p>She\u2019d completed her list last spring.</p><p>19. Karate classes with Ellen</p><p>20. To live happily ever after</p> <p>Twenty wishes, nearly all of them a reality now.</p><p>Anne Marie had found a pair of red cowboy boots in a secondhand store for a fraction of the cost. They fit perfectly and she wore them often.</p><p>Then one Sunday in July, shortly after Anne Marie had begun attending church with Ellen, she\u2019d spontaneously sung a hymn. She was well into the second verse before she remembered that she couldn\u2019t sing anymore and yet here she was.... Now not a day went by without her belting out one song after another.</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s gaze fell on Barbie, who sat next to Mark, holding his hand.</p><p>Anne Marie had met him only half a dozen times, but Barbie had spoken of him often enough to make her feel as if she knew him.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we made our lists of wishes, did you ever dream it would come to this?\u201d Elise asked, joining the circle of friends.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about our lists recently,\u201d Lillie said, sitting in the overstuffed chair with Hector standing behind her, his hands on her shoulders. \u201cHas anyone completed any wishes lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Elise said, looking down at her plastic glass of champagne. \u201cI\u2019ve set up a charitable foundation in memory of Maverick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise, that\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>The older woman struggled to hide her emotion. \u201cThat\u2019s not all. I took my two grandsons on a hot-air balloon ride. That was something Maverick and I always intended to do. We put it off\u2014and then it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it as exciting as you thought it would be?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p> <p>Elise smiled warmly. \u201cEven better than I imagined. When I closed my eyes, I could almost feel Maverick\u2019s arms around me again,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cIt was the most thrilling sensation to be that high above the ground. He would\u2019ve loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI completed one of my wishes, too,\u201d Barbie volunteered.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Lillie asked.</p><p>Eyes dancing, she glanced at Mark. \u201cI went skinny-dipping.\u201d</p><p>Lillie frowned. \u201cI have a feeling you weren\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>Barbie giggled like a schoolgirl. \u201cAs it happens, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Mark shifted uncomfortably in his wheelchair. \u201cI believe that falls under the heading of too much information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went with Mark.\u201d Lillie feigned shock.</p> <p>Barbie laughed and leaned over to kiss his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m not telling.\u201d</p><p>Mark couldn\u2019t quite restrain a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Anne Marie?\u201d Barbie asked, diverting attention away from her and Mark.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to accomplish one of my most heartfelt wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout to?\u201d Hector asked. \u201cI thought the adoption was finalized this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, and Ellen\u2019s now my daughter in the eyes of the law. But this is another wish.\u201d She opened her purse and removed a thick envelope and showed it to the group.</p><p>Ellen dashed over to her side. \u201cCan I tell everyone?\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Anne Marie told her.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d she said, and looked at Anne Marie. \u201cIs it okay to call you Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom bought tickets for us to fly to Paris for our first Christmas together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d Elise repeated slowly. \u201cWhat a perfect idea.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie slipped her arm around Ellen. \u201cI\u2019m going to Paris with someone I love.\u201d</p><p>Barbie\u2019s eyes were soft. \u201cThat\u2019s just beautiful.\u201d She glanced at Mark, who grumbled something about not getting any ideas. She ignored him and reached for the brochure Anne Marie handed her.</p><p>\u201cBarbie, I\u2019m warning you right now, I\u2019m not going to Paris.\u201d Mark hesitated. \u201cGo if you like. I\u2019ll even encourage it. But I\u2019m staying right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Barbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d Apparently she had no intention of arguing with him. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of traveling to Europe for two weeks on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks?\u201d Mark said, frowning. \u201cThat long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would hardly be worth my while to travel all that way for less than that.\u201d</p><p>Mark groaned. \u201cWhy do I have the feeling that I\u2019m going to be staring up at the Eiffel Tower and wondering how I got there?\u201d</p><p>Everyone smiled.</p><p>Ellen walked over to where Anne Marie was sitting and climbed onto her lap. \u201cOne of my wishes came true, too,\u201d she told the group.</p><p>\u201cWhich one was that?\u201d Hector asked kindly.</p><p>\u201cI found a mom,\u201d Ellen announced. \u201cI thought Anne Marie would just be my Lunch Buddy but now she\u2019s my mom. Forever and ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever and ever,\u201d Anne Marie repeated.</p><p>It was a solemn moment, broken only by Ellen\u2019s happy shout. \u201cHey, Mom! You have to start a new list of Twenty Wishes now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie smiled. This truly wasn\u2019t the end but a new beginning for them all. </p> </body></html>"]
