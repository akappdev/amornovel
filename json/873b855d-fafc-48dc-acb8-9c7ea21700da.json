Oh, no. Melanie Ann Smith was going to be the death of him.</p><p>Carter Ambrose grimaced at the socket wrench in his hand, then bent over the engine and began to ratchet the bolt.</p><p>For the past three weeks, Melanie had been coming over to his garage to check on him or in her words, \u201cmake sure he didn\u2019t go insane from lack of company\u201d. While he was trying to take some time to clear his head, she was driving him insane, with her short skirts, patterned tights, platform heels and glossy lips.</p> <p>Damn unnerving if anyone asked him.</p><p>Although no one ever did, mostly because he wouldn\u2019t tell anyone that he\u2019d started noticing a damn thing about Melanie Ann Smith. She was off-limits, forever on the list of women he had no business entertaining lustful thoughts about. A man just didn\u2019t do that with his sister\u2019s best friend.</p><p>The side door to his garage opened and closed.</p><p>The sound of her heels had him thinking of her mile long legs wrapped around his waist while he tasted her strawberry-flavored lip gloss. Something he knew, because he\u2019d covertly watched as she coated her pouty lips with the stuff at least a hundred times.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and thought of stats, of his crew chief balling him out when Carter let his tires marble. Of having to let his teammate, Jake Henley, permanently race without him, because Carter had totaled his car during a friendly competition back in September.</p> <p>A total rookie move, and one that he was still recovering from. Unfortunately, racing wasn\u2019t an option, not anymore. He wasn\u2019t one of those hardcore guys, willing to gamble on his health. Besides, he\u2019d actually like to settle down and have kids one day.</p><p>Only he wasn\u2019t sure how soon he wanted to pursue that avenue. And he wasn\u2019t sure where he wanted to live or start his classic car restoration business\u2014small town Holland Springs, with his entire family, or Charlotte, with his racing friends and extended family.</p><p>That\u2019s why he\u2019d come home. Usually being in Holland Springs cleared his mind and put things in perspective. Usually.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you working on today?\u201d Melanie asked, sidling right up next to him and pulling him out of his thoughts. She was the wrench in the clear-his-head plans.</p><p>Her hip bumped his as she leaned over and he dropped the socket wrench. Then the bolt fell through the engine and hit the concrete floor with multiple pings as it bounced. Son of a bitch. \u201cSame thing as yesterday,\u201d he muttered and hair the color of sunshine filled his vision, along with the smell of coconut tantalizing his senses. Damn if she didn\u2019t make his mouth water, and damn if she didn\u2019t bring to mind sitting on the beach with a six-pack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d</p> <p>Carter turned to tell her no, got a glimpse of a white bra with cherries on it and bumped his head hard against the hood of the Jeep. Only years of his dad\u2019s \u2018don\u2019t-curse-in-the-presence-of-a-woman\u2019 speeches made him bite back every cuss word he knew. He blinked, rubbing the top of his head.</p><p>Melanie stared at him, her chocolate brown eyes wide with concern, as she held out the socket wrench. Across the bridge of her nose was a smattering of freckles that should\u2019ve made her look like a little girl, except he thought those little golden dots were sexy. Lately, he had been thinking everything about her was sexy.</p><p>God help him.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Taking the tool from her, he set back to work. \u201cFine.\u201d He hoped like hell she\u2019d get the hint and leave before he did something stupid. Like kiss her senseless.</p><p>She shook something by his ear. \u201cThought you might be hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Glancing out of the corner of his eye, he watched her green platform shoe wiggle from side to side. \u201cBut it\u2019s your favorite: chicken salad and crackers with a slice of Daisy\u2019s famous German chocolate cake. I had her add some extra coconut to the frosting.\u201d</p> <p>So that\u2019s what was making his mouth water, not her. Relieved, he moved to his work bench and carefully placed the socket wrench in the third drawer, then turned and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve convinced me.\u201d</p><p>Her smile lit up the room. \u201cGreat.\u201d She joined him at his work bench, setting the large brown bag down and pulling out the contents. \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind if I join you.\u201d</p><p>Thing was he didn\u2019t; he actually liked Melanie. Always had, even when she was being a pain in the ass, along with his sister, Zoe. \u201cSorry for being so short with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the hunger talking,\u201d she said with a wink. She hopped on one of the four barstools he kept near the worktable, crossing those mile long legs and making him swallow hard.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be at work?\u201d he asked, moving to the sink and washing his hands. Then he ambled over to her and sat down. Melanie had opened all of the containers and fixed them both a plate. \u201cJen\u2019s place, right?\u201d</p><p>Taking a bite of chicken salad, she held up a finger and swallowed. \u201cJen didn\u2019t need me anymore. Whose Jeep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose Holland. She needed something reliable and asked me to find something for her.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s eyes lit with genuine warmth. \u201cShe certainly asked the right guy to help her.\u201d</p><p>Maybe so, but it hadn\u2019t stopped some of the guys around here from asking if he was doing her or her older sister, Summer. Perverts. He shrugged. \u201cI think Rose\u2019s taking care of her little sister all by herself. No one\u2019s seen their mom in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor kid,\u201d she said, popping a grape into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not much older,\u201d he pointed out, earning a look of annoyance from her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-four.\u201d She leaned forward to snag one of his grapes, once again flashing her bra and amazing cleavage.</p><p>He choked down a half eaten cracker. Grabbing the bottle of water she\u2019d brought, he drank down a third of it before he came up for air. \u201cYeah, I saw pictures on facebook of your drunk tail celebrating your twenty-fourth birthday at Poor Boy\u2019s. My sister\u2019s, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Carter Ambrose, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been looking at my tail.\u201d She unscrewed the cap of her water bottle. \u201cWhat would your momma say?\u201d</p><p>His momma would tell him to get the hell away from a woman like Melanie. Then again Leah Ambrose warned all of her sons about staying away from every woman that didn\u2019t meet her standards. So far that had meant all of them, but one\u2014his ex-fianc\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for another job?\u201dhe asked, trying to steer their conversation away from her ass and his mother. Two things that would never be in the same sentence ever again.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lowering her eyes, she stared at the ground for a moment and then peered up at him through lacey, black lashes. \u201cZoe said you needed a temporary assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, absolutely not.\u201d He couldn\u2019t get the words out fast enough. Yes, he needed someone to organize his office, answer emails and a slew of other tasks that he didn\u2019t have the time or inclination to attempt to do or finish. But there was just so much temptation a man could take.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, Carter. You\u2019ve been here for almost three weeks and haven\u2019t hired one person.\u201d She held up her hand and began to tick off her fingers. \u201cNot Kelsey Greggs, Maisey Perry, Bernice Waters or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvangeline told Zoe, who then told me,\u201d she said, gathering their trash and placing it in the bag she\u2019d brought. \u201cWhere did you move the recycling bins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver by the door.\u201d He watched her cute ass shake as she walked over to the bins. He hadn\u2019t hired any of those women, because they had been looking for a man. And by man he meant a groom. Bernice had even brought a bridal magazine with her to the interview. \u201cDid Zoe also tell you not to repeat what you heard to anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t repeat it.\u201d</p><p>Crossing his arms over his chest, he said, \u201cYou just told me, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t count, baby doll.\u201d Glancing over her shoulder, she gave him a look that made his cock start to harden. \u201cWhat are your office hours?\u201d</p><p>Still stunned by that heated look, he blurted, \u201cNine to five. Except on Fridays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! See you tomorrow.\u201d With a backwards wave, she left his garage.</p><p>What the hell had just happened? Oh right, he\u2019d just hired Melanie to be his new assistant. Glancing at the clock, he uncrossed his arms and ambled over to the fridge. Opening it, he grabbed the first bottle and twisted off the cap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s five o\u2019clock somewhere,\u201d he muttered, then toasted the framed print of The Intimidator. \u201cCheers, Dale.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cHe hired you? Just like that?\u201d Zoe Ambrose asked with a snap of her fingers. Astonishment shone in her dark green eyes.</p><p>Pleased with herself, Melanie nodded. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>A grin curved the corners of her best friend\u2019s mouth. \u201cGood for you.\u201d Zoe\u2019s grin fell. \u201cCarter wasn\u2019t mad at me for telling you, was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Melanie lied. Well, it wasn\u2019t exactly a lie. Carter hadn\u2019t looked mad. He\u2019d looked like he normally did when she talked to him\u2014 sexy as hell. Lately, that look had turned into sexy as hell and oh-crap-she\u2019s-here-again. And for a woman who\u2019d been in love with him for as long she could remember, it stung. \u201cAnyway, I report for duty at nine o\u2019clock sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better be there at 8:45,\u201d Zoe said, snagging a breadstick and tearing it in half. \u201cHe\u2019s a stickler for punctuality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re related to him?\u201d</p><p>Giggling, Zoe said, \u201cFairly certain. Anyway, will it interfere with taking care of Mr. Henry\u2019s dog and house?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Melanie dipped her own breadstick into marinara sauce. \u201cI\u2019ll let Cody out at seven, then check the plants, tidy up the kitchen and be back home in time to get a shower and be at Carter\u2019s by 8:50 at the latest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sweet of you to help Mr. Henry out like you do,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cCody is a menace to society.\u201d</p><p>Cody was a yippy, two-pound Chihuahua that thought himself to be a one hundred and fifty pound attack dog. \u201cYou mean it\u2019s so sweet to let eighty-five year old Mr. Henry ogle my butt for twenty bucks a day?\u201d Melanie asked, innocently batting her lashes.</p><p>\u201cWell, when you put it that way...\u201d</p><p>Melanie snorted. \u201cI swear, you should hear the beeps of his heart monitor when I walk in. One day, I\u2019m going to forget to not bend at the waist to pick up Cody and the man\u2019s gonna keel over from a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least he\u2019ll die with a smile on his face.\u201d Zoe pulled out her phone, then looked at the screen and sighed. \u201cAnother rejection. Maybe I should give up this writing thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Z. One day you will get a yes.\u201d Melanie pushed Zoe\u2019s wine glass closer. \u201cBut in the meantime, have another drink.\u201d</p><p>After taking another sip, her best friend eyed her. \u201cIs that what you hope will happen with Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Zoe\u2019s face fell. \u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>Melanie snorted, then wriggled her eyebrows. \u201cI want more than one yes from him. In fact I want a lot of yeses followed by oh God and more.\u201d Really, who wouldn\u2019t want six foot two and two hundred pounds worth of a man on top of them? Who wouldn\u2019t want to run their fingers through dark brown hair and stare into sexy emerald-colored eyes? A man with a gorgeous face and a hot body that filled out jeans as well as he did boxer briefs in major ad campaigns.</p><p>\u201cDespite being majorly squicked out at the thought of my brother saying those words to anyone, I totally support your efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always supported my efforts.\u201d Melanie laughed, brushing a loose chunk of hair over her ear. \u201cIt\u2019s why we get along so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we were little, it was the only time I got in trouble,\u201d Zoe reminded her, tucking her phone back into her purse.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Melanie Ann Smith, Troublemaker Extraordinaire. That\u2019s me,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m surprised your momma ever let us be friends in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Zoe rolled her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019d hoped I would be a good influence on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBless your momma\u2019s heart,\u201d Melanie sighed dramatically, placing her hand on her chest. \u201cHer hopes have been dashed to pieces by now.\u201d</p><p>The owner of Jack\u2019s Fine Italian Dining, Jack Macpherson, strode to their table, smiling at Zoe, then giving Melanie a pointed look. \u201cSmoke break\u2019s .\u201d</p><p>Melanie pushed up from the table and grabbed her tray. \u201cYes sir!\u201d She gave him a salute.</p><p>The sound of dishes breaking in the restaurant kitchen captured her boss\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201dHe stomped to the kitchen, yelling at everyone in his path. Good thing it was a very slow Monday night. Three out of twenty tables were filled.</p><p>She frowned. That wasn\u2019t good at all. Tips would be scarce and she always managed to give back the tip Zoe left for her. It didn\u2019t feel right taking money from her best friend, even if Melanie had earned it.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start smoking?\u201d Zoe asked as an extra cheesy portion of the ziti fell from her fork onto the table.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Melanie grinned, tossing the tray back and forth between her hands. \u201cFigured it was the only way I could get a break like Darlene and Kelsey. Fair\u2019s fair, you know.\u201d</p><p>Her best friend laughed. \u201cJust don\u2019t get fired, okay?\u201d</p><p>Melanie drew a little x over the pocket on her white shirt and walked away. \u201cPromise,\u201d she said over her shoulder. And she meant it. She couldn\u2019t afford to lose another job. Two out of the three things she wanted most in life cost money that she didn\u2019t have. It was part of the reason why she asked Carter for a job. She knew his personal assistant position paid well, even if it was temporary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Only one problem with that: Melanie didn\u2019t want temporary with Carter.</p><p>She wanted forever.</p><p>Melanie tossed her keys onto the counter and sat down at the small kitchen table.</p> <p>Her dad\u2019s snores drifted in from the living room, along with the evening news. Louis had passed out in the recliner, a couple of beer cans on the table beside him.</p><p>\u201cOnly two tonight? Must\u2019ve been a good day,\u201d she said, taking off her shoes and messaging her aching feet. Then she stood and shuffled to the recliner, grabbing the remote and clicking off the television.</p><p>Ever since her momma had died from breast cancer, Melanie had been raised by her dad. Although some might argue she was using that term loosely. Louis had let her run hog-wild and fancy free, until a well-meaning (nosy as heck) woman had taken an eight year old Melanie under her wing one summer during Vacation Bible School.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t helped, but Melanie did get a best friend out of it: Zoe Ambrose.</p><p>Louis muttered something in his sleep and Melanie smiled. She snagged an orange and brown afghan from the sofa and covered him with it, brushing back his grey hair. \u201cSleep tight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRaylene?\u201d</p><p>Melanie froze, her heart pounding in her chest. There was only one Raylene in Holland Springs and she was married. Worse, she was married to Carter and Zoe\u2019s uncle, who just so happen to be their momma\u2019s favorite brother. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Melanie.\u201d She knew her daddy had been doing some odd jobs around Raylene and John\u2019s house. And she pleaded with God that Raylene wasn\u2019t one of those jobs.</p><p>Louis shifted in the recliner, his brown eyes blinking open. \u201cHey, sugar. How was work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She stared at her father for a moment, then said, \u201cAre you messing around with Raylene Alfred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t see how that\u2019s any of your business, young lady,\u201d he said and her heart plummeted to her toes. Any time he called her young lady, he was lying to her or trying to justify himself. \u201cMy private life is private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot around here it\u2019s isn\u2019t.\u201d She fisted her hands on her hips. \u201cEveryone knows how you like messing around with married women. Love \u2018em and leave their marriages in shambles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s different this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that every time!\u201d She held up her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you think you\u2019re in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are in love. Besides, John doesn\u2019t treat her right and she\u2019s miserable,\u201d Louis countered, sitting up in the recliner and pushing the bottom half down.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s not happy with John, then she needs to leave him before y\u2019all make a go of it. I\u2019m getting tired of having to defend you and your affairs.\u201d She really was, but she wouldn\u2019t stop sticking up for her dad. Louis was the only family she had and she loved him.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s saying she\u2019s not leaving him?\u201d Louis said as he stood. \u201cWho\u2019s to say that Raylene and I don\u2019t have plans?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. We\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, moving toward her room. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know about your plans. But for once in your life, can you think about the consequences?\u201d</p> <p>How many times had they been through this before? Louis Smith fell in and out of love like a thirteen year old girl. He always had plans, always knew that his latest was The One, and he was The One to save her from her loveless marriage.</p><p>Yet another reason why she needed to get her own place. Not knowing for a fact what her daddy was up to would take a lot of stress off of her.</p><p>Shutting the door behind her, she dug into the front pockets of her apron and started straightening and laying out her tips on her dresser. Sixty bucks wasn\u2019t too bad for a slow Monday night.</p><p>Biting the side of her lip, she considered the two jars in front of her. One labeled Trip Money and the other, House Money. One day she would have a home that didn\u2019t have wheels, that she couldn\u2019t be evicted from and a bed that was actually hers.</p><p>Most people thought she was flighty, unable to hold down a job or even finish college. But she had a plan and had been pre-approved for a loan. And it was all documented on her ancient computer. Still, she couldn\u2019t in good conscience buy that tiny cottage on three acres without some savings in the bank or a five thousand dollar down payment.</p><p>Plus, she wanted to travel, to see the world outside of Holland Springs. Her life so far had consisted of a hundred-mile radius. Pretty boring and pathetic.</p><p>So, the sensible thing to do would be to split the tips eighty-twenty in favor of the House Money Jar. But sometimes a girl needed a little excitement.</p><p>Smiling, she opened the Trip Money jar and put all but ten dollars in it.</p><p>Just as she put both lids back on, there was a knock at her door. \u201cSugar, can you spot me some money for the rent? I promise to settle up with you on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you my half last week,\u201d she said, opening her door. \u201cRight before you went down to Biloxi with...\u201d</p><p>Her dad looked away, his hand running through his hair.</p><p>She sagged against the door frame and placed her palm across her forehead. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t stay away, could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could make things easier on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy gambling away our rent money?\u201d Tears pricked at the back of her throat as she walked to her dresser and opened up her House Money Jar. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine hundred,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cRent\u2019s twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d The lid slipped from her grasp, falling to the floor. It landed on the carpet with a thud. Digging through the jar, she pulled out her money and counted out the amount he needed. Her heart pinched at the sight of a month\u2019s worth of tips from her House Jar. Who knew if she\u2019d ever get it back? Louis wasn\u2019t exactly a stickler for keeping his word. And settling up on Friday could mean this Friday or twenty Fridays from now.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d She turned to face him. \u201cYou told me my half was three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m still your dad.\u201d He walked inside her room and picked up the lid, then set it back on the jar. \u201cKnew you\u2019ve been trying to save up and all.\u201d</p><p>All the self-righteous anger she\u2019d let build up fled her body. She hugged her dad tight. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head affectionately. \u201cNo need to thank me.\u201d Then he stepped back and took her money, shoving it in his pants pocket. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you keep that in a bank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She smiled and untied her apron. \u201cI just like to make big deposits with lots of singles and fives. Makes all those stuffy ladies\u2019 eyes get real big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially when I tell them that, despite the down economy, lap dances are still high in demand. In fact it\u2019s my patriotic duty to go down to Jacksonville and make those poor Marines feel better,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Louis groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I want people to think of my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought that\u2019s how you met momma,\u201d Melanie reminded him.</p><p>\u201cShe was a cocktail waitress. Big difference in skill set and clothing choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreatly relieved to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did get a job as Carter Ambrose\u2019s assistant.\u201d</p><p>Her dad raised his brows. \u201cYou sure that\u2019s a wise thing? I know you\u2019ve always been sweet on him, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing.\u201d Melanie lifted her chin. \u201cAren\u2019t you ready for me to move out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYes, I want you to move out and find a nice guy who\u2019ll treat you right. Not like your last two boyfriends.\u201d</p><p>She tossed her apron on her bed. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me of those disasters.\u201d However, those two disasters were a positive reminder that she hadn\u2019t sat around mooning over Carter Ambrose. She\u2019d gone on with her life, especially after he\u2019d gotten engaged, and had fun. Now the timing was perfect. Neither of them were in a relationship (that she knew about anyway). It was up to her to make the most of it, maybe even make him fall in love with her.</p><p>\u201cNever been so happy in my life when you broke things off with Trent. Heard he\u2019s in prison now, for grand theft auto and assaulting an officer.\u201d Louis rapped his knuckled again the door. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll turn in, sugar. I\u2019m repairing the front and back porches at Rayl\u201d\u2014Melanie narrowed her eyes at him.\u2014\u201cMrs. Alfred\u2019s house tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing she could do to stop Louis. He was a grown man. So she had two choices: Stay mad at him. Or love him no matter what. \u201cNight, daddy. Don\u2019t stay too late tomorrow. I\u2019m cooking supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, tomorrow\u2019s my turn. See you in the morning.\u201d Louis walked out of her room, shutting the door softly behind him.</p><p>With a sigh, she moved to her dresser and began to undress. She needed a shower, else her bed would smell like Jack\u2019s Fine Italian Dining. Plus she needed to look her best tomorrow.</p><p>Carter had to stop viewing her as a kid. She rolled her eyes as she thought about his you\u2019re not much older comment.</p><p>She might be three years younger than him, but she knew men. Knew what they liked and didn\u2019t like. And she\u2019d known Carter since she was eight, and for dang sure, she knew what he liked: boobs and butts. Both of which she had. Okay so she might have more butt than boobs, but none of her ex-boyfriends had complained.</p><p>It was time to bring out the big guns.</p><p>Searching through her top drawer, she pulled out the laciest push-up bra she owned and smiled.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Carter frowned as Melanie walked into his office. It was either that or let his jaw drop to the floor. She was dressed in the sexiest do-me-I\u2019m-the-naughty-secretary outfit he\u2019d ever seen. She had always dressed in themes to match wherever she was going. Hell, it had been something he thought was kind of cute. Until today.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Sunshine,\u201d she said with a big smile. She tapped a black pen against the top of her clipboard, drawing his eyes to the deep vee of her shirt.</p><p>He blinked. Her breasts were about to spill out of it.</p><p>God help him.</p><p>Her smile wobbled a little, then she pressed her shoulders back and said, \u201cNeed some coffee to start off your day? If you show me where the coffee pot\u2014Oh, there it is.\u201d She sashayed over to the coffee maker on the file cabinet, black stiletto heels clicking on the floor.</p><p>Jesus. His weakness. There was something about a woman wearing heels so high that it pushed out her ass and breasts. So high that it made a woman look delicate and needy. Ready for a man to catch and do very dirty things to her.</p><p>She kicked up one foot as she reached for the mugs hanging on hooks above her. The black, narrow skirt she wore rode up her thighs.</p><p>\u201cStockings and garters? Ah, fuck me,\u201d he muttered to himself and bit his knuckle, willing his very inconvenient erection away while she chatted on, mercifully oblivious. Damn, but he was a sick son of a bitch. He shouldn\u2019t be lusting after anyone who worked for him, least of all Melanie.</p><p>Shooting to his feet, he grabbed his coat and held it in front of him. \u201cI have to go. Errands to run.\u201d</p><p>Melanie turned to face him, a little frown on her pouty lips. Lips so pouty that he wanted to bite the bottom and\u2014</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s what an assistant is for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot wearing that get-up you\u2019re not.\u201d No way in hell he\u2019d send her to Frank\u2019s. Not because the boys over there would do anything to her, but because they were boys and didn\u2019t know how to talk to a woman. And he didn\u2019t relish the notion of having to beat anyone\u2019s ass for being disrespectful. Old fashioned\u2014maybe, but he didn\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like, I mean, it\u2019s not appropriate for what I\u2019ll be doing for you?\u201d she asked, slowly smoothing her blouse down and then her skirt. \u201cI could go home real quick and change.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to groan at the images that formed in his head. Her outfit was very, very appropriate for what he wanted her to be doing for him. Shaking his head, he tried to clear his mind of her straddling his lap, her skirt at her waist and his cock buried balls deep inside her wet heat, while he sat in his office chair with his face in her breasts.</p><p>Son of a bitch. He had to think of something else. Grasping at straws, he asked, \u201cDo you really need this job?\u201d</p><p>The light in her pretty brown eyes faded. \u201cYes, especially after\u2014never mind.\u201d She turned away, but not before he saw tears welling.</p><p>Crossing the distance between them, he put his hand on her elbow and turned her to face him. \u201cLouis gambled his money away.\u201d Everyone knew about her dad\u2019s gambling. And when Louis Smith got a wild hair to bet it all, he usually lost his shirt. Usually Melanie had to find a way to pick up the pieces.</p><p>Her lower lip trembled as she nodded. \u201cI gave him almost all of my money from my House Jar...to pay the rent.\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell. \u201cHow often does he ask for your help?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. Damn, Louis did not deserve the excuse she was getting ready to make for him. \u201cNot that often. Just every couple months or so.\u201d</p><p>Carter let go of her elbow and rubbed the bridge of his nose, not trusting himself to speak at the moment. Someone needed to take Louis in hand, because Carter knew every couple months or so actually mean every other month. At that rate, Melanie would never move out of her dad\u2019s place.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell anyone, especially not Zoe. You know how she is and I can\u2019t take any money from her.\u201d</p><p>Why she trusted him with this, he had no idea. Well, that wasn\u2019t entirely true. About three years ago, he\u2019d found her sitting along the side of the road with two suitcases and a huge bag slung over her shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, Carter had offered her a ride. Turned out, she and her dad had been evicted from their rental. All they\u2019d let her pack was her clothes and some personal items. Louis had been up in Cherokee, presumably trying to change their luck.</p><p>He\u2019d driven her back to Holland Acres Mobile Home Park and paid what was owed, plus two extra months. He would have paid more, but Louis might have gotten the wrong idea.</p><p>Carter still remembered the kiss Melanie had given him in thanks, soft as a butterfly\u2019s caress and more potent than moonshine. But he had stopped her, really himself, before things had gone any further.</p> <p>\u201cYou know I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her nose crinkled a little as she smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but dust his thumb over her bottom lip. Her breath hitched and it was all he could do to not kiss her right then. \u201cHow about I give you an advance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d she asked and he could have sworn she stepped closer to him.</p><p>Tilting his head to the side, he let his thumb find the corner of her mouth, then coast along the line of her jaw. Melanie really was a pretty little thing. Always had been and mischievous as hell, too.</p> <p>She leaned into his touch, her eyes closing and chin tipping up. Black lashes brushing the tops of her cheeks and barely visible freckles. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hide those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHide what?\u201d Her sweet breath fanned over his face.</p><p>\u201cYour freckles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen don\u2019t like freckles.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, continuing his exploration of her face and easing his hand behind her neck. He wanted to undo the ridiculous bun she\u2019d put her hair up in. \u201cThis man does.\u201d Then he said the worst thing possible. \u201cIn fact I\u2019d like to see if you have freckles in other places.\u201d</p><p>Of their own volition, his fingers came from around her neck and coasted over her clavicle, down to the deep vee of her shirt. He nudged it to one side, watching in pure male satisfaction as goose bumps appeared. A perfect line of golden dots disappeared underneath her lacey black bra. Her breasts rose and fell, breaths coming out in little pants that made him harder than before.</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019d spend some time connecting the dots with my tongue,\u201d he added, tracing the lace at the edge of the cup.</p><p>Eyes popping open, she gaped at him. \u201cYou would?\u201d she all but squeaked.</p><p>It was as if someone had clipped his fender and woke his ass up. He dropped his hand and high-tailed it out of his office. \u201cBe back later. I need my files organized,\u201d he called over his shoulder.</p><p>Melanie stared after him, watching in disbelief as the door slammed closed. Then she walked over to his chair and flopped down in it, her heart still beating a mile a minute. Her nipples were hard and she was wet and throbbing between her thighs. Dear Lord, the man had barely touched her.</p><p>There was no way she could get anything done. At least not right now. She needed time to calm down. She needed to talk her best friend.</p><p>Picking up the receiver, she quickly dialed Zoe\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYay,\u201d Zoe squealed into the phone. \u201cWait, what worked?\u201d</p><p>Melanie rolled her eyes. \u201cBrain hasn\u2019t kicked in yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stayed up until four a.m.writing,\u201d Zoe said with a yawn.</p><p>\u201cWell your brother said he liked my freckles and wanted to see where else I had them,\u201d Melanie crowed. \u201cAnd some other stuff, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. He\u2019s coming \u2018round to my way of thinking.\u201d Melanie should\u2019ve taken the opportunity to touch him, only she had been scared that he would reject her.</p><p>There was silence on the line, so long that Melanie thought Zoe had hung up. A sliver of self-doubt tried to pierce her victory.</p><p>\u201cMel, you know I love you, right?\u201d</p><p>Oh crap, this couldn\u2019t be good. \u201cAnd I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lied,\u201d\u2014There was a pause and Melanie\u2019s forehead wrinkled\u2014\u201cabout things that could possibly hurt you. I also know how much you love\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust spit it out, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvangeline said that April called Carter last night, wanting to get back together. He\u2019s supposed to meet her for dinner this evening at Jack\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s heart fell to the pit of her stomach and she blew out a shaky breath. \u201cI\u2019m off tonight, but thanks for warning me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey. I really am, but I don\u2019t want you to get hurt,\u201d Zoe said, her voice sincere. \u201cCarter\u2019s not the type to string women around, but you\u2019re my best friend and I don\u2019t want to take the chance. Sometimes men, even ones you have high opinions of, turn out to be real asshats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Gabriel have another fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s been really sweet. Distant but sweet. Then again, Summer Holland is back in town and living with Patrick Johnson. I don\u2019t think Gabe is too happy about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2019s helping out her sister, Rose,\u201d Melanie said, grabbing a yo-yo in the shape of the globe. She spun it around on the desk top. \u201cI swear there is something about those Holland girls. It\u2019s like they have supernatural powers or something. Heck, if I liked women, I\u2019d date one of them. Only downside would be that if there was a bad breakup, I\u2019d no longer be able get my coconut bath and body stuff.\u201d</p><p>Zoe snorted, the familiar sound chasing away her blues. \u201cWell, as my momma says, the Hollands are an institution, and should be respected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour momma and her sayings.\u201d Amazing how Leah Ambrose would defend a whole family of women who supposedly preyed on men\u2014married to another or not. \u201cBet she\u2019d never say that about me. I\u2019m not \u201cfrom\u201d here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you stay away from her boys, you should be fine,\u201d Zoe said, then Melanie heard her friend smack herself. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. Oh, God, I am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Melanie said as she looked around Carter\u2019s office. She wrinkled her nose in disgust. The entire room needed to be cleaned from top to bottom. \u201cLook, I need to go. Work and all. Talk to you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could bring you lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a doll, but I brought it with me.\u201d She\u2019d be bringing all of her lunches from now on. After saying goodbye, Melanie hung up the phone and laid her head in her hands.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d celebrated victory too soon. Carter had all but run away from her. At the time she could have sworn it was because he had realized what he\u2019d said and what he\u2019d almost done, but now it most likely because he wanted to get back together with April Billingsworth, daughter of the current governor.</p><p>Really, who would chose trailer park over gated community? Rising from the chair, she moved to the radio by the window and cut it on, tuning it to her favorite country station. Pistol Annie\u2019s \u2018Bad Example\u2019 filled the room.</p><p>Yep, that was her.</p><p>Sighing, she moved to the filing cabinet and opened the top drawer.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be at work or something,\u201d Heath said as he tossed him a beer and a game controller.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in class?\u201d Carter shot back, then pressed the START button. Call of Duty III flashed on the screen.</p><p>\u201cIf I were in class, then you wouldn\u2019t be able to hide out in my apartment.\u201d Heath killed his player before he had time to blink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hiding.\u201d</p><p>Heath snorted, his dark blue eyes rolling. \u201cYeah, right. You\u2019ve been home for almost a month and this is the first damn time you\u2019ve stepped foot in my apartment.\u201d</p><p>Another kill and Carter threw his controller down in disgust.</p><p>\u201cHey, the game\u2019s not over, chicken shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kiss your momma with that mouth?\u201d Carter shot back. He had no idea why he\u2019d chosen to hang out with his eighteen year old brother of all people.</p><p>\u201cHell no. I stopped kissing her when I was fourteen and in love with Rose Holland.\u201d Leaning back in his chair, Heath smirked. \u201cGot over that when Isabella Edwards kissed me two months later. Then there was\u2014\u201d</p><p>Carter held up a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t need a fucking list of all the girl\u2019s you kissed, but please text me when you finally become a man.\u201d</p><p>Heath flipped him off, then his face grew serious. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>Now this was interesting. His baby brother was never serious, only concerned about having a good time, women and playing baseball. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever done something that you regretted?\u201d</p><p>Taking a pull of his beer, Carter nodded. \u201cYep. Matter of fact, I did something really stupid today, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean with your cars; I mean with another person. Something so big that you and she, er- that person had to keep it a secret.\u201d Heath didn\u2019t take his eyes off the screen. \u201cAnd now you wish you could have a do-over, only the other person involved won\u2019t give you the fucking time of day.\u201d</p><p>Carter set his beer down on a coffee table made of plywood and cinderblocks. \u201cAre you in trouble, Heath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d like to make things better with the person I hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good start.\u201d Ah, hell this was hard. He had no clue what his little brother had done, but he was almost a hundred percent sure that it had something to do with the preacher\u2019s daughter, Isabella Edwards.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. She won\u2019t answer my texts or my calls. And she\u2019s going to school clear across the country, so it\u2019s not like I can just hop on a plane and show up on her doorstep,\u201d Heath grumbled, then paused his game to grab a handful of chips.</p><p>His brother had all but confirmed it involved Isabella. Damn. \u201cLook, if you need to talk about something, anything, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>Just as his brother was about to answer, two of Heath\u2019s roommates burst through the door and the moment was lost. No way in hell they could talk now.</p><p>Heath flashed him a grin. One that didn\u2019t quite meet his eyes. \u201cNah...I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me...call me, text me\u2014whatever works for you,\u201d Carter said before he left. His little brother had it right though: Sometimes, you needed a do-over in life. All he had to do now was make sure that Melanie would accept his apology.</p><p>Should be as easy as nailing Jell-o to a wall.</p><p>Now this was familiar, Carter thought as his ex-fianc\u00e9 smiled at him. This was something he could handle. There wouldn\u2019t be any half-confessions or outfits meant to tease a man to the point of leaving his own damn garage.</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>His date cleared her throat and he forced a smile back on his face. April\u2019s had never left, perfectly white and full like a toothpaste commercial. Her hair was perfectly made up, just like the rest of her. No extraneous emotions, no outbursts...at least not in front of her daddy\u2019s constituents.</p><p>This was a woman in control of her wardrobe, her life and her career. In bed. Unfortunately, that hadn\u2019t translated into I\u2019m-in-control-of-my-man and you\u2019d better make each orgasm better than the last one. Too bad, because he wouldn\u2019t have been opposed to that in the least.</p><p>No, every move was calculated. Every sigh and moan. Eventually, great sex had become stale for him, because it felt like she was checking off a list. As in football season has started, guess it\u2019s time to break out the cheerleading outfit that\u2019s three sizes too small.</p><p>Even their breakup had been polite. A perfectly orchestrated scene in one of Charlotte\u2019s finest restaurants. She\u2019d cried and told him how sorry she was for wasting his time, but she wasn\u2019t ready to settle down. Or any kind of commitment. Amazingly enough he\u2019d been okay with that, not that he hadn\u2019t loved April. He had, but it was a toxic kind of love.</p><p>There had also been the little digs she\u2019d like to get in, the flirtations she liked to start with other men to make him jealous and the angry sex...lots of angry make-up sex, too. Damn near exhausting.</p><p>In the end he hadn\u2019t liked the person he\u2019d become while they were together, and had been searching for a way out of months. Breaking off an engagement with the daughter of the current Governor wasn\u2019t something a guy could just do without ramifications-at least according to April\u2019s father.</p><p>Maybe this hadn\u2019t been the best idea.</p><p>\u201cThis is probably a surprise for you,\u201d April said, toying with her still full glass of wine.</p><p>Carter forced his smile wider. \u201cI\u2019m not opposed to having dinner with old friends. We didn\u2019t end our relationship on bad terms, you know.\u201d His mother had been thrilled when she found out he was having dinner with April while he\u2019d wanted to strangle the person who had told Leah his business. Leah had made it perfectly clear that she wanted him to get back together with April. That he and April would have the most beautiful babies together. As the oldest, it was Carter\u2019s duty to provide grandchildren as soon as possible.</p><p>That perfect smile of hers slipped, becoming brittle. \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t but I did.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>She glanced around the dining room. Patrons talked, drank and ate, ignoring them. \u201cI know you cheated on me, Carter, and I think you should finally come clean about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind,\u201d he said, then took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve never cheated on anyone. Never will either.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, brittle smile staying firmly in place. \u201cDaytona, after party. Cute blonde, wearing a racing jumpsuit. Big brown eyes staring at you with hero worship. You took her back to her hotel room because she\u2019d gotten sick.\u201d She made little air quotes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was only one cute blonde that fit that description: Melanie Ann Smith. He\u2019d invited her and his sister, along with his brothers to the race and the party afterwards. \u201cMelanie? Oh, come on, I\u2019ve known her since she was eight.\u201d</p><p>When April remained silent, he added. \u201cShe\u2019d had too much to drink and so had my sister. No telling where the two of them would\u2019ve ended up without my help. My God, April, you were there.\u201d</p><p>Hair the color of caramel was tossed over a slender shoulder.\u201cYeah, and I came to see what was taking you so long.\u201d</p> <p>The implication that he\u2019d been found guilty and convicted without a trial turned his body hot with fury. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you scoop her up in your arms and she snuggled all against you before you smiled at her and walked inside. Like y\u2019all had done that before.\u201d April laughed. \u201cWho am I kidding? You had to have done that before, because you sure as hell never smiled at me like that.\u201d</p><p>Jesus H. Christ. A fucking smile made him guilty? \u201cWell, if you had stuck around, then you would have seen me come out about thirty seconds later\u2014alone.\u201d He picked up his napkin from his lap and threw it on the table. \u201cI give women a whole lot more than thirty seconds of pleasure and you know it, having been on the receiving end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d April said and his mouth fell open. There was a gasp and his head jerked up, finding Melanie, only a few feet away, staring at him. Her face was pale and he\u2019d never seen her eyes so big. Hell, he\u2019d never seen her looked so crushed, not even when he and April had announced their engagement.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that convenient,\u201d April said, her voice smug. \u201cI think she\u2019s in love with you.\u201d</p> <p>Melanie in love with him? A crush, maybe, but that was a long time ago. \u201cNo. She\u2019s just known me forever and...\u201d He watched Melanie run outside. Fuck. But he couldn\u2019t go after her. Not right now. He directed his attention back to April. \u201cI\u2019ll do right by you and\u201d\u2014he swallowed\u2014\u201cthe baby.\u201d The response was automatic, taking responsibility for his actions something that had been taught to him for as long as he could remember.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m four months along.\u201d April\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWe haven\u2019t slept together in eight months, Carter. It\u2019s not yours. The father is daddy\u2019s new campaign manager, Ned.\u201d She shook her head and muttered, \u201cWhy is it that the pretty ones are always so stupid?\u201d</p><p>Relief coursed through him and he tried to feel remorse or even like an ass, but he couldn\u2019t. And he didn\u2019t give a shit about her stupid remark. Thing was, he couldn\u2019t imagine his entire life tied to April. The baby, he wouldn\u2019t have minded at all. Only he or she would be used in campaign ads, whether he liked it or not.</p><p>\u201cSo, why are you telling me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I cheated with Ned in retaliation, and that\u2019s why I quit screwing you before we broke up.\u201d April lifted her glass of wine, then set it back down and picked up her glass of water.</p><p>Rubbing his temples, he exhaled. \u201cLet me get this straight: You thought I cheated on you, so instead of talking to me and finding out the truth, you decided to screw another man to get back at me, but kept everything quiet.\u201d Her logic made his head hurt. \u201cAnd your problem is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNed is married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is.\u201d Carter pinched the bridge of his nose, then dropped his hand to the table. \u201cAgain, why are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s willing to make it worth your while to claim it\u2019s yours.\u201d She pulled a check out of her purse, placed it on the table and slid it over to him.</p><p>The amount of zeros made him blink. It was a damn good thing he had morals, and the millions he\u2019d accumulated over the past few years didn\u2019t hurt things. \u201cTo avoid a scandal?\u201d</p><p>April gave him this look and in that second he could see fifty years worth of that look. He shuddered. \u201cThink of what it could do for you, to be married to the daughter of the Governor. Maybe translate into a run for office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were together for three years, Carter. Of course, I know you,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, his brows rising. \u201cWhat\u2019s my favorite television show?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Golden Girls.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she said, \u201cGive me another one.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she hated to be wrong. Ever. \u201cFavorite beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAle Brown Nights.\u201d</p><p>Well, she was bound to get one right. Plus, they had been a major sponsor of his. \u201cFavorite cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYellow, with buttercream frosting.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s voice slipped inside his head. Brought your favorite...German Chocolate... As upset as she\u2019d looked, he hoped like hell she hadn\u2019t driven off somewhere. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFavorite track?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalledega\u2014too easy.\u201d Yeah, that was too easy, because that was all she had cared about: Carter winning every race. Confidence made her smile. \u201cGive me something hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNames and ages of all of my brothers and sisters. Since we were together for two years it should be easy, right?\u201d Picking up his glass of red wide, he drank deeply and set the glass down.</p><p>\u201cZoe, twenty-four; Heath, nineteen; Evangeline, sixteen.\u201d She smirked. \u201cGuess I know you better than you thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, honey. Heath\u2019s eighteen and you forgot the twins, Luke and Logan, twenty-three.\u201d</p><p>April\u2019s nose wrinkled. \u201cBut they\u2019re not your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke and Logan are my brothers, no matter the color of their skin or what language they spoke first. Funny how right I was about you. Can\u2019t tell you how much I hate that I wasted so much time trying to prove myself wrong. \u201d</p><p>\u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d he added and rose to his feet, paid their bill on the way out and went to look for Melanie.</p><p>Carter found Melanie out back, sniffing and shivering. White puffs of air floated with every breath she took.</p><p>Taking off his coat, he draped it over her shoulders. \u201cDid I chase you off earlier today?\u201dhe asked. He hadn\u2019t returned to his garage until well after five. His office had been organized and he could tell she\u2019d begun to clean.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of my jobs. I had the night off, but Kelsey called in sick,\u201d she said with another little sniff. \u201cCongratulations, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a jerk, Carter.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but smile and shake his head. She would defend a woman who\u2019d never been anything but rude to her. \u201cThis really isn\u2019t any of your business, but she\u2019s four months pregnant and we haven\u2019t been together in eight months. Math doesn\u2019t work out and she told me who the father is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looked up at him then, the security lights in the parking lot highlighting her pretty face and the multiple paths of wetness on her cheeks. His heart pinched at the sight. \u201cSorry for calling you a jerk.\u201d</p><p>Using his thumb to wipe away the tears, he tried teasing her. \u201cGotta admit, I liked what you were wearing in my office better than what you have on now. Best theme outfit I\u2019ve ever seen you in.\u201d</p><p>The most adorable scowl appeared on her face. Thinking she was adorable was okay. Puppies, kittens and babies were adorable. \u201cNow I\u2019m back to not being sorry.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his coat tighter around her body, then started buttoning her up. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re teasing me.\u201d A lock of hair had come loose from her ponytail. It seemed to glow as he picked it up and tucked it behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always teased you, Melanie.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. That wasn\u2019t adorable in the least, mostly because it made him want to lick her lips, too. \u201cYeah, well, I don\u2019t want you doing it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Then how the hell was he supposed to talk to her? \u201cYou want me to treat you like a sister?\u201d It hit him right in the gut how much he did not want to treat her like that, as if she were an afterthought, or still a pain in the ass kid that had followed him everywhere, always spying on him.</p><p>\u201cYou already treat me like one.\u201d Her shoulders fell, then she took a deep breath and looked him right in the eye. \u201cI want to be treated like a woman, with needs and wants that only a certain kind of man can satisfy.\u201d</p><p>Damn, but she couldn\u2019t have said the most perfectly sexy and terrifying thing right then. \u201cSuppose I know a man who\u2019d be up for that. A man who\u2019d not stop until every need and want was met to your satisfaction.\u201d Ah, hell. There was no going back now. His dick was all up for it. Literally. \u201cAnd if it wasn\u2019t...well, he\u2019d redouble his efforts and take it from the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that man supposed to be you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if it were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFat chance that will happen,\u201d she said, her voice laced with sarcasm. \u201cNot that I care. There are plenty of men around here.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy, hot and lethal to his state of mind, coursed through Carter, surprising him with its intensity. He pulled her to him. Her eyes grew wide, then heavy-lidded. Oh yeah, she cared. So, he leaned down, hovering his mouth mere inches from hers. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m your man.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Gazing into Carter\u2019s dark green eyes set Melanie off-kilter, like she\u2019d been spun around on a ride at the county fair and hadn\u2019t found her center of gravity yet. The only other time she\u2019d ever been this up close and personal had been when he\u2019d caught her taking pictures of him skinny dipping with Naomi Price in the Pamlico Sound. Though he wouldn\u2019t have caught her if she hadn\u2019t fallen out of the tree she\u2019d been hiding in.</p><p>Except this time, there wasn\u2019t murder and embarrassment on his face as he patted her down, searching for broken legs or arms while yelling at her for being a nosy pain in his rear.</p><p>Oh no, Carter was extremely serious.</p><p>His lips lightly brushed against hers, over and over, like he was teasing her. She tried to put her arms around to get him to kiss her fully, only they were trapped beneath his coat. She was trapped beneath his coat. She\u2019d rather be trapped by his body.</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d she whispered against his mouth. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited my whole life for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say the most amazing things to puff up a man\u2019s ego.\u201d He her drew in her bottom lip and lightly bit it. Her knees went weak and she sagged against him. \u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she rose up on her toes. She used the tip of her tongue to trace the seam of his mouth. As soon as he parted his lips, she slid inside and his tongue met hers. He growled, his shoes crunching on gravel as he moved out of the parking lot light.</p><p>His hands moved to the front of his coat, unbuttoning and sliding inside to touch her. One of his thumbs found a tight nipple through her thin bra and shirt, beginning a slow glide. \u201cBefore the night is over, I\u2019m going to have these in my mouth,\u201d he said between kisses as he pushed up her shirt.</p><p>The cold night air washed over her but she was too hot for him to care.</p><p>\u201cUnfasten your bra.\u201d</p><p>Hands trembling with desire and excitement went to the fastening in the front, his dark gaze tracking her movements. With one tug, the fabric fell away and her breasts spilled out.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ that\u2019s a sweet sight.\u201d All at once, he pivoted and her back hit the brick wall of the restaurant. He sealed his mouth over hers and cupped her breasts. For long, sweet moments, there was nothing but his mouth on hers. Nothing but tasting and pleasure. Nothing but Carter.</p><p>Then his head dipped, lips wrapping around a taut nipple. She cried out when he began to suck, deep pulls followed by slow swirls of his tongue. \u201cYou taste so damn good.\u201dHe sandwiched a thigh between her legs, pressing against where she throbbed the most. \u201cThere you go...grind down on me.\u201d</p><p>Shamelessly, she rolled her hips and rode him. Moan after moan sang out. At this moment she didn\u2019t care who heard her.</p><p>From a distance she heard the squeaky hinges of the back door of the restaurant open. \u201cThat\u2019s it\u2014you\u2019re fired.\u201d</p><p>Carter jerked away from her and she opened her eyes. \u201cOh my God.\u201d Her body ran cold, then hot with embarrassment. They\u2019d been like two alley cats, in heat and going at it.</p><p>Light from the interior of the restaurant shone on him. His cheeks were flushed and he was breathing hard, but desire no longer flared his gorgeous eyes.</p><p>His gaze moved lower. \u201cFix your clothes before someone sees.\u201d</p><p>Trying not to flinch at his harsh tone, she refastened her bra and smoothed down her shirt. \u201cSomeone already saw.\u201d Us, she wanted to add, because she knew that was what he had meant to say.</p><p>His jaw worked. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure Jack keeps his mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Fisting her hands on her hips, she lifted her chin. \u201cWorried about your reputation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said and done some dumb things, Melanie,\u201d he said with a shake of his head, \u201cBut that blows them all out of the water.\u201d</p><p>If it had been anyone but him calling her dumb, she would have rolled her eyes and laughed it off. But this was Carter, the man who never said anything he didn\u2019t mean. \u201cThat\u2019s me: the town dummy,\u201d she said, tears gathering in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twisting my words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Pulling his coat from around her shoulder, she threw it at him and started for the door. \u201cYou always mean what you say.\u201d Her purse and fleece pullover were inside, under the utensil station. Maybe she could get in and out of there before anyone saw her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabbed her arm, but she shook it off. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me again. You know I have a good left hook and I\u2019m not afraid to use it.\u201d</p><p>Carter let go. Actually, her left hook was great and he\u2019d been the one to teach her how to make a fist properly. The rest came naturally. But none of that mattered, because he\u2019d hurt her. \u201cWould you stop and listen to me?\u201d</p><p>She tossed her ponytail and crossed her arms. \u201cWhy\u2014so you can tell me how smart I am?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d A little gasp left her mouth and she spun on her heel. Son of a bitch. Way to go, Carter. He strode after her. \u201cLet me finish.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, she kept walking and he kept following.</p><p>\u201cMelanie Ann Smith, with God as my witness, if you don\u2019t quit acting like a child, I\u2019ll turn you over my knee and spank your ass.\u201d That got her attention. He smiled in grim satisfaction as she froze in place. Unfortunately, it also got the entire kitchen staff\u2019s attention.</p><p>All conversation stopped. Eight pairs of eyes stared at the two of them. Only the radio blared and pots of noodles bubbled in the background.</p><p>\u201cI have to get my things,\u201d Melanie said, her voice hoarse. She knelt in the floor and pulled out her purse and pullover. \u201cWe can talk tomorrow morning, unless you\u2019re firing me, too.\u201d</p> <p>He scrubbed his hand over his face. Her job. It was all his fault. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always on time,\u201d he heard her say before she marched out the way she\u2019d come in, face scarlet and head held high.</p><p>What was wrong with him? First he\u2019d all but screwed Melanie in the parking lot, up against a building for Christ\u2019s sake. Then he\u2019d humiliated the hell out of her when they\u2019d gotten caught. He had to fix this for her. It was the least he could do before he apologized.</p><p>Carter nodded at Jack, who\u2019d just walked in. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d already been warned about taking too long of a break,\u201d Jack said, wiping his hands on the apron around his hips.</p><p>\u201cThis is was my fault, not hers,\u201d Carter insisted, hoping to get the man to listen to reason. He\u2019d known Jack since first grade. They\u2019d played high school football together and sneaked six-packs of beer on the activity bus after games.</p> <p>Jack grunted. \u201cMaybe so. But I\u2019ve got a business to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do and I respect that, but she needs this job.\u201d Carter shook out his coat, then put it on.</p><p>\u201cThen you hire her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile kicked up the corners of Jack\u2019s mouth. \u201cProblem solved.\u201d He turned his attention to the cooks. \u201cGet back to work. I\u2019m not paying you to stand around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for your help, Jack,\u201d Carter called over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cConsider it payback. I lost ten grand on you last year.\u201d Jack grabbed a plate, inspecting it before sending it out. \u201cNow that you\u2019re a has-been, I can recoup my money on your teammate, Jake.\u201d</p><p>Has-been? He was twenty-seven years old and could beat anyone in a race, blindfolded. Done it once too. Although it hadn\u2019t turned out so well on the victory lap.</p> <p>Carter started to tell Jack to go fuck himself, then shook his head and strode outside. People like Jack were exactly why Carter should open his business in Charlotte. Small towns bred small minds.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, Carter found himself crossing the Johnston county line. To his right he spied a sign advertizing a Sprint Car Race and it just so happened to be tonight.</p><p>He glanced at the clock on the dash and grinned. It was almost seven, plenty of time to catch the last few races. Downshifting, he headed to his old stomping grounds.</p><p>Turning down a dark, bumpy road, he headed to the brightly lit track where he\u2019d gotten his start. A man with a light baton pointed to a semi-full row of vehicles. Carter found the closest empty space and parked, his heart pumping with adrenaline.</p><p>The roar of Sprint Car engines had him pick up his pace, until he jogged to the entrance. He paid admission, bought a beer and ambled over to the stands. He climbed up to the back of the bleachers, where he wouldn\u2019t have to wear protective eye-gear or ear plugs. Men and women covered in a sheen of dirt nodded at him, some widening their eyes and whispering.</p><p>The stands and his chest rumbled as a pack of cars raced by, a chain length fence the only thing separating the spectators from the action. The smell of racing fuel and burnt rubber filled the air, making him feel right at home.</p><p>A little boy, wearing a shirt with Carter\u2019s face on the back, glanced over his shoulder, eyes widening as Carter grinned at him. Tugging on his dad\u2019s arm, the kid pointed behind him. Both turned to Carter and this time it was the dad who got that holy-crap-it\u2019s-you look on his face.</p><p>\u201cCome on up,\u201d Carter mouthed at the duo, with an uptick of his chin.</p><p>Grinning big, the kid and his dad made their way to him.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Carter. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Carter shook the boy\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cKyle.\u201d Kyle\u2019s grin nearly split his face in two, as he continued to shake Carter\u2019s hand. \u201cI knew it was you, Mr. Ambrose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon now, Kyle, Mr. Ambrose is my dad,\u201d he said, finally getting his hand back. \u201cYou can call me Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin, Beau, is racing right now. He wants to be just like you, Mr. Carter, only without hitting the wall twice in one year.\u201dKyle\u2019s skin went white under his freckles, as though he\u2019d just realized he\u2019d insulted him.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d Carter gave the kid a mock wince, then tapped the brim of Kyle\u2019s baseball cap. \u201cBeau sounds like a smart kid.\u201d</p><p>Another pack of cars approached and all conversation stopped as the three of them braced for the next mini-earthquake.</p><p>\u201cStanley Phelps.\u201d Kyle\u2019s dad extended a hand. \u201cHope we\u2019re not bothering you, but Kyle\u2019s a real big fan, just like the rest of us. My nephew has posters of you all over his room.\u201d</p><p>Carter clapped the man on his shoulder, a puff of dirt floating up. \u201cYou\u2019re not bothering me at all. I\u2019m mighty honored that y\u2019all are taking time away from watching your nephew to come talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d Kyle shouted, pointing to a bright green car. It broke sideways on the corner, then righted itself on the straightaway.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good.\u201d Carter took a pull of his beer when Beau almost painted the bumper of another car. And seriously reckless. The kid was going to get his ass kicked after the race if he didn\u2019t watch it.</p><p>\u201cCan we sit with you, Mr. Carter?\u201d Kyle sat down on the bleacher.</p><p>Nodding, Carter sat down beside him and Stanley took the opposite side of this son. They watched the race, the occasional hiss of breath and cheer from Kyle breaking their silence.</p><p>A woman waved a flag over the track, signaling that it was the last lap.</p><p>\u201cGo, Beau, go,\u201d Kyle shouted, but the kid\u2019s enthusiasm didn\u2019t help. His cousin came in next to last place. \u201cWell, crud, tonight was his last race. Daddy said he couldn\u2019t spend any more money, until he won one.\u201d</p><p>Stanly and Kyle stood, shoulder slumped and faces glum.</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting us sit with you,\u201d Stanley said with a tip of his hat.</p><p>\u201cBeau won\u2019t believe it when I tell him who we sat with during the race,\u201d Kyle crowed, jumping up and down on the bleachers.</p><p>Carter stood, craning his neck to find the driver of the bright green car. Beau emerged, tossing his helmet to another kid, then kicked at the dirt. Carter knew exactly how he felt.</p><p>\u201cWould it be alright if I said hello to Beau?\u201d</p><p>Stanley nodded and Kyle grabbed Carter\u2019s hand. He followed them down to the Pit. Memories bubbling to the surface of his first race, his first wreck and the first time he got his ass handed to him. Carter couldn\u2019t fight the grin. So much better than all the frowning and grimacing he\u2019d been doing in the past twenty-four hours. The tightness that had worked its way deep inside of him eased and he exhaled, blowing away the frustration.</p><p>\u201cIs that Carter Ambrose?\u201d A sandy-haired boy\u2019s mouth dropped open, gum falling to the ground.</p><p>Winking, Carter put a finger to his lips. He didn\u2019t mind people discovering he was here, but having it advertised was another. The fans in the bleachers should be cheering on their local favorites, not him. Taking away another driver\u2019s fifteen minutes wasn\u2019t anywhere on his radar.</p><p>Carter hung back as Stanley talked to his nephew. All of seventeen, with hair the same shade of green as the Sprint car stuck up in clumps, Beau pointed to the track and shook his head. A silver hoop pierced his lip while dirt streaked his face and his suit.</p><p>Beau walked over to him, an expression of chagrin on his face. \u201cHoly shit, it is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth,\u201d Stanley shouted.</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Beau leaned into Carter. \u201cHe gets on my ass all the time for my language but my aunt\u2019s the one that curses like a sailor. Uncle Stanley don\u2019t say a damn thing to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well...happy wife, happy life,\u201d Carter said. He sliced his gaze to the Sprint Car. \u201cCan I take a look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave at it. Maybe you can tell me what\u2019s wrong with her.\u201d</p><p>Carter ran his hand over the roof, sliding his fingers down to the hood that was still hot. The kid\u2019s ride was sweet. Popping the hood, he checked out the engine. You could tell a lot about a man by the cleanliness of his engine. Or lack thereof. Chrome glinted under the track lights, shiny and mostly free from dirt.</p><p>Beau cared alright. A point in his favor, but would he be able to take some constructive criticism? Being able to not only take, but follow a season racer\u2019s advice took a good driver to great, maybe even outstanding.</p><p>\u201cEver consider it might be the driver and not the equipment?\u201d</p><p>Beau crossed his arms. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Kyle ran over and climbed in the window. He began to make racing sounds.</p><p>\u201cYou a betting man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d Beau lifted his chin, all cocky attitude. \u201cIf the prize is worth anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour hundred says you come in the top two the next time you race, if you listen to my advice.\u201d Carter pressed the hood down and looked Beau in the eye. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll pay your entry fees for the rest of the season and for your fuel. Either way, you win.\u201d</p><p>Beau grinned and stuck out his hand. \u201cYou got a deal.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Carter was four hundred short and covered in dirt from head to toe as he headed back to his truck. Sometimes everything worked out just right. Beau was teachable and not totally stubborn or hot-heated.</p><p>Turned out, the kid and his family had just moved to the outskirts of Holland Springs, from Forestville. He would be starting Holland Springs High School next week.</p><p>So, Carter had given him a job in his garage. Which meant that he would have to find something for the kid to do when he moved back to Charlotte...if he moved back to Charlotte. If, if, if.</p><p>Letting his head fall back against the headrest, he considered driving his truck into the ocean. That made about as much sense as giving Beau a job and getting involved with Melanie.</p><p>Only it made complete sense. Yeah, he was completely screwed.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Melanie flipped down the visor and took one last look at herself, before heading inside to Carter\u2019s office. Her make-up was subdued, her hair straight as a board (and boring as one) and there was nothing remotely sexy about her outfit.</p><p>She got out of her old Honda, locking the door behind her.</p><p>Her borrowed lime green skirt swished around her legs as she walked, gravel made of oyster shells and rock crunching under her boots. The skirt was supposed to be ankle length, only she had borrowed it from Zoe who was about four inches shorter and had had it hemmed.</p><p>A cold breeze blew, making her wrap the bright orange wool cardigan tighter around her. It was possibly the most hideous outfit she\u2019d ever worn. What looked cute on her best friend, made Melanie look like a Halloween costume gone wrong.</p><p>Carter blinked at her a couple of times as she walked through the garage. In his hand he held some kind of tool and there was a black smudge on his cheek. The dark grey thermal t-shirt he wore emphasized his muscular arms, and she knew that if he gave her the back view of his jeans, her lady parts would get all tingly.</p><p>Stupid lady parts.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he said, setting the tool down and grabbing a cloth. Walking toward her, he wiped off his hands and smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s fresh pot of coffee in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink coffee, and you missed a spot on your cheek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you, too.\u201d After wiping off his face, he threw the towel in a hamper by the office door. \u201cI need at least two cups before I even feel human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just too dumb to know any better,\u201d she snapped, then inwardly cringed. This wasn\u2019t how to keep a job. Thanks to her lack of good judgment and ability to tell time, she couldn\u2019t tell Carter to take his assistant position and shove it.</p><p>His deep green eyes grew serious. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I said. And it came out all wrong. I\u2019d like for you to forgive me and for us to start over.\u201d He moved closer to her and she had to tilt her head back look at him. Something she thought was sexy as hell. Being five foot eight, it made her feel all dainty when she wore heels and a man towered over her. Well, not a man. Carter.</p><p>She frowned at her wayward thoughts.</p><p>Misunderstanding her frown, he took a step forward. \u201cTell me what I have to do to fix it. This isn\u2019t us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t an \u2018us\u2019, Carter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took another step forward and she stepped back, glancing over her shoulder. They repeated their dance until he\u2019d managed to shepherd her into his office and shut the door behind him. \u201cI made it pretty damn clear last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pushed at his chest, her palm meeting with muscles so hard that she wanted to weep. \u201cYou made it perfectly clear that I\u2019m fine to mess around with in the dark, where no one can see.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together, perfect lips thinning. \u201cI had your nipple in my mouth when Jack came storming out there. He could see everything. Everything he had no damn business or right to see.\u201d</p><p>Was Carter being possessive? Maybe even a little jealous? A wicked part of her wanted to find out the truth. \u201cWho says he hadn\u2019t already seen everything.\u201d</p> <p>He was on her so quickly that her heart barely had time to beat twice. \u201cHe won\u2019t be seeing everything ever again.\u201dCarter\u2019s voice was smooth and calm, in direct conflict with the fury in his eyes. Strong hands tightened around her upper arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a grown woman. If I want to prance up and down Broad Street wearing nothing but two band-aids and a leaf, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d She tried wiggling out of his embrace, but his grip was like steel bands. \u201cYou don\u2019t own me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, but you drive me crazy.\u201d He brushed his lips over hers and she shivered. \u201cAlways have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling\u2019s entirely mutual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it now?\u201d he asked with a smile so smug that she wanted to wipe it off his face. He bent his head down, his breath hot on her neck. \u201cLast night I dreamed about you.\u201d</p> <p>Her head fell back of its own accord as his tongue traced a path along her jaw. She could barely get out the words, \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d his voice had gone deep, almost guttural sounding. \u201cYou showed up at my garage wearing a trench coat with nothing but stocking and garters on underneath. And stilettos. Can\u2019t forget those.\u201d</p><p>She could stop herself from asking, \u201cThen what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you?\u201d He lifted her in his arms, his large hands cupping her butt. A good thing since her knees had ceased to exist. Unable to speak, she wrapped her legs around his waist, his erection deliciously pressing against her sex. He set her down on the edge of his desk and smiled like the confident man he\u2019d become. \u201cNever took you for the quiet type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever took you for the type that never shuts up,\u201d she said, leaning back and propped her arms on the desktop while he made quick work of the buttons on her cardigan.</p><p>\u201cYou can shut me up anytime, baby.\u201d</p> <p>Eyeing the large Crown Royale clock over the door, she said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the cups of her bra down until her breasts popped out, tight nipples begging for his attention. \u201cFast is for the racetrack, not the bedroom.\u201d He tweaked a hard peak and her hips jerked.</p><p>\u201cAn assistant is for working, not screwing on top of your desk during business hours,\u201d she panted. No way in hell they\u2019d have sex while she was on the clock.</p><p>Green eyes laced with bits of black glinted. \u201cTen minutes it is.\u201d Then he sealed his mouth over hers. Her hands went to his head, curling her fingers into his short strands of hair. He tasted of coffee and mint...and Carter. All male and all hers.</p><p>Large hands slid under her skirt, up her bare thighs until he discovered what she wasn\u2019t wearing. \u201cAh, hell...no panties,\u201d he growled against her mouth. \u201cSo damn wet.\u201d</p><p>She gasped as he thrust two fingers inside of her, his thumb finding her clitoris with a practiced ease.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes isn\u2019t enough time to fuck you properly.\u201d He tugged on her bottom lip, then released it. \u201cInstead I\u2019m going play and you\u2019re going to come all over my hand.\u201d</p><p>Staring up at him, she could feel the blush spreading over her face. Carter never talked like this\u2014so raw and dirty. He pumped his fingers in and out of her, his thumb pressing hard as it moved in circular motions.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it...ride my fingers,\u201d he said before biting down on the lobe of her ear. She moaned in response. \u201cDamn, but you are tight. I can barely move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been...a while,\u201d she said, her voice breaking on a moan.</p><p>He leaned back, looking at her. \u201cWant me to make it easier on you?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, her hips rising to meet his thrusts. \u201cH-how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this.\u201d Suddenly, he shifted, his soft hair brushing against her bare thighs.</p><p>Her eyes opened. Then his tongue replaced his thumb and she cried out. He pushed her down to his desk with his free hand, wrapping his arm around her hips to pull her even closer to the edge.</p><p>Teasing licks around her clitoris had her gulping for air. And when he sucked it into his mouth, she let out a scream and smacked the top of his desk with her palms. Either she would burst into flames or pass out if he did that again.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself. Make those sweet nipples of yours even harder,\u201d he rasped against her delicate folds. He flicked his tongue over her clit, his eyes so dark they looked black.</p><p>Without hesitating, she trailed the tips of her fingers over her breasts, watching Carter watch her as he continued to lick and suck and fill her. She pinched her nipples, rolling them between her fingers until she heard him groan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna feel so fucking good around my cock.\u201d</p><p>The thought of him inside of her, thrusting harder and deeper than his fingers was enough to send her over the edge. Once more, he sucked her clitoris into his mouth and she went up in flames, screaming his name as she burned.</p><p>Carter was so hard, his dick could be used as a car jack.</p><p>He glanced back at the clock. Five minutes. The hands of the clock burned into his brain, until he looked down at the woman splayed so wantonly on his desk. All flushed from her orgasm, messy hair and pouty lips begging to be kissed. Satisfaction rose in him. He\u2019d done that to her.</p><p>And he was going to do it again.</p><p>Leaning down, he kissed her gently, until she ran her hands up his arms and pulled him down to her. The kiss deepened, tongues slipping and sliding against the other.</p><p>The garage door hummed and rattled as it began to rise.</p><p>Panic filled Melanie\u2019s eyes. \u201cLet me up,\u201d she said, her voice reed thin.</p><p>Helping her up, he winced as his fly rubbed against his erection. He would be sore as hell in a few hours.</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d a very familiar female voice called out. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here, momma.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s face went white, then she moved at warp speed. \u201cOh God, oh God,\u201d she chanted as she smoothed down her shirt, skirt and hair. She whirled to face him. \u201cDo I look okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he lied, snagging the daily paper to hold in front of him to conceal his hard-on. She looked like a woman had who just been satisfied while he felt like a damn teenager.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Leah Ambrose said as she walked in the office. She stopped, glancing from him to Melanie. \u201cDid I come at a bad time?\u201d</p><p>He sliced his gaze to Melanie and raised his brows conspiratorially.</p><p>Melanie\u2019s mouth trembled, then her hand slammed over it and she ran out of the office, shoulders shaking. The sound of her laughter echoed in the garage and it was all Carter could do to not join her.</p><p>Leah\u2019s forehead wrinkled. \u201cShe always was a strange girl. Bless her heart.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat brings you out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a reason to visit my son?\u201d Leah walked around the room, eyes not missing a thing. \u201cThought I\u2019d invite you to dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApril still there?\u201d Just saying her name was enough to get rid of his erection. He threw the paper on his desk and moved to the coffee maker, pouring himself another cup. \u201cWant some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thank you,\u201d Leah said, her voice prim. \u201cAnd yes, she\u2019s still here. Poor girl is devastated you won\u2019t give her another chance. I spent almost the entire night consoling her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend her back to Charlotte.\u201d He took a sip of his coffee, not really wanting to wash away the taste of Melanie on his tongue. Turning to face his mother, Melanie walked back inside his office. His heart flipped his chest. There was no stopping the grin that kicked up his mouth at the corners.</p><p>Melanie returned that grin with a sweet, confident smile of her own.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his attention back to his mother. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019ll let you two get back to work.\u201d Leah\u2019s lips thinned for a moment, then she smiled, but it didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. Yeah, she was really unhappy with him. But there was no way in hell he would get back together with April.</p><p>\u201cSee you tonight, Ms. Leah,\u201d Melanie said, \u201cZoe invited me to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that something,\u201d his mother said as she ran her eyes up and down Melanie. \u201cDid she invite you into her closet as well?\u201d</p><p>A dull flush crept up Melanie\u2019s throat. \u201cI-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how those two are,\u201d Carter said, unable to fully comprehend how rude his mother had just been. \u201cBesides I think that outfit looks good on her. Maybe a little early for dressing up as the Great Pumpkin for Halloween though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Great Pumpkin. Seriously?\u201d Melanie rolled her eyes, but the embarrassed look on her face had disappeared. \u201cGee thanks.\u201d</p><p>Their exchange seemed to mollify Leah, because she shook her head and tsked. \u201cSome things never change.\u201d</p><p>A wicked gleam appeared in Melanie\u2019s eyes and he gave her a don\u2019t-you-say-it look. Thankfully she kept her mouth shut and only waved good-bye to Leah as she left.</p><p>He shut the office door and moved closer to Melanie, placing his hands on her hips. \u201cNow where were we?\u201d</p><p>She leaned into him, her breasts rubbing against his shirt as her lips touched his throat. His mouth went dry. \u201cAt work. Your ten minutes was up five minutes ago.\u201d Then the little witch laughed at him and wriggled out of his embrace.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cAre you really not coming to dinner?\u201d Melanie asked, her purse on her shoulder and her hand on the door. It was after five-thirty and she needed to be at the Ambroses\u2019 house before six. Leah was worse about being punctual than Carter, which explained where he got it.</p><p>Carter leaned back in his seat, closing his eyes and shoving his hands behind his head. His eyes opened. \u201cYeah. Although now that I know you\u2019re going to be there, I\u2019m liable to change my mind...or yours. In fact, why don\u2019t you come back here for dessert?\u201d</p><p>She gripped the doorknob harder. All thoughts of what he really meant by dessert make her knees go weak. \u201cI could do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you half an hour to eat, then get your sweet ass out of there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019ll take longer than that to help clear the dishes and wash them,\u201d she protested. She always helped, it was practically second nature.</p><p>\u201cNot my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to say: \u2018Excuse me, I need to go have sex with your son?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not the wisest thing to admit.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>A trickle of doubt seeped into her. He could have told her to tell his family that they were dating or something like that, but maybe after being engaged for so long he didn\u2019t want a real relationship. Maybe he wanted something more casual. \u201cSo I guess our relationship is a secret.\u201d Tell me I\u2019m wrong, she silently pleaded.</p><p>Something hard glinted in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSeeing how I work for you and all. Plus people would talk and you know how people like to see things that aren\u2019t really there,\u201d she added in a rush.</p><p>He grunted, whether to agree with her or not, she wouldn\u2019t know, because his phone rang. \u201cSee you later. We\u2019ll talk more about this secret relationship,\u201d he said, then answered his cell. \u201cJake, you son of a bitch. How\u2019s she running?\u201d</p><p>Shoulders drooping, she opened the door.</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute. Melanie?\u201d</p><p>Joy rushed through her and she turned to face him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to drop off those two packages at the post office for me. I left them by the front door.\u201d He directed his attention back to the phone. \u201cHave you checked the rear axel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d she mumbled, feeling like the biggest fool on the planet. She snagged the packages and took a deep breath as the sharp January air hit her.</p><p>After unlocking her car and placing the packages in the back seat, she got inside and started up the engine. She gripped the steering wheel and let her head fall against it. Reconciling herself with this new-to-her side of Carter wouldn\u2019t be easy. There would be no turning back from it either. Things would never be the same between them.</p><p>Oh God, she was being way too dramatic. Just because she\u2019d never had had a friends-with-benefits type of relationship didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t do that with Carter.</p><p>Plenty of her other girlfriends did it. Heck, even uptight Kelsey Griggs had her booty call on speed dial. Still.</p><p>Lifting her head, she eased her death grip on the steering wheel and put the car in drive. In no time at all she\u2019d dropped off the packages, arrived at the Ambroses\u2019 house and now sat at their huge dinner table.</p><p>As usual Leah had cooked a Sunday after church meal and it was only Wednesday evening. Something that Melanie would never complain about. Ever. Unlike on Sunday afternoons when the entire family ate together, only Carter\u2019s parents sat at the formal dining room table, along with Zoe and\u2014Melanie inwardly made a face\u2014April. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Zoe whispered. \u201cI thought she\u2019d be gone by now.\u201d</p><p>Melanie glanced April\u2019s way and smiled. Well, bared her teeth at the woman. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s waiting on a summons from the governor.\u201d</p><p>Zoe and Melanie broke out in giggles. Leah frowned at them, then cast a sympathetic glance April\u2019s way. \u201cI know you\u2019re used to better company, sugar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no, ma\u2019am. I think it keeps me grounded to know what those less fortunate than us have to go through. Like eating at a family friend\u2019s house, so she doesn\u2019t go hungry,\u201d April said, returning Melanie\u2019s smile with a smirk. \u201cIt\u2019s why I support my father\u2019s initiative\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that kind of talk at the table,\u201d Lawton Ambrose said. \u201cI have enough trouble digesting as it is.\u201d</p><p>Leah shook her head at her husband and tapped him on the arm. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him, April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you headed home, April?\u201d Zoe asked and Melanie could\u2019ve kissed her best friend. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have a lot to do, with your dad in campaign mode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe Martha, where are your manners?\u201d Leah scolded. \u201cApril is welcome to stay here as long as she likes.\u201d</p> <p>April looked down at her plate, the perfect picture of demure southern belle. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Carter would like that.\u201d</p><p>Leah reached across the table, patting the younger woman\u2019s hand in reassurance. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mind one bit. I spoke to him today about it and he\u2019s so very sorry that he couldn\u2019t come tonight. But you know how he likes to tinker on car engines.\u201d</p><p>April shook her head, caramel color hair sliding forward. \u201cThat\u2019s nice of you to say, but I think he has other things on his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give him time to get whatever has gotten into him out of his system. Let him hit rock bottom with the trash so he can realize what a treasure he has in you,\u201d Leah said as she reached for her glass of water and took a sip.</p><p>Melanie\u2019s mouth fell open, then she snapped it shut.</p><p>\u201cMomma,\u201d Zoe gasped. \u201cThat was an ugly thing to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you know present company is excluded,\u201d Leah said, then smiled. As if sugar wouldn\u2019t melt in her mouth.</p><p>Biting the inside of her cheek, Melanie struggled to stay quiet. She stabbed at the green bean casserole on her plate a few times, before spearing piece of chicken.</p><p>\u201cCarter did mention something about one of the local girls. That she was head over heels for him, but he made it clear that he wasn\u2019t interested in a long term thing.\u201d April raised her head and shrugged. \u201cMaybe she gave him something I didn\u2019t, seeing as how I\u2019m saving myself for marriage.\u201d</p><p>Melanie choked, earning a swift pounding on the back from Zoe and a would-you-mind look from Leah. \u201cWrong pipe,\u201d she rasped before taking a drink of sweet tea.</p><p>\u201cToo bad Evangeline had cheerleading practice tonight,\u201d her best friend whispered. \u201cI can only imagine what she would have to say.\u201d</p><p>Clearing his throat, Lawton rose to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m taking my supper in the living room.\u201d</p><p>Just as Lawton left, the phone rang and Leah excused herself from the table.</p><p>The dining room was silent but for the scrape of utensils. Not that Melanie expected April to talk to her, but she did expect April to at least make small talk with Zoe.</p> <p>\u201cHave you been working out, Zoe? I swear you look sooo much skinnier than the last time I saw you,\u201d April said and Melanie fought the urge to smack the woman. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy to carry all that extra weight, with your face and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that you\u2019re not pretty in your own way,\u201d April added.</p><p>Stunned, Melanie could only gape at April.</p><p>\u201cI weigh exactly the same as I did eight months ago,\u201d Zoe said, her nose lifting in the air. \u201cAnd there\u2019s not a dang thing wrong with my face.\u201d</p><p>Melanie reached for Zoe\u2019s hand, squeezing it tight. \u201cI think you\u2019re gorgeous, doll. And so does Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you doing, I mean dating, Melissa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Melanie said through clenched teeth. \u201cThanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>April leaned forward in her chair. \u201cAlready went through all the boys around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then some,\u201d Melanie shot back, crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cNow I\u2019m making my way through all the men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanie Ann Smith,\u201d Leah gasped, her hand on her heart. \u201cYou will not talk like that in front of Zoe. She\u2019s a good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d Zoe snapped. \u201cThere are lots of things I\u2019ve done that you know nothing about.\u201d She grabbed her plate, stood up and left the room, calling over her shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m going over to Gabriel\u2019s. Who knows what sorts of things we\u2019ll be doing.\u201d</p><p>Melanie almost gave her best friend a standing ovation. Instead she smiled and made a mental note to text Zoe later.</p><p>\u201cSee what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Leah said, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve done?\u201d Melanie said, her nose scrunching on one side. \u201cIt\u2019s that thing you\u2019ve invited into your home that started all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not insult\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, Ms. Ambrose. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d Fat tears rolled down April\u2019s face. \u201cI was only trying to help Zoe. She\u2019s like a little sister to me and I can\u2019t stand to see someone downplaying their looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a crock,\u201d Melanie muttered, yanking her napkin out of her lap. \u201cThank you for dinner, but I need to go, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to take some key lime pie with you, sugar,\u201d Leah said. \u201cI made it just for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will and thank you,\u201d Melanie said, feeling as if her head wanted to spin like a top. The woman had insulted her at Carter\u2019s garage and again at dinner, but had also taken the time to make (and remember) her favorite dessert?</p><p>\u201cSomething else the matter, Mrs. Ambrose?\u201d April asked as Melanie scraped her chair back and picked up her plate.</p><p>\u201cJust my brother, John. I know I shouldn\u2019t talk, but you\u2019re like a daughter to me and well, he and Raylene have been having problems,\u201d Leah said. \u201cHe wants to take her a special trip but she always has other plans.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. She did not need to hear this, because she had a sinking feeling that Raylene\u2019s plans were Melanie\u2019s dad.</p><p>Melanie practically ran out of the room and lobbed her plate on the kitchen counter. Opening a cabinet near the sink, she found some Tupperware and threw in a big slice of pie, then headed out the back door.</p><p>Melanie had never left the Ambrose house so quickly in her life, or ever been so happy to do so. Jumping in her car, she started it up and headed home. She had no desire to have dessert with Carter or anyone else for that matter. All she wanted was a bubble bath and a romance novel. Those two things never failed to put her in a better mood.</p><p>One bubble bath and half a romance novel later, Melanie was still in a foul mood. She tossed the book on the floor and grabbed the towel off the hook, wrapping it around her shivering body. Maybe it was time for some pie.</p><p>After drying off and putting on her robe, she walked to the kitchen and rummaged through the silverware drawer for a fork. She took the fat slice of pie out of the fridge and the plastic container, placing it on a paper plate, because there was no darn way she felt like doing dishes. A house without a dishwasher meant that everything had to be done by hand.</p><p>One slice of heaven later, she licked the fork clean and chunked it the sink. That she could get tomorrow when she cleaned up her mess from breakfast. As she headed to her bedroom, her phone buzzed and she scooped it up. \u201cCarter,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Where are you? I\u2019m getting worried.</p><p>Yeah, she bet he was. He was worried he wouldn\u2019t be getting any tonight, and he was right.</p><p>I\u2019m fine.</p><p>And?</p><p>Oh she knew what that meant. He wanted to know when she\u2019d be coming over there, like some kind of desperate woman. Well here you go, she thought as she sent another text.</p><p>Thank you for asking.</p><p>This time, her phone rang. Sighing, she flopped down her bed and answered it. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Thank you for asking?\u2019\u201d Carter all but growled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cOh, did I need to send you a note instead of a text?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get over here.\u201d</p><p>Staring at the ceiling, she counted the glow-in-the-dark stars that had never fallen off. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d God, she so wish she could see his face right now, because he sounded shocked as hell. A thick sigh later, he said, \u201cTell me what to do to fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about what not to do?\u201d she asked slowly, then braced for his comeback. He had to have one. Although a very large part of her would die if he did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Melanie blinked, then glanced at her phone. That wasn\u2019t the comeback she expected. Her shoulders tensed as she thought about exactly what should be on her list of don\u2019ts. \u201cDon\u2019t order me to come to your place just for sex. Don\u2019t ignore me at work...and don\u2019t treat me like a...a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiece of ass,\u201d he supplied.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Tension left her shoulders. It couldn\u2019t be that easy. A woman couldn\u2019t have that kind of conversation with a man and him say \u2018No problem\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m still not coming over tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t figure you were.\u201d</p><p>Now she wanted to come over to his place. Stay strong, Melanie. \u201cSee you tomorrow at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Oh, and Melanie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo things. First, don\u2019t give my sister back the outfit you borrowed. I don\u2019t think I could take seeing Zoe wear it after today.\u201d Melanie struggled not to laugh at the seriousness in his voice. \u201cSecond, how about wearing something more you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes to the first, and maybe to the second.\u201d She rolled to her side and traced a figure eight on the covers. \u201cI tend to go a little overboard with my themes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your themes are perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t go changing on my account.\u201d</p><p>She melted inside, got all nice and gooey at the center. This was the Carter of her dreams. \u201cMaybe a little theme then.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, then the line went silent. \u201cDid you want to keep talking or say good night?\u201d</p><p>She froze, her finger stuck at the upper curve of the eight. \u201cUm...keeping talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember that time you went to John Hampton\u2019s place and blew up his barn?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped and she sat up. \u201cI did not blow up his barn! It just caught on fire a little bit after the propane tank quit doing its job of holding everything inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little bit.\u201d Carter snorted. \u201cIt took the fire department all day to put it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried I\u2019m going to do that to your garage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She could hear the smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cCarter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I can\u2019t help what I know about my employee\u2019s past misdeeds.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she brought her knees up and wrapped one arm around them. \u201cYou know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis, what we\u2019re doing right now, is on my Do List.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, right before his voice dropped lower and made her heart speed up. \u201cWant to know what\u2019s on my Do List when it comes to you?\u201d</p><p>She shivered in excitement. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Low laughter came over the line. \u201cWhat are you wearing right now, Melanie?\u201d</p><p>Unwrapping her arm from around her knees, she settled against her pillows and smiled. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d ask me that.\u201d It was going to be a very long and naughty phone conversation with him\u2014she hoped.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Melanie had tried. She really had, but there wasn\u2019t enough will-power in her for her stop.</p><p>She glanced down at her outfit and grinned. Today she wore a bright red t-shirt with Carter\u2019s racing number on it, black and white checkered shorts, and since it was the middle of January, black leggings tucked into knee high black boots.</p><p>Every time she caught Carter staring, she over-exaggerated her movements. Bent over just a little bit more, throw her shoulder back a little bit further, put a little more hip action in her walk. But true to Carter\u2019s word and her Don\u2019t List, he treated her like an employee during work hours. He talked to her, ate lunch with her in the office and even asked her opinion on things she didn\u2019t have a clue about. Like website colors.</p><p>Sure she knew what colors she liked, but what made a user come back again and again\u2014not so much.</p><p>But after hours...Oh God.</p><p>He\u2019d call and talk so dirty to her that she was surprised her sheets hadn\u2019t caught on fire. Just last night he asked her to touch herself. Well, make that, he ordered her to touch herself. To make herself come while he told her in explicit detail all things he wanted to do with and to her. So she had, and today...somehow she\u2019d managed to not turn eighty-five shades of red when he\u2019d said good morning to her.</p><p>The garage door opened and Carter drove in a cherry red classic Mustang convertible, parking it beside a green Jeep Cherokee. She smiled and started to walk in his direction when a slender dark-haired girl appeared out of nowhere. Rose Holland. She wore a long skirt, a faded purple and a cream colored sweater that was thin at the elbows.</p><p>Their eyes met, the girl\u2019s a startling shade of blue and so weary that Melanie wanted to hug her. Automatically Melanie waved. Rose nodded, hand clenched tight by her side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carter jumped out the Mustang and walked over to Rose, his gait slow. Almost careful, like he didn\u2019t want to spook her. He smiled at Rose, friendly and open. A smile that Melanie knew she wouldn\u2019t have been able to resist, especially at seventeen. Forget seventeen, she couldn\u2019t resist Carter at twenty-four.</p><p>However, Rose didn\u2019t smile back. She held out her hand. \u201cThree hundred for the Jeep, like we agreed on.\u201d Then she swung a basket up. \u201cI brought some eggs and strawberry jelly, too.\u201d</p><p>Melanie blinked. Three hundred dollars for a Jeep?</p> <p>Carter took both. \u201cYou drive a hard bargain, Rose. I can\u2019t wait to get this jelly on some of my momma\u2019s biscuits.\u201d</p><p>A small smile graced the girl\u2019s lips, then she listened as Carter went over the details of the Jeep. He showed Rose everything, treating her like a new car owner. Treating her like an equal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tempting to really let her go on the straight-away near your house, but unless you like getting pulled over by Sheriff Nelson, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSheriff Nelson\u2019s wife is going to go into labor tonight and he\u2019ll spend all day at the hospital tomorrow. They\u2019re having a girl,\u201d Rose said and this time Melanie looked at her in amazement. No one knew what the Sheriff and his wife was having, and Layla wasn\u2019t due for another three weeks. The hair on Melanie\u2019s arm stood up.</p><p>Carter sliced his gaze to Melanie, his green eyes full of the amazement she felt. He cleared his throat and re-focused on Rose, handing her a set of keys. \u201cReally could have used you on the racetrack with all that foresight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Carter.\u201d Rose got into the Jeep, leaving as quickly as she came.</p><p>When Melanie could find her voice again, she asked, \u201cThree hundred for the Jeep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, couldn\u2019t talk her into giving me less,\u201d he said, a guilty tone to his voice. But for what? That Jeep had to have cost at least a couple grand. Her heart tumbled from her chest to her toes. Her knees went all shaky and she sighed.</p><p>No one else in the world was like Carter.</p> <p>She glanced at the clock, then ran across the garage. Carter\u2019s newest employee, Beau Montgomery, wasn\u2019t due until three-thirty. Yet another positive sign that the man of her dreams was leaning toward staying in Holland Springs. Why go to all that trouble?</p><p>Stopping in front of Carter, she let her gaze travel up his body. His heart was good, sweet and kind, and when combined with the total package\u2014heart-stopping. Or heart-stomping, if she wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>\u201cHelp you with something?\u201d</p><p>Rising up on her toes, she let her lips brush against the lobe of his ear. \u201cInstead of calling me to talk dirty, why don\u2019t you come to my place and be dirty with me instead?\u201d Then she whirled around and sashayed to the office, leaving him standing there.</p><p>Carter rarely regretted any decision he made, but as his newest employee walked in, giving Melanie a longer than was necessary once over, he was ready to throw the kid out on his ass.</p><p>Melanie wasn\u2019t helping things, fussing over Beau like he was some sort of long-lost puppy. \u201cCan I get you a snack, honey?\u201d Carter heard her ask Beau. He rolled his eyes and shoved a box of rags into Honey\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cFollow me. You need to know what I need from you in order to get a paycheck,\u201d Carter said. \u201cUnless you\u2019d rather have a nap after your snack.\u201d</p><p>Beau glanced from Carter to Melanie. \u201cThank you for the offer, Miss Melanie, but I need to get to work.\u201d</p> <p>Her brown eyes got all soft, like melted chocolate. \u201cPoor thing, working so hard after school. Did you know he\u2019s helping his Uncle and Aunt out at home, too? All those cousins need looking after. You are such a sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Beau nodded. \u201cIt can be hard at times.\u201d</p><p>Oh come on. The kid was so full of it. Carter crossed his arms and waited. \u201cIf you\u2019re through blessing his heart, I\u2019d really like to get to work on the Mustang.\u201d</p><p>Now that got Beau\u2019s attention. \u201cI get to touch that on the first day?\u201d He shifted the box in his arms, pushing his lip ring out with his tongue. \u201cHell, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll be sorting through nuts and bolts. You learned that skill today in Kindergarten class, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Beau mumbled something under his breath, but the kid didn\u2019t complain. Thirty minutes later, Carter checked on him. Satisfied with the work Beau had done so far, Carter ambled to his office. He found Melanie sitting at the desk he\u2019d bought and had delivered last week, a frown on her face as she looked at the computer screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouis came home this morning right before I left for Mr. Henry\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>The frown grew deeper. \u201cHe said he got a job down in Baxterville, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat state?\u201d He knew she was looking for casinos.</p><p>\u201cAlabama.\u201d</p><p>He moved to stand beside her, looking over her head to count all the casinos in a twenty-five mile radius of Baxterville. There were dozens of them. Heart aching for her, he settled his hands on top of her shoulders. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll stay away this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of staying away.\u201d She placed a hand over his and squeezed. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of how much he\u2019ll lose or win.\u201d</p><p>Reminding Melanie of what an ass her dad was would only serve to make him feel better. Actually, finding a way to put Louis under house arrest would make him supremely happy. However, this wasn\u2019t about Carter. This was about Melanie.</p><p>\u201cLet me know what I can do to help,\u201d he said. He meant it. Potential lover or not, he would always be there for Melanie. Whenever she needed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He spun the chair around, bending at the knees to get level with her face. There was so much worry in her brown eyes, and all he wanted to do was make it go away. Permanently. \u201cHey. I mean it. Whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip trembled before a smile formed on her mouth. \u201cI know you do, but sometimes, a girl can\u2019t be saved. Sometimes, a girl has to save herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy moving out.\u201d She nodded and he leaned forward. \u201cI know we\u2019re on the clock right now, but I really need to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t taken my afternoon break,\u201d she said, inching closer.</p><p>\u201cOff the clock,\u201d he murmured right before he kissed her. Soft lips to his, tasting like sweet tea and the key lime pie he\u2019d brought back from town just for her.</p><p>She sighed, her hands coming to rest on his shoulders, and he cupped her face, keeping his touch as light as his kisses. This wasn\u2019t about lust, wasn\u2019t about teasing her. This was about wanting to give without expecting anything in return. She wouldn\u2019t take his money, she wouldn\u2019t take his help, but his kisses...Yeah, he knew she\u2019d take those. Because he would do the same.</p><p>Breaking their kiss, he caressed the side of her face and smiled. \u201cFeeling a little better now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Returning his smile, she glanced up and then back at him. \u201cJust a little,\u201d she said with a wink.</p><p>\u201cAbout tonight?\u201d He traced the outline of his racing number on her sleeve. \u201cI\u2019m thinking along with the dirty, we should do something not-so-dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGolden Girls marathon?\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he rose to his feet. She knew him so well. \u201cFollowed by Glee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetty White and spontaneous singing all on the same night?\u201d She placed a hand over her heart. \u201cA man after my own heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all I\u2019m after.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she said, \u201cMen. You can\u2019t just stop at the heart-melting stuff.\u201d</p><p>Tires crunching over gravel had him checking the window of his office. A silver BMW slid in beside Melanie\u2019s Honda.</p><p>What the hell was April doing here? The driver and passenger doors opened; April and mother getting out simultaneously. He clenched his jaw. Now that was his mother\u2019s doing, not his ex.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe nice,\u201d Melanie called after him.</p><p>He met the two women in the middle of the garage, right beside Chase Montgomery\u2019s Mustang. April leaned against it, the heavy chains on her purse dragging against it.</p><p>\u201cOff the car, April,\u201d he said and she slowly moved away, her nose in the air. He inspected the paint, relived to find it scratch free.</p><p>Leah\u2019s eyes rounded. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you greet visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one of you are visitors,\u201d he pointed out, then crossed his arms. \u201cWhat can I help you with? Oil change, tire rotation.\u201d</p><p>Beau eyed them, his gaze returning to April again and again. Carter shook his head at the kid and motioned to the four foot tall shelf of endless drawers filled with nuts and bolts that Beau hadn\u2019t finished sorting. With a roll of his eyes, he shoved a hand through messy bright green hair and returned to his work.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2014tonight, since you haven\u2019t bothered showing up for dinner in forever,\u201d his mother said. \u201c\u2018No\u2019 is not an option.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Melanie come to the door. His number across her chest, hot as hell shorts and boots that made him want to do very good bad things to her.</p><p>April cleared her throat. She shook her plastic cup of iced coffee. \u201cI need a refill.\u201d She stalked to his office, brushing past Melanie. Melanie stumbled back, catching herself on the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be expecting you at six, Carter.\u201d Leah hoisted her purse higher on her shoulder. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll expect you to be civil to April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust civil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019d like for the two of you to work things out.\u201d Glancing around the garage, she lowered her voice. \u201cI\u2019m not getting any younger, and I would like to enjoy some grandchildren before y\u2019all ship me off to the nursing home.\u201d</p><p>He loved his mother. He really did, but this interference, this maneuver and attempt at manipulation? It didn\u2019t sit well with him, and he knew he wasn\u2019t the only one Leah did this to. Every one of the Ambrose siblings had to deal with her wants and wishes.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s shipping you off to the nursing home, Momma.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, one full of win. \u201cSuch a sweet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take you out back and put you out of your misery first,\u201d he teased.</p><p>Stunned, Leah\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cCarter Mason Ambrose! I\u2014\u201d</p><p>A woman\u2019s squeal of surprise caught their attention, and they turned in time to find Melanie\u2019s outfit covered in iced coffee. April stood beside her, a fake horrified look on her face.</p><p>Beau raced to Melanie with a clean towel in his hand. She flashed him a smile and began to wipe at the ever-spreading wet spot.</p><p>\u201cI am soo sorry, Myrtle.\u201d April threw her cup into the trash. \u201cI\u2019m sure Carter can buy you another shirt and maybe Goodwill has another pair of those unfortunate shorts.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s face turned bright red. He knew for a fact that she shopped at Goodwill. Hell, he still remembered all the times she would come over to his house to share her finds with his sister, making a big deal over second hand clothes, because she couldn\u2019t afford Wal-Mart.</p><p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d Melanie muttered, eyes downcast.</p><p>Carter stood there, not sure exactly what to say or do. He couldn\u2019t yell at April, because he wasn\u2019t sure if it was an accident, and Beau had beaten him to the punch with the towel.</p><p>Finally his mother spoke. \u201cMelanie, you bring those to my house and I\u2019ll get the stains out for you. No sense in throwing out good clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m sure April will be happy to replace them,\u201d Carter said, with a pointed look at his ex. He walked to Melanie, not giving a shit what his April or his mother thought. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Eyes glistening, she dried off her hands and threw the towel on a nearby counter. \u201cI\u2019m fine. The coffee wasn\u2019t hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, but those hips of yours, Marsha...\u201dApril tsked and flipped her hair over her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard to find that size where I shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I want to punch her,\u201d Melanie muttered, which only made Carter feel worse.</p><p>He raised his brows at his ex and pointed at the door. \u201cOut. Don\u2019t come back either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, April,\u201d Leah said, her dark blue eyes narrowing. \u201cI have errands to run.\u201d</p><p>Stopping his mother as she turned, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not coming to dinner, not while she\u2019s there. Understand me?\u201d God he hated taking such a sharp tone with his mother, but this\u2014this was unacceptable.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d With that, Leah marched out of his garage, April on her heels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d Melanie disappeared into his office, reappearing two seconds later with her purse and keys.</p><p>He strode to her, blocking her path. \u201cAre we still on for tonight?\u201d His eyes dropped to her breasts, her nipples were hard against the wet material. \u201cLooks like you got the dirty part all covered.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a look of disbelief. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>Letting his head fall back, he counted to ten. \u201cI was teasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor anything,\u201d she added as she skirted around him.</p><p>Nothing like coming home to a cold, empty house. Louis must have forgotten to pay the propane bill. Again.</p><p>Sighing, Melanie pulled on her robe and headed to the kitchen in search of chocolate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her phone rang and she answered it. There was lots of yelling in the background and the sound of slot machines being played.</p><p>\u201cMelanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Daddy. Did you forget to pay\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur luck has change, sugar. I won big tonight!\u201d A woman laughed, low and husky over the phone. \u201cMust be the good luck charm that came with me.\u201d</p><p>She froze, standing in the middle of the living room. \u201cIs Raylene with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t get all preachy on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>Louis paused. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>Why couldn\u2019t she catch a break? Of all the women in Holland Springs, he had to pick the one married to Carter\u2019s uncle. It was like God had it out for her.</p><p>\u201cBut the real question you should be asking is how much.\u201d</p><p>Again, Louis put her between a rock and a hard place. Pretty soon, she wouldn\u2019t have any breathing room. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve grand. I\u2019m on a roll!\u201d Another whoop in the background.</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re not going to cash out and come home, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can double this, sugar. Pay you back and help get you out of that trailer faster. Do right by your momma. I can feel it.\u201d</p> <p>Tears pricked at her eyes. She bit her lip, then forced a smile. Why? She had no idea, because it wasn\u2019t like Louis could see her tears or her smile. \u201cThat\u2019s good, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish me luck, before I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBe back on Monday.\u201d</p><p>She ended their call, made her legs work again and tossed her phone on the counter. It landed with a thud. She needed more than chocolate; she needed a drink.</p><p>Someone pounded on the door just as she opened the freezer. \u201cBe right there!\u201d Ms. White had mentioned bringing back Louis\u2019 shears once she got off of work.</p><p>Before she could do an about face, the knock turned into a consistent pounding. \u201cHold your horses. I\u2019m coming.\u201d The pounding grew louder. That couldn\u2019t be Ms. White. Stopping by the only window in the living room, she peeked out and saw Carter standing at her door.</p><p>Her heart bungeed-jumped into her throat.</p> <p>For a moment she considered letting him stay out in the cold, but the pounding started up again and she had no desire to listen to Mrs. Gregory lecture her about being a loose woman.</p><p>Never mind that Mrs. Gregory entertained three different men during the week. And by entertain, she meant sex. That little trailer, a camper really, would rock so hard that Melanie was sure it would fall on its side.</p><p>Unlocking the door, she shoved it open, almost smacking Carter in the face. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, woman. You could\u2019ve reminded me that your door didn\u2019t open like normal.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and glared at him. \u201cSorry, our doors don\u2019t open the way people with real houses\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet.\u201d Carter pushed past her, practically barreling his way into her house and shut the door behind him. \u201cLouis home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you wanted me to be quiet?\u201d</p><p>He raked a hand through his dark hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you came here to get your rocks off,\u201d she said turning to face him. \u201cAnd I remember telling you that I wasn\u2019t in the mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlanned on getting you in the mood.\u201d He leaned into her, his dark green eyes smoldering. \u201cPlanned to do something with your rocks, too.\u201d</p><p>A cross between a laugh and a snort left her. \u201cOh you sweet talker, you. Now I know why April still wants to be with you.\u201d</p><p>The smirk that kicked up the corners up his sexy lips made her stomach drop to her toes. \u201cYou sure are cute when you\u2019re jealous, Miss Smith.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw worked. \u201cGo home, Carter. I\u2019m sure April\u2019s waiting for you, wedding dress at the ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want April.\u201d Tugging on the sash of her robe, he crooked a finger at her. \u201cCome here and let me apologize for being an insensitive man.\u201d</p><p>Telling herself that she was only walking closer to him so that her sash wouldn\u2019t give way and flash him, she found herself practically pressed against him. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>He dipped his head, minty breathy invading her space. \u201cI\u2019m a sure thing, baby. And I\u2019m sorry for not doing whatever you need me to. Maybe I need some lessons. I\u2019m a fast learner.\u201d The sash to her robe gave and the material parted, the throbbing, heated part of her making itself known. A cold hand slipped inside, cupping her breast and making her gasp. Her nipple beaded against his palm. \u201cDamn, but your skin is nice and hot, better than any pair of gloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you put another cold hand on me, Carter Mason Ambrose, I\u2019ll knee you in the balls,\u201d she all but growled at him.</p><p>But that sexy jerk did nothing but laugh and wiggle his fingers at her. Just as he attempted to slide his other hand inside, her knee came up. He stopped her with a twist of his hips. \u201cWhat if I warm it up first, then I can touch you?\u201d The hand cupping her breast moved lower, allowing his thumb to brush her nipple. Desire sparked, flaming higher and hotter with each lazy pass. \u201cThing is, sweetheart, you\u2019re so damn hot that there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever be warm enough to touch you.\u201d</p><p>She felt herself softening, giving into him. Into his legendary charm that she\u2019d never been the recipient of until now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it a try anyway.\u201d He vigorously rubbed his hand up and down the outside of his thigh. \u201cLet\u2019s see if I got it right.\u201d</p><p>Breathing became hard to do as his hand hovered in the air. Her lashes fluttered as he gently touched her neck, his warm palm making her head fall back. She felt the tip of his tongue trace the base of her throat. His soft hair brushed the side of her face.</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m still upset with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid all the coffee come out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that doesn\u2019t get you out of the hot seat.\u201d</p><p>His tongue touched the lobe of her ear, then his teeth nibbled on the flesh.\u201cNo place I\u2019d rather be than in your hot seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>A low chuckle emanated from him, dark and full of so much promise that her knees went weak. Reflexes fast as his race car on the final turn at Daytona caught her around the waist before she fell. \u201cWhere\u2019s your room?\u201dhe asked, kissing his way to her mouth. His tongue slid in just as her lips parted to answer, tangling with hers.</p><p>Tearing her mouth away for even a second was almost impossible to do, but she managed to gasp, \u201cBehind me, door at the end of the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your dad coming home anytime soon?\u201d Carter swept her off her feet and headed down the short hallway. \u201cI\u2019d hate to let him beat the shit out of me for catching me satisfying the hell out of his daughter.\u201d</p><p>Dread reared its ugly head, breaking through a haze of lust and longing. If she told him where and who Louis was with, no telling what would happen. And she couldn\u2019t have Carter thinking of her like that. Like she was the daughter of trailer trash, of a man who slept with other men\u2019s wives and discarded them as soon as the next helpless, ignored housewife came along.</p><p>Not now, not when it seemed she\u2019d finally gotten him to think of her as not just his kid sister\u2019s best friend. \u201cHe won\u2019t be back for a while.\u201d</p><p>Carter nudged the door open with his hip. \u201cA while means many things, baby. Humor me and clarify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a couple of days.\u201d Usually that was how long he stayed away, when he and his new woman decided to go away together. She prayed Carter wouldn\u2019t ask her to elaborate any further.</p><p>He set her down on her feet, and she felt every hard inch of him on the way down. \u201cThen tonight we\u2019ll stay here, but tomorrow you\u2019re coming home with me. In fact I\u2019m thinking that tomorrow is a holiday and there\u2019s no need for us to go into work.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as he helped her out of her robe.</p><p>Muttering a curse, he said, \u201cOr the next day either.\u201d He stepped away, his hands caressing as they followed the curves of her body. \u201cWhen the hell did you get a tattoo on your ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteenth birthday.\u201d She shook her head. The tattoo was low on her back, over to the side so it couldn\u2019t be classified as a tramp stamp. \u201cTried to talk your sister into getting one, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ, Melanie. Don\u2019t bring my sister into the conversation.\u201d</p><p>Biting back a laugh, her eyes popped open to reveal their reflection in her mirror. She was naked as the day she was born while he was fully clothed. And he was watching her watching him as his hands explored her body.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d she asked. Of course this meant something to her. She\u2019d been in love with him for years.</p><p>\u201cYour tattoo is about me and you?\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. Face turning fiery red, she looked away from the mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s a hummingbird. My momma used to call me that.\u201d Bittersweet memories enveloped her as did his arms. \u201cShe said I like to flit from here to there, always moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m the mood-killer now, huh.\u201d He kissed the top of her head, a gesture so sweet and telling that she wanted to weep. \u201cSorry, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t just saying sorry for killing the mood. He meant her mom, too. Carter was just that kind of guy. No, not that kind of guy. He was a man, protective and sexy as hell.</p><p>Whirling in his arms, she crept her hands up his wool sweater. \u201cIt happened a long time ago, when I was a little girl. Before I knew you. And I\u2019m grown now.\u201d She gave him her best-come-and-get-me-boy smile, cupping her breasts and pressing them together. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to be dead to not notice.\u201d Admiration gleamed in his sexy green eyes. \u201cBut thank you for reminding me...ma\u2019am,\u201d he said in that deep drawl she loved.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you warm up your hands again.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a suggestion.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I warm you up instead.\u201d His mouth came down on hers, his tongue breaking the seam of her lips as she stood on tiptoe. Rubbing against him, she whimpered in the back of her throat. His hands explored every sensitive part of her that he could reach. Cupping her butt, he lifted her to him and started in the direction of the bed.</p><p>She helped him out of his shirt along the way, throwing it in the middle of the room. Even as her back hit the comforter, she was tugging at his belt, ripping it off and unbuttoning his fly as his mouth found her nipple and sucked.</p><p>Her head fell back against a pillow, her fingers digging in his back. She found her way to his jeans, pushing them down so she could cup his muscular butt. The very hard length of him rubbed against her thighs, and then hit her stomach as he worked his way back up to her mouth. He bit her bottom lip and tugged, worrying it between his teeth and then soothing the sting with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the poutiest fucking mouth and one day real soon, I\u2019m going to have it around my dick.\u201d He sealed his lips over hers, taking her breath away and replacing it with his. She couldn\u2019t get enough of him. He rolled onto his back, taking her with him.</p><p>Sitting up, she grinded against his erection and raked her nails across his chest. A chest made of muscular pecs and a washboard stomach. Dear God, she should pin a picture of it on her Pinterest page, under ManCandy. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll return the favor and put your mouth on me again. Maybe we can do it at the same time.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cCan\u2019t take much more.\u201d In one swift move, he had her pinned under him and entered her with one long finger. \u201cFuck. You\u2019re so damn wet. Reach into my pocket and get a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d she asked, desperate for him to be inside of her, and not just his finger.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter; they\u2019ve all got one.\u201d</p><p>He eased a second finger inside of her and pressed up. An involuntary shriek left her. \u201cOh God.\u201d She grabbed the first foil packet with the tips of her fingers and lifted it to her mouth, tearing it and throwing the packet to the side.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you so bad...but I can\u2019t wait.\u201d He snagged the condom from her and rolled it on, then the blunt head of his erection replaced his fingers and he pushed inside.</p><p>His head fell to her shoulder, fingers threading in her damp hair, and flexed his hips. She whimpered at his invasion. As he stretched and filled her. Even if she hadn\u2019t had sex in almost two years, he was still hung like a porn star.</p><p>And they were moving like two odd puzzle pieces being shoved together. It was awkward and hurt like hell. This wasn\u2019t what she dreamed about. This was...They needed to slow down.</p><p>\u201cCarter...not so fast,\u201d she gasped, hips pressing into the mattress. \u201cI haven\u2019t had...ung...sex...\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cYou\u2019re not virgin, are you? Because if you are I\u2019m going about this all wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014virgins deserve more than hussies like me?\u201d she asked, tears stinging her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Melanie.\u201d His head snapped up, eyes dark and jaw clenched. \u201cWhy do you assume the worst about me? More importantly, why do you assume the worst about yourself?\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d been reminded her whole life that she was from the wrong side of town, the wrong side of the tracks and was nothing but trash. Turning away from him, she stared at the wall. Posters still hung on her wall. Teen heartthrobs and favorite bands smiled back at her.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, because if she did, she might cry. And God knew there was no crying in the middle of sex. Not unless it was the good kind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to take it easy on you, because I don\u2019t want to hurt you and I have no fucking clue as to what you have and haven\u2019t done. What you\u2019re used to and what you like.\u201d Now she did turn to face him, finding his emerald green eyes fixed on her. \u201cI\u2019m going on instinct, on those sexy little moans and whimpers that I love hearing you make. Then you scare the shit out of me\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201c\u2014Christ. I\u2019m inside of you\u2014you\u2019re tight as hell...wet as hell\u2014and we\u2019re having a fucking conversation, instead of ...fucking. Help me out here.\u201d</p><p>She moved her hips and he slid in deeper, a low rumble coming from his throat. Gazing into his eyes, she managed a smile. \u201cI wanted you to slow down, because I haven\u2019t had sex since Trent and I broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell.\u201d He moved his hand to her face, running his knuckles over her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time.\u201d</p> <p>His touch made her feel all vulnerable. When he kissed the tip of her nose, she felt positively special, which was flat out stupid and dangerous to her well-being. \u201cDon\u2019t feel too bad for me. I do have B.O.B.\u201d</p><p>A crooked grin replaced his look of tenderness. \u201cThink I can give ole\u2019 B.O.B. a run for his money?\u201d He began to move his hips and dipped his head, brushing her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t require replacement batteries.\u201d</p><p>Giggles escaped her mouth before she could help it, then full blown laughter. That is, until he tugged her nipple into his mouth and sucked. His large, callused hand on her hip held her in place while he worked his way inside of her. Letting her thighs fall open, she jolted when he went deeper.</p><p>\u201cThere you go. Fuck me back,\u201d he growled, slipping his hand under her. His fingers dipped between her cheeks, teasing that very private area that she\u2019d allowed no man to ever explore. \u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said in a breathless rush. The tip slid inside and her eyes widened, little sparks of pleasure and pain radiating from that very spot. \u201cOh!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he said, his voice low and dark.</p><p>Trust him? Of course she trusted him. She loved Carter. Her heart beat out the syllables of his name. And now that he was inside of her, making her body crave him more than ever, she was going to be a mess when things between them ended. Things would end.</p><p>She wrapped her legs around his waist, crossing her feet at the ankles, and was rewarded with a hard thrust that she felt from head to toe. In fact, her toes curled so hard that they popped.</p><p>His thrusts became steady, his finger teasing her and going deeper until she didn\u2019t care where he put anything as long as he didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>He coaxed her lips open, mimicking what his cock was doing to her with his tongue. She curled her own around it, eliciting a growl from him. Tearing his mouth away, he removed his finger and planted an elbow on each side of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re squeezing my dick so tight,\u201d he said, his movements relentless and precise. Every forward roll of his hips, sent his groin in direct contact with her clit, until her entire being focus on that. \u201cNever felt anything so good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need\u2014\u201d Another roll of his hips and she let out a strangled cry. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what you need, Melanie.\u201d He bit down hard on her shoulder and ground against her.</p><p>Pleasure and pain crashed inside of her, blending until she didn\u2019t know where one stopped and the other began. She went over the edge, crying out Carter\u2019s name, God\u2019s and who knew what else.</p><p>Her eyes closed as he picked up the pace, prolonging her orgasm until he pushed himself deep inside of her. \u201cOh fuck,\u201d he growled as he came.</p><p>For long minutes, she held him in her arms, stroking his back and placing kisses on his neck. So overwhelmed by what had happened, she almost said \u2018I love you\u2019 right then and there. But something, mostly the almost absolute knowledge that Carter didn\u2019t feel that way about her, kept her lips sealed tight.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d he began and her heart, already beating at a frantic pace, took off. \u201cI see Trent, I\u2019m going to buy him a beer, then beat his ass for hurting you.\u201d</p><p>That crazy heart of hers did cartwheels. She was surprised the poor thing hadn\u2019t given out. \u201cTrent\u2019s in jail, so you\u2019ll have to get in line.\u201d</p><p>Carter blinked. In jail? Where did Melanie meet these guys? \u201cDo I need to pick your next boyfriend, because your taste in men sucks.\u201d He regretted the words as soon as the left his mouth.</p> <p>Her hands froze on his back. \u201cVery funny,\u201d she said on a laugh. Only that laugh of hers sounded fake as hell, and it was all his fault.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>He needed some time to think. He\u2019d just broken his own rule about getting involved with Melanie. Hell, he\u2019d done more than get involved...he\u2019d most likely just had the best sex of his life with her.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I was out of line.\u201d Sorry was quickly becoming his go-to word when it came to Melanie, which made him feel like a complete jackass.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d But he knew it wasn\u2019t, not by a country mile.</p><p>Refusing to look at her, because he didn\u2019t want to see the hurt in her eyes, he eased out of her tight heat. Rising to his feet, he left her room in search of the bathroom. After he disposed of the condom and washed his hands and face, he stared at his reflection in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cPansy-assed coward,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>He had no choice but to make things right between them. Whatever that entailed. Although she had said she wanted to keep things secret. Maybe even casual. For once the thought of being some woman\u2019s booty call didn\u2019t appeal to him. But he chalked that up to the whole Melanie dynamic.</p><p>Knowing her since they were kids didn\u2019t help things. It only made this entire situation murky. Maybe it would be for the best if this was a one-time thing. Something impulsive and sexy as hell, but incredibly stupid.</p><p>And maybe he should have thought of that before he driven here tonight.</p><p>He found her in tucked in bed, wearing his t-shirt as she slept the sleep of the fully satisfied. Guess he\u2019d talk to her in the morning. Pulling the covers back, he joined her. A little breathy sigh leaving her as she scooted her ass up to his groin. He threw an arm and leg over her, completely aware of how perfectly they fit together.</p><p>Oh hell, he was in for it now.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Daylight streaming through the blinds of her bedroom woke Carter. He blinked and rubbed his eyes. Looking down at the woman sleeping on his chest, he smiled.</p><p>Her blonde curls were everywhere. He sifted his fingers through them, breathing in the coconut scent that always accompanied her.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she said, her voice sleepy and cute as hell. She started to slide off of him, but he wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cHow about breakfast in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can whip up some pancakes.\u201d She stretched against him, her breasts straining against his t-shirt.</p><p>His cock throbbed, reminding him of exactly what he should be doing with it. \u201cBreakfast can wait.\u201d Though he\u2019d planned on cooking for her, not the other way around. He slipped the t-shirt over her head and rose above her, taking in full breasts and bright pink nipples. \u201cThink I\u2019ll have some dessert first.\u201d</p><p>Kissing his way down her stomach, he parted her with two thumbs and her hips jumped. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He grinned up at her. \u201cGetting ready to eat.\u201d He slipped a finger inside of her, groaning as her inner muscles clamped down on him. \u201cWhere are my manners? Ladies should always be first.\u201d Easing his finger out, he crawled up her body and pushed his finger between her parted lips. \u201cSuck.\u201d</p><p>Brown eyes burning with desire closed as her little tongue curled and stroked, licking away her honey from his skin. Her hands came up, pushing against his chest and he fell on his back. She surveyed him with a wicked gleam in her eyes, before she put herself mouth level with his dick.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I have entire buffet at my disposal.\u201d Then she opened her sexy lips and took the head of him into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cFuuuck,\u201d he moaned. Not one to just lie there, even with a woman\u2019s mouth on his cock, he fisted his hands in her hair and guided her movements. He couldn\u2019t not watch her head bob up and down.</p><p>A little sound of pleasure left her throat and he rocked his hips, sending his cock deeper. Her tongue swiped over his head and he groaned. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re good.\u201d Faster now, he gently pushed and pulled on her hair, setting a rhythm that had him on the edge.</p><p>Big brown eyes gaze up at him as her cheeks hallowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Her response was to suck harder and rub his balls. His orgasm shot through him, leaving him with every pull of her hot mouth. She drank him down greedily, her tongue doing things that made his body shake.</p><p>\u201cGod...fucking...shit,\u201d he growled. Yeah, he didn\u2019t make any sense, but he didn\u2019t give a damn. When he could finally see straight again, she sat up, bare breasts bouncing and nipples begging for his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d she said. Then that sexy woman crawled up his body and sat on his face. Oh yeah, this was exactly what he wanted for breakfast. He spread her, plunging his tongue deep inside and letting all of her honey go down his throat. He licked and sucked and bit until she grabbed the headboard.</p><p>A little twist of his lips and she cried out his name. But he didn\u2019t stop. He scraped his teeth over her clit and sucked the swollen flesh into his mouth.</p><p>She went wild, bucking against him and screaming.</p><p>It had to be the sexiest thing he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Rolling off of him, she sank down beside him and closed her eyes. \u201cThat was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Lashes lifting, she rolled to her side and traced a pattern on his chest. \u201cCarter, if you\u2019ve got things to do...It\u2019s okay if you leave.\u201d</p><p>The relief at her offer of an easy out didn\u2019t come. Instead all he could think about was her sitting by herself at home, or worse, calling his sister and crying. That wasn\u2019t all he thought; he didn\u2019t want to leave. He wanted...her. This.</p><p>He dusted his thumb over her pouty lower lip. \u201cSpend the day with me.\u201d</p><p>The smile she gave him lit up the room, brighter than the sunshine streaming in. And when she hugged him tight, his heart did a little flip.</p><p>Well, shit.</p><p>Melanie eyed the Mustang parked beside Carter\u2019s garage. There was no way in hell she was going to drive it anywhere. Carter loved that car, more than anything. Or at least he acted like he did.</p><p>Carter held open the driver\u2019s side door and gestured for her to get in. \u201cWe\u2019re wasting daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because someone kept me in bed the entire morning,\u201d she said, her cheeks heating.</p><p>He strode from the car, his confident gate sending little bubbles of excitement throughout her body. Wrapping his arms around her middle, he said, \u201cPlan on keeping you in bed this evening, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the bed?\u201d She shivered as he pressed hot kiss along her neck.</p><p>\u201cGot some countertops, too. But first\u201d\u2014He pulled her over to the car, practically shoving her inside.\u201cYou\u2019re going to drive this car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Even as she said the word, she climbed inside and put on her seatbelt. He closed the door after her and got in on the passenger side. She glanced at the floor and nearly jumped right back out. \u201cI can\u2019t drive stick anymore, Carter, not since I wrecked Ryan Sawyer\u2019s truck.\u201d</p><p>A wicked grin kicked up the corners of his mouth. \u201cHate to argue with a lady, but the things you were doing to me this morning say otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open, cheeks heating to beyond acceptable levels. Flicking her eyes at the review mirror, she wanted to die. Her face was a red as the paint job. Great...just great.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I mess up the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here with you.\u201d He touched her cheek. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>There he went with those words again. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what to do first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Starting up the car or even putting it in reverse wasn\u2019t the problem. It was getting out on Highway Thirteen and putting it into a higher gear. The last time she\u2019d attempted this, she\u2019d down-shifted her dad\u2019s truck some many times that she\u2019d almost stripped the gears and given them whiplash. Her palms began to sweat as she pulled out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cDoing good, baby.\u201d He placed a warm hand on her thigh, gliding it down over her knee to cover her hand. A hand that had a kung-fu grip on the gearshift. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this together.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension that had worked its way into her shoulders began to fade away as he helped her shift from first to second. \u201cCarter,\u201d she whispered, knowing that her next move was where she had the most trouble.</p><p>\u201cPut the pedal to the metal,\u201d he said, his voice so confident that she did exactly what he said. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t close your eyes, she silently reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t close those big brown eyes of yours.\u201d</p><p>Together they shifted into to third, then fourth. And the only thing that happened was exactly what should have happened.</p><p>She let out a little cheer and Carter squeezed her hand. \u201cYou did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did it,\u201d she said. There wasn\u2019t anything she couldn\u2019t do with him at her side.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said and she could hear the smile in his voice. \u201cIt was a team effort. Where to next, Miss Smith?\u201d</p><p>Grinning she flicked her eyes to him then back at the road. \u201cWherever the road takes us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d Pulling her hand to his mouth, he kissed it. She fully expected him to let it go, but he laced his fingers through hers and every time she had to shift gears, he stayed with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Don\u2019t ever let me go, she thought.</p><p>\u201cCan I show you something?\u201d Melanie asked as she drove. She had put the top down, so now all her blonde curls streamed in the wind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d</p> <p>Down shifting, she hit the gas. \u201cHold on to your hat, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>Carter grinned. For the past thirty minutes, she\u2019d driven as fast a he\u2019d let her up and down Highway Thirteen, her confidence growing with each mile.</p><p>She took a right onto Persimmon and drove another quarter mile before turning into the driveway of a tiny house with a for sale sign stuck in the front yard.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of this place?\u201d she asked, unbuckling her seatbelt and getting out. She walked to the porch and peeked in the windows.</p><p>He joined her on the porch, shoving his hands in his pockets. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I want to buy it.\u201d Turning to him, her brown eyes brimmed with happiness. \u201cI almost have enough money for a down payment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a loan?\u201d</p><p>She moved to the front door, fiddling with the lock. \u201cPre-approved.\u201d Giving the door a push, it swung open. \u201cCome see the inside.\u201d</p><p>Holding out her hand, she waited for him to take it. He knew if he took her hand that there was no going back to what they used to have or what they used to be. Not even after last night and this morning. But he liked to take chances, even when they didn\u2019t pay off. So, he took a deep breath and pulled his hand out of his pocket to grab hers.</p><p>He let her lead him inside, her fingers laced through his. \u201cWe won\u2019t get arrested for breaking and entering will we?\u201d</p><p>Giggling, she shook her head. \u201cJanie gave me the code, since I\u2019d been bugging her almost every day to come out here.\u201d</p> <p>As they walked through the two bedroom cottage, she pointed out every little thing she loved about it. He couldn\u2019t help but be caught up in her excitement.</p><p>\u201cOut here, I was thinking that I could have a grill and one of those chimineas, so I can roast marshmallows.\u201d She practically skipped to the right side of the deck. \u201cMaybe put a patio set over here.\u201d</p><p>Wiggling the deck railing, he frowned. \u201cThis needs be fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could hire you as my handyman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were planning on staying, I\u2019d love to be your handyman.\u201d The words slipped out, before he had a chance to consider the impact.</p><p>\u201cYou really are set on living in Charlotte?\u201d she asked in a small voice.</p><p>He had to tell the truth; she deserved complete honesty, and he hated liars. \u201cLooks like it, but I\u2019m not a hundred percent.\u201d A look of sadness appeared on her face, but in his next heartbeat it was gone so fast that he was sure he\u2019d imagined it. \u201cIt\u2019s not that far away and I plan on coming home for holidays and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess it\u2019s a good thing that you and I are just friends, because most women around here wouldn\u2019t be too happy to know that they man they\u2019ve been sleeping with plans on leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Just friends? He sure as hell didn\u2019t do what they had done last night and this morning with his friends. But maybe she did. An uneasy feeling settle in his gut, heavy as a tire iron. \u201cDo you usually have sex with your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...at least, not until you.\u201d</p><p>That uneasy feeling left him, and he suppressed a grin. He always did like being first.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked, running her fingers along the top of the railing.</p><p>\u201cNot since my first year of college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re okay with that kind of relationship with me, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with whatever you need to call it.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t. Kneeling down, he examined the boards. They seemed to be in good shape and the deck hadn\u2019t shook when they\u2019d walked on it. He looked up at her. \u201cHow long has it been since anyone\u2019s lived here?\u2019</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout two years. The bank owns it now,\u201d she said as he stood, wiping off his hands. \u201cHopefully, real soon, I will instead.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, he was amazed by her, by her confidence and dedication to a goal that her dad made nearly unreachable with his gambling habits. Whoever she ended up with was a lucky man, because he knew that she\u2019d be that guy\u2019s biggest cheerleader and best friend.</p><p>Didn\u2019t he sound all Hallmark-like.</p><p>Frowning, he dug his hands into his jean pockets.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be that easy to read. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat maybe I\u2019ve bitten off more than I can chew. That a single woman shouldn\u2019t buy a house, because what if she meets a man\u2014\u201d</p><p>Pressing a finger to her lips, he gave her a look. \u201cIf I thought all of that, what kind of man would I be?\u201d He grabbed her hips, pulling her close. \u201cI find female home-ownership very sexy.\u201d</p><p>A little smile pulled up the corners of her mouth. \u201cOh you do, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his voice low.</p><p>\u201cSure you\u2019re not saying that to get in my panties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cLines aren\u2019t my MO.\u201d Melanie laughed, her joy contagious and he found himself laughing with her. \u201cYou are the sweetest thing, Melanie Ann Smith. And I\u2019m mighty proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Brown eyes widened. \u201cI am? You are?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, he lowered his mouth to hers, kissing her in the afternoon sun. Her arms wound around him as she pressed her body to his. In that moment, something inside of him shifted and all he could think was it was a damn shame he wouldn\u2019t be that man for Melanie.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Carter drove home, pushing the car to speeds she would never dare to go, but she didn\u2019t feel afraid. This was Carter and he would never put her in harm\u2019s way.</p><p>Carter said something, but she couldn\u2019t make it out over the music blaring.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she yelled.</p><p>Glancing at her, he began again, \u201cI said\u2014\u201d The bass hit, drowning out the rest of his words.</p><p>Squinting at him, she mouthed, \u201cCan\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn down the radio.\u201d</p><p>Good grief. Why couldn\u2019t he turn it down himself, if it was so darn important? \u201cMen,\u201d she sighed, turning down the music.</p><p>\u201cSpend the next couple of nights with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLike dates or a sleepover?\u201d</p><p>He pulled the car into his garage and cut the engine. Silence permeated the air, until he finally said, \u201cA little of both.\u201d</p><p>She faced him, smiling so big that her face felt like it was going to split. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the week passed by in a blur. Melanie had never been so happy in her life. So happy that she barely had any time to dwell of the fact that her dad still hadn\u2019t come home.</p><p>Or the phone call she\u2019d overheard Carter having with his Uncle John this morning about his Aunt Raylene leaving John a note about going out to one of those spas on Hilton Head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know why people tell me their problems,\u201d he had grumbled, then moved into his garage.</p><p>She heard a series of crashes, and tools falling. \u201cWhat in the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Carter shouted and she went running into the garage.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she gasped, skidding to a stop.</p><p>Beau\u2019s eyes widened but wisely he said nothing. Instead he grabbed some cleaning supplies and went to work cleaning up the mess. Melanie hadn\u2019t been too sure about him when he started. All tough edges on the outside, but inside, where it counted, that boy was softer than the cotton in a field.</p><p>\u201cOh my God is right.\u201d Carter was covered from head to toe in oil and grease. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill Heath when I see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think he did,\u201d\u2014she pointed to the overturned containers.\u2014\u201cthis?\u201d</p><p>Wiping his face with a paper towel, he said, \u201cBecause he was the last one to use my tools to change his oil. Who else would think it was good idea to set an opened oil container on top of old boxes?\u201d</p><p>Carter did have a point about his brother. Heath wasn't the most responsible college kid on the planet. \u201cHow about you go get in the shower and I\u2019ll help Beau clean up this mess.\u201d Kneeling in the floor, she grabbed a wad of paper towel and began blotting up the oil.</p><p>Beau watched them with round eyes as he rushed back and forth, bringing more cleaning supplies.</p><p>\u201cLeave it, Melanie. That\u2019s what I pay Beau to do.\u201d Carter stalked to the door at the rear of the garage and motioned for her to follow. Once they were out of earshot, he said, \u201cBesides, I\u2019ll need your help in the shower.\u201d</p><p>She soo wanted to help in the shower, but her brain won the battle over her raging lust. \u201cNo way. First, I\u2019m still on the clock and second, there is an impressionable young man working for you.\u201d</p><p>Carter snorted. \u201cThat kid probably gets more tail with his I\u2019m-bad-on-the-outside-but-a-softie-on-the-inside routine than I ever did at his age.\u201d</p><p>Gasping, she glared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not a routine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWill we ruin Beau for life if you help get me out of these clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not, but that\u2019s all I\u2019m doing.\u201d She trailed behind him as he made his way upstairs to his home away from home. They entered the laundry room first and she helped him get off his boots without getting too much on her or the floor. He peeled out of his shirt, jeans and socks next, revealing his lean, muscular body.</p><p>Taking his clothes, she piled them in the deep sink and ran hot water over them.</p><p>\u201cSure you won\u2019t reconsider?\u201d he asked, his voice deep.</p><p>After adding a capful of detergent, she turned to him and almost dropped the container. \u201cWould you put that away,\u201d she hissed, waving at his erection.</p><p>\u201cAfter you come wash all the parts I can\u2019t reach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d However, her entire body was screaming: Go for it! She replaced the cap and placed the detergent on top of the washer.</p><p>\u201cThen how will you get the oil off of you?\u201d He lunged for her and she just barely danced out his reach.</p><p>\u201cGo shower, you dirty old man,\u201d she said with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he said, walking away. She couldn\u2019t help but ogle him. \u201cStop staring woman, before I decide that I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about Beau seeing me chasing you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget we\u2019re going driving again this afternoon,\u201d he added, disappearing into his apartment.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait!\u201d She raced down the stairs. Composing herself before she reentered the garage, she schooled her face and walked inside.</p><p>Beau stopped mopping up the spill. \u201cYou sure look pretty today, Miss Melanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Carter was completely wrong about him. That boy was nothing but sunshine--</p><p>Grey eyes dropped to her chest and she narrowed hers at him. Cotton had hard seeds at the center, nearly impossible to get out without the right equipment.</p><p>His gaze met hers again, all angel-faced. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when he\u2019s right,\u201d she muttered, stomping to the office.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything, Miss Melanie?\u201d</p><p>Turning, she stuck her head in the garage and shot him a stern look. \u201cI\u2019m on to you, Beau Montgomery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Beau winked at her, then went back to cleaning.</p><p>Parked in the Johnson\u2019s tobacco field, Melanie sat beside Carter, her head on his shoulder as they watched the sun begin to set. North Carolina in January had notoriously fickle weather. One minute is was freezing and the next, like today, it was seventy and sunny.</p><p>\u201cHave you found a job to replace the one I helped you lose, yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Jack texted me while you were filling up the car. He said he forgot about Valentine\u2019s Day next month. So, he needed to hire his best waitress back.\u201d She\u2019d almost told Jack no, but she needed the money. Plus, she was pretty darn sure Jack would never forget about one of his biggest money-making days. Sneaky man.</p><p>\u201cForgot all about Valentine\u2019s Day. Isn\u2019t it in three weeks or something?\u201d Melanie\u2019s heart came to a screeching halt. She didn\u2019t expect him to think about spending Valentine\u2019s Day with her. That was something people in love did. And their love was incredibly one-sided. But it hurt. God, it hurt.</p><p>\u201cThree and a half weeks.\u201d Once again she questioned her sanity for getting involved with him. \u201cJust another day for me, only with better tips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you got your job back.\u201d He wrapped his arm around her, pulling her close. \u201cHow about you come to Charlotte with me this weekend and meet some of my buddies?\u201d he asked, sending her heart into overdrive. Men did not introduce casual relationship women to their buddies. Or vice versa.</p><p>\u201cWe get to drive this the entire way,\u201d he added, as if she needed a car for an excuse to spend time with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love...that sounds like fun.\u201d While she sounded like a complete idiot.</p><p>He turned to her, dark green eyes flashing with humor.\u201cKnew you couldn\u2019t resist the lure of driving the car.\u201d</p><p>Dipping her head, she peered up at him though her lashes. \u201cMight have something to do with the owner.\u201d</p><p>Humor gave way to obvious annoyance. \u201cLots of women like Chase Montgomery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d She had no idea why lots of women liking Chase Montgomery had anything to do their conversation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t know.\u201d His fully lips compressed into a thin line. \u201cAlmost every woman I\u2019ve dated, since I\u2019ve been in racing, wants to meet Montgomery. He\u2019s a racing god.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Obviously this was a very bad thing, but she had no idea why he\u2019d think she wanted to re-meet a man she\u2019d already met. Then it dawned on her: Carter had used the word \u2018dated\u2019. As if they were dating. Or at least that\u2019s what she thought he meant.</p><p>Oh God, that\u2019s what she hoped he meant.</p><p>He opened the passenger side door and slid out. \u201cI need some air.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a convertible, with the top down.\u201d She followed him, grabbing his arm. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, but I only met Chase once or twice \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Letting go of his arm, she flicked her hands in the air. \u201cAll I know is that I was trying to flirt with you. Bad me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy saying the only reason you\u2019re going to Charlotte with me is to meet the owner of this car?\u201d He ran a hand through his hair, making it stick straight up in the front. \u201cI already had two years of that shit. Trying to make me jealous all the fucking time. April lied to me about everything. Everything\u2014look lying is a deal breaker for me. I\u2019m honest and expect the same from everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Boy, didn\u2019t she know it. In high school, he had once told her not to wear her favorite sweater because the knit knots on it looked like nipples. She\u2019d taken a pair of scissors to that thing as soon as she\u2019d gotten home.</p> <p>\u201cWhich is exactly why this is a big fucking deal to me. I don\u2019t need this kind of drama in my life, especially from you,\u201d he said, his voice harsh. \u201cJesus Christ, woman. You\u2019re already leading me around by my dick. What more do you want?\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s face drained of color, then her pouty lips thinned. \u201cYou, Carter Ambrose, are a big jerk. Huge.\u201d She stomped away from him, yelling as she headed to the road. \u201cGinormous. Enormous. All the words that describe every man I\u2019ve ever tried to please JERK!\u201d</p><p>Every man she\u2019d tried to please? He strode after her, grabbing her arm and spinning her around. \u201cJust how many men have you tried pleasing?\u201d Oh yeah, that didn\u2019t sound jerky as hell.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have enough fingers and toes, and neither do you to help me count them all.\u201d Tears filled her pretty eyes. \u201cAll a man has to do is tell me I\u2019m pretty and I drop my panties. Why, just the other day Mr. Henry said he thought I was cute as a button while I cleaned his house. So I took that eighty-five year old man by the hand and rocked his freaking world. Next week, I\u2019ll get all swoony over the UPS guy telling me how neat my signature is, then let him put his package in my slot.\u201d</p><p>Scrubbing his hands over his face, he tried to make sense of her, their situation and came up with nothing. \u201cDammit, woman. Would you be serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019m too stupid.\u201d She shoved a finger in his chest. \u201cBut at least I\u2019m not mean like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cArrg.\u201d He almost dropped to his knees and pounded the dirt field in frustration. What the hell had happened in the last five minutes? He\u2019d invited her ass to Charlotte with him, even said she could drive Chase\u2019s car on the way and...oh , shit. \u201cMelanie, did you think that car is mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else\u2019s would it be?\u201d she cried, then ran back to the car. \u201cAccording to Ms. Leah, you have a whole garage full in Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch. Why couldn\u2019t he actually talk to her like a real person? Oh that\u2019s right, he turn into a certifiable dumbass around her. \u201cMelanie...\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you Melanie me.\u201d She snagged her purse, pulled out her phone and walked past him. He grabbed her around her middle and picked her up. She tensed, but didn\u2019t fight him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Kissing the side of her neck, he breathed in her coconut scent. \u201cI am a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be like this,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be like this.\u201d</p><p>Setting her on her feet, he turned her so she faced him. \u201cHow am I supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>She searched his face. Her eyes were red and her lips were swollen. \u201cNot like the rest. You\u2019re always telling me to quit assuming the worst about myself, but you assume the worst about me.\u201d</p> <p>A kick to the gut, not that he didn\u2019t deserve it. He\u2019d known Melanie since she was eight years old and he\u2019d always looked out for her while he lived here. But he sure as hell wasn\u2019t being protective of her right now.</p><p>She deserved better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say. Anyway, Zoe\u2019s on her way to get me,\u201d she said, her shoulders slumping as she tucked her phone back into her purse. \u201cThings need to go back to the way they were before we made...hooked-up.\u201d</p><p>Jerk was too good of a word for him. \u201cMelanie\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Rising to the balls of her feet, she pressed a soft kiss to his cheek. \u201cThanks for letting me drive.\u201d</p><p>That one kiss almost had him on his knees, his arms wrapped around her middle and begging for forgiveness, until she relented. Instead he shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cSee you tomorrow at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine a.m. sharp,\u201d she said with an obviously forced cheerful tone. \u201cBye, Carter.\u201d</p><p>He heard Zoe\u2019s Camaro before he saw it. Slowly turning as Melanie walked past him, he saw the accusation in his sister\u2019s eyes as she got out of her car. She gave Melanie a hug and then Melanie got in on the passenger side.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Zoe hissed.</p><p>Carter stepped back. He\u2019d never seen her so mad. \u201cShot off my mouth before my brain got in gear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, it really sucks to know that my brother is just like the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst her and now you. I\u2019m human, Zoe.\u201d He rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cI screw up.\u201d</p><p>Fisting her hands on her hips, she let out a disbelieving snort. \u201cYou did more than screw up. Melanie\u2019s always been in lo\u2014sweet on you. Everyone around here knows it.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they did. Hell he knew it, but thought it was a crush. Nothing serious, until now when his sister had almost said love. \u201cYeah, well everyone should know that I\u2019m not looking for that.\u201d And just when he thought he couldn\u2019t be more of a jackass...he said shit like that.</p><p>\u201cToo bad you didn\u2019t tell Melanie,\u201d Zoe snapped. \u201cStay away from my best friend, Carter, or so help me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He crossed his arms and tilted his head to one side, raising his brows. \u201cYou\u2019ll write about it in your books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill trying to think of the perfect person to base the villain on.\u201d She tipped up her chin. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re edging out the leading candidate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you know anyone who\u2019s villainous,\u201d he said, gazing over his sister\u2019s shoulder. Melanie sat with her head facing the passenger side window. Yeah, he was the damn villain, breaking a woman\u2019s heart like some cold son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised who I met out in California,\u201d she said.</p><p>His gaze sliced to hers. Zoe had been different since she\u2019d moved back home. \u201cSomething I need to take care of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to it.\u201d Zoe was lying, but if she wasn\u2019t going to tell him, then there was nothing he could do. \u201cSee you later, Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to never hurt her again, Zoe.\u201d Even if it meant staying away from Melanie, which he realized wasn\u2019t something he wanted to do. He had to make things right.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep, big brother,\u201d Zoe said softly, then she walked back to her car and got in.</p><p>He held up his hand in good-bye, but Melanie still refused to look his way. Not that he could blame her. But he could make it up to her.</p><p>Starting tomorrow.</p><p>Melanie found her dad sitting in his usual spot, like he\u2019d never been gone. Unfortunately, he was on his fifth beer and cursing at the television. A sure sign that he\u2019d lost all twelve grand and then some. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Zoe,\u201d she lied, jogging to her bedroom. Okay so it wasn\u2019t exactly a lie. Technically she\u2019d spent the past hour with her best friend, until Zoe had convinced her to come spend the night. They\u2019d planned on going to Poor Boy\u2019s tonight to dance their cares away.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Gregory said there was a car parked here all night.\u201d</p><p>Searching her closet, she found the perfect quasi-breakup revenge dress to wear out tonight. \u201cMrs. Gregory also said there were little green men line dancing on Ms.White\u2019s roof last month.\u201d</p><p>Louis chuckled as she walked to into the living room. She bent down to kiss his scruffy cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t wait up for me. I\u2019m staying at Zoe\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan on going out of town for about a week, sugar. Got another job lined up in Wilkesboro,\u201d he said as she straightened. If she didn\u2019t stay as far away from anything that remotely resembled gambling, she would have bet the bank that he was headed up to Cherokee.</p><p>Biting back a sigh, she clutched her bag tighter. \u201cThat\u2019s good, Daddy. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry none.\u201d He nodded, his eyes never leaving the television screen. \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling that our luck\u2019s about to change. Raylene will see that I\u2019m the man for her.\u201d</p><p>Yeah and some things never changed, she thought as she headed out the door and got in her best friend\u2019s car.</p><p>An hour later, Melanie was downing another shot of Jose Cuervo. She slammed the shot glass down on the bar and headed for the dance floor. A live band had begun to play their version of Big and Rich\u2019s Party Like Cowboyz.</p><p>She linked arms with Zoe, pulling her along. They shuffled, kicked up their heels and stomped to the beat, shouting the lyrics.</p><p>\u201cNothing like shaking your booty to chase away a man,\u201d Melanie yelled over the music.</p><p>Zoe grinned. \u201cOr have them panting for your attention.\u201d She nodded at two men making their way over to them. \u201cI\u2019ll be your wingwoman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want anyone else by my side.\u201d</p><p>Face turning pale, Zoe\u2019s eyes grew wide. She grabbed Melanie\u2019s arm. \u201cCarter\u2019s here and he looks pissed as hell.\u201d</p><p>Melanie whirled around, smiling at the guys, and then frowning at the jerk glaring at her.</p><p>The song changed, bass hitting hard as she was surrounded by tall, hot and male. Sandwiched between them, she tossed her hair and slowly rolled her hips.</p><p>\u201cBeen staring at you all night, babe,\u201d the one behind her said, his hands settling on her waist.</p><p>\u201cHave you now?\u201d She leaned back, then looked up at the one in front of her. \u201cWhat about you, cutie?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHad to flip a coin on who got to dance with you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re both dancing with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe play well together...on the dance floor and the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Melanie blinked. That was kinda hot, but not her thing. Just as she opened her mouth to turn them down, Zoe grabbed her arm. \u201cCarter\u2019s heading this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother can kiss my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, gentleman, but I need to have a talk with my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not your girl,\u201d Melanie snapped and began to drag her dance partners away, but the two hotties were more interested who\u2019d just walked up.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, bro. You\u2019re Carter Ambrose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn shame you\u2019re not racing anymore,\u201d the guy behind her said, his hands leaving her waist.</p><p>Melanie rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s a hundred percent,\u201d Carter said, shaking their hands. \u201cBut I can tell you this: Jake Henley is one to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Royce and he\u2019s Van.\u201d Of course they were, Melanie thought. Only she could attract two guys named after automobiles. \u201cIt would be our honor to buy you a couple rounds of beer\u201d</p><p>Carter grinned, confident yet humble. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you gentlemen up on your honor and enjoy every last drop.\u201d He leaned into Melanie, whispering in her ear. \u201cBe back later, baby, then you can tell me exactly what I can kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not waiting around for you.\u201d She crossed her arms, ignoring how happy her body got with him around. Two plus one didn\u2019t turn her on as much as Carter Ambrose.</p><p>Stupid happy body.</p><p>\u201cYes, you will.\u201d He sauntered off and she stared after him, knowing he was right. Knowing she was allowing him to dictate what she would and wouldn\u2019t be doing, but only because she wanted to tell him off again. Or at least that\u2019s what she told herself as she found the table she and Zoe had claimed when the first arrived.</p><p>Anticipation grew to epic proportions as Melanie waited for him. She drummed her fingers on the table and tapped her foot on the floor. She sneaked a peek at Carter and found him staring at her, then he set down his beer and strode toward her.</p><p>The band took a break and the bar\u2019s jukebox kicked on. The Civil War\u2019s Dance Me Until the End of Love began to play.</p><p>As he neared, her heart sped up so fast that she was sure it was about to run out of her chest. It knew what her brain refused to believe. She wanted to dance with him.</p><p>Wordlessly, he took her hand and led her on the dance floor, wrapping her arms around his neck. As if it were the most natural thing in the world, she lay her head on his chest. They moved slowly, bodies turning and swaying with the beat.</p><p>His hand coasted down her arm, sending shockwaves throughout her nerves, as it traveled and found a home on the small of her back. The heat of his palm was like a brand on her skin. Holding her away from him, he spun her around and pulled her back again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look sexy as hell in that dress, Melanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t let his compliment sway her. \u201cToo bad you lost your chance to go home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad for you, too.\u201d Carter\u2019s head dipped to hers, his mouth dangerously close. \u201cDon\u2019t go home with anyone but my sister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll cause a scene, maybe kick some good ol\u2019 boy\u2019s butt, just to show that redneck in you hasn\u2019t been completely driven out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that and more.\u201d His green eyes bore into hers. \u201cI\u2019m feeling mighty proprietary towards you, Miss Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig words suppose to impress me? In case you forgot, I\u2019m a beauty school drop-out,\u201d she said, but her heart wasn\u2019t in it. In fact her heart thrilled at the thought of him feeling so possessive of her.</p><p>A soft smile pushed up the corners of his sexy mouth. He brushed an invisible strand of hair away from her face. \u201cYou just haven\u2019t found the career that interests you enough, but when you do\u2014watch out Holland Springs. Hell, watch out world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think all that about me?\u201d It was true she flitted from job to job, trying to discover exactly what she wanted to do, or be. So far, the only thing that interested her cost too much to invest in, and her camera, the one she\u2019d inherited from her momma, had stopped working two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d He searched her face. \u201cI think you\u2019re gorgeous, sexy, smart\u2014\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u2013\u201csmart and thoughtful. Too good for a dumbass jerk like me.\u201d</p><p>Tears gathered in her throat. \u201cStop teasing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dead serious. Sometimes, my mouth shifts to fifth while my brain stalls in first, and it\u2019s your job to call me out on it.\u201d</p><p>The things he said to her. She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll think on it.\u201d</p><p>The song ended, but they kept moving. Carter seemed no more inclined to leave her than she did him. Out of the corner of her eye, the band walked back onto the stage.</p><p>\u201cSong\u2019s over.\u201d Lifting her chin, he gazed down at her. Closing her eyes, she waited for the inevitable. For him to kiss her, for her to forgive him and for them to end up hot and sweaty, and tangled up in each other in his bed.</p> <p>\u201cCarter,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the dance, Melanie,\u201d he said and her eyes popped open. \u201cI\u2019ll be at the bar until you leave with Zoe.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cOf all the high-handed\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cStill your choice.\u201d He touched her cheek, then walked away, leaving her wanting more.</p><p>Zoe sidled up to her. \u201cCarter\u2019s not leaving until we do, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Carter sat down on an empty bar stool and lifted his glass in salute.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with that?\u201d</p> <p>Unable to lie to herself or her best friend, Melanie sighed. \u201cYep.\u201d Then she grinned at Zoe. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m leaving anytime soon. Let\u2019s dance.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>After staying until closing time and watching Carter watch her, Melanie made it to work five minutes before nine.</p><p>Of course he was already there. The damn man rose with the sun. She didn\u2019t know how he did it, because being a non-morning person meant that ten o\u2019clock felt like five a.m..</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she said, come to a halt in the doorway of his office. She blinked. There were roses everywhere. Pink, purple, white and blush. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d</p><p>Carter ambled to her, one hand in his pocket and biting the side of his lip. \u201cPart of my apology. I know it\u2019s pretty standard, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not standard with me.\u201d She walked inside, brushing past him and lifting the closest vase. \u201cThese smell so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like?\u201d He stood behind her, so close that she could feel the heat his body threw off. In that moment all she wanted to do was touch and kiss him. His hands crept around her waist, pulling her back against his front. \u201cForgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nine o\u2019clock.\u201d His hands fell away. \u201cTime for work.\u201d</p><p>Eyes opening, she set down the vase and whirled to face him. \u201cThank you for the roses.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you exhausted?\u201d she asked, her voice cracking on a yawn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to going all night.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear God. There was so much promise in his words that she was ready to call it quitting time and drag him upstairs. \u201cCan you get that for me?\u201d she asked, pointing to a box on a top shelf on the far wall. \u201cI need to go through those files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Miss Smith,\u201d he said, coming up behind her. His large, lean body pressed against her as he grabbed the box. He set the box right in front of her, his arms around her but not touching. \u201cThis good for you?\u201d</p><p>Was it good for her? She wanted to whimper at the ache he\u2019d started between her thighs. \u201cY-yes,\u201d she said, scooting away from him. She could hear him walking behind him and her heart sped up. Thankfully, just as she put the box down on the table by the file cabinet, her phone rang.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to answer that. I don\u2019t have a no cell phone policy,\u201d he said from behind her. \u201cBesides it could be your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope not, because my dad only calls me for two reasons: He\u2019s in jail, or he needs me to come pick him up from Poor Boys.\u201d She answered on the third ring. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Smith?\u201d</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be good. No phone call that started with a Ms. Anything was ever good. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Jane Ellen, calling from Holland Springs Bank. You had two debits that overdrew your account. Since this is the first time a situation like this has ever occurred during your time with us, we paid the bills anyway.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. Needing privacy, she mouthed, \u201cBe right back\u201d at Carter and headed out the door. \u201cThat was really nice of you, but I don\u2019t understand why my account would be overdrawn. I have almost forty-five hundred dollars in there.\u201d And the only two bills she had were car insurance and cell phone, which totaled no where near that amount.</p><p>\u201cAs of two p.m. you had a balance of twenty five dollars. That is, until the debits hit. \u201c</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. I haven\u2019t taken out any money.\u201d A feeling of dread washed over her. She closed her eyes and leaned against her car, bracing for the bad news.</p><p>There was an audible breath, then a throat cleared. \u201cYour daddy came in here this morning and withdrew four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars from your account. LeeAnne waited on him, like usual. \u201c</p><p>She let her head hit the piece of metal above the window. LeeAnne Parks was sweet on her dad, but he never gave her the time of day, due to her being available and not in need of a white knight. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t have my permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s listed on your account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I opened it when I was twelve, remember? You were the one who waited on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that, but since then, you could have had him removed.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she could have, but she never dreamed Louis would steal from her. Taking a steadying breath, she counted to ten. \u201cIs there anything I can do to get it back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Melanie. There\u2019s nothing I or anyone else here can do. Why don\u2019t you talk to Louis? In the meantime, we\u2019ll have to hold-off on closing on your loan next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d For nothing, she wanted to add. Melanie hung up and fisted her hand around her phone. \u201cDamn you, Louis Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Carter asked as Melanie appeared in his office again, her face red and her brown eyes glittering.</p><p>\u201cNo, everything is not okay.\u201d She marched back to the table by the file cabinet and jerked the lid off of the helpless box. \u201cThe bank\u2019s basically told me I\u2019m a deadbeat and my dad\u2019s run off with all my money.\u201d Turning, she shook her head and gave him a brittle smile. \u201cI was supposed to close on my house next month. Looks like that will never happen.\u201d</p><p>Jumping up from his chair, he joined her at the table, taking away the file she\u2019d just pulled out. \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d Hunting Louis down and beating the crap out of him for putting Melanie in this position was high on his list, but he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d like that too much. And he didn\u2019t relish the thought of going to jail for assault.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Lifting her chin, she took the file back and held it to her chest. \u201cI\u2019m never getting out of that trailer park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you wanted the house, Melanie, but there\u2019s not a thing wrong with living in a trailer park.\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned sour. \u201cSays the man that owns three houses and a condo.\u201d Then she smacked both hands over her mouth, letting the file fall to the floor. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. That was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize. We all say and do things we don\u2019t mean, or at least we don\u2019t mean once cooler heads prevail.\u201d</p><p>She dropped to the floor, picking up the scattered papers. He joined her, handing her the ones that had slid under the table. \u201cThanks.\u201d Replacing them, she set the folder on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m any good to you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d Biting the side of his lip, he lifted his brows. \u201cHow would you feel about us taking a trip together\u2014strictly business, of course\u2014to Charlotte? I\u2019ll pay for your expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the same trip you\u2019d invited me on yesterday?\u201d Her brown eyes had gone all soft and dewy.</p><p>He gave her a crooked smile. \u201cYeah, but I really do need you to come with me. I have three business meetings with possible investors, and I\u2019ll need someone to help me keep everything straight. Maybe take some notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have lawyers for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but those investors always have an assistant and I can\u2019t walk in there looking all wet behind the ears.\u201d He had no idea if that was true or not, since his manager and agent had always handled things of that nature. But for this, his own start-up, he wanted to be the one to handle it. Even if it meant he fell flat on his face. He always did like to learn the hard way.</p><p>\u201cBeats staying here and moping around,\u201d she said with a shrug and a sigh.</p><p>\u201cGee thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an insult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t explain yourself. Everyone needs to get away.\u201d Warmth coursed through his veins as her expression of utter hopelessness eased a tiny bit. He knew the smallest distance gained could win the entire race. \u201cGo home and pack, then I\u2019ll be by to pick you up at five thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we driving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlying. Wieland Airlines was a sponsor of mine and we\u2019re still on good terms.\u201d Actually, he\u2019d decided to go that route, because he couldn\u2019t ride in a car with Melanie for five hours and not keep his hands off of her.</p><p>The flight was uneventful and quick. Just the kind he liked. A limo picked them out front of Charlotte Douglas International, whisking them away to the Marquis. After checking in, the valet showed them to Melanie\u2019s room.</p><p>Carter tipped the woman and shut the door behind her, then turned to face Melanie. She stood at the windows, peering out at the Charlotte skyline. The lights of the Carolina Panthers\u2019 stadium were visible from this high up.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to order room service, movies and gorge yourself on the mini-bar.\u201d He smiled as she whirled to face him. \u201cJump on the bed and prank call the room next door.\u201d All those things she had done with his sister the last time they\u2019d come out to Charlotte to visit him, before he bought his house. But there was no way he could take Melanie to his house. He didn\u2019t trust himself.</p><p>\u201cNot much fun to do without a friend,\u201d she said, moving to the bed. Her hand trailed over the covers. \u201cThis is a huge bed for just one person.\u201d</p><p>Yeah and he\u2019d like nothing more than to join her in it. His dick was on board with his plan, too. Jesus, he had to get out of there. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need anything, I\u2019ll be going.\u201d He turned, moving to the door.</p><p>\u201cCarter, wait!\u201d Her coconut scent reached him before she did.</p><p>Hand on the door knob, he closed his eyes as her arms came around him. This is was okay. She\u2019d always given him hugs, except when he\u2019d gotten engaged, then she\u2019d avoided him like he had the plague. Her breasts flattened against his back. He stiffened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you brought me with you. I needed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Then he opened the door and stepped out of her embrace.</p><p>The three meetings he had scheduled went two for three in his favor. Two major investors not only wanted to help him get started, but had a list of clients that would be interested in his services.</p><p>Only problem was that one of the investors was a close friend of the governor and Carter wasn\u2019t completely sure that they were there for the potential to make money. Since he\u2019d removed his manager and agent from the equation, he needed someone to bounce off ideas. someone that wouldn\u2019t bullshit him or break his balls.</p><p>Someone like Jake Henley.</p><p>After texting his friend and former teammate, Carter checked in on Melanie.</p><p>How\u2019s it going?</p><p>Swimmingly. \uf04a</p><p>She texted him a picture of the pool on the fiftieth floor. Good thing it was heated, else her cute ass would be freezing right about now. He had to force himself to not ask Melanie to text him a picture of herself, wearing one of those tiny bikinis she favored. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Join me and Jake for drinks tonight?</p><p>Already have plans. Thanks anyway. Tomorrow?</p><p>\u201cPlans,\u201d he muttered. Who did she know in Charlotte? It didn\u2019t matter, because he hadn\u2019t earned the right to be nosy about her personal life. Despite his little talk with her at Poor Boy\u2019s, she was keeping him firmly in the friend zone.</p> <p>Pick you up at five. Have fun. Friend zone or not, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from adding, Be careful and call me when you get in.</p><p>K \uf04a</p><p>Motioning for the clerk, he indicated the necklace he wanted to see. Smiling, the woman gently removed it from the case and displayed it on black velvet. Diamond, sapphires and emeralds gleamed under the store lights. The gold chain was delicate, like the pendant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like for me to gift wrap it, Mr. Ambrose?\u201d</p> <p>Melanie would probably like that. \u201cPlease.\u201d He\u2019d give it to her tomorrow as a thank you for putting up with him and cheering him on between meetings. She\u2019d worn a pencil thin skirt, with a fitted suit jacket, her hair in a soft up-do as she sat at his side. Each little under-the-table pat on his knee made him feel ten feet tall and bullet proof.</p><p>He was really going to miss that when he moved.</p><p>Pouring himself a glass of Southern Comfort, he wandered around his house. April had been the one to pick out the floor plan, the neighborhood and the interior designer. It was perfect, or it had been.</p><p>April had taken her favorite pieces of furniture and all the artwork. The rest, she had said, he could sell on eBay or donate to Goodwill. He hadn\u2019t done either, yet.</p><p>He sat down on the leather sofa in the media room, grabbing the remote. For almost forty five minutes, he watched his old races\u2014the times he\u2019d won and lost. And crashed.</p><p>Then he watched his last race, the one where he\u2019d hit the wall so hard that his car had crumpled around him like an accordion.</p> <p>Wincing, he clicked off the television. Yeah, he missed racing, but he did not miss the recovery time or the look on his mother\u2019s face when he first opened his eyes in the hospital. Come to think of it, everyone he\u2019d known had visited him, including Melanie.</p><p>Then again, Melanie had been a part of his life in some way, shape or form since he was eleven. Smiling, he leaned his head back and thought about his earliest memory of her.</p><p>He could see her clearly: Sunshine-colored hair, face full of freckles and big brown eyes. He\u2019d been playing football on the playground and she\u2019d asked to join in. The other boys had said no. Then she\u2019d looked at him, batted her lashes, and he\u2019d felt sucker-punched.</p><p>Hell, he still felt that way around her.</p><p>The doorbell rang, pulling him out of his memories. Rising from the sofa, he set his drink down on the way to answer the door.</p><p>A grin kicked up the corners of his mouth as Jake Henley walked in. \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind, but I brought along an old friend and his guest.\u201d Then Jake\u2019s voice dropped, \u201cDidn\u2019t have choice. Chase beat my ass at the last stoplight. Told him where I was going, before I knew who was with him. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Carter shrugged. \u201cMaybe he can contribute.\u201d While breaking his balls.</p><p>Chase Montgomery stepped inside, shaking Carter\u2019s hand. \u201cThanks for having me.\u201d</p> <p>Just as he closed the door, April breezed through. \u201cFancy seeing you here. Love what you\u2019ve done with the place.\u201d</p><p>Shit. No damn wonder Jake was sorry. \u201cCome on in. Make yourself right at home,\u201d Carter muttered to himself as he joined the threesome in his kitchen.</p><p>April cozied up to Chase, batting her big blue eyes at him. Nearly two years ago that same move had sent him chasing after her, pursuing April like she was the two million dollar purse at Daytona. A year ago, watching her do that would have sent him into a jealous rage. He would have shot off his mouth, then they would have had angry make-up sex.</p><p>Tonight, however, it didn\u2019t even register. He smiled and reclaimed his drink, he took a long pull.</p><p>Despite April\u2019s over the top flirting, Chase didn\u2019t seem interested. Then again, Racing Royalty could have any woman he wanted around here. Hell, last year the man had dated the Princess of some European country he couldn\u2019t remember the name of, their images splashed on every magazine and online gossip blog.</p><p>\u201cA toast to my man, Carter, for knocking it out of the park today,\u201d Jake said, lifting a glass. \u201cCharlotte\u2019s restoration car business won\u2019t know what hit \u2018em.\u201d</p><p>Piercing grey eyes met Carter\u2019s. \u201cFinally made up your mind, huh? Thought you\u2019d stay in Holland Springs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s what I needed to talk to Jake about. Mind if we go in the other room?\u201d</p><p>April tossed her hair. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to keep Chase occupied.\u201d</p><p>Just as Carter and Jake left the room, Carter bumped a picture with his hip. He stopped, picked up the frame and set it back in place.</p><p>\u201cAlready been occupied by you, darlin\u2019. Or did you forget that time I showed you how to drive stick? Practiced in every car I owned until you got it right,\u201d Chase said, his voice low, but Carter heard every word.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad boy, Chase Montgomery,\u201d April cooed.</p><p>Still he felt nothing and kept walking. That\u2019s really what had driven him and April apart, at least on her end. She wanted a bad boy twenty-four seven. Only once Carter committed to a woman, the bad boy took a backseat to the dedicated boyfriend.</p><p>Jake waited in Carter\u2019s office, standing near the French doors that led outside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dangerous pastime for you, man.\u201d Jake grinned, his white teeth flashing the million dollar smile he was known for. He ran a hand through his hair, blue eyes gleaming with humor. \u201cSo what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>Carter relayed his dilemma, then waited for Jake to mull it over.</p><p>After a few minutes, Jake said, \u201cYou should definitely open your business in Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much I already knew, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the best option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte\u2019s where you have the contacts, the social life and clients,\u201d Jake pointed out.</p><p>Carter looked out through the French doors at his backyard. Pool lights gleamed under the water while steam rose from the top. \u201cDefinitely don\u2019t have that in Holland Springs.\u201d Unless he counted spending time with Melanie as his social life. He really should have invited her over to swim in his pool. Then he would have been able to watch her splash around, her breasts bobbing as she floated on her back.</p><p>He gave himself a mental shake and turned to face Jake, only to spy April standing in the doorway, looking like a cat that had caught the canary.</p><p>\u201cNeed something?\u201d he said. How much had she heard?</p><p>\u201cLooking for the ladies room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you couldn\u2019t be torn away from my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad an appointment with my hair dresser.\u201d She let out a little huff. \u201cBathroom?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his drink, he listened to the ice rattling around. \u201cYou picked out the house, April. I\u2019m pretty sure you know where everything is located.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I do.\u201d Blowing him a kiss, she sauntered away.</p><p>\u201cDamn good day when the two of you broke up,\u201d Jake said from behind him. \u201cAnyway, how about going into business with me? I know my way around cars and finances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it, Mr. MBA,\u201d Carter said, bumping his fist against Jake\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll give it some serious consideration, but in the meantime, let\u2019s get rid of my guests and get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>The minute he stepped foot into King\u2019s, Carter knew Melanie was here. A cute waitress, wearing all black, led him and Jake to the club\u2019s VIP section on the second floor. From up here he could survey the entire dance floor, but the flashing lights and columns made it difficult for those on the lower level to see him.</p><p>A flash of sunshine-colored hair caught his eye and he found his girl in the center of the dance floor, shaking her cute ass with her arms in the air. Dressed in a flirty skirt and hot pink halter top, she had the attention of every man in the place. A slow grin kicked up the corners of his mouth as she wagged a finger at the guy who\u2019d come up behind her and scooted away.</p><p>Jake joined him at the railing.\u201cIs that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. She\u2019s really filled out since last I saw her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks the same and you keep your damn eyes to yourself,\u201d Carter growled.</p><p>Melanie pulled a laughing woman out on the floor and the two began to dance.</p><p>Jake laughed. \u201cHow\u2019s your sister, Zoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, I\u2019m just yanking your chain.\u201d His buddy ambled over to the long silver sofa and sat down, spreading his arms along the back. \u201cMind if I invite some ladies to join us?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what he needed. Or so he thought.</p><p>Jake ticked up his chin and two women, dressed to kill, sauntered over. One joined him at the balcony. She opened plump lips and he held up his hand.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Carter and I\u2019m seeing someone.\u201d</p><p>A little smile played on the woman\u2019s lips as a cocktail waitress handed each of them a beer. \u201cHi, Carter. I\u2019m Kelly and why aren\u2019t you with her?\u201d</p><p>He tilted the beer down toward the dance floor. \u201cI am, only I really messed things up. So here I am, up here and relegated to the friend zone while I watch over Melanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stalking her?\u201d Kelly\u2019s brow furrowed as she brushed back a long strand of blond hair.\u201cFYI: I\u2019m a self-defense instructor and I\u2019ll totally kick your ass if you so much as try to go all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. I\u2019ve been protective of her since we were kids. Kind of a habit now.\u201d One he liked and had missed while he dated April. He took a long pull from the bottle. \u201cInitially, I asked her to text me when she got back to her hotel room. Wasn\u2019t planning on see her at all tonight. My buddy, Jake, picked out this place and she just happened to be here.\u201d</p><p>Kelly didn\u2019t look completely convinced but held up her drink. \u201cHere\u2019s to getting her back.\u201d</p><p>Here\u2019s to him not fucking things up again. He finished the last of his beer and joined Jake on the sofa, shrugging out of his coat. He kept one eye on Melanie while he and his buddy discussed strategy for Jake\u2019s next race.</p><p>A little after midnight, Melanie waved good-bye to the group of friends she had apparently made and began to push her way through the throng of people. He jumped up, intent on catching her before she left.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fire?\u201d Jake called out, his arms around the very lovely Kelly and her friend, Sharon.</p><p>Carter headed for the stairs. \u201cNeed to make sure she gets to the hotel safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring her with you tomorrow.\u201d Jake threw Carter\u2019s jacket at him. \u201cI could use some inspiration.\u201d</p><p>Catching his jacket, he flashed his buddy a grin. \u201cPlanned on it, but you can find inspiration elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoller at you later.\u201d</p><p>Taking the stairs two at a time, Carter snagged Melanie\u2019s arm just as she walked outside. A sharp elbow came flying back just as her foot stomped down on his toes. \u201cArrg!\u201d He stumbled, nearly toppling her over.</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d she gasped, her brown eyes round. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I thought you were some random guy trying to cop a feel.\u201d</p><p>Of her elbow? \u201cNope, just me.\u201d He blinked, trying not to wince at the pain as he rubbed his stomach. \u201cWanted to give you a ride back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you, but I already texted a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, we\u2019ll share it.\u201d</p><p>She let out a thick sigh. \u201cCarter you don\u2019t have to end your date just to take care of me.\u201d</p><p>Raising his brows, he tilted his head to one side. So, she had seen him and maybe, just maybe she\u2019d been dancing out there for his benefit. \u201cI\u2019m not on a date. Don\u2019t get me wrong-I enjoy Jake\u2019s company, but he\u2019s just not into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your love is unrequited, bless your heart.\u201d Her lips twitched, then thinned. \u201cHopefully one of those girls you had up there can make it all better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather be with you, making sure you get home okay.\u201d The hopeful expression that had appeared on her face disappeared faster than the smoke on the water. He wanted to smack himself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your misplaced sense of watching out for your sister\u2019s best friend. I\u2019m fine on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me anyway.\u201d</p><p>The cab pulled up to the curb and Melanie moved toward it. Carter beat her to the door, opening it for her and sliding in once she was settled.</p><p>After giving the driver her address, he settled back into the seat. They rode in stony silence back to the hotel. Or at least she did. He spent most of the time trying to figure out the best way to get her to spend the day with him and give her the necklace he had stashed in his coat pocket.</p><p>Jesus Christ. He needed to man-up and do the direct approach.</p><p>\u201cCome spend the day with me, out at the Speedway.\u201d He dug into his pocket and pulled out the small box. \u201cWhile we\u2019re there, will you where this for me?\u201d</p><p>Delicately arched brows dipped together as she unwrapped and opened the gift. Her eyes flew to his. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d He bit the side of his lip. \u201cAnd it\u2019s my apology, part two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl could get used to this kind of apologizing.\u201d Melanie glanced down, pulling on the delicate chain nestled within the box. A small hummingbird dangled from the center, diamond, emeralds and sapphires joined together to form its body. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Another first for her, she\u2019d never been given jewelry before. But she felt too silly and too embarrassed to admit it.</p><p>\u201cLet me put it on you.\u201d He took the necklace. She turned to the side, staring out the window as they slowly inched up the driveway to the hotel\u2019s entrance. He brushed her hair to one side, his touch making her shiver.</p><p>The necklace dropped into place against the back of her neck and she whirled to face him. His emerald eyes looked black in the dim interior of the cab. \u201cThank you.\u201d Then she leaned forward, intending on giving him a kiss on the cheek, but he turned at the last minute and their lips met.</p> <p>Neither of them pulled away, so Melanie stayed right where she was, kissing him and letting her hands steal up his chest. His tongue teased her lips and she opened her mouth, taking him inside of her.</p><p>Large hands settled on her thighs, but went no further. They stay locked like that, as time seemed to slow down. She focused on him, his taste and smell. How hot and wet he got her just by nibbling on her bottom lip.</p><p>How could something that felt so right be so completely one-sided? How could she ever stop kissing him tonight? Blood pounded in her ears as she let her hand drift down, finding his rock hard length. At least her desire for him wasn\u2019t one-sided.</p><p>She squeezed and he let out a groan, turning his head. \u201cStop...I can\u2019t do this.\u201d But he didn\u2019t push her away, instead he gathered her in his arms and held her close. She didn\u2019t know whether to be flattered or insulted by his rejection.</p><p>Then again he had said can\u2019t, not won\u2019t. Hardly a rejection. \u201cWe need to take things slow, not jump into a relationship like we did before.\u201d</p> <p>Take things slow? If she\u2019d waited any longer for him, she\u2018d be old and gray by the time he came around to her way of thinking. Her head began to hurt. Almost as much as her heart.</p><p>The cab finally made it to the hotel\u2019s main entrance. Reluctant to leave Carter\u2019s embrace, she sat until he finally opened the door.</p><p>Freezing cold air shot inside, making her teeth chatter. She wished she\u2019d worn something a little more weather appropriate.</p><p>\u201cYou looked damned sexy tonight,\u201d he said as he helped her out.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She tugged gently on her necklace. \u201cThank you for this, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me for apologizing.\u201d He looked around, then back at her. \u201cIt would mean a lot if you would spend the day with me tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Letting out a shaky breathe, she smiled. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround noon. I know how much you like sleeping in.\u201d He pressed one last kiss to the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until you get inside. Text me when you\u2019re back in your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I text you after I brush my teeth, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd right after you say your prayers.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she shook her head and shifted from side to side. \u201cThank you again for my present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, sweetheart,\u201d he called out and her heart soared.</p><p>Glancing over her shoulder, she said, \u201cNight, baby doll.\u201d She blew him a kiss, nearly doing a jumpy clap at the heated look on his face.</p><p>Tomorrow would be interesting, to say the least.</p> <p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>After they arrived at the racetrack, Carter had introduced her to his buddies as his good friend, which made her only a little sad. Okay, so if she were being really honest, it made her a lot sad. But seeing him back in his element was a sight to behold. Not even fifteen minutes ago, he had decided to take up Jake on the offer to warm up his car. Or something like that.</p><p>All suited up, Carter strode onto the track.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d She thought that by warming up his car, that they\u2019d go to the place where he hadn\u2019t slammed into the wall. Her knees began to shake.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, he\u2019s impressing his girl,\u201d Jake said with a laugh.</p><p>Carter flipped him off, then turned to Melanie. \u201cWant a turn when I\u2019m done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d The car that waited for him cost more than she\u2019d ever make in a freaking lifetime.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crazy all right.\u201d He gave her a wicked smile and a wink before he put on his helmet and climbed in the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since he\u2019s last driven?\u201d Fear gripped her heart, sinking its razor sharp claws deep. The last race she\u2019d watched, he\u2019d crashed into the wall and she almost fainted. Seeing him lying in the hospital, so pale and helpless when usually he was sun-kissed and heroic, had brought her to her knees. She\u2019d never prayed so hard for God to not take the one she loved away, not since her momma had died.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Jake said, his hazel eyes dancing as if he knew a secret. \u201cCome stand beside me and I\u2019ll help you get through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have to promise to quit holding your breath,\u201d he added.</p><p>Blushing, she exhaled and adjusted her sunglasses. Carter peeled out of his spot like the devil was after him. She whooped when he made the first lap.</p><p>\u201cTold you he\u2019d be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s more than okay, I think.\u201d She held up her hand, shielding her eyes from the afternoon sun.</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d Jake said. She turned a little, keeping one eye on Carter. \u201cI remember you praying for him at the hospital. Not even his ex stayed around to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone does public exhibitions of prayer,\u201d she said, trying to downplay what she\u2019d done, which in the grand scheme of things was not much.</p><p>\u201cYeah and not everyone goes out and parties while the man they love is in a coma for three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop talking about her, else I won\u2019t be able to stop myself from committing a crime of passion the next time I see April,\u201d she said, her tone light and teasing. On the inside, her thoughts were anything but light or teasing. More like dark and murderous.</p><p>\u201cYou know if he wasn\u2019t such a great guy, I\u2019d probably hate him.\u201d Jake reset his stopwatch on his phone.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s effortless with him. He\u2019s a natural, only he doesn\u2019t give a shit like the rest of us\u2014pardon my language, ma\u2019am.\u201d Jake tapped his screen and whistled as Carter zoomed past. \u201cJust shaved a half second off, the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to disagree but I think Carter gives a shit\u201d\u2014She grinned.\u2014\u201cabout racing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, he only hates not being first. Racing cars is an outlet for him. It\u2019s all about the thrill, the sport...not the glory or the money. All that is icing on the cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s really okay with giving all this up?\u201d Jake fiddled with the brim of his baseball cap. \u201cNot everything. He can still be involved without being out there, and he\u2019s got the business sense to do it.\u201d</p><p>A sense of foreboding washed over her, but she shook it off as Carter came roaring into the Pit. He climbed out of the car, pulling off his helmet and tossing it at Jake. His hair was plastered to his forehead. He unzipped his suit, exposing the form-fitting t-shirt underneath that defined his muscular chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a damn good thing you\u2019ve retired.\u201d Jake bumped Carter\u2019s fist with his own. \u201cElse I\u2019d be eating your exhaust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it: You love the taste of my exhaust,\u201d Carter said and Jake punched him in the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOn that note, I\u2019m getting the heck out of dodge. Going to see a woman about a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, bro.\u201d</p><p>Melanie smiled over their exchanged. Carter crooked a finger at her. \u201cGet over here and stroke my ego.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d like to stroke more than his ego, she thought as she ran to him. \u201cThat was amazing! You were amazing and I couldn\u2019t stop cheering for you, once I picked my heart off the asphalt.\u201d</p><p>Trying to hold her at arm\u2019s length, he said, \u201cI\u2019m all dirty and sweaty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d Wrapping her arms around his neck, she hugged him tight. \u201cYou looked good out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as good as you did running to me.\u201d He let her go slowly, his eyes dropping to her breasts. \u201cEveryone else enjoyed the show, too.\u201d Fingering her necklace, he smiled. \u201cThis looks good on you, too.\u201d</p><p>Stepping back, she tucked her hands into the pockets of her jeans and toed a boot on the asphalt. \u201cI slept in it last night.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows, his fingers dipping lower and making her shiver. \u201cThat so? Well, how about you wear that necklace to my house and I\u2019ll cook you dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t live with Leah and Lawton Ambrose for eighteen years and not learn how. It\u2019s a requirement for the boys and the girls. Chaps my ass that Heath\u2019s better than me. Boy can make some mean strawberry and cream crepes.\u201d</p><p>Laughing she laced her fingers with his, walking off the Speedway with him. \u201cWhat about the rest? Wait, I already know. Luke lectures on safety while Logan is the bottomless pit. Evangeline sits back and takes notes and Zoe bosses everyone around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be impressed with that, except for the fact that you practically lived at my house since you were eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, you can know a person for years and not really know about them or their family.\u201d</p><p>He got a faraway look in his eyes. \u201cAin\u2019t that the damn truth.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Carter\u2019s house was nothing like she imagined, mostly because she\u2019d only seen homes like it on MTV Cribs and Southern Living magazine. The foyer had a ceiling that had to be as tall as the house. Her stilettos clicked with every step she took on the white marble floor.</p><p>\u201cNice shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I wore the necklace, too.\u201d And her shortest skirt. The pushup bra seemed to be doing its job as well. Pinning her shoulders, she smiled.</p><p>Carter ran his eyes over her, green turning dark with desire. He cleared his throat and motioned for her to follow him. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it\u2019s big enough for the two of us?\u201d The dining room was bigger than her entire house and could seat at least fifty people. Okay, so maybe she was exaggerating but the room was ginormous.</p><p>\u201cWe can eat in the kitchen, if you want.\u201d</p><p>Letting out a thick sigh, she pretended to consider his offer. \u201cNah, I\u2019ll suck it up and eat in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your sacrifice,\u201d he said with a wry smile. He held out her seat, waiting for her to sit before he wiggled the chair up to the table.</p><p>Her plate was already fixed, with a juicy steak, steaming baked potato and a fresh salad. \u201cDessert\u2019s in the kitchen, so eat all your veggies, Miss Smith.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she picked up her glass of red wine and took a small sip. \u201cYes, sir, Mr. Ambrose.\u201d</p><p>Waving a fork at her, he made a sound of mock disapproval. \u201cDon\u2019t make me punish you for having a sassy mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you go about that?\u201d She put on her best angel face to hide how wicked she wanted to be with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d put it to work singing my praises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoring,\u201d she said with a pout. \u201cI bet you could think of something else for my mouth to do.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dropped to her lips and she could practically see the lust written in them. \u201cHow\u2019s the steak?\u201d</p><p>She almost dropped her fork. The steak?! \u201cFine.\u201d She stabbed a piece and chomped down on it. Chewing the delicious meat, she stared at everything in the room, but him.</p><p>Trying to make small talk was too much to ask of her, mostly because she was too ticked off and\u2014once again\u2014too embarrassed by her shameless mouth.</p><p>Eating the last bite of salad, she pushed back her chair and stood. \u201cThanks for dinner. I\u2019ll help clear the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Carter\u2019s arm shot out, grabbing her by the wrist. \u201cI have something that needs saying.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well she didn\u2019t want to hear some speech, re-emphasizing how they needed to take things slow. Or at all. \u201cMy steak was great, the meal was great. Everything was so great that I\u2019m too full to eat dessert,\u201d she said, smoothing her skirt down. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to drive me back to the hotel. I\u2019ll text the driver I used last night. He was great.\u201d If she said great one more time, she would stab herself in the hand with her own fork as punishment.</p><p>\u201cI thought it best if we were to go back to being friends.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did. She closed her eyes, tears threatening to fall. \u201cYeah, I guess that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t do it, sweetheart.\u201d His chair scraped back and she felt the heat of him as he came to stand behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. I can\u2019t stand idly by, watching other men talk to you. I know what they\u2019re thinking, what they\u2019re seeing and what they want, because I\u2019m feeling the exact same way.\u201d One of his hands slid around and up, cupping her breast. His free hand joined in, going to the small buttons of her shirt and slowly freeing each one. \u201cI want you in my bed. I want to hear those breathy sighs while my cock is in you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched and her eyes opened. \u201cCarter...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you want that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you in me,\u201d she said, arching against him and rubbing her bottom against his erection.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you say the sexiest things.\u201d</p><p>She shoved the plates away from her. \u201cRight here is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here is great.\u201d He pushed her down on the table and flipped up her skirt. She heard his zipper being pulled down, then the sound of foil ripping. \u201cFuck me. Who bought you these?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Guess he liked the lace thong. \u201cI did while I was out shopping yesterday. Someone who shall remain nameless, so as to not gross you out, recommended the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dick thanks you for that.\u201d Carter slipped his hand beneath the edge of them, finding her wet. \u201cAlways like this for me... so wet and hot.\u201d He thrust two fingers inside of her and curled them, making her hips jerk back. For long minutes, he tortured her like that, keeping her on the edge of release as she begged for him to make her come.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put your cock where your hand is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat mouth of yours is going to get you in trouble one day, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope you\u2019re the one that punishes me.\u201d</p><p>In one smooth motion, he shoved her panties to one side and thrust deep. \u201cHell, yes.\u201d Her tight heat sucked him in, muscles clamping down on him so hard that he groaned at the pleasure. Pleasure built as he rocked into her. \u201cDamn, I love fucking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d she said on a moan, her hips pushing back.</p><p>Relentless, he sought to drive himself deep. So deep that she\u2019d forever be marked by him, that no other man would ever come close to touching what they had. Only that was the problem. He didn\u2019t want her with another man. Some faceless, nameless man who would feel and see her like this, so vulnerable and at his mercy, because she\u2019d allowed it.</p> <p>Pulling out, he turned her around and lifted her, driving into her once more. He walked forward, until her back hit the door to the kitchen. \u201cLook at me.\u201d Chocolate eyes glazed with desire and passion gazed into his. \u201cNever gonna be this good with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>She tightened her thighs around him. \u201cOnly you...I only want you inside of me. Forever.\u201d</p><p>He wanted that to and it should have scared him shitless. Her words stripped him bare, until only a fierce desire to possess her remained.</p><p>\u201cOnly me,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He took her mouth then, tongue tangling as he sank inside of her. Deeper than he ever thought possible, until she twisted her hips and he slid the smallest of distances. But it was enough to send him into a frenzy.</p><p>Caught up in a fever, he fucked her like his life depended on how good she came. Slipping a hand between them, he pinched her clit and she cried out. Her body seized up and her inner walls began to milk him.</p> <p>Tearing his mouth away, he watched as she went over the edge, calling out his name. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he murmured, but his enthrallment didn\u2019t last long, because in his next heartbeat he poured himself inside of her.</p><p>\u201cMelanie...fuck,\u201d he panted, holding himself completely still inside of her while she throbbed and pulsated around him. She kissed his throat and jaw, her sweet breath fanning over his sensitive skin. He let her legs slide to the floor, then claimed her mouth in a long kiss. Something hot and sweet washed over him as the tips of her fingers touched his face.</p><p>He leaned back to get a good look at her. At her flushed face and tousled curls. At the emotion shining clearly in her dark eyes.</p><p>And he was done. Forget done. He was worthless. No good for anyone but her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go back to the hotel. Spend the night with me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want you with me.\u201d Who was he kidding? He needed her with him. Always.</p><p>He loved this woman.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you, too.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he considered telling her, but he wasn\u2019t completely confident that she felt the same. Coward that he was, he kept it to himself.</p> <p>Then again, he could show her how much he loved her.</p><p>Sweeping her up in his arms, he carried her to his bedroom, laid her on the bed and stripped off her clothes. \u201cI\u2019m a lucky man, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she caressed the side of his face and he leaned into her hand. \u201cYou sure are.\u201d</p><p>Damn, but he loved it when she was confident and sassy, saying whatever she thought. \u201cWhere should I start first? So many, many options\u201d He pressed a kiss on her neck, then nibbled a path up to her jaw, his hand memorizing the contours of her body. Where she dipped and curved in hot degrees that he wanted block off for every man that wasn\u2019t him.</p><p>She trembled beneath his touch, her sexy body and beautiful face filling with color. Dark pink lips parted, her tongue slipping out to lick at her bottom lip. The hummingbird pendant gleamed against her skin, right where her pulse fluttered out of control.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>And like every good southern boy should, he followed her orders with a polite \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d. However, what he felt like doing to her was beyond polite.</p><p>He kissed her until he couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t see straight or even want to know his name. Their tongues glided together, slipping and sliding...curling around the other. But it wasn\u2019t enough, not by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cIn a little while,\u201d he said between kisses. Only merely kissing the sexy woman lying beneath him was like only wanting to come in second at a qualifying race.</p><p>So he worshipped her with his mouth, licking and teasing her nipples until she dug her hands in his hair. Kissing his way down her stomach was no hardship at all and when he parted her, he groaned at the sight of her pink, wet flesh.</p><p>He\u2019d planned on this being all about her pleasure. But as he tasted her and his cock grew hard, he couldn\u2019t help but crawl up her body and put her gorgeous legs over his arms.</p><p>\u201cI need you, with nothing between us.\u201d Rubbing the head of his dick against her wet heat, he said, \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me back.\u201d Then she bent her legs and he sank inside. His eyes watered at the pleasure. He watched her breasts bounce as he began to move. Dipping his head, he caught a hard nipple in his mouth and sucked.</p><p>She whimpered and moaned, did all those things he loved to hear and feel. Her nails raked down his back and he hissed. Faster and harder he pounded into her, until he had to lower his arms on the bed and pin her to it with his lower body.</p><p>Her first orgasm made her entire body flush pink.</p><p>He ground down on her. \u201cAgain, baby.\u201d</p><p>Blonde curls went everywhere as she shook her head. \u201cCan\u2019t...oh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. Think about me pushing my cock in that tight pussy of yours, stretching and filling you,\u201d he whispered in her ear, then bit down on the lobe.</p><p>Her body bowed, almost bucking him off as she screamed. He joined her then, hot walls clenching at him, scalding him. He slumped over her, vaguely aware of her hands coasting down his back.</p><p>Rolling off of her, he took her with him and ran his hand down her side. He couldn\u2019t stop touching her. He couldn\u2019t get enough of her. Everything about right now was perfect.</p><p>She was perfect and warm and soft in his arms. In his bed.</p><p>She\u2019d fit perfect in his life. But he couldn\u2019t just up and say that. No, that would be too easy. Instead he\u2019d think of something better. Something that would show her he was serious. Telling a woman you loved her was serious business after all, and required the ultimate in dating moves.</p><p>\u201cOkay in there?\u201d he asked, kissing her drowsy eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worn me out,\u201d she said, her voice shaky sounding to her ears. That had been...she still couldn\u2019t think of the right word. Maybe mind-altering or life-changing. Solidifying the fact that she was in love with him. And he\u2019d never return that. Sure, he felt desire for her. Sure, he felt a duty to apologize, because he was a nice guy and that\u2019s what nice guys did when they hurt a woman\u2019s feelings.</p><p>But this...the way he\u2019d held her, kissed her, and had looked at her. This was going to kill her and no amount of flowers or jewelry would bring her back to life.</p><p>Then he said the thing that shocked and scared her the most. \u201cI think it\u2019s time you took me home to meet Louis. In fact tomorrow would be a great day for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you already know my dad,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cNot in this capacity,\u201d he disagreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still upset with him, so...I\u2019d rather not.\u201d Besides, Louis wouldn\u2019t be home. He\u2019d be out spending his newfound riches at the nearest casino.</p><p>Carter rubbed her shoulder. \u201cI could give you the mon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was embarrassing enough that he knew Louis had cleaned out her bank account. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Then tomorrow you\u2019re eating Sunday dinner at my parents\u2019 house, but not as Zoe\u2019s best friend.\u201d Okay make meeting her daddy the second most shocking and scary thing ever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Zoe won\u2019t be mad at me too long for forgiving you,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201d Grasping her chin, he lifted it and looked her right in the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going as my date and there\u2019s no way you getting out it. Hell, I\u2019ll make sure we sit together at church tomorrow, and I\u2019m holding your hand during the service, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your momma?\u201d she croaked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old to hold her hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure Louis would punch me in the throat if I tried holding his.\u201d</p><p>She let out a weak laugh, then closed her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me worry about that.\u201d He brushed a kiss on her lips. \u201cNight, Melanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Carter.\u201d</p><p>Soon he was snoring softly while she stared at the wall. He\u2019d lost his mind. She\u2019d screwed it right out of him. His momma was going to kill her.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Melanie couldn\u2019t go to hell for having erotic thoughts in church could she?</p><p>Not only had Carter held her hand as they walked in the sanctuary, he\u2019d also put his arm around her as soon as they sat with his family. Presently, he was lazily gliding his fingers back and forth along the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to get you alone,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cThat modest little dress of yours is driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>Leah Ambrose shot daggers at Melanie with her eyes while her thin lips held an even thinner smile. Melanie pointed at Carter. He was the one doing the talking not her. He was the one making her think of last night...and this morning. He had decided to conserve water by showering with her, which had led to her ridding him like a cowgirl on his shower bench.</p><p>Only falling asleep right after take-off on the plane ride home had kept them from joining the Mile-High Club.</p><p>She blushed and scooted over a little from Carter. He pulled her right back into place.</p><p>Melanie swore she heard Leah growl at her.</p><p>It was a good thing Leah had strong objections to violence, but that might not stop Carter\u2019s momma from maiming her, or from his ex\u2014who was still in Holland Springs and looking all virginal sitting on the pew wearing white\u2014helping her.</p><p>Melanie rolled her eyes and heard Leah gasp. Great. Now Melanie had confirmed what that woman thought of her. She was a pure heathen.</p><p>Thankfully, the pastor had everyone close their eyes and bow their heads as he prayed. As soon as he was done, she shot to her feet and tried to high-tail it out of there, but Carter laced his fingers through hers.</p><p>\u201cSlow up.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cI want to enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your momma and April having un-Christian thoughts about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanie, ignore them,\u201d he said, his green eyes gleaming with amusement. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m enjoying having the prettiest girl in Holland Springs by my side today.\u201d</p><p>Her heart did a little flip, didn\u2019t stick the landing and fell to her toes. But she tried to play it off as they walked outside. \u201cAre you sweet on me, Carter Ambrose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019d rather be in you.\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at church,\u201d Melanie gasped, looking around to see if anyone overheard.</p><p>Tilting his head to one side, he shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re in the parking lot.\u201d Opening her door, he helped her inside and shut the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cAnd since someone made us late, we\u2019re in overflow parking,\u201d he added as he got in and started up the car. \u201cSo I can talk as sinful as I want.\u201d</p><p>He was hopeless. \u201cGood grief,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cKeep that up and we\u2019ll be late to Sunday dinner.\u201d He pushed up the hem of her dress, exposing the thigh highs she\u2019d put on this morning under his very lusty eyes. As soon as they hit Juniper Street, he tugged on the top of her lingerie. \u201cI plan on fucking you tonight while you wear these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cI waited until we weren\u2019t on holy ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what I can.\u201d He slid his hand higher, until it disappeared under her dress. Large fingers brushed her curls. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing panties?\u201d</p><p>Spreading her thighs a little, she let him get the tip of his finger inside of her. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what ladies do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn if I know.\u201d His finger slid deeper, another joining it. He pulled them out, then shoved them back in.</p><p>\u201cOh God...yes,\u201d she said on a groan.</p><p>The sound of her arousal filled the interior of the car. She grabbed the door, her hips jumping. Again he pulled his fingers all the way out, but this time, instead of pushing them back inside, filling her where she was empty, he put them to his mouth and sucked the wetness off his skin.</p><p>Turning off the main road, he went down a dirt path, until nothing but woods surrounded them. \u201cGet over here,\u201d he said, his eyes darkening as he cut off the engine.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he added when she didn\u2019t move right away.</p><p>Taking off her seatbelt she scrambled across the bucket seat and into his lap. \u201cTurn around and face the front. Hands at ten and two.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she obeyed him, he pulled down his zipper and moved her dress out of the way. Another adjustment and he lifted her up, shoving his cock deep inside of her. \u201cHell, yes.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her hips, his hands on her breasts, pinching her nipples through the material. \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, but you make me hot,\u201d he said, his hands coming to rest on her hips and helping her find a rhythm. \u201cThat\u2019s it...ride my cock, baby. Love watching you take it.\u201d He smacked her bottom. \u201cThis ass of yours, always shaking it at me, like I wouldn\u2019t notice...think you\u2019ll let me fuck you there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she moaned, her movements frantic now. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>He thrust so hard inside of her that she could practically taste him. \u201cTrent do that with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014no, no one.\u201d Trent was the last person she wanted to talk or even think about right now.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care really,\u201d he said, his teeth scraping at her neck. \u201cJust want to be the last one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d If she had her way and wishes came true, then he\u2019d be her last everything. But what a man said during sex and what he actually meant were always two different things.</p> <p>Always.</p><p>He found her swollen clit, his fingers doing things that had sobbing his name and digging her feet into the floor mats. \u201cCome for me, Melanie,\u201d he said.</p><p>Concentrating on nothing but his hands and cock, she let the pleasure build. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop,\u201d she chanted.</p><p>His breath was harsh in her ears, the hand on her hip holding her so tight that she knew there\u2019d be bruises later. The belt he\u2019d worn dug into her bottom as he moved beneath her, faster and harder until the entire car creaked with their movements.</p><p>\u201cWatch me fill you.\u201d Leaning against him, she pulled up her dress and did exactly that. She watched as his cock disappeared inside of her, hitting her in all the right places. She couldn\u2019t stop watching.</p><p>He shoved the neckline of her dress down, until her breasts popped out. The little bit of lace covering them seemed to inflame him further. \u201cNeed those in my hands.\u201d He tweaked her nipples, making them ache for more. For his mouth and tongue and teeth. \u201cRub that swollen clit of yours.\u201d</p> <p>Boldly she touched herself, rubbing and pressing in the exactly the way that would make her come the fastest. \u201cAre...you watching...too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes. I don\u2019t know where to look,\u201d he said, nipped at her shoulder. \u201cSpread your legs wider, I need to be deeper.\u201d</p><p>Widening her thighs, he went so deep that she jolted at the invasion. \u201cUgn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect...so fucking perfect with you.\u201d He tugged on her nipples, sending a bolt of pleasure and lust right to where she throbbed and ached. To where everything centered.</p><p>To where, just like their first kiss, everything was him. All she breathed, tasted and wanted was Carter. The first sparks of her orgasm made her shake and tremble.</p><p>\u201cCome for me.\u201d Then he bit her neck and she came so hard that she screamed and saw stars. Another thrust, then a second and a third, and he joined her, groaning against her back.</p><p>When they had both fallen back to earth, he helped her clean up between kisses. His touch was so gentle that she wanted to cry.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201d he asked softly. He brushed a strand of hair out of her face and kissed her cheek.</p> <p>Love me, she wanted to say. Just love me. Instead she lowered her forehead to his chin and said, \u201cYou have to tell your momma why we\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cI swear, we almost started without the two of you,\u201d Leah said as Melanie and Carter walked in.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Ms. Leah,\u201d Melanie said, gripping his hand so tight that it almost hurt.</p><p>\u201cWe had a little car trouble, momma,\u201d Carter said, leaning in to kiss Leah\u2019s cheek. Yeah, that should work. Especially since his mother classified any car not made in the last five years as old.</p><p>April narrow her blue eyes at him. \u201cThought all of Chase\u2019s cars were in great shape.\u201d</p><p>Guess it wouldn\u2019t be too gentlemanly of him to say something along the lines of \u2018You should know since you fucked Chase in all of them\u2019? \u201cIs that your professional opinion?\u201d</p><p>Melanie loosened her fingers from his grip and walked to the next room. He almost went after her, until he heard her speaking in low tones to Zoe.</p><p>Leah passed him the plate of roast beef. \u201cSet this on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d He moved to the dining room and set it in the middle of the table. Turning to head back into the kitchen he almost smacked into April.</p><p>\u201cOffer still stands, Carter,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cStill not interested.\u201d He side-stepped her and moved into the kitchen. \u201cAnything else I need to carry in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKey Lime pie.\u201d Leah handed him the pie plate and pie cutter.</p><p>\u201cBut the only person who likes this is Melanie,\u201d he said, his brow furrowing. He hated the taste of lime, unless it was in the neck of a Corona. Or on Melanie\u2019s tongue. He smiled.</p><p>Leah raised her cobalt blue eyes, studying him. Heat rose up his neck and he pulled at the collar of his shirt. \u201cAnd your point?\u201d she asked, then she passed him a plate of blueberry cobbler. April\u2019s favorite. Was this to show him how compatible he and April were because their taste buds were similar? Color him confused as hell. \u201cSet this on the hutch, please.\u201d</p><p>Once he set the desserts on the hutch, everyone seemed to file in the dining room at the same time, even his aunt and uncle were there. Although, they weren\u2019t looking too happy about being seated by one another.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s everyone else?\u201d Carter ticked his chin up at Melanie and pulled out a chair for her. A sweet smile lit up her face and she started forward.</p><p>\u201cBaseball practice and job obligations, bless their hearts.\u201d Leah cleared her throat. \u201cI thought it might be fun to have place cards at the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYippee,\u201d his baby sister Evangeline said, twisting her fingers in the necklace at her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d Lawton asked, making his wife smile wider. Oh yeah, his dad was in for it now. That smile had been known to make grown men quiver in their boots.</p><p>\u201cBecause April suggested it.\u201d Leah held one up. \u201cShe handmade each one. Don\u2019t you think they\u2019re pretty, Raylene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGorgeous.\u201d Carter\u2019s aunt glanced at Leah, then at the table. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll be sitting between my favorite nieces.\u201d She cast her gaze at April. \u201cDid you decide where everyone will be?\u201d</p><p>April smiled like the Cheshire cat. \u201cI did.\u201d Suddenly she gasped and a little frown marred her forehead. \u201cI forgot about you, Missy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Melanie.\u201d Carter could have sworn he heard Melanie\u2019s teeth grind together.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Miranda.\u201d April gestured to the kitchen. \u201cYou can always sit at the kids\u2019 table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a kids\u2019 table,\u201d Zoe snapped, then turned to Melanie. \u201cYou can sit beside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sitting with me,\u201d Carter said, putting his arm around Melanie\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cEnough drama.\u201d Leah threw her hands up in the air. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Silence descended upon the room as everyone found a seat and began to pass around plates of food.</p><p>\u201cRaylene!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the\u2014\u201d Carter\u2019s dad stood, moving to the window and parting the lacey curtains. \u201cOh good Lord...I\u2019m eating in the other room.\u201d Lawton picked up his plate, silverware and drink and left the dining room.</p><p>\u201cRaylene! It\u2019s me, Louis.\u201d</p><p>All eyes turned to Carter\u2019s aunt. Her fork was frozen in the air, halfway to her mouth. Then those same pairs of eyes found Melanie.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you pay the man?\u201d John asked.</p><p>Melanie inwardly cringed. Please make him go away, she prayed, or at least make Carter\u2019s Uncle John keep believing that was exactly why her daddy was here.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re in there, sugar,\u201d Louis shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t take him back. I know we had words but I didn\u2019t mean it. C\u2019mon and give me another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother what?\u201d John asked, his face turning dark.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Melanie whispered, looking down at her plate. Her face had to be red as a firecracker.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving you, John,\u201d Raylene announced, placing her fork on the table.</p><p>\u201cFor him?\u201d John jerked his thumb at the window.</p><p>Raylene slowly rose to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m not happy here, John. Not with you or him.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI want out of this marriage and this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaylene,\u201d Louis shouted again, and Carter\u2019s aunt shook her head, stomping out of the room. John followed her, the door slamming behind him.</p><p>\u201cRoast anyone?\u201d Leah asked, a bright smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d everyone seemed to say at once.</p><p>Carter\u2019s mother stood. \u201cI need to get...well, something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you, Mrs. Ambrose.\u201d April hurried after her.</p><p>Oh goody, Melanie thought with a grim smile. Now the two of them would spend the next thirty minutes talking about her and her daddy, with lots of bless their hearts thrown in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go check on Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>As soon as his sisters were out of sight, Carter turned to Melanie. \u201cYou knew about this?\u201d Carter asked, his tone more than accusing. He sounded down-right pissed.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was anyone\u2019s business.\u201d And she\u2019d been ashamed as hell.</p><p>He threw his napkin down. \u201cYour dad is messing around with my aunt, my married aunt, and somehow that\u2019s not anyone in this room\u2019s business?\u201d Leaning back in his chair, his jaw worked.</p><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to say? Pass me the gravy and oh by the way, my dad\u2019s been sleeping with your married aunt. Besides, he didn\u2019t mess around with Raylene all by his lonesome. From what I understand she\u2019s a willing partner in all this,\u201d Melanie snapped. She hated this, hated defending her dad. Especially to Carter of all people.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you,\u201d she said, smacking her hand on the table. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie by omission is still a lie,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing I\u2019d thought you\u2019d never do to me. Ever. That\u2019s a deal breaker for me, Melanie, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Melanie choked back a sob of fury and helplessness, wishing she was anywhere but here. Wishing she hadn\u2019t gone with him to Charlotte, wishing she\u2019d never tried to make Carter see her as anything but his sister\u2019s pain the ass best friend.</p><p>At least if she had, then she would always wonder what would happen between them, instead of knowing for sure. And for sure, this was it for them.</p><p>\u201cHow could you help break up a marriage, Melanie?\u201d April cried as she walked back in the dining room, with Leah hot on her heels.</p><p>Now that witch got her name right? \u201cI give up; you tell me how I helped,\u201d Melanie snapped.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it enough that you\u2019re keeping the father of my child from marrying me?\u201d Melanie noticed how silent Carter stayed. How he didn\u2019t say a dang thing while April kept running her mouth. His silence was damning.</p><p>Leah let out a gasp, dramatic as usual, but this time Melanie couldn\u2019t blame her. \u201cCarter Mason Ambrose, how could you keep this from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe speaks,\u201d Melanie muttered, crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cWhat other magic trick can you perform?\u201d</p><p>Carter gave her a look, then turned his attention back to the two women staring at her accusingly.</p><p>Leah looked from April to Carter, the back at April. \u201cSo you\u2019re not pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s pregnant alright but it\u2019s not his,\u201d Melanie said. No way in hell she let that poor excuse of a woman try to pin anything on her or Carter. No matter how mad she was at him right at this moment.</p><p>Tears filled April\u2019s eyes and Melanie struggled not to roll hers. The woman was a better actress than the one who\u2019d won an Oscar last year. \u201cYou actually believed him?\u201dApril asked on a sob.</p><p>Melanie blinked. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her the truth, Carter,\u201d April demanded.</p><p>Carter looked at Melanie. Anger made his eyes dark, almost black in the light. She wasn\u2019t sure if his anger was only directed at her or at the two women who had lied to him. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant and I\u2019m not the father.\u201d</p><p>A little high-pitched sob left April\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhy would you lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Lord, I need to call a prayer circle.\u201d Leah placed a hand on her forehead. \u201cCome get me when y\u2019all figure out if I\u2019m going to be a grandmother or not,\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>Miraculously, April\u2019s tears dried up and she smirked. \u201cThink that was fun? Just wait until the press finds out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s these things called paternity tests,\u201d Carter said, leaning forward. \u201cI\u2019m completely willing to take about a hundred of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but in the meantime...\u201d April drew little circles on the tablecloth. \u201cSure will be hard living in Charlotte with all this hovering over you. Can\u2019t imagine many of daddy\u2019s friends will give you much business in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe success of my business doesn\u2019t depend on your daddy\u2019s friends,\u201d Carter said, his jaw clenched. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019ll be hanging out with your friends in Charlotte? Give me a break.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>April huffed and flounced away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve decided to move to Charlotte?\u201dMelanie asked, her heart racing. Carter really was leaving and without her. Not that she\u2019d thought he take her with him. She\u2019d actually had thought he might stay here, because of her.</p><p>Dark green eyes swung back to her. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did she know and not me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApril must have overheard my conversation with Jake on Friday night.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cShe followed us to Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, but she does live there. I\u2019d planned on talking to you about that Saturday night, but we got a little sidetracked.\u201d He drilled his fingers on the table. \u201cNow the cat\u2019s out of the bag, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great news. I know you\u2019ve missed it. And your friends. Holland Springs can\u2019t compare, I bet. That\u2019s just great.\u201d Oh God, now she sounded like a rambling fool, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself. \u201cCharlotte will be great for you and your business.\u201d Could she stop saying everything was great, because it wasn\u2019t and someone had taken her fork so she couldn\u2019t stab herself in the hand. Everything was horrible and heart-breaking, and everything she knew it would be.</p> <p>Confusion filled his sexy eyes. \u201cIt will?\u201d</p><p>She shot to her feet, overturning her chair. \u201cI need to go home.\u201d Could this get more humiliating? Bending down to right it, Carter stopped her with a hand on her elbow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d he said, picking up the chair and sliding it under the table.</p><p>Moving to the window, she wavered between looking out of it and escaping through it. Only April seeing her leave so undignified made her keep her feet firmly in the dining room.</p><p>Carter joined her. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a ride, clear our heads and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said as tears gathered in her throat. \u201cI\u2019ll ride with my dad, assuming he\u2019s fit to drive. If not, I\u2019ll drive.\u201d She would be good at it, too, because Carter had been the one to help learn to drive stick again. Another slice to the heart.</p> <p>Pressing a kiss to her forehead, he bent his knees a bit to look her in the eyes. \u201cGuess tonight wouldn\u2019t be the best night to come by, with your dad and all. How about tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>There was no reason at all to string this along. He only wanted to do the right thing by letting her down gently. Look at what April had said and done, and not one time had he embarrassed his ex or even called her names. He never resorted to that, only stuck with the truth of the situation and let it speak for him.</p><p>God, he was so perfect for her, for any woman that longed for a real man.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be busy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>A grin kicked up the corners of his mouth. \u201cJack needs his best waitress, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Carter.\u201d She glanced away, her shoulders beginning to shake. \u201cI think it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t come by at all. Ever.\u201d</p><p>His arms came around her then. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Melanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no this, no us.\u201d She shrugged out of his hold. \u201cNever was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d He clenched his hands at his side. \u201cAfter this weekend, after\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201dshe asked, then took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m not the kind of girl that gets taken home to meet the parents.\u201d Even though Carter had done exactly that. \u201cGirls like me get taken to bars, the beach and occasionally a chain restaurant for a special dinner. Girls like me never get Prince Charming, because his car never ever stops at the town\u2019s trailer park.\u201d Even though Carter had come to her house more times than she could count. \u201cHe never comes to where we work and sweeps us off of our feet like in that Richard Gere movie. But our dumbasses keep waiting for him to show up anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, you said my lie by omission was a deal breaker for you,\u201d she added.</p><p>For long minutes, it seemed, he stared at her, like she\u2019d grown another head. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet at the same time, so completely wrong.\u201d He turned away from her, hands clenching into tight fists. There was a tic in his jaw. \u201cGo home Melanie. I\u2019ll text you later this week\u2014maybe you\u2019ll be in a better frame of mind and willing to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. At his strong back and broad shoulders. At his clothes that cost more than what she made in tips in a month. Then she took a good look at his parents\u2019 house, the house he\u2019d grown up in. Everything belonged to them. No one would be banging on their door in the middle of the night, evicting them. It personified security.</p><p>It screamed for her to get out. They were from two very different worlds and no matter how many times their paths crossed, it wouldn\u2019t change things.</p><p>Her little impromptu speech had made sure of it. She\u2019d accused him of being some hypocritical, rich frat-boy type who, when he had nothing better to do, slummed with her while no one was looking.</p><p>\u201cGood bye, Carter,\u201d she said, walking out of the dining room and to the front door. She passed April and Leah along the way, huddled in the family room and whispering.</p><p>Zoe intercepted her at the door, green eyes so like her brother\u2019s. A fresh wave of tears threatened to fall. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Back to where she belonged. \u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Zoe asked and Melanie knew her best friend wouldn\u2019t stop until she got an answer that made sense. Only problem: Nothing made sense to Melanie.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here. Carter\u2019s moving to Charlotte for good. Oh but he\u2019ll visit for holidays.\u201d Melanie wiped under her eye with a knuckle. \u201cWho knows when you\u2019ll move again, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever again. Memaw\u2019s old house needs so much work, and I don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d Zoe said, her eyes watery. \u201cBesides, I can\u2019t leave you. You\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Melanie hugged her tight. Sniffing, Melanie let go of Zoe and put her hand on the door knob. She could hear her dad pleading with Raylene to talk to him. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to take my Aunt Bethany up on her offer to come work for her at the Crab Shack. Just last week, she said it wasn\u2019t healthy for me to keep living with Louis, that I needed to spread my wings and maybe even try for college again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours isn\u2019t that far away,\u201d Zoe said with a sad smile, then her expression turned fierce. \u201cBut I\u2019m still going to give my jerk of a brother a piece of my mind.\u201d</p><p>Trust her best friend to take her side, no matter what. \u201cDon\u2019t go too hard on him. I\u2019m the one who ended whatever it was we had.\u201d</p><p>Zoe blinked. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d Carter appeared in her line of vision and she swallowed. \u201cI really need to go. Text me later, okay?\u201d</p><p>Glancing over her shoulder, a knowing look covered Zoe\u2019s face as she turned back. \u201cGot it. Let me know if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Melanie promised, panic setting in as Carter began to walk their way. She wrenched open the door and flew outside, stopping by her dad. \u201cIt\u2019s time to leave, Louis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until Raylene talks to me,\u201d he said, dropping to his knees beside the car that Raylene currently occupied with her husband. Louis\u2019 truck was parked in the way, making it impossible for them to back out.</p><p>White hot fury rose inside of Melanie, roaring like a tornado about to do major damage to everything in its path. She grabbed Louis by the arm, pulling him up. \u201cYou\u2019re making a scene and embarrassing yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a man in love, fighting for my woman.\u201d Oh my God, her dad was drunk off his ass. Looking around she saw Carter standing on the porch, his arms crossed as he stared at them. Fury gave way to mortification. Her body ran hot then cold and back to boiling as her cheeks heated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had about all I can take today,\u201d she said, her voice not as firm as she wanted it to be. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to wake Louis up. He blinked and ran a hand through his wild hair. \u201cSorry, sugar.\u201d He held out his hand. For a moment, she looked at it. Louis had stolen from her and his choices made her cringe and want to hide, but he was still her daddy. And he\u2019d always taken care of her the best way he knew how.</p><p>She took his hand and squeezed, smiling up at him.</p><p>\u201cReady to go home, hummingbird?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>Louis stumbled. \u201cYou can drive stick again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter taught me how.\u201d</p><p>Her dad grunted. \u201cIsn\u2019t that something?\u201d She had thought so. Still did if she was being honest.</p><p>Together they walked to his truck and got in. As she drove down the long dirt road, Melanie couldn\u2019t help but feel that she\u2019d left of piece of her heart behind.</p><p>Who was she kidding? She\u2019d given Carter her whole heart years ago.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>For a long time, Carter stood on the front porch, staring after tail lights that he could no longer see.</p><p>She\u2019d left him, not even given him time to explain. Yes, he\u2019d been mad, but mostly at the morons for screwing up a marriage and bringing everyone else into their misery. The rest of his fury had been divided between her not trusting him with the truth and him not being trustworthy enough for her to confide in.</p><p>April Billingsworth didn\u2019t deserve to have an emotional response from him. Or a conversational one. She sure as hell didn\u2019t deserve to be in the same room, breathing the same air as Melanie either. But honestly, if he said all that, he\u2019d only look like a jerk. Besides, Melanie could take care of herself, with that sassy mouth of hers.</p><p>A sassy mouth that he wasn\u2019t too sure would be kissing him anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cComing inside?\u201d Zoe asked from the doorway.</p><p>Hell, no. \u201cNot while April\u2019s still here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Zoe grinned, all mischievous and knowing. There was the sister he\u2019d missed seeing. \u201cI think she\u2019s worn out her welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only woman who\u2019s ever measured up to our mother\u2019s standard\u2014fat chance of that happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you didn\u2019t hear the little talk momma had with April.\u201d Zoe laughed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not upset at the lack of a grandchild?\u201d He did not relish the thought of having that kind of talk with his mother.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s more upset at being taken advantage of by April,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cBut momma said would pray for April\u2014bless her lying heart.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the door opened and April came storming out, suitcase in hand and cursing a mile a minute. Not bothering to say good-bye to him (which suited Carter just fine) or Zoe, she got in her BMW and squalled tires.</p><p>\u201cOh man, I didn\u2019t get to do the obligatory \u2018Y\u2019all come back now\u2019.\u201d He thumped his chest with his fist. \u201cHurts so bad.\u201d</p><p>His sister snorted, then joined him at the porch railing and leaned against his shoulder. \u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he echoed, waiting for her to bless him out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshat, Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I am,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd you need to go after Melanie, but not right now. Give her time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold her I\u2019d be texting her later this week.\u201d</p><p>Zoe sighed. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say that you also told her she needed to be in a better frame of mind and willing to actually listen to you?\u201d</p><p>Ears growing hot, he gripped the railing. \u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, Carter. How could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there when I said that my mouth gets in gear before my brain does.\u201d He sliced his hands through the air. \u201cBut I actually thought I was being nice and for lack of a better word, thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>She slapped a hand over her eyes. \u201cHow can men be so clueless when it comes to a woman\u2019s heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had Melanie\u2019s heart, I\u2019d treat it like the treasure it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that was poetic.\u201d Turning to face his sister, he was surprised to see tears in her eyes. \u201cQuick. Write it down before you forget it. She needs to hear that from you.\u201d</p><p>He tapped his head. \u201cDon\u2019t need to.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t in his brain. The words were written on his heart, signed and ready to be delivered to Melanie.</p><p>Of course, whether or not she threw it out with the junk mail was a whole other matter.</p><p>Carter followed his sister inside, stopping in the kitchen while she went upstairs. His dad stood at the sink, rinsing dishes and placing them in the dishwasher.</p><p>Sidling up to him, Carter said, \u201cYou rinse and I\u2019ll load.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, Lawton began handing Carter dishes. They worked in companionable silence, lapsing into a familiar rhythm that gave Carter much needed breathing time. And thinking time.</p><p>\u201cIs this going to be a usual Sunday event?\u201d his dad asked, drying his hands.</p><p>Carter grunted, then closed the dishwasher. \u201cI hope to God it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeant this, not what happened earlier.\u201d Lawton leaned against the counter, arms crossing over his chest. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been around much lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, some of the houseguests you\u2019ve been having lately\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay before then,\u201d his dad said. \u201cLook, it\u2019s a good thing that you\u2019re your own man, making your own decisions, and I\u2019m mighty proud of you.\u201d Carter braced for the \u2018but\u2019. There always was one after any kind of compliment Lawton doled out. It gave balance and didn\u2019t let any of them get too big for their britches, his dad would say. \u201cSometimes you need to remember who\u2019s on the receiving end. Your momma\u2019s not perfect but she means well...and there\u2019s no changing her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMelanie deserved better from you, son. She\u2019s part of our family and you ought not have let her leave like that,\u201d he added.</p><p>Carter felt the dressing-down clear to his toes. It was rare that his dad had an opinion about anyone\u2019s relationship. But what could Carter say? He couldn\u2019t defend himself from the truth.</p><p>Lawton moved past Carter, patting him on the back. \u201cLet\u2019s go watch some football.\u201d</p> <p>Now for that, Carter had the perfect response. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll packed up?\u201d Louis asked as Melanie zipped her suitcase.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she looked around the room, then smiled at her dad. Things weren\u2019t completely resolved between them, but Louis was Louis. What else could she do, besides finally move out. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Her dad didn\u2019t move from the doorway. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be awfully quiet without you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, daddy.\u201d Smiling became downright hard to do. \u201cI bet Mrs. Gregory comes over this afternoon with a lemon pie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod save me,\u201d he muttered, then moved to her bed and picked up the suitcase that had belonged to her mother. \u201cThis all you\u2019re taking?\u201d He motioned to the bed and her large duffle bag.</p><p>\u201cNothing else belongs to me.\u201d Not the dresser, the bed or the nightstand. The mattress had been new, twenty year ago, but her aunt had a bedroom for her. She sighed. All she was doing was trading one rented room for another, but at least Aunt Bethany wouldn\u2019t kick her out.</p><p>Louis thrust out his hand. \u201cThis is what I owe you. I shouldn\u2019t have taken it, stolen it, really, from you.\u201d</p><p>Only her daddy would walk around with almost five thousand dollars in hundreds in his pocket. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, closing his fingers over the roll of cash. \u201cYou might need it.\u201d Besides, her dream of owning the house on Persimmon Lane had been completely destroyed, with her daddy\u2019s actions and Carter moving away. She didn\u2019t want the memories of taking him there, of baring that part of her soul to him.</p><p>Moving to Palm Beach would give her the fresh start she needed. Plus, she\u2019d made an appointment with one of the course advisors at local community college. Something that she was equal parts nervous and excited about doing.</p><p>\u201cThanks, sugar.\u201d He tucked the money into his side pocket just as her cell phone rang. A quick glance told her that it was Carter\u2014again. She frowned and chucked the thing into her purse. \u201cNot easy to leave the one you love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEasier than finding out they don\u2019t love you,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry things didn\u2019t work out with Raylene.\u201d</p><p>Her dad chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar, Melanie Ann.\u201d He walked with her to the living room. \u201cIt was for the best though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to hear it, but think about finding a nice, single woman, like LeeAnne Parks.\u201d She opened the door and followed her dad outside. \u201cLess drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think on it.\u201d But she knew he wouldn\u2019t it. He\u2019d keep doing what he always did: Gambling and chasing married women. Popping open the trunk of her car, he placed her suitcase inside and closed it.</p><p>She hugged her dad one last time, threw her duffle bag in the backseat and got in the car. The last thing she saw in her watery vision was Louis staring after her, his body all dejected. No way she could leave him looking like that.</p><p>Slamming on the breaks, Melanie rolled down the window. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she shouted, and he gave her a thumbs up and a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she said again to her reflection in the rear view. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Only she wasn\u2019t sure who she was trying to convince more: Her dad or herself.</p><p>Melanie blinked at the acceptance letter from Coast Community College. She\u2019d gotten in and would be able to take Introduction to Photography as soon as the second part of the spring semester started.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d Zoe said, sitting on Melanie\u2019s bed. \u201cAre we celebrating or drowning our sorrows tonight?\u201d</p><p>Biting her lip, Melanie glanced up at Zoe. \u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelebrating,\u201d he best friend said in a voice filled with such confidence that it made Melanie thank God she\u2019d ended up in Holland Springs as a little girl.</p><p>Letting out a whoop, Melanie jumped on the bed. \u201cDing, ding, ding. And for your correct answer, you get a night out with me! Complete with dinner and a movie. I was thinking the newest Ian Romanov flick.\u201d She fanned herself. \u201cThat man is so verra, verra hot.\u201d</p><p>Zoe shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s okay, I guess, if you like that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been over this before, you\u2019re allowed to look at other men while dating one. Lust is a perfectly healthy emotion.\u201d Melanie dropped to her knees and stared at her best friend. At Zoe wouldn\u2019t meet her gaze and she sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right...it\u2019s highly illogical to lust after men that don\u2019t exist in our universe. I mean it\u2019s not like we\u2019d ever meet Ian Romanov and he\u2019d fall madly in love with us.\u201d</p><p>Zoe remained silent, her dark eyes downcast as she traced a pattern on the comforter. \u201cA guy like him fall in love with m\u2014us?\u201d She snorted softly. \u201cDifferent woman each week.\u201d</p><p>Rolling on her back, Melanie stared up at the ceiling. \u201cPlease, I\u2019m a certified catch and so are you. Even if you\u2019re already caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are stupid, and so are we for loving them,\u201d Zoe said sharply, completely unlike her usual bubbly and go-with-the-flow self. Joining her on the bed, Zoe grasped Melanie\u2019s hand and they stayed like that for a long time, just lying on their backs and staring at the ceiling while saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not talking about Gabriel, are you?\u201d Melanie asked softly. It dawned on her how much she didn\u2019t know about Zoe\u2019s time in California.</p><p>Zoe sniffed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone you met in Los Angeles?\u201d</p><p>They turned to face each other at the same time, Zoe\u2019s eyes were filled with tears. She nodded, her lower lip trembling. Melanie sighed and tucked a thick lock of hair behind her best friend\u2019s ear. Zoe had been listening to her mope for weeks now, years really, about Carter, and not once had she heard her best friend complain about men in return. Well, nothing beyond, the typical stuff that women usually griped about. But this, this felt more than the usual complaints.</p><p>\u201cDid you go fall in love with some no-good wanna be actor, honey?\u201dMelanie asked.</p><p>Zoe gave a little shrug. \u201cMaybe.\u201d There was so much meaning behind that maybe. So much her best friend was and wasn\u2019t saying, and it broke Melanie\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cNeed to talk to about it?\u201d</p><p>Another shake of the head and Zoe squeezed her hand tight. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll be okay. The words echoed in her ears. Exactly what she had told her Louis and herself as she left Holland Springs. Melanie closed her eyes, then opened them. \u201cI hope that sorry son of a bitch\u2019s dick drops off and he never becomes famous. That he has to be a waiter forever, serving really snotty people that leave really shitty tips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh My God, Mel.\u201d Zoe snorted, then sniffed and giggled. \u201cYou have the foulest mouth sometimes, and I love you for it.\u201d</p><p>Melanie grinned. \u201cHow about we stay in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd watch Persuading My Lady. Ian Romanov\u2019s character dies in it. I brought it with me, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that movie was your favorite because of the dancing and all the nice manners,\u201d Melanie asked, cocking her head to one side. \u201cThe costumes, and the bowing and curtsying to Lord and Lady Pompous Pants.\u201d</p><p>An unholy light gleamed in Zoe\u2019s eyes. \u201cAll that and the rake gets his, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m all for the rake getting his.\u201d Melanie hopped off the bed and fished the DVD out of her bag. She cracked open the case and popped in the movie, turning on the television. \u201cPlus, the rake is very easy on the eyes and the love scenes\u2014\u201cMelanie fanned herself with the empty case, then flung it on her dresser. \u201cOooh, la, la, Ian Romanov. Bet his co-star was one happy girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard he\u2019s horrible in bed and has halitosis,\u201d Zoe said primly.</p><p>Melanie gave her a blank look. \u201cHali-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad breath\u2014I thought you moonlighted as a dental assistant while I was gone. And he\u2019s a horrible kisser, or so the gossip goes.\u201d</p><p>One of the many things she loved about her best friend, Zoe never dumbed things down for her-unless she asked. She just assumed Melanie knew what she was talking about. \u201cDental office assistant. Anyway, I think the gossip you heard is wrong.\u201d The actor appeared on screen and they both sighed in appreciation. \u201cJust look at him!\u201d</p><p>Zoe muttered something, and Melanie tore her eyes away from the screen. \u201cSorry, got all distracted by the mancandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m going to pop some popcorn.\u201d As Zoe left Melanie\u2019s room, she couldn\u2019t help but think her friend was lying, because she could have sworn her friend had said, \u201cHe kisses like a dream come true.\u201d</p><p>Melanie turned her attention back to the movie, studying the man on screen. \u201cNo way,\u201d she whispered. Zoe would never keep a secret about something like that. Like him. If her best friend had fallen in love, with someone who wasn\u2019t Gabriel, she wouldn\u2019t have settled on coming back here and getting engaged.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Because if a woman like Zoe, someone who was educated, smart and from a good family, couldn\u2019t have what she really wanted, then there was no hope for a woman like Melanie.</p><p>She plopped down on the bed and scowled at the sexy grin lighting up her television. Zoe was right. \u201cMen are stupid,\u201d Melanie said. And sometimes, so were the women who loved them.</p><p>God, she missed Carter. But it was for the best that she didn\u2019t answer his calls or texts. He had his plans that didn\u2019t include her. And it was way past time for her to have plans that didn\u2019t include her dad or any man. She had to start living for herself and her dreams.</p><p>All she had to do was fight the loneliness and heartache that seemed to nip at her dreams.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>\u201cMan, you\u2019re in a foul mood,\u201d Beau said after Carter had stripped yet another bolt and had taken it out on him. \u201cMiss Melanie cut you off for good or something?\u201d</p><p>Carter clenched his jaw and threw the wrench into his tool box instead of his employee\u2019s face. \u201cWant to try that again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else I can do, Mr. Ambrose?\u201d Beau wiped his hands with a rag.</p><p>Yeah, Beau could tell Melanie to come by here and pick up her last paycheck. She\u2019d probably listen to that poor, sweet, misunderstood boy. Then Carter could get some face time with her. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time to knock off for the day. You clean up and I\u2019ll get your paycheck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice to be so damn excited about the weekend.\u201d</p><p>Beau gave him a pitying look.\u201cGuess once a guy hits twenty-one, it\u2019s all downhill from there, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s way before then,\u201d Carter said, keeping a straight face as Beau\u2019s drained of color. \u201cMore like eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m turning eighteen this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Carter said with a smile. He strode to his office. Little touches of Melanie were everywhere. She\u2019d hung a string of hearts along the outer-edge of her desk. A vase of roses sat by the coffee maker. He couldn\u2019t step two feet without smelling her. Sitting down in his chair, he pressed his fingers to his temples, then printed out Beau\u2019s check.</p><p>Damn, he missed her. Pulling out his phone, he hesitated over the keyboard.</p><p>Found a new game. Wanna kick my ass?</p><p>Two minutes and no answer later, he yanked open a desk drawer and chunked his phone inside. Apparently, she didn\u2019t miss him.</p><p>He grabbed Beau\u2019s check off the printer and signed it.</p><p>A black truck pulled up to his garage and he stood, moving to the window, the check still in his hand. He frowned. What was he doing here? The moving truck wasn\u2019t scheduled to pick up Chase\u2019s Mustang until next week.</p><p>Chase Montgomery got out of his truck and strode toward the garage, a look of determination on his face. Before Carter could turn, Beau had gotten in Chase\u2019s face and shoved the guy.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Carter muttered before shoving the check in his pocket and racing outside. \u201cBeau!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you? Some kind of stalker?\u201d Beau sneered. \u201cLike I told you before: I don\u2019t want your fucking money or your daddy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not want it, but you\u2019re going to need it,\u201d Chase said, standing firmly in place, but he made no move to stop Beau or retaliate. \u201cIt belongs to you.\u201d To everyone who didn\u2019t know him, Chase looked cool and collected, but to those who had raced against him\u2014that measured tone meant one thing: He was pissed as hell and holding on to his temper by a thread.</p><p>\u201cGive it to charity.\u201d</p><p>Chase cocked an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Montgomery.\u201d Beau charged, fists raised. Carter grabbed him by the collar of his shirt, ripping it, then somehow managed to get his arms around the kid.</p><p>\u201cCut it out,\u201d Carter growled in Beau\u2019s ear.</p><p>Beau struggled against him, panting. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go to jail for assault?\u201d Carter said, keeping one eye on Chase. The man had crossed his arms in front of his chest and for all the world looked bored. Bored. \u201cAnd you\u2014want to tell me why this kid wants to pound you into the ground?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlways thought you were more beauty than brains, Ambrose.\u201d Chase smirked. \u201cGuess I was right.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he should let go of Beau and let the kid kick Chase\u2019s ass. It would be Chase\u2019s word against theirs, and Carter had the hometown advantage. \u201cThat cryptic shit might work on women, but it doesn\u2019t on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re brothers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf-brothers,\u201d Beau muttered.</p><p>Carter looked from Chase, then at Beau. But for the kid\u2019s lip ring, their faces was nearly identical. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d Same color eyes and he\u2019d bet that green dye covered up dark blonde. \u201cSame dad or mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis dad cheated with my mom while she was on leave from Afghanistan. Lying bastard didn\u2019t bother to tell her his real name or that he was married. Didn\u2019t bother coming to her funeral either.\u201d Beau wrenched out of Carter\u2019s grip and stalked inside the garage, calling over his shoulder, \u201cStay the hell away from me.\u201d</p><p>Carter swiped a hand over his face. \u201cSo what\u2019s your version?\u201d</p> <p>Grey eyes turned hard in direct contrast to the casual shrug of shoulders. \u201cYou know Remington.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Carter knew all about Chase\u2019s dad. He was a womanzing son of a bitch that humiliated his wife daily, and publicly announced that Chase would never be one of the greats.\u201cBeau thinks you\u2019re just like him.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s brows lifted. \u201cHe\u2019s not too far off in his assessment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemington wouldn\u2019t be here, and not to be real obvious, but he\u2019s not and you are.\u201d Carter gave him an appraising glance. \u201cYou never struck me as the messenger boy type.\u201d Quasi-buddy or not, old rivalries died hard and any chance Carter could get in a dig, he would. \u201cBut like you said, I\u2019m more beauty than brains.\u201d</p><p>His quasi-buddy\u2019s lips thinned and he let his arms fall. \u201cSpeaking of people not here\u2014where\u2019s your girl?\u201d</p><p>That was a damn good question, and one Carter wanted an answer. But no one seemed inclined to share it with him, not even Zoe. \u201cWhat do you need with Beau?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d Chase\u2019s eyes shifted to a spot over Carter\u2019s shoulder, right where the garage opened and Beau cleaned. \u201cIt\u2019s between us.\u201d</p><p>Carter took three steps, standing toe to toe with Chase. \u201cLeave the kid alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening.\u201d Chase kept his eyes on Beau. \u201cHe\u2019s going to accept what\u2019s owed him, whether he likes it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that strategy been working for you so far?\u201d Instead of answering, Chase pivoted and headed to his truck. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try talking to Beau, instead of shoving what\u2019s owed to him down his throat?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>Chase gave him a one-fingered salute as he opened the door. \u201cLater, Ambrose.\u201d</p><p>Carter shook his head, a small smile playing on his mouth. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way...\u201d\u2014Chase paused, halfway inside his truck\u2014\u201cApril and I hooked up before the two of you got together. She never cheated on you, not that I know about.\u201d Then Chase climbed inside, shutting the door and starting up his vehicle.</p><p>It really didn\u2019t matter to Carter what April might or might not have done, but he appreciated the information. He turned, slowly walking back to the garage. Beau was sweeping the floor, his mouth flat and his brow pinched. Bright green hair stuck out everywhere. Every now and then he\u2019d suck that god-awful lip ring into his mouth. Must run in the family, because Chase had a pierced tongue.</p> <p>Whatever floated people\u2019s boats, he guessed.</p><p>Carter dug the check out of his pocket. \u201cHere\u2019s your check.\u201d</p><p>Beau stopped sweeping long enough to glance at him, grab the check and shove it in his back pocket. \u201cThanks.\u201d He strode to the right side of the garage and hung the broom on a hook, zipped up his jacket and pulled the hood over his head.</p><p>\u201cHave a good weekend.\u201d</p><p>Beau spun around. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me I\u2019m wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking that asshole\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>Carter blew out a breath. \u201cLook, kid, you have to do what\u2019s right for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Stanley says I should take it, because without it, I\u2019ll be stuck here my entire life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad in Holland Springs.\u201d</p><p>Beau snorted. \u201cThen why are you so hell-bent on getting out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Beau shot him a look of disbelief. \u201cOkay, I was, but now I\u2019m not...and I like my hometown. But I also think your uncle\u2019s right. There are a lot of people around here that have never been anywhere.\u201d People like Melanie who had a damn trip jar. His gut clenched. \u201cPeople who would give anything for the money and the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Beau shook his head, his grey eyes clouded. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the money. Remington wants me to come live with them in Forestville. I don\u2019t want to switch schools in the middle of the year again. But I can\u2019t live with Uncle Stanley and his family forever, you know? We had to move because he lost his job, and the one he has now pays a lot less. There are four other kids besides me and we all live in a three bedroom singlewide.\u201d He rubbed the heel of his hand on his forehead. \u201cI hate this. I hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was little and my mom was still alive, Remington used to come around and give me all this NASCAR stuff. It\u2019s his fault I love racing,\u201d Beau added, as if admitting some deep dark secret.</p><p>\u201cHe bought your Sprint car?\u201d Carter asked. Remington had made Chase buy his vehicles, had bragged all the time about making his son to start on the bottom rung in his company.</p><p>Beau shook his head. \u201cTraded my mom\u2019s old Firebird for it. Guy wasn\u2019t interested in racing anymore.\u201d</p><p>The school bus dropped Beau off every afternoon and his uncle picked him up once he got off work. Carter chuckled. \u201cGuess not having a ride makes dating tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me. Girls pick me up,\u201d Beau said with an expression that made him look like Chase\u2019s twin. \u201cSometimes I even let them pay\u2014equal rights and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pussy move and you know it.\u201d Carter crossed his arms. \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford to pay or pick them up, you need to keep your ass at home until you can.\u201d Jesus Christ, someone needed to school this kid on how to treat women. Or girls. Whatever.</p><p>Beau rolled his eyes. \u201cDude, I was yanking your chain. I always pay and I borrow Uncle Stanley\u2019s truck. My mother raised me right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need your own ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if my boss paid me a little more, I could afford one.\u201d Carter pretended to lunge for his employee and he ducked out of the way.</p><p>Laughing, Carter said, \u201cYou\u2019re a little shit, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies love it.\u201d Beau smirked, then his shoulders and that cocky grin dropped. \u201cCarter...I can\u2019t take his money. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking his money doesn\u2019t mean you have to start going to Olan Mills for family portraits, or even family dinners after church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but living with him might.\u201d A ghost of smile flickered on Beau\u2019s face. \u201cSeriously, what would you do?\u201d</p><p>Carter looked off into the distance, allowing his eyes to focus on the parking lot that was missing her car. \u201cI\u2019d figured out what I wanted most in this life, and start down the path that would lead me to it.\u201d</p><p>Carter stood outside of Melanie\u2019s house in the pouring rain, but he didn\u2019t give a damn. For two fucking weeks, he\u2019d given her space. For two fucking weeks, he\u2019d only texted her when necessary, like when he couldn\u2019t find a file he needed. Or when he had wondered if he should get a Twitter account.</p><p>Unfortunately, communication with that stubborn ass woman had only progressed to her answering him via his sister.</p><p>At least he knew she was reading his texts. Yeah, that made it so much better.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want, boy?\u201d Louis growled as he opened the door.</p><p>Carter shielded his eyes from the porch light. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Louis leaned against the doorframe. The television hummed in the background and blue flickering lights were the only illumination in the place. \u201cLike I said the other day, Melanie\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you the first time.\u201d Carter swiped a hand over his face. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what Melanie told you about me and her, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, you\u2019d better carry your ass, before I put my size twelve boot up it.\u201d Louis stepped down. \u201cMrs. Gregory told me about that fancy car of yours being here all night long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI respect your daughter, sir. And I respect your right to kick my ass, but I\u2019m not going until I find out where she is,\u201d Carter said, lifting his chin and bracing for the first punch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to find out a damn thing from me.\u201d Another step down and now the rain fell on Louis. \u201cI know your kind. Take a girl out, sweet talk her, let her drive you car and then knock her up before you leave her high and dry. Only my girl was too smart for you.\u201d</p><p>She was also stubborn as hell, too. But Carter didn\u2019t figure Louis wanted his opinion on the matter. \u201cI get it. Someone took advantage of your cousin or sister or some female relative and I\u2019m real sorry about that. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>Louis shoved him, the strong smell of Jack Daniels invading Carter\u2019s senses. \u201cNot some relative. It was Bobbie Ann and I\u2019m not going to let it happen to her daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean Bobbie Ann\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanie ain\u2019t mine, not by blood anyway.\u201d Louis swayed to one side. \u201cBut I made a promise to look after her. So I did.\u201d</p><p>All this time, people, including Carter, had thought Louis was a no good, shifty loser that couldn\u2019t commit to a radio station. \u201cDoes she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course she does. I don\u2019t keep secrets from her.\u201d</p><p>Well, she sure as hell had kept it from him. Although it really wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business, including his. Especially his. But he wanted it to be. He wanted every little thing about her to be his business. Rain dripped from the roof onto his nose. \u201cSir, I know you don\u2019t like my kind, but I\u2019d like to have a conversation with you. A serious one about your daughter. One that involves me making a promise to you about taking care of her, like a man should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man who respects her should,\u201d he added, just in case Louis got the wrong idea.</p><p>Louis narrowed his eyes at Carter, reminding him so much of Melanie in that moment that he wasn\u2019t sure she wasn\u2019t Louis daughter by blood.</p><p>Finally a smile broke over his face and he clapped Carter on the back. \u201cCome on in, son. Let\u2019s get you dry and have a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis mean you\u2019re going to tell me where Melanie is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all depends on you, son, that all depends on you.\u201d</p><p>The door shut behind Carter.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>It had been almost three weeks since Melanie had last spoken to Carter, but as she entered the town limits of Holland Springs, a fresh wound on her heart exposed itself.</p><p>Years would need to pass before she\u2019d be able to get over him. Maybe more if he didn\u2019t stop trying to re-friend her on facebook or sending her private messages that she refused to read. And if he invited her play Scrabble with Friends one more dang time, she was going to choke him with some real life Scrabble pieces. Only that would require her actually seeing him and then she\u2019d be right back where she started.</p><p>Her cell phone rang, the tune identifying her best friend as the caller.</p><p>\u201cRemind me why I agreed to work on Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d Melanie made a left onto Pine Drive. Jack\u2019s restaurant stood on the right, the parking lot already full.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a glutton for punishment,\u201d Zoe said, her voice teasing though the cell phone.</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d Melanie pulled her car into her usual parking spot at the back of the restaurant and cut the engine. \u201cYou and Gabriel going out tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. \u201cDid y\u2019all break up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Zoe laughed, but it sounded a little strained. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be available in case my best friend needed me after she got off of work.\u201d</p><p>Thankful for her friend, Melanie closed her eyes and said a little prayer. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the dessert. There should be tons of leftovers. Last year, the pastry chef screwed up the order and we ran out. This year, Jack had her make twice as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYum-my. See you later.\u201d</p><p>Melanie opened the car door. \u201cBye.\u201d She grabbed her purse and dropped her phone inside of it, then started for the restaurant.</p><p>Jack met her at the back door, his large frame taking up most of it. \u201cChange of plans.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging out of her coat, she threw it over her shoulder and secured her ponytail more tightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d he said, his brown eyes teasing. His bark was always worse than his actual bite. \u201cAnyway, some big shot has rented out the entire back section and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to take care of him?\u201d She brushed past Jack and headed inside. Kneeling down by the flatware station, she shoved her coat and purse under it. Then she grabbed her apron, looped the straps around and tied it in the front. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow up.\u201d Jack\u2019s booming voice made her freeze in place. \u201cThe guy\u2019s already in there, but his woman is running a little late, as usual.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why wouldn\u2019t they have ridden together? \u201cI\u2019ll go get his drink order first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s going on, Jack?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet rid of the apron and go fix your hair and makeup.\u201d</p><p>Melanie bristled. \u201cHow about I just go home?\u201d</p><p>Jack held out his hand. \u201cApron, please. Then do the rest.\u201d As she untied and handed him her apron, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d she muttered, heading to the bathroom. There was absolutely nothing wrong with her make-up and standard issued ponytail. She looked exactly like a waitress, because that\u2019s exactly what she was tonight. \u201cForget it, I\u2019m going in.\u201d</p><p>She walked into the dining room, only instead of the usual noise, it was eerily quiet. Every table was full and every eye was on here. \u201cOh-kay,\u201d she muttered. Unsure of what to do, she smiled and searched the room, trying to find a familiar face to share with her what was going on. But all she found were a familiar pair of sexy green eyes.</p> <p>Her heart bungeed to her toes, then almost jumped out of her mouth.</p><p>Carter Ambrose, in all his racing glory, made his way to her, skirting around tables and chairs. He held a bouquet of roses in one hand and a small, blue box in the other. He stopped only a few feet away from her.</p><p>Finally she found her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re the big shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want to call me,\u201d he said with a heart-stopping grin. \u201cAnyway, I came down here to ask you something, Melanie.\u201d</p><p>She heard a wolf-whistle from the crowd and found Carter\u2019s youngest brother, Heath, ready to let another one loose. Only his mother smacked on the back of the head before he could make good on it, then gave Melanie an encouraging smile.</p><p>Melanie\u2019s eyes widened. Leah Ambrose had never smiled like that at her, not once.</p> <p>A flash of lime green caught her attention. In a corner booth sat her best friend with a big smile on her face. Louis sat beside her, a big glass of iced water on the table in front of him. He looked like he was going to cry.</p><p>Carter cleared his throat and she focused on him once more. \u201cI had this big speech planned, but now that you\u2019re here standing in front of me, I can\u2019t think of a damn word,\u201d he said, his cheeks heating a little. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just come right out and say it: I love you, Melanie Anne Smith.\u201d</p><p>Knees threatening to give out on her, she collapsed in the nearest chair. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>He kneeled in front of her, handing her the roses. \u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything more.\u201d She really didn\u2019t. The words she\u2019d never thought she would hear from him were being said in front of everyone and then some. So this couldn\u2019t be a dream or a joke. \u201cI love you, too, Carter. Ever since you picked me to be on your team when the other kids wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, he kissed her quickly, then handed her the blue box he\u2019d been holding and she opened it. A slim band with a emerald-cut diamond winked at her. Breathing became hard to do, as did seeing when black dots danced in front of her eyes. \u201cGood God, that\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know why you love her so much,\u201d Jake shouted from the back and everyone burst out laughing.</p><p>Melanie\u2019s cheeks heated and she pressed her palms against them. \u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I like your sassy mouth,\u201d he whispered back, then raised his voice. \u201cIt seems like my entire life has been touched by you, and I just can\u2019t see the next sixty years without having you by my side. I\u2019m not Prince Charming and you don\u2019t need rescuing. But I am yours and I\u2019ve got a Mustang sitting out front that I\u2019d love to drive off into the sunset with you in it. Marry me, Melanie, and make me the happiest man in the world.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, clearing away the dancing dots and gazed into his eyes. \u201cYes, and I\u2019ll go anywhere in the world with you.\u201d</p><p>The entire dining room erupted into applause and cheers.</p><p>Carter tugged her to a standing position and slipped the ring on her finger. She kissed him, putting every ounce of love she had for him in that kiss. He returned her kisses, hands cupping her face. It was the sweetest kiss of her life.</p><p>\u201cDamn, but I love you, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cLove you, love you.\u201d Then he swept her off of her feet and she grabbed his hat, putting it on her head. \u201cThis what you had in mind? I watched a dozen You Tube clips before I found a movie that even remotely resembled what you were talking about,\u201d he said.</p><p>As he strode out of the restaurant, she kissed his cheek and said, \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201dYou\u2019re perfect and best of all: You\u2019re mine, Carter Ambrose.\u201d</p><p>Setting her down by the car, he grinned at her and fiddled with the brim of his cap. \u201cI have a couple more surprise for you, soon-to-be Mrs. Ambrose.\u201d He opened the passenger side door. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can take any more surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, baby.\u201d</p><p>He drove to the house on Persimmon Drive and her heart sunk at the sight of a Sold Sign in the yard. As they pulled into the driveway, she saw someone had hung a flag with a roses and hummingbirds from the front porch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Carter cut the engine and helped her out of the car. Digging into one of his pockets, he pulled out a house key. \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me my own house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was kind of hoping that you\u2019d let me live here, too,\u201d he said with a teasing smile, then he handed her the keys to the Mustang. \u201cCouldn\u2019t see myself letting Chase have his car back. So, it\u2019s all yours. Figured it might be fun for you to drive back and forth to class on sunny days.\u201d</p><p>Glancing from the keys to the car, then him, she shook her head. \u201cBut what about living in Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a house there, too? Done.\u201d</p><p>She punched him in the shoulder. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided to open two garages. One in Charlotte and here, in Holland Springs. Jake and I decided to forgo the investors and become business partners. Besides, what would Beau do without you defending him?\u201d</p><p>She jumped into his arms, plastering kisses all over his face. \u201cBest presents ever, well, besides this diamond ring. But I don\u2019t have anything to give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you make up your oversight in bed.\u201d Holding her by her thighs, he walked to the house. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go inside and take a look at the master bedroom... maybe let me drive you crazy for once.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she wrapped her arms around him, happiness winding through her. She was going to be Mrs. Carter Ambrose, her best friend\u2019s sister-in-law and best of all, her happily ever after had come true. \u201cHow about we drive each other crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d He pressed her against the door, dipping his head to claim her mouth in a searing kiss. Then he opened the door and carried her inside to begin what promised to be one crazy ride.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Two years later</p><p>Big brown eyes stared up at Carter, a toothless grin making his heart flip in his chest. The baby in his arms wiggled, then yawned and snuggled against him.</p><p>\u201cYou are so wrapped around her finger,\u201d Melanie said, gently caressing SmithAnn on the face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright with that.\u201d He kissed his baby girl before laying her down in her crib.</p><p>Pink was everywhere in his house: On the walls, the bedding and the baby\u2019s clothes. It was even the color of the mini-Sprint Car he\u2019d bought her a week after she\u2019d been born. \u201cSomeday real soon,\u201d he had said while \u201cshowing\u201d her the present he\u2019d gotten, \u201cyour daddy\u2019s going to teach you how to beat the boys at their own game. Then I\u2019ll have to buy three more shotguns to keep them all away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019ll get going.\u201d But he lingered in his daughter\u2019s room, not wanting to miss a thing his little princess did.</p><p>His little princess grunted and let out a burp.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your manners, Miss Priss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d Melanie said, then smacked Carter on the ass. He followed her to the kitchen. \u201cToday, I\u2019m taking SmithAnn with me to Kerry\u2019s house to shoot her daughter\u2019s birthday party, then we\u2019re supposed to have dinner at your momma\u2019s house. Card games to follow.\u201d</p><p>He snagged his cooler. \u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a really bad liar, Carter. Only Zoe\u2019s worse than you, which might be why she always loses at Bullshit.\u201d She brushed up against him. \u201cPlus, your momma and Evangeline said they would babysit SmithAnn for the entire weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about feeding her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll taken care of.\u201d She held up a clear tube. \u201cBreast pump to the rescue of parents needing a night or two off.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah, he liked how she thought. \u201cDo we have to stay for cards?\u201d He pressed her against the island and set his cooler on the granite countertop.</p><p>She made little circles on his chest with her finger, peering at him through her lashes. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her easily and set her down beside his cooler, bracing his hands on either side of her. Her breasts rose and fell as her breath quickened. \u201cI want to have lots\u201d\u2014He nuzzled her shirt to one side and kissed a heavy breast\u2014\u201cand lots of alone time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes SmithAnn\u2019s naps can last a really long time.\u201d Melanie unbuttoned her shirt, her lacy bra doing things for his dick that he greatly appreciated.</p><p>Just as he unfastened her bra, SmithAnn began to cry. He let his head fall to Melanie\u2019s chest. Breathing in her coconut scent didn\u2019t help things.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her,\u201d Melanie said on a sigh. \u201cShe probably did a lot more than grunt and burp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, she\u2019s just determined to drive me crazy like her momma does.\u201d He helped his wife down from the island. \u201cHow about I get this one?\u201d</p><p>Biting the side of her lip, she shook her head. \u201cI am one lucky woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure are.\u201d Smiling, he kissed her. </p> </body></html>"]
