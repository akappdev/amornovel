The small porcelain clock on the mantel\u2014Gran\u2019s favorite, brought over from Ireland\u2014sat in its place, the seconds ticking away softly. A night-light burned in the bathroom, because she didn\u2019t like total darkness.</p><p>The air conditioner hummed.</p> <p>The clock chimed softly.</p><p>It was midnight.</p><p>Then she realized what was wrong. Granda was in the room. He was watching her from the old white rocker that faced her bed. He was smoking his old pipe and rocking gently, and he smiled as she opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGranda?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cAh, girl, I woke you,\u201d he said. \u201cI didna mean to do so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Granda,\u201d she told him, curious. \u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my girl, just the way it is,\u201d he said, and he leaned toward her. \u201cI want you to be good to Gran, that\u2019s all, Christie. Be there for her.\u201d</p><p>She almost laughed aloud in protest. She was twelve years old, and she didn\u2019t even live near Gran, so she could hardly be much help to her. \u201cI\u2019m a kid, Granda,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI can\u2019t even go to the mall by myself.\u201d</p><p>She was rewarded with one of his deep and endearing smiles. \u201cSo y\u2019are young, girl, so y\u2019are. But children can give a lot of love.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, surprised suddenly that he looked so good, and that he was so calm, just sitting there, rocking, the pleasant odor of his pipe tobacco so strong. Gran had been on him about that pipe lately. And he had tried to stop smoking it to please her, which had been easy enough, since he\u2019d been sick in bed so much lately. That was why she was there then, actually, when she should have been back home and going to school. They had come up to help Gran. Of course, Gran wasn\u2019t alone. Christie\u2019s uncle, her mother\u2019s brother, and his wife and two sons lived in the area, but Christie suspected that her grandmother needed her mother. Certainly her mother believed that daughters had more of a bond with their parents\u2014or maybe daughters were just more useful.</p><p>\u201cShe should know it, aye, she should, but you make sure she knows I love her, eh?\u201d Granda said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Granda. She knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mom, too. But she has your da, and he\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom loves you, too, Granda,\u201d Christie said firmly, feeling it was important that he really understood that.</p><p>\u201cAye. And you love me, too, eh, moppet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran is the one who will miss me most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going on about, Granda? You\u2019re not going anywhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe there for her,\u201d he said, then rose and set his pipe on the mantel. He came to the bed, sat by her side and scooped her into his arms against his chest, and held her as he had often done when reading her a story\u2014or making one up. She seldom knew what was true and what wasn\u2019t, because Granda had, so Gran told her, the gift of blarney. But she loved him and loved his stories, and all her friends loved him, too, because he had such a way with the tales he\u2019d brought over from the old country.</p> <p>He smoothed back her hair. \u201cThe Irish are special,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey have the gift of sight.\u201d</p><p>She remembered one time when Granda had said so in front of her father. He had remarked dryly, \u201cUmmhmm. Special. Give \u2019em a fifth of whiskey and they\u2019ve got the sight, all right.\u201d</p><p>Granda hadn\u2019t been angry; he\u2019d laughed right along with her father. Her dad hadn\u2019t been born in Ireland, like her mom, but his parents had been born there. And even though she wasn\u2019t quite a teenager, she was very aware of what went on around her.</p><p>A lot of their Irish friends did have a habit of consuming whiskey.</p><p>\u201cGuard your gift,\u201d Granda said softly to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Granda, I\u2019m too young to drink,\u201d she told him. \u201cHonestly.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI mean the gift of sight, y\u2019little sass,\u201d he told her playfully. \u201cI have to go, Christie. But I\u2019m all right. You let Gran know that, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere all wars cease, where God sees goodness, not religion. Where the grass is as ever green as that I knew in Eire.\u201d</p><p>The way he spoke was scaring her. She hated when anyone talked about death. She knew that her grandparents were older, that things happened. But she always thought as long as she was cheerful and convinced them that they were still young, nothing could go very wrong. \u201cA place that beautiful?\u201d she teased. \u201cWe should go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis not to be, not now,\u201d he said. \u201cAll in time. Gran will meet me one day. Till then, you give her what she needs.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed her hair again. Then he frowned for a moment, looking around.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Granda?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAh, well, \u2019tis all new to me, but it seems...well, there are many doors. Indeed, I have opened a new door. No reason to worry, moppet.\u201d He held her close, smiling tenderly. \u201cYou just remember all I\u2019ve said to ye, me little girl.\u201d Cradling her, he began to sing an old lullaby. Granda had a great voice. He\u2019d never been a performer\u2014except in pubs\u2014but he could have been, she thought proudly. He didn\u2019t think a thing of his talent\u2014all Irish men could be tenors, if they chose, in his opinion.</p><p>As he held her, singing, she drifted off to sleep.</p><p>In the morning she heard the soft sound of tears coming from the parlor. It was a parlor in this house, and not a living room, like she had in Miami. Her grandparents had bought the place before so much of Orlando had been bought up by the Disney Company, then hotel and restaurant chains, and other mega-entertainment companies. It was one of the really old houses in the area, one of the very few that had been there before the Civil War\u2014or the War of Northern Aggression, as some of Granda\u2019s friends liked to call it. It had been falling to ruin when they had found it, which was why they had been able to afford it. They called it a Victorian manor. Christie\u2019s two cousins\u2014even though they were boys\u2014found it creepy. She loved it\u2014but then, she loved her grandparents, and they never insisted that she turn off all the lights.</p><p>Now it was daylight. But even from her upstairs bedroom, she could hear the soft sound of sobbing down in the parlor.</p><p>She stepped from the bed and hurried to the top of the stairs. She heard her father\u2019s voice first. \u201cMary, Seamus is at peace now. He\u2019s at peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush now, Sean,\u201d her mother said to her father. \u201cMom knows that. We\u2019ll all be crying just because we miss him so.\u201d</p><p>Gran suddenly looked up the staircase, looking sad but strong. Gran always looked strong. She held out her arms. \u201cChristie, girl.\u201d</p><p>Christie ran down the stairs to sit on her grandmother\u2019s lap, and hugged her, frowning. \u201cGran? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranda. He\u2014he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d Christie said with a frown. Then her memories of the night washed over her like a wave. \u201cOh...he told me that he had to go.\u201d</p><p>There was a strange silence. \u201cWhen you were at his bedside, Christie?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad. Last night. He was in my room, smoking his pipe, sitting in the rocker. He told me that he had to go, and that you\u2019d meet him in time, Gran. He said that I needed to be here for you. He said it would be green, like Eire. And...\u201d</p><p>Again there was silence. Moments later there were people at the door. Her grandmother set her down as the paramedics and police entered. Christie frowned, wondering why the police were there, then found herself forgotten as the paramedics hurried up the stairs. She followed. Someone asked Gran what had happened; she explained that she had awakened to find him cold.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been dead for hours, since at least midnight,\u201d someone else said. Then someone got on the phone with Granda\u2019s doctor, and Christie realized that since he had \u201cpassed\u201d at home, they had to make sure Gran hadn\u2019t killed him.</p><p>Christie was appalled.</p><p>But it was only then that she realized the rock-bottom truth of it.</p><p>Granda had gone.</p><p>Granda was dead.</p><p>But he had been in her room!</p><p>After midnight.</p><p>Her mother saw her and took her hand. Her mother was sobbing, and Christie felt her pain, her own sense of loss, but somehow, hers wasn\u2019t as bad. Granda had been at peace, ready to live in a land that was as green as Eire again.</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right,\u201d she said urgently.</p><p>Her mother was distracted and didn\u2019t seem to really hear her. \u201cHe was ill,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIn pain. And now...he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him, Mom. Last night. He loves you all so much. He said he\u2019s fine, and he wants you to be fine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of the mouths of babes,\u201d her father said gently. \u201cHey, it\u2019s cold today, young lady. You need slippers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>Her mother walked with her to the room, still distracted, crying, quietly now, the tears sliding down her face.</p><p>When they reached Christie\u2019s room, her mother paused and stared at Christie, frowning. \u201cI...I can almost smell his tobacco in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was here. With me. I told you that, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Her mother looked at her then as if hearing her for the first time. She forgot all about slippers as she paled and walked away.</p><p>That night, the Irish of the area came. First and foremost the family, of course, her uncle and aunt and her cousins, all in mourning, the boys, who were slightly older than Christie, looking very mature and somber, and being tender and even courteous to her.</p><p>Granda had left explicit instructions. He was not to be mourned. His life was to be celebrated in the old way. So his cronies also came, and they drank beer, and they lamented, but they celebrated, too, telling stories, drinking more beer. Granda\u2019s family did him proud, hosting all those who had loved him the way it was done in the old country. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seamus Michael McDuff was buried three days later.</p><p>At the gravesite, everyone cried. He had been seventy, had had a full life. He\u2019d come from Ireland to the United States with his wife, his daughter and his son, and he\u2019d created a good home for them. He\u2019d been a pastry chef, and he\u2019d worked very hard and saved his money, and finally he\u2019d opened his own restaurant, where he also employed his Irish knack for a ditty and blarney, entertaining as well as feeding many people. He\u2019d loved God and his family; he\u2019d been a good man.</p><p>It was while the ancient Irish bagpipes were emitting the mournful notes of a lament that Christie saw him again.</p> <p>Most people were standing, but Gran was still seated when he went to her side, touched her hair and whispered into her ear.</p><p>Gran looked up, startled, frowning. Then it seemed to Christie that the hint of a wistful smile shone through her tears.</p><p>Granda turned, as if aware that Christie was watching, and winked. He looked so healthy. So much younger. His playful Gaelic self.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help smiling, too.</p><p>The service was coming to an end, the bagpiper playing \u201cDanny Boy.\u201d</p> <p>It was then that she looked up, across the expanse of the cemetery.</p><p>There was another funeral going on, small in comparison to her grandfather\u2019s. There were a man and a woman and a priest. Just three people. The woman was crying her heart out. The priest was speaking, obviously trying to comfort her. Strangely, it seemed to Christie that they were in a hurry, as if they didn\u2019t want to be seen by anyone else.</p><p>There was something so terribly sad about it.</p><p>She saw her grandfather again. He was eyeing her with a touch of wistful humor.</p><p>\u201cLove is all we can take with us to the grave,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt is the greatest part of any existence, and in that, I have died so rich.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to speak to him; she also wanted to scream.</p> <p>Because he couldn\u2019t really be there.</p><p>She heard him whisper. \u201cIf y\u2019would, girl. Kindness to others, in me honor.\u201d</p><p>She realized that his service had come to an end, and somehow she was holding a rose. She followed the others\u2019 lead and dropped it down on the coffin. She turned away and noticed that one rose had fallen on the ground. She picked it up and, without thinking, started walking over to the other funeral, which had ended. The priest and the distraught couple were gone. Only the caretakers were there now, getting ready to lower the coffin into the ground.</p><p>\u201cDo you know this man?\u201d the caretaker asked as she drew nearer.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...?\u201d</p><p>She set the rose she was holding on the coffin. \u201cGo with God,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cChristina!\u201d She heard her mother\u2019s voice, calling. She turned away from the sadness of the grave where so few had mourned and hurried back to her family.</p> <p>Later, thinking that it would make her grandmother feel better, she told Gran that she\u2019d seen her grandfather. Gran stared at her, then said, \u201cAye, lovie, I sensed him there, that I did.\u201d</p><p>But that night, to her surprise, her mother seemed angry. \u201cChristie, please, stop saying that you\u2019re seeing your grandfather. Stop it. It\u2019s hurtful, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hurting anyone,\u201d Christie protested.</p><p>\u201cAnd you wandered off...God, that was dreadful. To think that he was buried at the same time, on the same day, as my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Her mother shook her head. \u201cChristina, I\u2019m sorry. I love you so much, and I know you\u2019re hurting, too...but you\u2019re dreaming. Dreaming at night, daydreaming when you\u2019re awake. You cannot see Granda. And you must stop saying that you do!\u201d</p><p>Her mother was upset, of course; she had just lost her father. Christie understood that. But, it was almost as if her mother were...</p><p>Afraid.</p><p>If she really was seeing her grandfather, wasn\u2019t that a good thing?</p><p>To be honest, she wished that he would come again, closer, that he would speak to her, that he would explain.</p><p>Who had that other freshly dug grave belonged to?</p><p>Her mother hadn\u2019t answered her, but she heard other people talking. Everyone said it was terrible. There had been a murderer on the loose, but luckily he was dead. He\u2019d been killed by the police, or he was the police, or something like that. She was irritated by the way people clammed up when she came near. She was nearly a teenager, after all, tall for her age, and she was actually developing a shape. It was insulting to be treated like a child. Then she realized that she had set a flower on a murderer\u2019s grave. That was disturbing. But she had seen Granda just before, and he had spoken about kindness....</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked her friend Ana, who lived down the street and was her own age. Ana had come to the funeral and then back to the house afterward, of course, along with her parents and her cousin Jedidiah, looking handsome in his military uniform. Her grandparents\u2019 next door neighbor was there, too, Tony, who was eighteen already. He and Jed were off talking, so she was able to talk to Ana alone.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d Ana asked her. \u201cThey got that guy that was killing people. I guess maybe you didn\u2019t hear as much about him down south, but up here, people were paranoid. He was buried today, too.\u201d</p><p>And she had put a rose on his coffin.</p><p>Later, when she was alone with her grandmother, she was told again to stop talking about seeing her grandfather.</p><p>\u201cYou loved him, my girl. I know that. But you must stop saying you\u2019ve seen him, though I know you are only trying to ease my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you, Gran?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>Gran looked at her very seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous. Very dangerous. So today you\u2019ve said goodbye. Never, ever think of him as speaking to you...being near you...again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranda would never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Granda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gran was suddenly intense. \u201cTo see Granda...you have opened a door. And God alone knows who else might pass through that door.\u201d</p><p>Gran\u2019s words chilled her.</p><p>\u201cGran, was Ana telling me the truth? No one thinks twelve is old enough to understand anything, but it is. Tell me, please, was a murderer buried today?\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother\u2019s face went white. \u201cNever speak of it, never speak that name in connection with your grandfather!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever you mind. It\u2019s over. An awful time is over. And your grandfather...well, he\u2019s in God\u2019s arms now. Where monsters go, I do not know.\u201d</p><p>Gran kissed her then, and held her. \u201c\u2019Tis all right, my girl, \u2019tis all right. We have love. I have you, and I have your Mom, and my dear son and his lads.... \u2019Tis all right.\u201d</p><p>Christie looked at her. She wanted to scream, because it wasn\u2019t all right. They were always trying to shelter her from the world, but surely it was better to understand the world than hide from it.</p><p>But here in her grandparents\u2019\u2014her grandmother\u2019s now\u2014house, everyone was too upset.</p><p>Too lost.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why, and it made her afraid. Not afraid of Granda, but just...</p><p>Afraid.</p><p>Afraid of the dead.</p><p>That night, she didn\u2019t sleep. She lay awake, praying silently in her soul that he wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t.</p><p>She had probably just been so upset that she was imagining things.</p><p>Granda, don\u2019t come again. Don\u2019t ever come again. If you love me at all, please, don\u2019t ever come again.</p><p>She told herself that all she felt was the whisper of a breeze, though there was none. A gentle touch, as if...</p><p>As if she had been heard and understood.</p><p>Her grandfather didn\u2019t appear.</p><p>In fact, she never saw him again, not even in dreams.</p><p>And as the years passed by, slowly, certainly, she forgot.</p><p>It had only been a dream, just as her mother had said.</p><p>She was able to believe that for nearly twelve years. And then one day she learned that her grandmother\u2019s words were true.</p><p>Seeing the dead...</p><p>Was dangerous.</p><p>1</p><p>A n autopsy room always smelled like death, no matter how sterile it was.</p><p>And it was never dark, the way it was in so many movies. If anything, it was too bright. Everything about it rendered death matter-of-fact.</p><p>Facts, yes. It was the facts they were after. The victim\u2019s voice was forever silenced, and only the eloquent, hushed cry of the body was left to help those who sought to catch a killer.</p><p>Jed Braden could never figure out how the medical examiner and the cops got so blas\u00e9 about the place that they managed not only to eat but to wolf down their food in the autopsy room.</p><p>Not that he wasn\u2019t familiar enough with autopsy rooms himself. He was, in fact, far more acquainted with his current surroundings than he had ever wanted to be. But eating here? Not him.</p><p>This morning, it was doughnuts for the rest of them, but he\u2019d even refused coffee. He\u2019d never passed out at an autopsy, even when he\u2019d been a rookie in Homicide, and he didn\u2019t feel like starting now.</p><p>Even a fresh corpse smelled. The body\u2014any body\u2014released gases with death. And if it had taken a while for someone to discover the corpse, whether it was a victim of natural, self-inflicted or violent death, growing bacteria and the process of decay could really wreak havoc with the senses.</p><p>But sometimes he thought the worst smells of all were those that just accompanied the business of discovering evidence: formaldehyde and other tissue preservers and the heavy astringents used to whitewash death and decay. Some M.E.\u2019s and their assistants wore masks or even re-breathers\u2014since the nation had become litigation crazy, some jurisdictions even required them.</p><p>Not Doc Martin. He had always felt that the smells associated with death were an important tool. He was one of the fifty percent of people who could smell cyanide. He was also a stickler; he hated it when a corpse had to be disinterred because something had been done wrong or neglected the first time around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There wasn\u2019t a better man to have on a case.</p><p>Whenever a death was suspicious, there had to be an autopsy, and it always felt like the last, the ultimate, invasion. Everything that had once been part and parcel of a living soul was not just spread out naked, but sliced and probed.</p><p>At least an autopsy had not been required for Margaritte. She had been pumped full of morphine, and at the end, her eyes had opened once, looked into his, then closed. A flutter had lifted her chest, and she had died in his arms, looking as if she were only sleeping, but truly at rest at last.</p> <p>Doc Martin finished intoning the time and date into his recorder and shut off the device for a moment, staring at him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak straight to Jed, though. He spoke to Jerry Dwyer, at his side.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant. What\u2019s he doing here?\u201d</p><p>Inwardly, Jed groaned.</p><p>\u201cDoc...\u201d Jerry murmured unhappily. \u201cI think it\u2019s his...conscience.\u201d</p> <p>The M.E. hiked a bushy gray eyebrow. \u201cBut he\u2019s not a cop anymore. He\u2019s a writer.\u201d</p><p>He managed to say the word writer as if it were a synonym for scumbag.</p><p>Why not? Jed thought. He was feeling a little bit like a scumbag this morning.</p><p>Doc Martin sniffed. \u201cHe used to be a cop. A good one, too,\u201d he admitted gruffly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so give him a break,\u201d Jerry Dwyer told him. \u201cAnd he\u2019s got his private investigator\u2019s license, too. He\u2019s still legit.\u201d</p><p>This time Martin made a skeptical sound at the back of his throat. \u201cYeah, he got that license so he could keep sticking his nose into other people\u2019s business\u2014so he could write about it. He working for the dead girl? He know her folks? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I want to see justice done,\u201d Jed said quietly. \u201cMaybe the entire force was wrong twelve years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ve got a copycat,\u201d Martin said.</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe we got the wrong guy,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, we didn\u2019t get any guy, exactly,\u201d Jerry reminded them both uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cAnd you feel like shit for having written about it, as if the cop who was killed really did do it, huh?\u201d Doc Martin asked Jed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, if that\u2019s the case, I feel like shit,\u201d Jed agreed.</p><p>Jerry came to his defense again. \u201cListen, the guy\u2019s own partner thought he was guilty. Hell, he was the one who shot him. And Robert Gessup, the A.D.A., compiled plenty of evidence for an arrest and an indictment.\u201d Jerry cleared his throat. \u201cAnd so far, no one has been proved wrong about anything. We all know about copycats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThing about copycats is, they always miss something, some little trick,\u201d Doc Martin said. \u201cUnfortunately, I wasn\u2019t the M.E. on the earlier victims. Old Dr. Mackleby was, but he passed away last summer from a heart attack, and the younger fellow who was working the case, Dr. Austin, was killed in an automobile accident. But don\u2019t worry, if there\u2019s something off-kilter here, I\u2019ll find it. I\u2019m good. Damned good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jerry Dwyer said, adding dryly, \u201cHell, Doc, we knew that before you told us.\u201d</p><p>Martin grunted and turned the tape recorder back on. Jerry gave Jed a glance, shrugging. He\u2019d warned Jed that they might have trouble. He\u2019d told him right out that if Martin said he had to leave, he had to leave.</p><p>An autopsy was a long, hard business, and Jed knew it. In his five years in Homicide, he\u2019d learned too well just how much had to be done meticulously and tediously. And messily.</p><p>He\u2019d never expected to attend one when his presence wasn\u2019t necessary in solving a case, but the truth was, he didn\u2019t have to be here today.</p><p>Except in his own mind.</p><p>The woman on the table was already out of her body bag. There had been no need to inspect her clothing. She hadn\u2019t been found with any.</p><p>The discovery of her body on the I-4 had been not just a tragedy but a shock to the police and anyone who had been in the area for the original killings twelve years ago. Her name was Sherri Mason; she had come to what the locals called Theme Park Central in the middle of the Florida peninsula because she\u2019d wanted to be a star. The police knew her identity because her purse\u2014holding not just her ID but fifty-five dollars and change and several credit cards\u2014had been found discarded near her naked body.</p><p>She had been found not just lying there but carefully displayed, arranged, stretched out on her back as if she were sleeping, her arms crossed over her chest, mummy-style. They were assuming, an assumption to be verified during the autopsy, that she had been sexually assaulted.</p><p>Just like the other five victims\u2014those who\u2019d been slain twelve years ago.</p><p>The problem was, everyone had spent the past twelve years assuming that the killer of those five young women\u2014found beside the same highway and left in the exact same position\u2014had perished himself. He had been a cop named Beau Kidd, shot by his own partner, who had discovered him with the body of the fifth woman. Beau had drawn his own weapon, giving his partner no choice but to fire. He\u2019d never gone to trial, since he\u2019d been pronounced dead at the site, exhaling his last breath over the body of his final victim.</p><p>Assuming he really had been the killer. Certainly the remaining detectives working the case and the D.A.\u2019s office had thought so, and there had been enough circumstantial evidence to make the case.</p><p>That evidence had been sound, Jed knew. He had investigated the case himself after he left the force. He had interviewed as many people who\u2019d been involved as he could find. His first book, the one that had made his reputation as an author, had been about the case. A work of fiction, names changed, but it had been clearly based on the career of the Interstate Killer.</p><p>Like everyone else, he\u2019d unquestioningly blamed the deaths on the man who had died, one of the detectives assigned to the case.</p><p>Jed put the past and all his doubts out of his mind as Doc Martin went on to make observations and take photographs. The body showed signs of rough handling, with abundant bruising. As expected, she had been sexually assaulted, but, as in the past, the killer had been careful. More testing would be necessary, but every one of them was glumly certain there would be no fluids found from which to extract DNA.</p><p>The majority of the bruising was around her neck. Like the original victims, she\u2019d been strangled.</p><p>Occasionally the M.E. had a question for Jerry, who explained that Sherri had last been seen at a local mall, and that her car had been found in the parking lot there. She had met friends to see a movie, then left alone. When she hadn\u2019t shown up for work the following day, a co-worker had reported her missing and filed the report when the requisite twenty-four hours had passed. On the third day after her disappearance, she had been found alongside the highway.</p><p>Jed realized that Jerry was staring at him. \u201cThe same?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t attend any of the original autopsies, remember?\u201d Jed replied.</p><p>\u201cYou did the research,\u201d Jerry reminded him.</p><p>Jed hesitated, shook his head grimly, and spoke. \u201cThe previous victims disappeared and were discovered within a few days. They bore bruises, as if they\u2019d fought with their captor. There were signs of force, but no slashes, no cigarette burns or anything like that. No DNA was ever pulled from beneath fingernails, and no DNA was acquired from the rape kits. That was one of the reasons for thinking the killer was a cop. Whoever killed those girls knew how to commit a murder without leaving evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of you were on the case, or even near it?\u201d Doc Martin asked, looking up.</p><p>Both men shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t here, either, at the time. I was working Broward County back then,\u201d Doc Martin murmured. \u201cHell, come to think of it, Jed, you weren\u2019t much more than a kid at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen, and in the service,\u201d Jed told him.</p><p>Doc Martin settled down to work then. After the back of the body had been inspected, it was bathed and any trace evidence collected in the drain. Tools clicked against the stainless steel of the autopsy table. Scrapings were taken from beneath Sherri\u2019s nails, but Jed was already certain that they would find nothing. Next came the scalpel, the Y incision, the removal of organs and fluids for testing. Everyone went quiet. Jed found himself thinking about Sherri\u2019s dreams. She had come to Orlando looking for a start. To create a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to take with her to New York or California. With all the theme parks in the area, she\u2019d had a solid chance of finding work as a dancer or singer.</p><p>So who had she met, what had she done, that had changed the shimmering promise of life that had stretched before her?</p><p>\u201cWell, Doc?\u201d Jerry asked quietly. Jed gazed at his old friend. Jerry had been on the force for several years before he\u2019d joined himself. He, too, had spent his fair share of time in the autopsy room. But today...This death had affected them all. She\u2019d been so young. Death was part of living. But losing life at a time when dreams were at their strongest was especially poignant.</p><p>Doc Martin looked at them, shaking his head sadly. \u201cThe tox screens will take a little time, but I\u2019m not expecting they\u2019ll turn up anything. The kid was clean. Dancer, I imagine, hoping to grow up to be a fairy princess. Cause of death? Strangulation. Was she tortured before death? Hell, yes\u2014I\u2019d sure call it torture to be continually assaulted, knowing that death is probably imminent. The bruising appears to be indicative of her having been forced and the fact that she fought. We\u2019ll analyze the nail scrapings, of course, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if her murder was committed by the Interstate Killer,\u201d Jed said dully, \u201cthere won\u2019t be any DNA beneath the nails. And there won\u2019t be any semen in the vaginal canal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like twelve years ago, like a cop or an M.E. or a crime scene tech, someone who knew exactly what would nail him, did it,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>\u201cOr an avid student of forensics?\u201d Jed said.</p><p>Doc Martin was thoughtful for a moment. \u201cNo way to know for sure, but it\u2019s certainly possible.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later they were standing outside the morgue. The sun was high and hot, the sky the kind of crystal blue the state was known for. But the storm clouds were already brewing. Hell, it was summer. That meant a storm like nobody\u2019s business sometime during the day, around three or four, usually. Locals loved the phenomenon, though the tourists had a penchant for running from the theme parks when the rains started, not realizing they would be gone in an hour or so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then the night would be beautiful, crystal clear, even if humid and hot.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Jerry demanded, staring at Jed.</p><p>\u201cWell, either everyone involved fucked up entirely and Beau Kidd wasn\u2019t the killer, or we\u2019ve got a copycat out there who studied the case and is imitating the original too damn well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell, I knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, I was in and out of town when it all went down,\u201d Jed reminded his friend. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t on the force then, either. Who\u2019s your partner these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Donnell. Mal O\u2019Donnell. And he wasn\u2019t around twelve years ago, either. Hey, you want to get some dinner?\u201d</p><p>Dinner? Jed\u2019s stomach turned at the thought. Did that make him a wimp? he wondered. He could still smell death and disinfectant. Still, he started to agree, hoping, probably vainly, that Jerry might say something that would give him a clue to the truth about the murders. Did he feel guilty? Hell, yes\u2014if he\u2019d made a mistake. Not only had he made the perp in his novel the homicide cop, even though the man\u2019s name had been changed for legal reasons, but the case he had used was glaringly evident.</p><p>The real cop was dead.</p> <p>Yeah, but his parents weren\u2019t. And they had to live every day with the world\u2019s belief in their son\u2019s guilt, a belief he had perpetuated in his novel.</p><p>Jed realized that he wanted the current killing to be the work of a copycat\u2014he didn\u2019t want to be responsible for the continued life of a horrible mistake.</p><p>\u201cHey, you in there somewhere?\u201d Jerry asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d Jed looked at his watch. \u201cI can\u2019t join you for dinner. I have a commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin Ana. One of her best friends when she was growing up just moved into her grandmother\u2019s house. I promised I\u2019d show up for the housewarming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCool. Where\u2019s the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost horse country. An old pre-Civil War place, one of the few still left in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. A rich kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. I grew up down the street, and Ana is still there, since she bought her parents\u2019 house. Christina\u2019s place is just older and bigger. Her grandparents were immigrants and bought the place way before the theme park explosion, when the countryside was nothing but groves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be worth a fortune now,\u201d Jerry noted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess. But you know how neighborhoods build up. Christina has almost an acre, with a big sloping lawn, almost looks like the place is on a hill, but there\u2019s a modern ranch on her right, and a 1930s art deco-style bungalow on her left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds cool,\u201d Jerry commented. \u201cBetter than the cookie-cutter housing developments that have gone up everywhere. Anyway, if you think of anything, give me a call. And stop by the precinct sometime. The guys will be happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they like to torture me about my books.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? You a sissy now? Can\u2019t take the torture? I\u2019m betting I\u2019ll see you soon enough,\u201d Jerry told him. He pointed a finger. \u201cI know you, and you\u2019re not going to let this go. And that\u2019s cool with me,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the mayor and the governor breathing down our necks. The feds even have a squad on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m sure the perp will be caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Jerry said morosely. \u201cWe had about six counties\u2019 worth of detectives and the feds on the case the last time. Anyway, keep in touch. Have fun hobnobbing with the rich and famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, Christina\u2019s family wasn\u2019t rich,\u201d Jed said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cIf she sold that place, she\u2019d be rich now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t sell it,\u201d Jed said flatly. But did he really know that? Christina had been his kid cousin\u2019s friend. He didn\u2019t actually know her all that well, though for some reason he felt as if he did. He had just seen her six months ago at her grandmother\u2019s funeral. The gangly kid she had once been had grown into a beautiful woman. Tall and slim, but shapely. Regal, and stoic in the face of grief. She\u2019d been wearing black, a suit with one of those slim pencil skirts. Her hair had been a blaze of deep red against the black, something Jed remembered well. The sun had lit up the length of it as it swept down her back, and the color had been almost startling.</p><p>Irish red, he reckoned.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t cried at the service, but those enormous blue eyes of hers had been filled with a greater depth of emotion than any tears could have evoked. She\u2019d loved her granny, the last of her family except for two cousins. He knew them, too, though they weren\u2019t the same age. Dan and Michael had graduated one after the other right behind him, but they\u2019d had different interests and hung out with different friends. He\u2019d gone for a basic BA, while Michael and Daniel McDuff had gone into the arts. Daniel was still struggling as a performer, while Michael did freelance production work for several of the local theme parks and planned to found his own company one day.</p><p>Jed knew through Ana that despite having grown up several hours away in South Florida, Christina had been the closest of the three grandchildren to her grandmother. According to Ana, Christina and her grandmother had shared a special bond.</p><p>He\u2019d turned down tonight\u2019s invitation at first. He had never been a real part of the crowd. But oddly enough, it was the memory of Christina at her grandmother\u2019s funeral that had turned him around. She had grown up not just beautiful but intriguing. She\u2019d acquired an air of sophistication that was best described as alluring. In addition, she\u2019d lost her parents just five years earlier, and had worn a lost and weary look he knew all too well himself.</p><p>He wished that he could somehow ease things for her. It was so easy to become bitter after so much loss. He had certainly done so, but Christina didn\u2019t look as if she had.</p><p>He was surprised by how eager he felt to go, even if Ana\u2019s old friend had grown up very nicely and he felt that they shared a bond of grief.</p><p>He usually avoided any woman who might be considered a friend. He didn\u2019t like sympathy, and he didn\u2019t like to talk. Margaritte had been dead for four years. He wasn\u2019t as dead inside himself as he had been, but he still wasn\u2019t certain that he even liked people in general, much less that he wanted to let himself get close to anyone. Best to veer far away from anything that might be an actual relationship. Barhopping and one-night stands were his preferred mode of existence.</p><p>Still, Ana had begged. And for a while, at least, he didn\u2019t want to think about the Interstate Killer, and whether the original was alive or dead.</p><p>Or the fact that he was very afraid the nightmare was starting all over again.</p><p>There were still boxes everywhere.</p><p>For the life of her, Christina couldn\u2019t figure out why she\u2019d given in when Ana had insisted that she have a housewarming before she was fully moved in, but in Ana\u2019s mind, it was good luck. At least she\u2019d said \u201csmall gathering\u201d and meant it. Just Ana, maybe her cousin Jed, Tony and Ilona from next door, and her own two cousins, Mike and Dan. The menu was simple: sodas, beer and wine from the quick mart down on the highway and barbecue delivered by Shorty\u2019s. That was easy enough, she supposed.</p><p>But still...</p><p>This was her first day. The first day when she was completely out of her condo in Miami, when her boxes were filling this house, when she would sleep here for the first time after inheriting the house and deciding to move in.</p><p>Ana arrived early, while Christina was still considering the piano question. The piano was a crucial part of her work. It was almost like a physical attachment.</p><p>The light in the parlor was best, but she didn\u2019t like having shelves piled with paper and drawers full of disks around, or all her office supplies cluttering up the small room. Still, her piano looked great right in front of the bay window.</p><p>It was staying, she decided. She would eventually find\u2014and be able to afford\u2014some good oak or maple office furniture that would suit the decor. And if not, the library was across the hall, a perfect place for office supplies and equipment. She could just walk across when she needed something. No big deal.</p><p>Why were there so many boxes? she wondered with dismay.</p><p>Because I\u2019m incapable of parting with anything, she reminded herself.</p><p>She felt like the keeper of the family heritage or something. It was so hard to believe that everyone was gone except for Mike, Dan and herself. And neither Mike nor Dan felt the need to keep things like the cocktail napkin her mom had saved from her first date with her dad. Or all the hundreds of pictures from Ireland, or even the pictures of all of them as kids.</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by the clang of the old front door bell. She opened the door to let Ana in. Ana had a big box in her hand, with a plastic-wrapped cardboard tray on top. Christina quickly reached over to help her.</p><p>\u201cNo, no...if I just aim for a flat surface, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Ana told her cheerfully.</p><p>A flat surface sounded easy enough.</p><p>An empty flat surface involved deeper thought.</p><p>\u201cThe pass-through between the kitchen and dining room,\u201d Christina said quickly.</p><p>Ana cut a path through the hall and parlor to reach her destination. Except for the clutter of boxes, the house was clean. It was a large, airy place, the perfect family home, in Christina\u2019s mind. The hall worked as a breezeway, a traditional old time \u201cshotgun\u201d approach that allowed the house the best of whatever breeze was available. The stairway stood to the left of the hall and led to the second floor, a beautifully carved banister leading the way.</p><p>Ana knew her way around the house. She had been Christina\u2019s friend forever, and had spent plenty of time here whenever Christina was up visiting her grandparents.</p><p>\u201cThis really is a super place,\u201d Ana said, leading the way.</p><p>The house was wonderful. Christina had always loved it, and her grandmother, knowing how much she loved it and how well she would take care of it, had left it to her. But neither Mike nor Dan had been forgotten. They had received trust funds from the woman who had come to the U.S. to make her own way, and had done well simply by being hard-working, careful and smart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ana said, setting down her burden. \u201cNow I\u2019ll have a beer. Want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Ana headed for the refrigerator and produced two icy bottles, which they clinked together in a toast. \u201cTo you living here full-time,\u201d Ana said.</p> <p>\u201cI always knew I would, but I really didn\u2019t want the day to come,\u201d Christina told her.</p><p>\u201cShe lived a good long life,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>A long life, but an often painful one, Christina thought. Gran had lost Granda too soon, and then, much too young, her daughter and son, and their spouses, but she had called on an inner reserve and been there for her three grandchildren. Maybe she had been tired. Ready to join those who had gone before her.</p><p>\u201cAh, that she did,\u201d Christina said softly, lifting her bottle again and offering her best imitation of her grandmother\u2019s heavy accent.</p><p>The doorbell rang again. The two of them hurried to answer it.</p> <p>\u201cHey, is Jed coming?\u201d Christina asked Ana.</p><p>\u201cHe said he was. But that won\u2019t be him. He said he was meeting a friend for something work-related this afternoon and he\u2019d be late if he came at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would have figured he\u2019d become a bestselling writer, huh?\u201d Christina asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was going to be a football hero and get me lots of dates,\u201d Ana said with a sigh.</p><p>Christina rolled her eyes at her friend, shaking her head. Strange, she barely knew Jed anymore. He\u2019d seemed like a god when they\u2019d been kids. She\u2019d seen him at her grandmother\u2019s funeral, where he\u2019d been reserved but kind, but she\u2019d felt so bereft that she\u2019d barely noticed anyone. He\u2019d said the right things, though. While everyone else had been telling her what a good and long life her grandmother had lived, he had simply said that he knew how she would miss her gran, and that losing someone hurt, no matter how old they\u2019d been, even if knowing they\u2019d had a long life and lived it well eventually helped with the healing process.</p><p>He would know, she thought, having lost his wife when she was only twenty-five.</p> <p>\u201cHey, there, you two,\u201d she said, pleased, as she opened the door. Dan and Mike had come together. They were just a year apart and had often been taken for twins, they were so much alike. Dan had half an inch over his older brother\u2019s height of six two, but they both had the deep red hair that seemed to run with an unbridled strength in the family, and the warm hazel eyes that had been Gran\u2019s. Her own were blue\u2014her father\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, little cutie,\u201d Dan said, stepping in and giving her a hug.</p><p>\u201cLittle? She\u2019s five ten, if she\u2019s an inch,\u201d Michael said, shaking his head as he followed his brother inside. They loved to tease her about her height. It had started when she reached her current max in eighth grade and never stopped.</p><p>\u201cHa, ha, love you, too,\u201d she said, accepting a hug from Michael in turn. They were both good-looking and always had been. She peered past them to the porch, then stared at them, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWhat, no dates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAna told us it was family night,\u201d Dan said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s a real little bit,\u201d Michael said, catching hold of Ana and lifting her up for a hug. She really was tiny\u2014five feet even\u2014and they loved to tease her, too.</p><p>\u201cPut me down,\u201d Ana commanded, then swung on Daniel. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you even think about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m innocent,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d Ana muttered, but she gave him a grin. Adulthood had taken them in different directions, but it didn\u2019t matter. A bond had been formed when they were young, when this house, and Gran, brought them together, and it had never been broken.</p><p>Only Jed Braden had been on the outside, Christina thought. A year older than Michael, two years older than Dan. And somehow different, set apart. Maybe it had been his determination to go into the service. Not because he longed to go to war, but because he wanted the benefits to get through college. He\u2019d been gone a lot once he joined up, and then he\u2019d gotten married in a beautiful ceremony to the gorgeous, gentle Margaritte. He\u2019d drawn even further away from them after that, shouldering increasing responsibility by becoming a cop and then a detective.</p><p>And then a widower and famous but semireclusive writer.</p><p>She shook off thoughts of Jed. It felt slightly uncomfortable somehow, seeing him again.</p><p>Maybe because they seemed to meet all too frequently at funerals.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said cheerfully, realizing that her cousins were staring at her, waiting for her to speak. She offered a huge smile. \u201cI admit I hadn\u2019t really planned to entertain strangers tonight, but you guys could have brought the current loves of your lives,\u201d Christina told them.</p><p>\u201cI have no love in my life,\u201d Dan said with a feigned mourning note in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI want no love in my life,\u201d Mike said, and his tone was sharper. He\u2019d been married once, and his divorce hadn\u2019t been a pleasant one, though he had dated since.</p><p>\u201cWell, Tony from next door is coming, and he\u2019s bringing Ilona, the girl we met at the funeral. They live together,\u201d Christina told them. \u201cSo come on. The menu\u2019s barbecue and beer. I\u2019ll get the plates out as soon as I get some of the boxes off the chairs so we can use the parlor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Ana said as they all walked deeper into the house. Suddenly she let out an exclamation as she pulled something out of a box. \u201cLook, it\u2019s a Ouija board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never throw anything away,\u201d Christina admitted sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you even consider throwing this away?\u201d Ana demanded. Picking up the Ouija board, she walked over and sat in a wing chair and stared at it raptly. \u201cOh, my God, remember? We used to have so much fun with this thing.\u201d</p><p>Christina found herself feeling strangely irritated, wishing she\u2019d thought to stick the damn thing somewhere out of sight, or, that she\u2019d gotten rid of it altogether.</p><p>She groaned aloud. \u201cWe had fun because we were kids who knew the answers we wanted to hear, so we pushed it around to get them,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to play with this sucker again,\u201d Ana said, entranced, and obviously unaware that Christina was nowhere near as anxious as she was to dredge up past fun and games. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? We had so much fun. Sometimes you\u2019d wrap a towel around your head like a turban and call yourself Madame Zee, and we\u2019d have a s\u00e9ance. It was so much fun. But this guy...\u201d She patted the Ouija board affectionately. \u201cWe asked it so many questions. It was great. We have to play with it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I know what I\u2019m going to be when I grow up,\u201d Christina said. \u201cAnd we are all grown up, in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupposedly,\u201d Mike threw in skeptically.</p><p>\u201cGrown up\u2014not dead,\u201d Ana said with mock impatience. \u201cLet\u2019s ask it something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any answers to any questions\u2014prophecies can be self-fulfilling,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t want any answers,\u201d Dan said. \u201cBut I want to know if I\u2019m going to have to be a fluffy all my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFluffy?\u201d Ana giggled. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean \u2018fluffer\u2019? And don\u2019t you have to be a girl for that? Or maybe not, these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute, shorty, very cute,\u201d Dan said dryly.</p><p>\u201cA lot of the entertainers at the parks call playing a character being a \u2018fluffy,\u2019\u201d Christina explained, unable to hide a smile. \u201cDan is in the running to play Zeus in a new show, but in the meantime...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019m Raccoon Ralph,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cRaccoon Ralph?\u201d Ana said, and burst into gales of laughter.</p><p>\u201cIf we were still kids, I\u2019d be bopping you on the head right now,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cThank God we\u2019re not kids, then,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>\u201cEnough of that,\u201d Mike said, suddenly serious. \u201cYou two need to be careful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just teasing each other,\u201d Ana told him, frowning.</p><p>Mike shook his head impatiently. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about you and Dan. I\u2019m talking about you and Christie. I was watching the news earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were warning women to be careful. There\u2019s been a murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA murder?\u201d Christina asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about the woman they found along the highway?\u201d Ana asked.</p><p>Mike nodded. \u201cYou must have heard about it, even down in Miami,\u201d he said to Christina.</p><p>\u201cI did. But it was just one woman, right?\u201d Christina asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s got a lot of people around here worried. The killer is a copycat of the Interstate Killer,\u201d Mike told them.</p><p>\u201cI saw it on the news earlier, too,\u201d Ana said. \u201cIt sounded like they don\u2019t know if they really got the right guy to begin with, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is admitting that yet,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cCan it be the same guy?\u201d Christina asked. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not an expert, but I always thought that a killer like that escalated until he was killed or caught and locked away. Would a serial killer take a break that long?\u201d She felt vaguely uneasy. She knew that the so-called Interstate Killer had plagued the central part of the state a dozen years ago. She also knew that he had supposedly been killed.</p><p>And buried.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t take a break,\u201d Dan theorized aloud. \u201cMaybe he was gone...traveling from state to state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. They say that killers often keep on the move. Thank God for computers. They\u2019ve made a big difference,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cJed will know more about it,\u201d Ana said confidently.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. He wrote a book about the killings,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cJed wrote a novel,\u201d Ana said. \u201cBased loosely on real events.\u201d</p><p>Michael was quiet, frowning at Christina. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He shook his head, then pointed a finger at her. \u201cSherri Mason, the woman who was killed, was five feet eight inches tall, about one hundred and thirty pounds. She had blue eyes\u2014and long red hair.\u201d</p><p>They all stood in silence for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cWow. Thanks a lot for that,\u201d Christina said at last.</p> <p>Ana slipped a supportive arm around her friend\u2019s waist. \u201cWe can handle ourselves. It\u2019s the unwary who usually wind up in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d Michael said, and took a deep breath. \u201cChristie, you have to be careful. The last victims, twelve years ago...they were all tall. And all had light eyes and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd long red hair,\u201d Dan breathed softly.</p><p>\u201cJust like Sherri Mason,\u201d Mike said. \u201cWho was killed just the same way. As if she\u2019d been killed by...a ghost.\u201d</p><p>2</p> <p>J ed should have headed straight over to Christina\u2019s house, and in fact he had meant to.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>For some reason he found himself traveling down the road that led to one of the largest local cemeteries.</p><p>Beau Kidd had been laid to rest there. His parents and his sister, furious that Beau had been labeled a killer without a trial, grieving his death, had ordered a fine tombstone for him. A glorious angel in marble rested atop it, kneeling down in prayer.</p><p>It was dusk when he arrived, and the gates were closed, but the cemetery was one of the oldest in the area. Broken tombstones belonging to those who had served in the United States military as far back as the Seminole Wars could be found there. No one had ever spent the money for a high fence, so he was easily able to hop the low wall and enter. He knew this cemetery well. Too well, he thought.</p><p>Margaritte was buried here.</p> <p>But he hadn\u2019t come to mourn at her grave or feel sorry for himself. Not tonight.</p><p>He was losing it, he thought. Visiting a cemetery, as if Beau Kidd could talk to him from the grave and offer him help.</p><p>No, he told himself. He had simply decided to check on the monument, that was all. In the years after the killings and Kidd\u2019s own death, the tombstone had been vandalized several times. Then Beau Kidd\u2019s mother had appeared on television and made such a tearful plea to be let alone that the vandalism had stopped. No requests by law enforcement or even arrests could have put an end to the graffiti and damage the way her softly sobbed plea had done.</p><p>He could see the angel as he headed down the path. What surprised him was that he wasn\u2019t the only one who had come to check on Beau Kidd\u2019s grave tonight.</p><p>There was a young woman standing there. He frowned, for a moment thinking it might be Christina Hardy. This woman, too, had long red hair, and she was tall, slim and shapely, with elegantly straight posture.</p><p>But when she turned as Jed approached, he saw that though she was attractive, her features were quite different from Christina\u2019s. For one thing, her eyes were a pale yellow-green color, not a brilliant blue.</p><p>He didn\u2019t recognize her, but she obviously recognized him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cKatherine Kidd, Beau\u2019s sister,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Sorry, but I know who you are. You\u2019re an opportunist. You wrote a book about my brother. As if the events weren\u2019t painful enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote a work of fiction,\u201d he said. Why defend himself? He should just let her lambaste him. That might work out better for both of them.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here? Do you want to hammer a stake into my brother\u2019s heart? Do you think he\u2019s alive and killing again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>He turned to go.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re lost, your wife\u2019s grave is nowhere near here,\u201d she called after him.</p><p>He squared his shoulders and kept walking.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>He was startled when she ran after him. Her eyes were troubled when she awkwardly touched his arm to get him to turn around. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know, exactly. I guess...I wanted to think. Honestly, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau was never the killer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so certain?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was my brother.\u201d</p><p>He let out a soft sigh. \u201cYou do know that every homicidal maniac is some mother\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you investigated when you wrote your book. I know you were a cop. And I know you have a license now as a private investigator. You came here because you\u2019re feeling guilty for what you did to my brother\u2019s reputation. You want absolution? Fine. Prove that\u2019s not just a copycat out there. Prove Beau was innocent.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, unable to think of anything to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay you,\u201d she offered suddenly.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. No, you won\u2019t pay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really believe in Beau\u2019s innocence, do you? Not even now, with the evidence lying in the morgue,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I believe right now,\u201d he told her honestly.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve read every word let out by the police, the newspapers, every single source. No copycat could be so exact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet just how exact he was,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI do. And I know that Beau wasn\u2019t a killer, no matter how guilty he looked. And you...you used him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used a story, a real-life story,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to investigate, but no one owes me anything. I guess that\u2019s why I was here tonight. This one is between the two of us, Beau and me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He nodded and walked away again. When he looked back, she was standing where he had left her, looking bereft and alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you informed\u2014when I can prove something,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He thought that she smiled as she lifted a hand to wave goodbye.</p><p>There was a low ground fog beginning to rise. Looking up, he saw that the moon was full. Odd night. Most of the time around here, the fog came in the early morning. Between the moon and the fog, the cemetery seemed to be bathed in some kind of eerie glow.</p><p>As he headed to his car, he thought about Sherri Mason, lying on the autopsy table. Sherri...tall, slim, with long red hair.</p><p>Before he knew it, he was heading back into the cemetery. \u201cKatherine!\u201d he shouted, running.</p><p>She was standing by her brother\u2019s monument again. She looked up, startled.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get out of here,\u201d he told her. She stared at him blankly. \u201cIt\u2019s dark, and there\u2019s a killer loose. Where\u2019s your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlong the street, just past the gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She sounded unconvinced, but she didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>He walked her to the Honda parked by the curb. She must have arrived after the cemetery had officially closed, as well. She slid behind the driver\u2019s seat and lowered the window. He ducked down to talk to her, but before he could speak, she said, \u201cI know, long red hair. I\u2019ll be careful, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-four, but I still live with my folks. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as she turned her key in the ignition, and he watched the Honda\u2019s lights disappear into the fog.</p><p>He stood there for a long moment, feeling a strange sensation of dread grip his spine like an iron claw. Beautiful women with long red hair.</p><p>Christina Hardy fell into that category, as well.</p><p>He had lost her tonight, thanks to the cop-turned-writer.</p><p>But he would prevail. He would behave normally. He was a special person, unique; amazing things went on in his mind. He could walk, talk, smile and act completely normal, and all the while he would be planning his next kill.</p><p>But there had been an almost frightening moment when he had felt as if he might combust, the opportunity had been so good.</p><p>She had been there, so appetizing.</p><p>He made himself breathe, told himself to function. There was his world, his inner world, and then there was the world beyond. Sometimes he could combine them, but it was over now.</p><p>Still, there had been those moments when he had almost been able to taste and feel the results of his brilliance. He had come here tonight by happenstance, unable to resist a visit to the grave of the man who had taken the blame for everything he himself had done all those years ago. And then...to see Kidd\u2019s sister...</p><p>It was too good.</p><p>She was such a pretty thing. All that lovely hair...</p><p>Then he\u2019d shown up.</p><p>Jed Braden was big and broad-shouldered, clearly capable of holding his own in a fight.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter. The point lay in his own brilliance, not in something as crass as a physical fight. He loved watching the dumb fucks chase their tails while he went gleefully about his business.</p><p>God, he loved the press. The newscasters were so grave when they talked about the latest killing. Then, with the switch of a camera angle, a smile instead of a somber look. Suddenly it was \u201cLots of fun on tap for Halloween this year.\u201d</p><p>But at home, watching their plasma TVs, the viewers would be reeling. No change in camera angle for them. A killer was on the loose....</p><p>The experts were all baffled. It would never be like the crime shows. He was far too intelligent. There would be no solving his murders in a one-hour show.</p><p>How he loved the attention. His double life. Defying profilers and \u201cbehavioralists,\u201d knowing they were more confused than ever now.</p><p>And all thanks to his own brilliance.</p><p>Breathe. Be ready. Walk, talk, smile, and all while the other world lived on in his mind. The time would come again\u2014and soon\u2014when it would become real once again.</p><p>\u201cQuit staring at me. You\u2019re giving me chills,\u201d Christina said to her cousins.</p><p>Mike shook his head, looking away. \u201cI just want you to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am careful. I\u2019ve always been careful. I never go anywhere with strangers. I\u2019m street smart, honest. You guys know that,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust keep your doors locked, okay?\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m always careful.

Christina wasn\u2019t sure why, but she was sorry she\u2019d kept the damn thing around. Ana seemed way too enamored of it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tony from next door,\u201d Mike said when he returned a minute later, two more people in his wake. \u201cAnd his fianc\u00e9e,\u201d he added, stressing the word.</p><p>Tony went over to Christina, took her shoulders and gave her a peck on the cheek. He\u2019d been a gaunt, geeky boy, but he\u2019d grown into a tall, well-built man. His eyes were gray, his hair sandy-colored, and his nose and ears were no longer too big for his face.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Tony, thanks for coming,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cNasty fog out there,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even see your house from mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpooky,\u201d Ilona agreed.</p><p>\u201cChristina, you remember Ilona, don\u2019t you?\u201d Ana asked.</p><p>\u201cWe met at the funeral,\u201d Ilona said, stepping forward to take Christina\u2019s hand. She had a warm grip and sympathetic green eyes. She was slim, with long, straight blond hair and a pleasant way about her.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course we met,\u201d Christina said warmly. \u201cCongratulations. I didn\u2019t know the two of you were engaged. When\u2019s the big day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, we haven\u2019t planned that far ahead yet,\u201d Ilona said.</p><p>\u201cI say we ask the Ouija board,\u201d Ana suggested.</p><p>\u201cI say we have a beer and some barbecue,\u201d Mike protested from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right, but then we do the Ouija board,\u201d Ana insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jed? Should we wait for him before we eat?\u201d Christina asked.</p><p>\u201cMy dear cousin will get here in his own good time,\u201d Ana said. \u201cHe can eat when he gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Christina agreed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat, then,\u201d Dan said.</p> <p>\u201cWorked up a real appetite being a fluffy, huh?\u201d Ana teased.</p><p>Dan gave her a fake scowl as they all moved into the kitchen and started eating.</p><p>The conversation was general and pleasant as it moved from topic to topic. It turned out that Ilona had originally come from Ohio, which led to a discussion about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Nice, easy stuff.</p><p>So why, Christina kept wondering, was she feeling so on edge?</p><p>Ilona asked Christina about her work, and she explained that writing advertising jingles was more difficult than most people thought, as well as a crucial element in selling the product. \u201cIf you can get people to remember a jingle, then they\u2019ll remember the product,\u201d she explained. As she spoke, she could hear Dan, Mike and Tony talking about the murdered woman who had been found beside the highway.</p><p>When everyone seemed to have finished eating, Ana reached over for Christina\u2019s plate. \u201cDone with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleanup time?\u201d Dan said, noticing. \u201cLet me help.\u201d He came over with a large garbage bag and they all tossed their paper plates into it. \u201cGran wasn\u2019t the type to let any of us get away without picking up after ourselves, right, Christie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But,\u201d she added, smiling to take any sting out of the words, \u201cit\u2019s easier when all you have to do is grab a garbage bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran made us scour her copper collection every Sunday,\u201d Mike put in, a nostalgic smile curving his lips.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and it was a pain in the butt,\u201d Dan said, and grinned at Christina. \u201cYou gonna keep all that copper glowing forever?\u201d he asked. His eyes indicated the array of copper pans and molds lining the special racks their grandfather had constructed to hold the collection.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBetter you than me,\u201d Dan told her, laughing.</p><p>\u201cChristina was always the keeper of the keys,\u201d Tony said, lifting his beer to her.</p><p>\u201cThe keys?\u201d Ilona said, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cChristie was always the one who loved all the old family stuff,\u201d Tony explained. He sounded slightly impatient.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ilona said in a cool tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tony murmured, pulling her close.</p><p>\u201cGet a room,\u201d Dan teased.</p><p>Ilona laughed softly, blushing, and drew away from Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they get a room when they have a perfectly good house?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cForget it, it\u2019s Ouija board time,\u201d Ana announced.</p><p>\u201cThe parlor is a mess,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cWe can just sit on the floor,\u201d Ana said, waving away her objection. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with Tony and Ilona. Maybe the Ouija board can give us a wedding date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Tony said with a shrug.</p><p>Ilona giggled. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we dim the lights or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Mike asked with a shrug, moving to the switch that controlled the lights.</p><p>Dan made a sound as if a soft and wicked wind were moving through the room.</p><p>Christina, arms folded against her chest as she leaned against the arched doorway, groaned.</p><p>Ilona and Tony set their fingers on the planchette, which began to move, finally settling over the J.</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d Ana breathed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotta be at least July,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not ready yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d Mike said as the planchette started moving around erratically. \u201cShe wants January, he won\u2019t be ready until July, and poor Mr. Ouija doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pushing it,\u201d Tony accused Ilona.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014you\u2019re pushing it,\u201d Ilona protested.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take it so seriously. It\u2019s just a game,\u201d Mike said lightly, as if aware that a real argument was in the offing.</p><p>And that was all that it was: a game, Christina reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cFingers barely touching the planchette,\u201d Ana advised. \u201cChristina, come over here and help me show them how to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right. But we\u2019re not doing this all night,\u201d Christina protested. She flashed a smile at Ilona. \u201cI want to learn more about how you and Tony got together. Who cares when the wedding is? We\u2019ll all have a good time whenever you choose to have it\u2014if we\u2019re invited, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re invited,\u201d Ilona said.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Ana said. \u201cJust get down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it dark enough? Want it spookier?\u201d Dan teased.</p><p>\u201cThat fog is spooky enough,\u201d Ilona said, and shivered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just fog,\u201d Christina said, barely managing not to shout. Damn. It wasn\u2019t like her to be so edgy, but it was unnerving to realize how closely she fit the description of the victim of a serial killer.</p><p>Either a copycat...</p><p>Or a maniac who had somehow escaped detection for twelve years.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the moon,\u201d Ilona added.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking werewolves?\u201d Tony teased her.</p><p>\u201cThere are enough real monsters out there,\u201d Christina said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to make up more.\u201d</p><p>There was a sudden uncomfortable silence in the room. She realized she had snapped out the words rather than simply speaking them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quickly. What was wrong with her? It was just...</p><p>It was just that stupid Ouija board and the idea of talking to spirits. She suddenly found the past welling up in her mind, a vision that was far too real. She could see Gran, after her grandfather had died. Sitting in her chair, looking at her so somberly. She\u2019d dreamed that she\u2019d talked to her grandfather. A psychology professor had once told her that such dreams were defense mechanisms, a way to reconcile oneself to losing someone. But Gran had said, \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous. You have opened a door....\u201d</p><p>That was just Gran and the Irish speaking. She had never had such dreams again. Not even when she had lost her parents.</p><p>All of that was far behind her now. She was a perfectly rational, sane person, and it was just the Irish sense of fun that made them all pretend to believe in banshees and leprechauns and even dreams.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ana, let\u2019s show everybody how it\u2019s done,\u201d she said, then lowered her voice teasingly. \u201cIt was a dark and stormy night...no, it was a dark and foggy night, with a strange, full moon rising above the mist.\u201d</p><p>Her light banter didn\u2019t seem to be helping her mood any, she thought, and apparently it was obvious.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Christie?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cMy fault,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to snap at anyone. I guess I\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really okay?\u201d Dan said softly.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Come on, Ana. Let\u2019s do this Ouija thing and be done with it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Ouija board,\u201d Ana said, as if she were greeting an old friend.</p><p>Christina forced a grin, then set her fingertips very lightly on the planchette, which took off, slowly spelling out \u201cHello, good evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a spirit in you tonight, Ouija board?\u201d Ana asked.</p><p>\u201cIs she for real?\u201d Christina heard Tony whisper to Dan.</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d Dan replied.</p><p>\u201cReal? Real is what we make it,\u201d Mike put in.</p><p>Christina knew that she wasn\u2019t moving the planchette, so Ana had to be the one causing it to spell out the answer.</p><p>\u201cY-E-S,\u201d Ilona read softly.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Ana asked.</p><p>They all stared as the planchette began to move again and Dan read aloud, \u201cB-E-A-U-K-I-D-D...Bookid?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt must mean boo, kid,\u201d Mike said. \u201cBoo, like Halloween.

Beau, like a man\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike General Beauregard, the Confederate military leader,\u201d Tony offered. \u201cRight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeau Kidd. The detective who was supposedly the Interstate Killer!\u201d Dan gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou did that on purpose!\u201d Mike accused Ana.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I did,\u201d she retorted adamantly.</p><p>\u201cThe thing moves by the power of suggestion,\u201d Mike said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cAsk him what he wants,\u201d Dan said. \u201cWatch\u2014it will spell out, \u2018I was framed. I\u2019m innocent.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Ana asked the spirit softly, ignoring Dan.</p><p>Christina gritted her teeth, longing to lift her fingers from the planchette, but somehow she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to do it.</p><p>The planchette continued to move.</p><p>It was Ana, damn her. She had to be forcing it.</p><p>But what was really unnerving Christina was that she didn\u2019t think Ana was forcing it.</p><p>Dan whispered behind them, \u201cPuh-lease. You\u2019d think we were still teenagers, telling scary stories out in the woods.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe quiet. It\u2019s spelling something,\u201d Ana said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cH-E,\u201d Mike began.</p><p>\u201cL-P,\u201d Dan finished.</p><p>\u201cHelp,\u201d Ilona breathed.</p><p>\u201cHang on, it\u2019s not finished,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cThey must be moving it,\u201d Tony whispered to Ilona. \u201cBut they\u2019re good. Spooky, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Help,\u2019 again,\u201d Mike said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting kind of monotonous, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>What other letters added to \u201chelp\u201d would make another word? Christina wondered as the planchette kept moving.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Help me please,\u2019\u201d Dan whispered.</p><p>The planchette was practically racing around the board.</p><p>Help me please help me please help me please....</p><p>Then, suddenly, it came to a definite stop in the middle of the board.</p><p>The room fell dead silent, even the doubters momentarily spellbound.</p><p>A thunderous knocking broke the silence and brought a scream from Ilona\u2019s lips. As if in response, the planchette seemed to rise and soar straight into the air.</p><p>And then they heard the front door burst open.</p><p>3</p><p>\u201cW hat the hell?\u201d Dan demanded.</p><p>Jed stared back at his old family friend, wondering why he looked so spooked. Okay, maybe he\u2019d opened the door a bit more forcefully than necessary, but it hadn\u2019t been locked.</p><p>Although even if it had been locked, he would have forced it open, anyway, he had to admit.</p><p>He was definitely on edge, he thought, but he\u2019d also heard someone scream.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Jed said to Dan. \u201cWhat the hell is going on in here? I heard a scream.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes. \u201cSorry.\u201d He stepped back so Jed could come in and closed\u2014and locked\u2014the door after him. \u201cGood to see you, Jed. The screamer was Ilona, Tony\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. She got spooked after Ana insisted on playing with the Ouija board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the dim lights, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Daniel agreed dryly.</p><p>By then they had reached the parlor and Ana leapt up and rushed over to meet him, giving him a quick hug. \u201cYou made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d come,\u201d he told her, looking past her to Christina Hardy, who was slowly rising. She was one of those women with the ability to do normally awkward things with the sinuous grace of curling ivy. She walked over, a small smile on her face, and gave him a quick, friendly hug in greeting. \u201cWelcome. There\u2019s still barbecue in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m famished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Jed,\u201d Mike said. \u201cYou know Tony, but have you met Ilona?\u201d</p><p>Jed nodded toward the woman at Tony\u2019s side. They\u2019d met briefly at the funeral. \u201cNice to see you again,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d Ilona said.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Jed\u2019s a famous writer?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really famous,\u201d Jed said quickly, embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, guess what name those two\u2014\u201d Mike paused to indicate Ana and Christina \u201c\u2014just dredged up. Beau Kidd.\u201d</p><p>Jed frowned. Even if his nerves hadn\u2019t already been on edge, the name would have stung. Damn it, he thought. He hadn\u2019t caused what had happened to the cop. He had just built fiction around the facts of what had already happened.</p><p>Yeah. Fiction that clearly skewered the man.</p><p>\u201cBeau Kidd?\u201d he said, and he knew that his voice was harsh.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jed, don\u2019t sound so mad. We were just playing with the Ouija board,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>\u201cAfter talking about the recent murder,\u201d Dan explained.</p><p>\u201cOuija board?\u201d Jed said skeptically.</p><p>\u201cHey, blame Ana, not me,\u201d Christina said lightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, it spelled out his name,\u201d Ana said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cCome in the kitchen, I\u2019ll warm up some food for you,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Ana teased. \u201cHe used to be a cop. He even eats cold pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you don\u2019t have to eat cold barbecue,\u201d Christina said firmly, then stared at him with those crystal-blue eyes of hers and smiled slowly. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged a little awkwardly. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She strode past him, smooth and sleek. He followed.</p><p>She was already reaching into the refrigerator by the time he stepped into the kitchen. She handed him a beer.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s it going?\u201d she asked after he thanked her, helping herself to one, as well, and leaning back against the counter. A subtle grin curved her lips. \u201cWhen does your next book come out?\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cLast month, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have kept up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazingly, the entire world doesn\u2019t rush out to the store the minute a book of mine comes out.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m one of Ana\u2019s best friends. I should have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even all of Ana\u2019s friends rush out the minute I have a book on the shelves,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>She smiled and dug into the refrigerator again. He realized with an inner smile that she had planned for his arrival as she pulled out a microwave-ready plate with chicken, ribs and corn on the cob.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been lying when he\u2019d said he was hungry. He\u2019d showered, and the smell of the autopsy room no longer seemed to fill his nostrils.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t forget the dead woman or what had happened at the cemetery.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t forget that Christina Hardy was a beautiful redhead.</p><p>He warned himself to get his thoughts under control. He couldn\u2019t let himself become obsessed with this, couldn\u2019t let it consume him and everyone around him.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s it going in jingle land?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s your latest?\u201d</p><p>Her smile deepened as she played with the dial on the microwave. \u201c\u2018Come to the Grand, walk on the sand, hear the steel band, sunsets and glory, the minute you land,\u2019\u201d she sang lightly.</p><p>\u201cThat was you? I hear it all the time,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great resort,\u201d she told him. \u201cI was given a comp weekend when I was hired, so I got to check it out for free. It\u2019s one of those all-inclusive places. Really nice. You step out from your private bungalow right onto the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice work if you can get it,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cAs long as I am working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this place is worth a mint,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d panhandle before I sold this house,\u201d she assured him passionately, then seemed embarrassed by the emotion she had betrayed. She offered him a wry smile. \u201cHmm. And are you suggesting I won\u2019t get work?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNever,\u201d he vowed solemnly.</p><p>The microwave beeped. She reached in for his plate, and he walked over to take it from her. The scent of barbecue was strong, but her perfume was more alluring. He remembered how, years ago, he had thought she was a pain in the butt and wished she and Ana would go away.</p><p>Things certainly changed, he thought wryly.</p><p>She smiled and brushed by on her way to get him a fork, knife and napkin. His muscles tightened. Hell, yes, things changed.</p><p>Ana appeared in the kitchen. \u201cHurry up,\u201d she said to Christina. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who can make that stupid Ouija board work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing anything,\u201d Christina protested.</p><p>Jed felt his muscles tighten again, and not in a good way.</p><p>\u201cBeau Kidd?\u201d he said to Christina.</p><p>She flushed. \u201cI swear, I didn\u2019t make it do anything,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to be so brusque. She barely moved, but he could feel her stiffen from across the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I worry, okay?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI know. I\u2019m a redhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA beautiful redhead,\u201d he told her, trying to atone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big kid, and I\u2019ve lived on my own for a long time now. I don\u2019t do stupid things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t assume that all victims are stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. But I am careful,\u201d she told him. \u201cReally.\u201d She was irritated. Why not? It was a good cover-up for being frightened.</p><p>She walked out of the kitchen, toward the parlor. He followed her, keeping his distance and stopping in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cYou made that name\u2014Beau Kidd\u2014appear,\u201d Mike said, staring accusingly at Christina.</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell didn\u2019t,\u201d she replied, and her voice betrayed her annoyance. \u201cTwelve years ago, I was thirteen and my mom turned the news off every time something came on TV that she thought I shouldn\u2019t know about. In fact, my parents used to argue about it. My dad thought I needed to be aware of what was going on in the world, but my mom just thought I was too young to know some things\u2014no, a lot of things.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou still must have heard the name,\u201d Dan said.

Beau Kidd did it himself, because there is no copycat killer and he wants us to know he\u2019s innocent,\u201d Mike murmured dryly.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Ana said. \u201cAnd maybe his spirit did move the planchette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re scaring me,\u201d Jed teased his cousin.</p><p>She frowned, staring at him with a stubborn set to her jaw. \u201cOh, right, Mr. He-man. There\u2019s no possibility that anything you haven\u2019t seen for yourself could possibly be real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the phrase? A ghost in the machine?\u201d Tony said, his tone light, as if he were hoping to lift the tension that had suddenly filled the room.</p><p>\u201cIf there were a ghost here, it would be Gran, yelling at us,\u201d Dan said, grinning, and evoking smiles from the others at last.</p> <p>\u201cWas she mean?\u201d Ilona asked.</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no,\u201d Christina said. \u201cBut she had a very clear vision of right and wrong.\u201d She flashed a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d be yelling. We haven\u2019t messed anything up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she wasn\u2019t all that fond of the way I\u2019m running my life,\u201d Dan said, shrugging. \u201cI tried to explain to her that I intend to be more than Raccoon Ralph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you will be,\u201d Christina said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be Zeus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And Halloween is around the corner. I\u2019ll get to play some pretty scary stuff,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cThe three-year-olds are trembling in their boots,\u201d Ana teased, then suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we ask the Ouija board when you\u2019ll get your big break?\u201d</p> <p>Mike groaned. \u201cI\u2019m getting another beer.\u201d He started down the hall, almost crashing into Jed, who was still standing in the doorway. \u201cBeer?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, one more,\u201d Jed said, heading to the kitchen with him.</p><p>A few seconds later, they heard a loud and startled clamor from the parlor.</p><p>They frowned at each other and rushed back to the other room. Jed was in the lead, and when he reached the arched doorway, he was almost hit in the head with the planchette.</p><p>\u201cHey, who threw that?\u201d he demanded. Ducking had saved him from a good shot right in the face.</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d Ana said, pointing to Christina.</p><p>\u201cI did not!\u201d Christina protested.</p><p>Ana met his eyes, looking more than a little scared. \u201cIt...it was like it got mad and flew cross the room,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAna, get a life,\u201d Jed snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Mike demanded from just behind Jed.</p><p>\u201cWe asked it if Dan was going to get the part he wants,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it spelled out \u2018help\u2019 again,\u201d Ilona said, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pulling your leg, Ilona,\u201d Mike told her.</p><p>Ana let out a long, aggrieved sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Let\u2019s put the stupid thing away,\u201d Christina said. Without waiting for anyone to agree, she reached for the box.</p><p>\u201cThrow the stupid thing away,\u201d Dan suggested.</p><p>\u201cChristina, throw an old treasure away?\u201d Tony teased. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I don\u2019t throw anything away. You might recall a box I packed up when a few people forgot about it after one Christmas dinner,\u201d Christina said, looking from Mike to Dan and smiling complacently.</p><p>\u201cYes, and we appreciate it,\u201d Dan said, then explained to the others. \u201cWe got bonds for Christmas one year when we were kids. We forgot all about them, but Christina stuck them in a box and held on to it. Our bonds matured and ended up being worth a bundle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we thank her for it,\u201d Mike said, then turned to Christina. \u201cWant me to help you pack anything up?\u201d he asked as he turned up the dimmer switch.</p><p>\u201cNo, but thank you for the appreciation.\u201d She rose from the floor as gracefully as ever.</p><p>Dan yawned, then apologized. \u201cSorry, but I\u2019ve got to go. I\u2019m on first shift tomorrow. Costuming at seven in the morning for the eight o\u2019clock breakfast. This was fun. Thanks, Ana. Christina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should take off, too,\u201d Jed said, anxious to get away. He still couldn\u2019t get the autopsy off his mind, and the last thing he needed was to spend the evening at a party where the conversation kept turning to Beau Kidd.</p><p>\u201cChristina, Ana, thanks for dinner, and, Christie, welcome to the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d she said, and walked over to him for a brief hug. There was still something reserved between them.</p><p>His fault, she decided as he waved to the others and started toward the door.</p><p>\u201cThis is your home, too, just like always,\u201d he heard Christina tell her cousins as they followed a few steps behind.</p><p>\u201cThanks, kid,\u201d Dan told her. \u201cBut one day you might have a sex life, and you wouldn\u2019t want us walking in on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about my little cousin\u2019s sex life, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather walk in on it?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>\u201cOutta here,\u201d Mike said firmly.</p><p>Jed was almost at the door, but he still overheard the last remarks from the group in the parlor.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was with Jed tonight?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Beau Kidd thing,\u201d Ana said. \u201cWhen he wrote his book, he was sure Kidd was guilty, but now he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jed headed out the door to his Jeep and gunned the engine.</p><p>Ana was right.</p><p>Ana left a few minutes later with Tony and Ilona. Dan and Mike had offered to drive her home, but Tony had assured them that he and Ilona would see her safely inside. Ana had bought her parents\u2019 house when they had retired down to their place in the Keys, so she\u2019d never moved once in her life. And at the price of real estate, she was lucky\u2014as Christina was herself.</p><p>Christina locked the front door as the stragglers left. One thing she didn\u2019t have was an alarm system. Something she should probably consider in the future, she decided.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much to do as far as cleaning up; paper plates for food that had arrived in cardboard cartons didn\u2019t create much of a mess. She was done in five minutes.</p><p>When the water stopped running, the house seemed almost painfully silent.</p><p>She walked back into the parlor and immediately noticed the Ouija board. \u201cYou suck,\u201d she muttered. Her eyes moved over the many boxes littering the room.</p><p>For some reason, all those boxes made her feel uneasy. The fact that the house didn\u2019t have an alarm\u2014which had never bothered her before\u2014now made her even more uneasy. The silence weighed on her.</p><p>And she wished to God they had never played with the stupid Ouija board.</p><p>She found herself walking around, turning on every light in the house. She even turned on the plasma television in the living room, thinking the noise would be good.</p><p>The news came on instantly.</p><p>\u201cAs is common in such cases,\u201d an attractive young anchorwoman was saying, \u201cthere was evidence that the police didn\u2019t share with the public when the Interstate Killer was at work twelve years ago. The police have not yet commented on whether or not the murder of Sherri Mason shares any of those confidential similarities or not. As you may be aware, the Interstate Killer\u2019s spree ended with the death of the man who had become the prime suspect, Detective Beau Kidd. Kidd was familiar with two of the victims, who\u2014\u201d</p><p>Christina was tempted to throw the remote control across the room; she hit the power-off switch instead.</p><p>Groaning, she rechecked the front door, turned off the lights and started up the stairs.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t taken over her grandmother\u2019s room, and she wouldn\u2019t. It was going to be her guest room, she had decided.</p><p>\u201cBeau Kidd, indeed,\u201d she murmured aloud in annoyance when she reached her own room. \u201cIf this house is haunted, it\u2019s haunted by Granda and Gran. Good people who loved me.\u201d</p><p>She had never felt afraid in this house, and she was angry that the night\u2019s events had left her feeling so unnerved.</p><p>So she was a redhead. There were lots of redheads out there, natural and otherwise. It was a popular color.</p><p>She locked her doors. She didn\u2019t go off with strangers. She was careful.</p><p>She looked around her room, the same room she\u2019d always stayed in as a child. It had changed a great deal over the years. She had a new bed, for one thing\u2014a Christmas present from a few years ago. It was a queen, with a handsome cherry-wood sleigh-style frame. Her dresser and wardrobe matched, as did the artfully concealed entertainment center.</p><p>She headed straight to it, turning on the television and finding a channel with nothing but sitcom repeats.</p><p>\u201cSo there. I will have no news tonight,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her voice rang strangely loud in the empty house. She was glad when the sound of the television filled the space.</p><p>She was even more pleased when a commercial with a jingle she had written popped up on the screen. \u201cEver soft, ever silky, ever gentle to the touch, oh, dear Biel\u2019s Tissue, we thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>Not poetry or even her most brilliant lyric, but it was a good, catchy tune.</p><p>She smiled, walked into the bathroom and slipped into the cotton sleep shirt that hung on the back of the door, then washed her face and brushed her teeth. A few minutes later she drew back her covers and settled beneath the clean, cool comfort of her sheets.</p><p>And she stared at the television, not seeing a thing.</p><p>She rose again and turned on the lights she had turned off earlier. She was certain that from the street, her house was lit up like a Christmas tree. She turned the television down, plumped her pillow and closed her eyes, hoping that the soft drone of the sitcom would help her sleep. It wasn\u2019t as if she had anything imperative going on early in the morning; she was just going to finish setting up the house and emptying boxes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she was tired. She wanted to sleep.</p><p>She tossed around for a while, forcing herself to lie still with her eyes closed, half listening to the television.</p><p>Then, head on the pillow, eyes closed, she felt a strange prickling sensation. She couldn\u2019t pinpoint anything different about the air around her or the sounds she was hearing. It was an old house, and it creaked. But she knew every creak, and she wasn\u2019t hearing anything she shouldn\u2019t have been.</p> <p>But the sensation stayed with her.</p><p>She felt as if she were a child again, frightened as she watched a spooky movie, closing her eyes...</p><p>If this had been a movie, though, she would have felt compelled to open her eyes, but this was real life, and she fought the desire. If she kept her eyes closed, she would be all right. It would be like hiding beneath the bed or taking refuge in a closet.</p><p>I won\u2019t. I won\u2019t open my eyes, she thought. And it will go away.</p><p>But the feeling didn\u2019t go away, and finally she had to open her eyes and look into the shadows, just to prove that there was nothing there.</p> <p>She opened one eye slowly.</p><p>If felt as if her blood congealed and her heart froze.</p><p>She closed her eye again. She must have imagined what she thought she\u2019d seen. A shadow. A shadow in the shape of a man. Standing at the end of the bed.</p><p>Her frozen heart began to thunder.</p><p>A normal response, she told herself, given that there was a killer on the loose.</p><p>This was all nonsense, she thought. No one could possibly be there.</p> <p>She opened both eyes, bolting up to a sitting position at the same time.</p><p>Someone was there.</p><p>A tall, solid, yet somehow shadowy figure standing at the foot of her bed.</p><p>Christina screamed and leapt out of bed, then practically flew out of the room.</p><p>She raced to the door, out to the hall and down the stairs. She burst out the front door, onto the porch and leapt over the two steps that led to the ground. She ran until she reached the end of the driveway, and then she finally turned back, gasping, checking to see if he was in pursuit.</p><p>It was difficult to see, though, because it was such a strange night. The fog was still lying low to the ground, while above, shimmering through with an illumination like silver, was the great orb of the full moon.</p><p>Instinct was kicking in. Fog or not, she would see him coming from the front of the house, and he clearly wasn\u2019t in pursuit. But she didn\u2019t have her keys. That was okay; she could just go next door to Tony\u2019s house, and she would be safe.</p><p>In her mind\u2019s eye, she pictured the figure coming after her, catching her, tackling her right before she could reach Tony\u2019s door.</p> <p>Then there was a tap on her shoulder.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>Spun around.</p><p>Screamed.</p><p>He was there.</p><p>It was impossible, but he was there. He\u2019d somehow gotten out of the house without her seeing and ended up behind her.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t a shadow, either. Not only that, she had seen his face before.</p><p>It took her a moment to remember where she had seen it, and when.</p><p>Then she knew.</p><p>She had seen it, plastered all over the newspapers after Beau Kidd had been shot kneeling over the body of his latest victim.</p><p>\u201cChristie...\u201d</p><p>Did he say her name, or was it the breeze? Or was she only deep in some horrible nightmare where the dew-damp grass beneath her bare toes was ridiculously real and the face of the man before her was bizarrely vivid?</p><p>\u201cChristie...\u201d</p><p>The world seemed to be fading, getting lost in the fog.</p><p>\u201cPlease...help me.\u201d</p><p>She had never passed out before in her life, but she did then, dropping flat onto soft, wet earth, seeing nothing but stygian darkness.</p><p>4</p><p>\u201cH ey.\u201d</p><p>Christina became aware of the deep, rich voice at the same time as she felt the chilling discomfort of the ground beneath her.</p><p>The sun was rising, she realized, feeling completely disoriented.</p><p>\u201cChristie?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. The sun created a haze as it burned off the last of the fog, so she blinked again, turning her head slightly to make out someone standing above her. For a moment she felt a resurgence of fear. But the sunlight was bright, and when she blinked a third time, her vision cleared and she finally saw who was standing there.</p><p>Jed Braden.</p><p>He hunkered down by her side.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d His tone was anxious, harsh.</p><p>She realized that she was lying on her lawn and frowned.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he demanded anxiously, his hands on her shoulders, his face close, his features tense.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not hurt. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She saw relief fill his face.</p><p>\u201cFine? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re alive,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She struggled to rise up on her elbows. \u201cI guess I...fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d he said. His voice hardened to a sharper edge. \u201cYou told me you were smart, remember? You said you didn\u2019t do stupid things.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. She must have had a nightmare. She couldn\u2019t possibly have seen the ghost of Beau Kidd. There in the light of day, the idea was just too ridiculous. But she really was lying on the grass, so she really had run out of the house. And she had run because someone had been there. Hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>She blurted the words without thinking. \u201cThere was someone in my house.\u201d</p><p>Jed stared at her, slowly arching a brow. \u201cSomeone was in your house?\u201d He sounded both concerned and doubtful.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Anxiety tightened his features. \u201cSo someone broke in and chased you out, then...forced you to sleep on the ground?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, there was a man at the foot of my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re also telling me you weren\u2019t attacked, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was just...there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaring at me. I...felt him there, opened my eyes and saw him, then jumped up and ran out,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cYou locked up, right? You made sure you locked up after everyone left?\u201d</p><p>He stood then, and reached down to help her to her feet. He was in jeans, a knit polo shirt and a casual suede jacket, towering and at ease. \u201cChristina, usually people run somewhere when they\u2019re running away from danger. They don\u2019t just curl up and go to sleep on the front lawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t just curl up and go to sleep!\u201d she flashed angrily.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristie, bad things are happening,\u201d he said softly, dark eyes on her like onyx. \u201cThis is no time to cry wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do that,\u201d she said, her temper growing, her tone an aggrieved growl.</p><p>\u201cAll right, so exactly what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came running out here and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>His voice went very soft then. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you weren\u2019t molested in any way?\u201d</p><p>Was she? She\u2019d passed out cold. But she hadn\u2019t been assaulted or anything. She was certain of it.</p><p>\u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t hurt. I wasn\u2019t even touched,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so this man broke into your house to stare at you and then did...what when you ran out? Ransacked the place?\u201d</p><p>No...somehow he moved faster than I did. He tapped me on the shoulder and scared me so badly I fainted. But she could hardly say that.</p><p>She lowered her head, lashes falling, flushing. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s take a look around, huh?\u201d He strode toward the house. For a moment she stood watching him; then she hurried after him.</p><p>\u201cJed, what are you doing here, anyway?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI came over to have coffee with Ana, and then I saw you lying out here.\u201d He motioned for her to stay on the porch, his face wearing a stern mask of warning.</p><p>\u201cHe could still be here,\u201d he said, and it made sense\u2014except that she knew he didn\u2019t believe her that anyone had been there in the first place.</p><p>But she knew he didn\u2019t dare ignore her. He might think that she was crazy, that she\u2019d had too much to drink while playing with the occult, but there was a killer in the area, and he couldn\u2019t take chances.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d be safer with you,\u201d she called as he disappeared into the house. \u201cIn all those slasher movies, when the guy goes off and leaves the girl she ends up dead!\u201d</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>She stood nervously on the porch, feeling like a fool. Despite the fact that this was Florida, autumn was well on the way, and she was chilled, standing there in her damp cotton nightgown and bare feet.</p><p>\u201cJed?\u201d</p><p>There was still no answer. She looked around, since there was nothing else to do. The day was coming on nicely. By midafternoon, it would be hot. The sky was crystal-blue now, but no doubt this afternoon the thunderclouds would come rolling through.</p><p>Jed returned at last, startling her out of her reverie as he stepped outside and shook his head. \u201cNothing. There\u2019s no one in there now.\u201d</p><p>She let out a long breath. \u201cJed, it was real. He was real. I opened my eyes, and I saw a man standing at the foot of my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll walk through the house together,\u201d he told her, the expression in his dark eyes an enigma. \u201cYou can see if anything is out of place.\u201d</p><p>She followed him into the house. \u201cUpstairs first?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Upstairs, the rooms that her family had claimed in earlier days were empty and undisturbed. Even in her bedroom, everything looked normal. The sheets were tossed back, as they had been when she bolted, but everything else looked just as she had left it.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Jed asked.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cYou and Ana shouldn\u2019t have been playing with that stupid Ouija board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so now you believe in Ouija boards?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I do believe in the power of suggestion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They traipsed downstairs. The kitchen was tidy, thanks to her efforts the night before. There was a last garbage bag waiting to go out, but that was it.</p><p>In the parlor, the boxes remained where they had been.</p><p>Too bad I don\u2019t have a ghost who wants to unpack for me, she thought.</p> <p>No. She didn\u2019t have a ghost at all. Besides, if anyone was haunting this place, it would be Gran, just as they\u2019d said last night. And she would be a stern but kindly ghost.</p><p>But of course there were no such things as ghosts, she told herself.</p><p>\u201cSo has anything been stolen?\u201d Jed asked. \u201cOr even moved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but wish that her hair wasn\u2019t sporting blades of grass, and that her cotton sleep shirt wasn\u2019t damp and hugging her uncomfortably.</p> <p>\u201cThe silver isn\u2019t missing?\u201d There was a dry note in his voice, she noticed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, increasingly upset.</p><p>Looking more disturbed than amused, he said, \u201cChristie, if someone really had been in the house, either something would be missing or you would have been followed out and attacked on the lawn.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around the parlor, and then she frowned.</p><p>The Ouija board.</p><p>It had been moved; she was certain of it.</p> <p>She had set it on top of some other boxes when they had finished with it the night before, but now...</p><p>Now it was back in the center of the floor.</p><p>\u201cThat moved,\u201d she said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jed asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Ouija board.\u201d</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d</p><p>He was so silent that she could have sworn she could hear every breath either one of them took and even their heartbeats.</p> <p>\u201cSit down, Christina,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>She looked at him, puzzled. Then she realized that he was trying to be patient and had reverted to being a cop trying to calm a distraught citizen.</p><p>\u201cChristina, I admit I wasn\u2019t a cop for all that long, but I never heard of anyone breaking into a house just to move a Ouija board.\u201d</p><p>She flashed him an irritated glance and stiffened, refusing to give him the satisfaction of sitting down as ordered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, when I went to bed last night, that box wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he said again. \u201cI can get you a glass of water or put some coffee on if that will help.\u201d He wasn\u2019t making fun of her, she knew. He was just treating her the same way he had when they\u2019d all been kids and he had five years\u2019 advantage over them.</p><p>\u201cJed, I\u2019m telling you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Let me talk,\u201d he said.</p><p>He pushed her down into one of the big wing chairs and hunkered down in front of her, taking her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. Trust me, I understand how hard it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristie, you have Dan and Mike, but other than that, you\u2019ve lost your entire family.\u201d His face hardened for a moment, and she knew why. He occasionally talked about his late wife, and sometimes he would smile or even laugh when he talked about something fun they had done.</p><p>But he never, ever spoke about the months of her illness or her actual death.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not sure you should keep this house,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI love this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re dangerously close to being haunted by it. By the house itself, by the memories, good and bad, of all the years here. When I lost Margaritte, I stayed in the house for a while. I couldn\u2019t part with any of her belongings. They even sent me to a police shrink. Eventually I gave her clothing to charities that could use it and only kept a few special mementos. And I sold the house and moved, because it was the only way I was ever going to stay sane.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him and squeezed his hand in comfort. There were so many stages of grief: shock, disbelief, anger...no, fury. Then, sometimes, a dullness. Acceptance. Enough time to learn that you would never forget. A time to forgive. And then...not peace, as some suggested, but at least gratitude for those who tried to help you, and an ability to function and move forward, because that was somehow ingrained alongside the survival instinct.</p><p>But she had already accepted her grandmother\u2019s death. Gran had lived a long life, and every memory she had that revolved around her grandparents was good.</p><p>The house, if it had a personality at all, was good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Really. And I love this house. Gran left it to me because she knew that. I\u2019ll never sell it,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut thank you for your concern.\u201d She cleared her throat. At another time in her life, she mused, she might have been thrilled to have Jed Braden practically on his knees in front of her, but this moment was far too raw for that. \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she said, indicating that she wanted to get up. He stood first, and since his hand was still on hers, he helped her up, too. \u201cDo you want coffee? Or something to eat?\u201d she offered.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, thanks. I need to get going. I have a few self-imposed deadlines today, but I\u2019m only a phone call away if you need me.\u201d</p><p>He did think she was crazy, she thought. Or at least emotionally fragile right now because of Gran\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cWe checked every room,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here. And like you said, no one breaks into a house just to move a Ouija board.\u201d</p><p>He smiled a little ruefully and reached for her, pulling a blade of grass from her hair. \u201cCall me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thank you,\u201d she said, and smiled at him. Like hell, she fumed in silence. That damned Ouija board had moved.</p><p>She managed to keep her smile in place as she walked him to the door.</p><p>\u201cChristina,\u201d he said gravely, then hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI know. There\u2019s a killer on the loose with a thing for redheads. I\u2019ll be very careful, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping on the lawn isn\u2019t being careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014Oh, never mind. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really am here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said, thinking, I had such a crush on you once, buddy.</p><p>He was still crush-worthy, she had to admit. The character worn into his features by life made him a striking man.</p><p>The fact that he was obviously patronizing her was a sharp wake-up slap, however.</p><p>\u201cThank, Jed. Thanks. I will call if I need you\u2014if there\u2019s a real problem,\u201d she assured him, and there was only a slight note of coldness in her tone.</p><p>If he heard it, he gave no sign, and left.</p><p>She closed and locked the door, then looked around. The house was silent. Then the old grandfather clock chimed out the hour of 8:00 a.m. and she jumped.</p><p>With an irritated sigh, she headed for the kitchen and the coffeemaker. While coffee brewed, she raced upstairs. She\u2019d been wearing those damp blades of grass just a little too long, and she had too much to do that day to be hanging around in her nightshirt.</p><p>Maybe she was crazy, she thought as she showered. Or at least more fragile than she had thought, too open to suggestion.</p><p>Because he was right. No one broke into a house just to move a Ouija board.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>Unless they wanted you to think you were crazy.</p><p>Police Detective Shot and Killed Disposing of Victim.</p><p>Police Detective Beau Kidd Identified as Interstate Killer.</p><p>The newspaper headlines gave no indication that Beau had only been the alleged killer. A little voice inside Jed nagged at him guiltily, even though he knew, rationally speaking, that if the department, the news and everyone else had condemned Beau Kidd, there was no reason why he shouldn\u2019t have done so, too.</p><p>He had seen the story as terrifying, horrible, sad\u2014and a lesson about how impossible it was to know even those closest to you, those who should be trustworthy. He had been completely convinced of Beau Kidd\u2019s guilt.</p><p>Now he was equally convinced he\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Sitting at his computer in his townhouse overlooking one of the area\u2019s natural lakes, Jed called up his files on the case. He stared at the names and ages of the previous victims as if some new truth would suddenly be revealed. Kelly Dunhill, twenty-four; Janet Major, twenty-eight; Denise Grant, thirty-one; Theodosia Wallace, twenty-two; and Grace Garcia, twenty-five. Only one of them, Grace, had come from the area, and she had been born in Tampa. The others had migrated south from four different states, Kelly from Tennessee, Janet from New York, Denise from Iowa and Theodosia from California. All had long red hair, ranging from strawberry-blonde to a deep, dark auburn. Their eye colors had been different, and their heights had ranged from five six to five nine. Each one had been found in the grass off one of the state\u2019s highways, naked, arms crossed over her chest. None had shown signs of torture, such as cigarette burns, but there had been bruises on the bodies, as if they had been pushed around when they were alive.</p><p>As if they had tried to fight their abductor.</p><p>They\u2019d all been sexually molested, but no semen had been recovered; their killer had used condoms. Nor had there been any flesh beneath their fingernails, so there was no way to test for DNA. The killer had been very careful.</p><p>The \u201cno\u2019s\u201d were endless.</p><p>No fingerprints, no DNA, no footprints, no cigarette butts found by the dump scenes. Simple physiology said that something was left behind when two bodies came together. But not in this case. Nothing of any use whatsoever had ever been discovered. It was baffling, and had been seen as indicating that someone in law enforcement or forensics had been involved.</p><p>He read through everything he had acquired from the newspapers and police files, hoping to see something, anything new, a spark of information or even misinformation that might help him. There was nothing.</p><p>He decided to take a trip down to his old precinct.</p><p>Christina looked around the house while she waited for a new singer, a local girl named Allison Chesney, to show up to work with her on a new nonfat potato chip commercial. The promotions department at the giant food manufacturer had chosen her because of one of her previous jingles, which had been filled with \u201cpep,\u201d or so her contact had told her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d managed to get rid of the boxes, storing most of them up in the attic\u2014a perk most of the houses in the area didn\u2019t have. She even had a basement, another rarity in the state. Going up to the attic and down to the basement had been a bit overwhelming. Why, she wondered, hadn\u2019t she realized just how much stuff she would find there? Despite that, there had been plenty of room for her boxes. In time, she promised herself, she would check out everything that was already there.</p><p>She sat down at the piano in the parlor, feeling happy as she ran through the jingle herself one more time. She was ready to try out Allison Chesney\u2019s sound, she decided, just as the doorbell rang.</p><p>Being smart, as she had promised everyone she would be, she looked through the peephole before opening the door. The young woman on the other side was a pretty brunette with flashing hazel eyes. As soon as Christina opened the door, she offered her hand with a shy smile. \u201cChristina? I\u2019m Allison.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, great to meet you. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your house?\u201d Allison said in awe as she stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s been in the family a long time,\u201d Christina replied. \u201cCan I get you something before we get started? Tea? Coffee? A bottle of water?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWater would be great, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake yourself comfortable in the parlor,\u201d Christina told her, pointing the way.</p><p>She got a bottle of water from the kitchen and returned to find Allison standing by the piano, looking out the bay window.</p><p>\u201cThis is really spectacular,\u201d Allison told her. \u201cI grew up in a place just like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Gainesville area.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty around there.\u201d</p><p>Allison laughed. \u201cPretty quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be too quiet. It\u2019s a university town,\u201d Christina reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and that\u2019s about it. But at least it\u2019s close to the action here. Well, action Florida-style. I thought I was so good when I was a kid that I was sure I\u2019d be a big deal in New York by now,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the way it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put yourself down. I listened to your demo,\u201d Christina told her. \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d She sat down at the piano bench and smiled in return. \u201cOr are you trying to tell me that doing jingle work is slumming it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good God, no!\u201d Allison said. \u201cNot at all. It\u2019s just that...well, I guess it\u2019s this house and, quite honestly, you. What are you? About twenty-five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re so successful,\u201d Allison murmured.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m paying the bills,\u201d Allison said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever want to compose great operas or something?\u201d Allison asked, openly curious.</p><p>\u201cNope. I always liked writing little ditties. Must be my Irish heritage,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cQuite frankly, I just got lucky with my first jingle and found a good agent. My cousin Dan is an actor, though, and he\u2019s still trying to get a break into the big time. Well, the bigger time, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a few years older than I am, and he\u2019s done some great shows, but you know how it is. Every time something ends, you\u2019re looking for something new. At the moment he\u2019s playing Raccoon Ralph at the new park, but he\u2019s been promised a lead in their next main stage show, so he\u2019s feeling pretty hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Allison said, looking more relaxed.</p><p>\u201cSo...ready to get started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I hear you do it first? Just so I can get a sense of how you hear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Christina said, and sang, \u201cKeep it off your hips, try our great new chips, Sanina\u2019s is a trip if you\u2019re looking for a chip.\u201d</p><p>Allison smiled broadly as she finished. \u201cCool,\u201d she said again, then apologized. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. There are other words in my vocabulary. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to worry. There\u2019s no reason to be nervous around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure there is. You can fire me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I liked your demo. I really liked it. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Allison started singing then, without waiting for the piano accompaniment. She had just the voice Christina wanted. Women would hear her and think they could be just like her; men would think there was suddenly something sexy about potato chips. Most important, people had to find it catchy enough to make them think about Sanina\u2019s Chips frequently.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Christina told her, and Allison blushed proudly.</p><p>They ran through it a few times with the piano, until Christina was more than satisfied that Allison could do the job.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got an appointment with the Sanina\u2019s people at the recording studio next Tuesday morning, nine o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded vigorously. \u201cI wrote it all down the first time we talked. This is great. Thank you. Thank you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Christina told her as she walked with her to the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be the voice for Sanina\u2019s Chips,\u201d Allison said happily.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s both hope they\u2019re good, huh?\u201d Christina said with a laugh.</p><p>Allison smiled and thanked her again, and Christina waved, then closed the door. As it clicked shut, she jumped.</p><p>Someone had played a note on the piano.</p><p>A single note.</p><p>A cold chill swept over her body. She swallowed hard. Something had fallen on the keyboard. That had to be it. Because there was no one else in the house.</p><p>She forced herself to turn and retrace her steps. She stood in the doorway and stared into the parlor. There was no one there. Of course not, she told herself. She\u2019d known there was no one else in the house.</p><p>She walked into the room and looked at the piano. There was nothing on the keyboard. It was just as she had left it.</p><p>Feeling as if cold fingers were raking down her spine, she sat down and forced herself to hum the Sanina\u2019s Chips tune as she hesitantly picked out the notes on the piano.</p><p>Suddenly she stood abruptly and walked into the kitchen, then back around to the other side of the house to check the library and the dining room.</p><p>It was only midafternoon. The sun was out. The day was sparkling.</p><p>She walked up the stairs and into every room. She paused on the landing before going downstairs again.</p><p>\u201cThis is my house,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cA good house, where good people, kind people, lived. And still live.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m talking out loud to invisible spirits, she moaned inwardly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m heading to the coffee shop,\u201d she added aloud, then gave herself a shake. No more talking to the air.</p><p>Downstairs, she collected her purse and headed out, making certain that she locked the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s the local big shot,\u201d Alex Mars, who had graduated with Jed from the police academy, called out.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d Hal Rather, Alex\u2019s partner said, grinning and rising to shake Jed\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself,\u201d Jed said, and looked across the room. Jerry Dwyer, looking haggard, was just coming out of the lieutenant\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cJed,\u201d he said, grinning, as everyone in the room rose at once and came over.</p><p>\u201cHello, golden boy,\u201d Sally Griegs, the communications officer, teased as she gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>Lieutenant Tiggs came out of the office when he heard all the noise. He was tall and slim but tough as nails, as Jed well knew. He\u2019d seen the lieutenant in action, before his promotion to his current status. Tiggs been attacked in a bar and turned into Jackie Chan. His attacker had wound up on the floor, begging to be cuffed and taken away.</p><p>\u201cTo what do we owe the honor?\u201d Tiggs asked him.</p><p>Jed shrugged. \u201cFrustration?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou got that right,\u201d Jerry muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a civilian now, Jedidiah,\u201d Tiggs said, using his full name, just as, for some unknown reason, he always had.</p><p>\u201cLicensed private investigator,\u201d Jed reminded him lightly.</p><p>\u201cHired by whom?\u201d Tiggs asked skeptically.</p><p>Jed shrugged again. \u201cA writer who might have gotten it wrong.\u201d</p><p>Tiggs stared at him and shook his head. \u201cHas to be a copycat,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cA damned good one, then,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>Jerry shuffled his feet. \u201cYou know we can\u2019t give you anything that hasn\u2019t already been released\u2014even if we had it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCan it, Jerry,\u201d Tiggs said. \u201cI know you had him at the autopsy.\u201d He leveled a finger at Jed. \u201cAnd I know you have copies of the old files. So if you find out anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know damned well I\u2019d never conceal pertinent information, Lieutenant,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think I know damned well,\u201d Tiggs said, \u201cand sometimes I\u2019m not so damned sure I know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidd\u2019s old partner\u2014\u201d Jed began.</p><p>\u201cRetired. But of course I interviewed him,\u201d Jerry said, then added, \u201cBut no one can stop you from talking to the man yourself, unless he refuses to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Jed looked at Tiggs.</p><p>\u201cBe my fuckin\u2019 guest. I\u2019d take help from hell itself right now, if it was offered.\u201d</p><p>Jed frowned. Sure, the new case had hit the papers like a bomb, but it wasn\u2019t as if months had gone by with a high-profile case unsolved.</p><p>\u201cTroopers just called in a second body off I-4,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cI...uh...I\u2019m on my way to the scene now.\u201d</p><p>Tiggs threw up his hands. \u201cScrew it.\u201d He stared at Jed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t ask, I can\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and headed back to his office.</p><p>Jed followed Jerry Dwyer out to the street.</p><p>Coffee cup in hand, Christina headed to a table outside the coffee shop. It was a pleasantly cool day. The sun was out, the sky was blue, and there was a gentle breeze just moving the air. Perfect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She unfolded the newspaper she\u2019d bought and idly read the local section, noting all the advertisements for the Halloween-themed events taking place at the parks. She wondered idly if Dan was going to play Raccoon Ralph with fangs or dress up as Franken-coon.</p><p>As she sat there, still looking at her paper, she suddenly realized that she wasn\u2019t alone, that someone had joined her at the little table with the umbrella overhead.</p><p>Then it started.</p> <p>A sense of chills like icy water sweeping down her spine.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to look up.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>She felt as if she had to.</p><p>The breeze stirred, and it was almost as if she felt a touch. A gentle, silken touch, nostalgic, poignant...</p> <p>It was the breeze, she told herself, and finally looked up.</p><p>She exhaled, feeling like a fool. There was no one there.</p><p>Smiling in embarrassment at her own lunacy, she picked up her coffee and headed for her car. Ten minutes later, she turned down her street and pulled into her driveway.</p><p>The moment she was inside, she felt it again. That terrible, chilling sensation. As if she was not alone. As if someone was with her, watching her.</p><p>There\u2019s no one here, she told herself. No one. This was the same silly thing that had happened at the coffee shop.</p><p>Still, she immediately stepped back outside. She wasn\u2019t going in alone. She sat on the porch and tried Mike\u2019s number first, but hung up when she got his answering machine. She tried Dan next, and he answered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, cuz?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching TV, killing time till my evening shift,\u201d he told her. Then, carefully, he asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cIs there any chance you can come over?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI guess. Why?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cI...it\u2019s silly. I keep thinking someone is in the house,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He was quiet for a minute. She heard him sigh. \u201cChristie...are you afraid that Gran is haunting the house or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll be there in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>She waited, wincing at the thought that she\u2019d had to call her cousin to come over. But better to call him than do something stupid. Like go into a house where a murderer might be waiting.</p><p>Dan made it to the house in record time. She rose from the porch steps as soon as he pulled up and got out of the car. \u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019s up, kid,\u201d he said, stepping past her and entering the house. She followed him, but Dan was moving quickly. He cut a circular path through the ground floor, and she only caught up with him as he hurried up the stairs.</p><p>There was no one downstairs, and not a sound\u2014other than the old floorboards creaking beneath their feet\u2014could be heard as they went to check the bedrooms.</p><p>On the upstairs landing, Dan paused, hands on hips, staring at her. \u201cMaybe you should sell this place,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cGran left me this place, and I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>With a groan, he checked the bedrooms one by one, then pulled down the stairs to the attic. It wasn\u2019t a spooky attic; it was well used and even well lit. There was a rocker by the little window that now looked over the neighbor\u2019s yard but had once offered a view of a sloping green hill. There were trunks and boxes, an old love seat and an overstuffed chair, and even a braided rug set between those so people could sit and play games.</p><p>It had always been a family home.</p><p>But there wasn\u2019t a hint of a stranger, a presence, or anyone who shouldn\u2019t have been there.</p><p>\u201cBasement,\u201d she said.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes impatiently. \u201cSure,\u201d he agreed, and they traipsed back down the stairs.</p><p>The door to the basement was in the kitchen. Christina hit the light switch, and they headed down into another bright, comfortable space. There was a Ping-Pong table in the center of the main area, surrounded by lounge chairs. There was a wet bar in the corner, and the laundry room was off to one side.</p><p>And nothing else.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d she said awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m...uh...sorry I bothered you.\u201d</p><p>He set an arm around her shoulders, pulled her close and lightly patted the top of her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cAnd...well, you are living here alone. You\u2019re right to be careful. Call anytime, Christie. I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>Back upstairs, she asked him if he wanted something to eat or drink.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. In fact, I\u2019d better get going. I\u2019m going to be doing some extra work at the park, so I need to go in for a costume fitting. I\u2019m the Grim Reader,\u201d he told her. \u201cLike the Grim Reaper, get it? You going to come see me read scary stories to the kiddies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later with my schedule,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSuper. And thanks again.\u201d</p><p>She walked him to the door. He left with a wave, and she locked the door immediately, telling herself that maybe it was natural to feel uneasy in a house she\u2019d never really lived in before, and never alone.</p><p>She walked into the parlor and sat idly on the piano bench, planning just to fool around.</p><p>There was music on the stand, she realized.</p><p>She frowned. She hadn\u2019t left any music out. Had she?</p><p>No, damn it, she knew she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Great. Who broke into a house to put music up on a stand?</p><p>She looked around the room. She was far from obsessive-compulsive, but...</p><p>Things had moved.</p><p>The changes were subtle. A chair facing in a slightly different direction. The drapes drawn back just a bit farther than they had been.</p><p>Her heart started to beat hard. She was tempted to leap to her feet and flee the house again.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, suddenly fighting tears.</p><p>No.</p><p>It had to be her imagination. Emotions seeping from her subconscious and coloring the world. There was no denying the fact that there had been far too much loss in her life.</p><p>\u201cI am not running away again,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Dusk fell as she sat there, unmoving.</p><p>Then she nearly jumped straight over the piano as a shrill noise suddenly reverberated through the house.</p><p>5</p><p>T he first patrolman on the scene had done his job; a huge perimeter had been marked off around the body, keeping voyeurism from the highway to a minimum. Doc Martin was already on the scene, speaking to Jerry\u2019s partner, Mal O\u2019Donnell, when they arrived.</p><p>O\u2019Donnell swept a long gaze over Jed but made no protest at his appearance. Doc Martin gave both the newcomers a nod.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t say anything definitive until I\u2019ve completed the autopsy. But...\u201d Martin let out a weary sigh. \u201cThis does echo Sherri Mason\u2019s murder to a T. She was definitely dumped here. I\u2019d estimate time of death to have been very late last night or very early this morning. I\u2019d say she was laid out before dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Jerry muttered. \u201cAnd it took this long for someone to spot her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d Jed said, pointing. \u201cThe bushes. They hid her from the road. And let\u2019s face it, people going by at sixty miles an hour don\u2019t have time to notice much.\u201d</p><p>Since he hadn\u2019t been thrown out, he hunkered down by the body while the others digested the fact that the bushes had evidently hidden the victim from the road.</p><p>\u201cHe must have not have realized his mistake,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cHe likes\u2014needs\u2014the attention that comes from the bodies being discovered naked and posed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd vulnerable,\u201d Jed agreed. He realized that the cops and the M.E. were staring at him, and he knew why. Everyone knew he had copies of the old files. That he had interviewed scores of people for his book. That he\u2019d become friends with the FBI agent who had profiled the killer for them.</p><p>Jed looked down at the dead woman. Her face was lovely; her brown hair long and highlighted with wide streaks of red. The strangulation marks on her neck were the only apparent giveaway to her violent end. She was stretched out naked, arms crossed over her chest, mummy-style.</p><p>Or in a way she might have been laid out in a funeral parlor.</p><p>\u201cPatti Jo Buhler,\u201d Mal O\u2019Donnell said quietly. \u201cTwenty-nine. There\u2019s an employee ID in her purse, which was found to the left there.\u201d He paused to point out the location where an officer had discovered her bag. \u201cShe\u2019s an entertainer at one of the parks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsual victim,\u201d Jerry said dryly.</p><p>Jed stared at the girl. His heart seemed to lurch. Without the marks, she might have been sleeping. She almost looked as if she could open her eyes, smile and get to her feet. She might be at peace in death, but her dreams were over.</p><p>\u201cAny other bruising?\u201d he asked Doc Martin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing a few spots where it looks like postmortem bruising will appear,\u201d Doc said. With a gloved forefinger he pointed to her arms. \u201cSee there? She was shoved around, but she wasn\u2019t beaten.\u201d</p><p>Jed looked down at what was left of Patti Jo Buhler. He\u2019d seen all the crime photos when he\u2019d written the book, and this could have been one of them. Like the others, she\u2019d been a beautiful young woman with everything to live for.</p><p>But now...</p><p>He thanked God he was no longer a cop. That he wasn\u2019t the one who would have to inform her family. That he wouldn\u2019t have to feel their pain, so much greater than anything a cop learned to live with.</p><p>A redhead lying there....</p><p>She could too easily have been Beau Kidd\u2019s sister.</p><p>Worse.</p><p>A flash of vision taunted his mind\u2019s eye, and for just a moment he saw Christina Hardy lying there.</p><p>He stiffened, then shrugged to ease the tension in his shoulders. He was getting too involved. Too wrapped up in this. Letting it eat him up inside.</p><p>O\u2019Donnell\u2019s phone rang. He answered it, stating his name in a monotone, then listened expressionlessly for a moment. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said then, and hung up. He looked at the others. \u201cPatti Jo was officially reported missing by her roommate two days ago, after they made her wait the mandatory twenty-four hours, so we can assume she was nabbed somewhere between work and home three days ago. A dozen people saw her leave the park. No one\u2019s found anyone who\u2019s seen her since.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf we can get Tiggs\u2019s okay, I\u2019d like to use the media,\u201d Jerry told his partner.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d O\u2019Donnell muttered. \u201cNothing else is working.\u201d</p><p>Jed stood. \u201cTime for me to go, but thanks for letting me in,\u201d he said to the two cops and the M.E.</p> <p>\u201cSure. Just don\u2019t make us out to be the bad guys in your next blockbuster, huh?\u201d There was a note of venom in O\u2019Donnell\u2019s voice that surprised Jed. He\u2019d thought the department had accepted that the Interstate Killer had been one of their own gone bad.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you off to?\u201d Jerry asked Jed suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cGainesville,\u201d Jed told him.</p><p>\u201cTo see Larry Atkins?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Donnell shook his head. \u201cAtkins will swear on his life that he knew he was doing the right thing. What do you expect? That he wants to be known as a trigger-happy cop who killed his own partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe these are copycat killings,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cHell, none of us were around back when it all went down.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Donnell looked away. He obviously wasn\u2019t pleased to have Jed around now. Too bad, Jed thought. Because if he felt like it, he could say he had been hired to look into the case.</p><p>Beau Kidd\u2019s sister was looking for the truth.</p><p>Jed felt a sense of uneasiness. It was imperative for them to solve this case quickly. This guy was piling up victims fast.</p><p>But there was something more frightening, more personal, about the current situation.</p> <p>The killer was focusing on redheads. Like Beau Kidd\u2019s sister.</p><p>And like Christina Hardy.</p><p>Jed looked at his watch. Plenty of time. He had an hour-, hour-and-a-half ride ahead of him. Larry Atkins had retired to a farm outside Gainesville, where he kept retired racehorses that hadn\u2019t been successful enough to become breeding stallions or broodmares, horses that might have wound up in the glue factory. He was a homebody. His wife had died a decade ago, and his kids had gone to college out west and stayed there.</p><p>Most nights Larry could be found on his porch from about seven to nine, smoking his pipe in peace and quiet, and staring out over the acreage his pension had bought him.</p><p>Two killings. God in heaven, Larry had to have something to give him. It was as if this guy was carrying out a series of perfect murders, as if he were in law enforcement, forensics...</p><p>As if he were a detective assigned to this very case.</p><p>There was no such thing as the perfect murder, Jed reminded himself.</p><p>\u201cTell Larry hi for me,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.</p> <p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Jed assured him, and he headed for his car.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d O\u2019Donnell yelled.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Jed turned back.</p><p>\u201cNo secrets, no being a big man and thinking you\u2019re going to solve the case. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Jed said patiently. \u201cIf I come up with anything at all, I\u2019ll be calling.\u201d</p><p>Christ!</p><p>What the hell did it matter who figured it out?</p><p>As long as the killing stopped. Now. Before...</p><p>He gritted his teeth and kept going to his car.</p><p>It was the phone. Nothing more than the phone.</p><p>Christina laughed aloud, then sobered, glad she hadn\u2019t hurt herself when she\u2019d jumped off the piano bench with such force that it had tipped over. She\u2019d forgotten that the phone rang as loud as a banshee\u2019s howl because Gran had been afraid she was losing her hearing.</p><p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d Ana said when Christina caught her breath and picked up.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ana asked cheerfully.</p><p>Sitting here afraid that I\u2019m imagining really weird things. Or that I\u2019m not imagining them and they\u2019re real, which is even worse.</p><p>\u201cWorking,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming over, and we\u2019re going out,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get out of that house,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>\u201cAna, I just moved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to get away from your own company for a while,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s just mean. I actually like myself just fine,\u201d Christina told her.</p><p>\u201cGreat, well, then, do you still like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I want to go shopping. I don\u2019t have anything to wear for Halloween. And I don\u2019t want to go out alone.\u201d</p><p>Did she really want to stay there? Christina asked herself. No.</p><p>\u201cGive me ten minutes,\u201d she said into the phone.</p><p>As soon as Ana arrived, Christina ran out to her car and slid into the passenger seat, then stared at her friend and asked accusingly, \u201cOkay, who have you been talking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>Ana shrugged. \u201cWell, I did get a call from Jed.\u201d</p><p>Christina groaned. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true. He...cares about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019ve barely seen him in years.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring that, Ana said, \u201cAnd then I happened to run into Dan at the gas station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin thinks I\u2019m crazy,\u201d Christina said glumly, then brightened. \u201cDid he tell you he\u2019s going to be playing the Grim Reader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Is he supposed to be scary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so. We need to go see him do his thing. Should be fun.\u201d</p><p>Ana shuddered. \u201cAnd crowded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if we avoid the weekends and Halloween itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should make plans, then. There are only two weeks left until Halloween.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy nights are fairly open,\u201d Christina told her. She thought about it for a minute. \u201cIn fact, they\u2019re completely open right now.\u201d</p><p>Ana giggled. \u201cMine, too. Hey, can he get us free passes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he can. So where are we going tonight, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA place called Once More, With Feeling. They sell vintage stuff, and then for Halloween they bring in more costumes than anyone else in the area. You\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>The shop was as eclectic as promised. Half of it was dedicated to the old, from fedoras to flower-child bell-bottoms. Then there were the costumes, as well as a selection of accessories that could be added to the off-the-rack offerings to individualize them.</p><p>\u201cWe should do a theme thing,\u201d Ana murmured. \u201cYou know, like Dorothy, Toto, the Tin Man and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going trick-or-treating?\u201d Christina asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to go out, anyway. I\u2019d love to win the costume contest at O\u2019Reilly\u2019s this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want Dan to come, you\u2019ll have to make sure he\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just buy him a costume and hope for the best. Are you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be Toto,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not carrying you around in a basket all night,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cI know, but think about how great it will be. Every time you see people doing the Wizard of Oz thing, Toto is a stuffed toy. You never see a live Toto. And you\u2019ll be fabulous as Dorothy.\u201d</p><p>Christina shrugged. Ana was going through a rack of costumes, looking for what, Christina wasn\u2019t certain. She found herself watching the other customers, curious to see what they were picking up.</p><p>A group of college boys were gravitating toward the slasher costumes. One of them put on a Freddy Krueger mask, and started laughing and menacing his friends. It was quite an effectively creepy costume, Christina thought.</p><p>And when he had it on, he could have been anyone.</p><p>It was a sobering thought.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening?\u201d Ana said, breaking into her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay attention, would you? Mike can be the Tin Man, and Dan can be the Scarecrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be missing the Cowardly Lion,\u201d Christina pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to talk Jed into that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you can get Jed to dress up like the Cowardly Lion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d Ana looked thoughtful for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019ll work on who dresses up as what later. He might go for it, though. He actually does have a sense of humor. Somewhere,\u201d Ana assured her dryly. \u201cI\u2019m going to pay for this stuff. Then we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll split it,\u201d Christina told her.</p><p>After the costume shop, they headed down International Drive, Ana complaining about the tourists the whole way. \u201cThe traffic gets worse every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s October in theme-park land. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>Ana was quiet for a minute. \u201cHaven\u2019t they heard we have a serial killer on the loose?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Christina was surprised by her friend\u2019s intensity. \u201cAna, most people never think they could be victims themselves. And most women can assure themselves they\u2019re not young or a redhead.\u201d</p><p>Ana looked at her worriedly. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not a tourist,\u201d Christina said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Ana said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>They had reached O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, a pub that predated the invasion of theme parks into central Florida. Family-owned and operated, it was currently in the hands of the third generation. The food was good and solid, and the atmosphere was friendly.</p><p>\u201cCheck out the pictures on the wall when we go in,\u201d Ana said. \u201cYou can see who\u2019s won in previous years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Christina said meekly, smiling.</p><p>A friendly hostess showed them to a booth. They both opted for iced tea and shepherd\u2019s pie, the house specialty. When their drinks were delivered, Christina dutifully looked at the pictures on the wall, recently hung as a ploy to entice customers to make O\u2019Reilly\u2019s their destination of choice on Halloween. First prize was a thousand dollars\u2014and a place on the October Wall of Infamy.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Ana breathed suddenly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ana pointed to the television behind the bar. Customers usually sat there to watch sports. But there was no game on tonight. Instead the screen showed a reporter, looking grim as he spoke live from the shoulder of a highway, where he was interviewing a police spokesman.</p><p>\u201cTurn it up, please,\u201d someone at the bar said.</p> <p>The entire restaurant seemed to go still as the police spokesman, a lean, older, authoritative man, spoke quietly.</p><p>\u201c...yet another victim. We are withholding her identity until her next of kin have been notified. We\u2019re asking everyone\u2014especially young women\u2014to be careful. Don\u2019t go anywhere with strangers. Don\u2019t walk through dark parking lots alone. Many of the businesses in the area will be taking special precautions to ensure the safety of our residents and tourists. We\u2019re also asking for help. Be vigilant and report anything, anything at all, that looks suspicious. Be smart, be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people are saying that the Interstate Killer has come back to town,\u201d the interviewer said. \u201cAre we looking at a copycat, or was a serious mistake made twelve years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau Kidd was never convicted of any crime,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re looking at just yet. Be assured that we have every law enforcement agency in the state on guard, and if circumstances warrant, the FBI will be called in, as well.\u201d</p><p>Christina started when her dinner was set before her and looked up. Their waitress was a pretty girl with golden eyes, freckles and carrot-red hair. Her slight accent said she was Irish but had been in the States for a while.</p> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t saying it on TV,\u201d the girl murmured with a shiver, \u201cbut some cops come in here all the time, and they talk. Freddy MacGregor was just in, and he said that girl was a brunette, but she had red streaks in her hair.\u201d</p><p>Christina felt a sensation of dread come creeping over her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying my hair black,\u201d the waitress announced, staring at the television. Then she cleared her throat. \u201cMore iced tea?\u201d she asked cheerfully.</p><p>Christina hoped to find out more about the murder, but the station was no longer broadcasting live from the highway. They\u2019d moved on to interviewing little children in homemade Halloween costumes.</p><p>\u201cJust great, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ana muttered in a tone that said it was anything but great.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll those kids in monster costumes. What happened to being a cowboy or a princess? All those monsters...when there\u2019s a real monster out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a real monster out there somewhere,\u201d Christina said. And that was the sad truth, she thought. Somewhere, at any given time, there was a monster on the streets. \u201cAnd the scariest monsters look just like the boy next door,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d be back,\u201d Larry Atkins said.</p><p>As Jed had expected, Larry had been sitting on his porch, a cool beer by his side while he puffed on his pipe. The pipe smoke had a pleasant aroma.</p><p>\u201cThat thing will kill you one day,\u201d Jed told him.</p><p>Larry smiled and ignored his words, using his pipe to point in the direction of his pasture. \u201cYou ever think about getting a horse, Jed? I just got a mare in\u2014they were going to put her down. She didn\u2019t live up to her promise. Sweetest thing you ever want to see. She follows me around just like a puppy dog, as if she knows I saved her life. A horse would do you good, you know. Grab a beer from the cooler over there, make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>Jed perched on the wooden porch fence and shook his head. \u201cThanks, but it\u2019s a long drive back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. An hour and a half\u2014just like the drive up here\u2014and you decided to come on a whim, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard yet? They found another victim.\u201d</p><p>Larry stared at him and shook his head. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with people? I drew my weapon twice when I was on the force. The first time I winged a guy so high on heroin that when he took aim at me, the bullet went about a hundred feet wide. And then...then I shot my own partner when I saw him with that girl. I gave him a warning, and that\u2019s when he drew his gun on me. But I tell you, even seeing Beau there with the girl, even knowing he was a sick psychopath, even then...knowing that I\u2019d killed a man was a bitch. How the hell do people get so warped that they can rip up another human being and take pleasure in the pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we had that one solved, we could start working on world peace,\u201d Jed told him.</p><p>\u201cYou came out here because you\u2019re thinking I must have made a mistake,\u201d Larry said, and scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI saw the last victim not two hours ago,\u201d Jed said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, it looks like the same guy. Larry, did I miss something in the files? Can you think of anything, anything at all, that was particular to the Interstate Killer? Something to prove this maniac is a copycat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, wouldn\u2019t we both like that?\u201d Larry breathed.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk through it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I got nothing to hide. Beau had dated Janet Major, the fourth victim. I saw his face when we found her. He was green. At first I thought he was all torn up about it. But then, little by little, it comes out that the two of them had a real set-to over some other guy. She was seen leaving Beau\u2019s apartment complex the day before she died. None of us believed it could be him, but our lieutenant did talk to him. Beau admitted to me that the lieutenant was worried\u2014he hadn\u2019t accused him, but he was about to take him off the case. So I did some background checks on the other victims and some sleuthing on my own...turned out he had at least met the other girls, as well. A few of the other detectives on the case were starting to look at him, too, especially after the point was made that we were looking for someone who knew what the cops would be looking for and knew how not to leave a trace. And we just couldn\u2019t find anything. You would have thought one of those girls would have managed to scratch the killer, but...nothing.</p><p>\u201cHe was dating the girl from Tampa, the last victim, Grace Garcia. We all knew it. When I came up, he had her in his arms, he was laying her out. I shouted at him, and he drew on me! What the hell else could have been going on?\u201d</p><p>Larry\u2019s voice sounded tortured. Well, why the hell not? Jed thought. He was going through his own angst, and all he\u2019d done was write a book.</p><p>Larry Atkins had shot and killed the man.</p><p>\u201cLarry, other than Beau knowing the girls and being a cop, what was the other evidence against him?\u201d Jed asked. \u201cRun through it for me again.\u201d</p><p>Larry stared out at the field, puffing on his pipe. \u201cNo alibi,\u201d he said, and took a deep breath. \u201cThe way we saw it, and the FBI guy agreed with us, the profile was for a man in his twenties, a functioning psychotic, someone who smiled by day and went about his business. Hell, look how long Bundy got away with it.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cLots of times, you get the guy who\u2019s down and out, a car thief, a junkie. He looks weird, and people are afraid of him. Then you get the really scary guys, who look as normal as your dad or your brother, and everybody around goes, hell, no, he\u2019s a nice guy, he pats my dog on the head, he keeps his yard neat. Beau was that guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, everything about these killings is the same as twelve years ago, the women disappearing, being missing for almost three days before they\u2019re found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds right,\u201d Larry agreed, rocking in his chair, not looking at Jed.</p><p>\u201cSo here\u2019s the question. Where the hell is he keeping them?\u201d Jed asked.</p><p>\u201cWe never found any evidence, but Beau must have been hiding them in his apartment, tying them up, gagging them...until their time was up and he killed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his apartment,\u201d Jed murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been over this before,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI wish I could think of something, something I\u2019ve been missing.\u201d</p><p>There has to be something, Jed thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about nothing else, ever since I heard about the murder of Sherri Mason,\u201d Larry told him. \u201cI just can\u2019t think of a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for trying, Larry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou come anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Thanks again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about getting a horse, Jed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in an apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet yourself some land, get into horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it some thought,\u201d Jed promised.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to stay with you tonight,\u201d Ana told Christina when they reached her house.</p><p>Christina realized that she was staring at the house with foreboding, and immediately felt irritated with herself.</p><p>It was her house now; she was the keeper of the family seat. And she loved it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really,\u201d she lied to Ana, hoping her tone was as convincing as her words.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re fine, but I\u2019m not,\u201d Ana told her.</p><p>Christina turned to her friend in surprise. Ana did look upset.</p><p>They exited the car and looked around, then looked at each other, both silently acknowledging they really were somewhat nervous. But the night was clear and beautiful; there wasn\u2019t a trace of the fog that had rolled in the night before.</p><p>Christina unlocked the door, and they entered the house. \u201cWant tea or something?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe just ate,\u201d Ana reminded her, then yawned. \u201cI\u2019m ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Ana didn\u2019t seem to be afraid once they were inside, Christina noticed, but she herself felt just as uneasy as she had before. She assured herself that the door to the basement was bolted, then wedged a chair under the doorknob to brace it, just for good measure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going upstairs,\u201d Ana called.</p><p>\u201cCool. Pick a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick a room? You just move over, sweetie. I\u2019m bunking with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re small,\u201d Christina teased.</p><p>She went to set the coffeepot timer for the next morning, and it was then that she froze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Someone had already done it.</p><p>The timer was set for seven-thirty, and the light was on.</p><p>Had she lost her mind? Was she doing these things herself and not realizing it?</p> <p>She reached into one of the cabinets for Gran\u2019s old rolling pin and got the pepper spray out of her purse. Methodically, and alone, she searched the downstairs.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>No one.</p><p>Nothing else out of place.</p><p>Still armed, she walked up the steps and went through every room upstairs except her own, determinedly looking in every closet and underneath all the beds. Though she realized that she was shaking, she decided to check out the attic.</p> <p>Ana\u2014comfortably clad in a pair of Christina\u2019s pajamas\u2014came out into the hallway just as she pulled down the ladder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d her friend demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe coffeepot was already set,\u201d Christina said. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been in here.\u201d</p><p>Ana watched her, frowning. \u201cChristina, no one breaks in just to set a coffee timer. You must have done it and forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She started up the ladder and realized Ana was behind her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Christina demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me alone down here,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen to you,\u201d Christina promised. \u201cI searched the ground floor and secured the basement, and I\u2019ve been all through the rooms up here. All that\u2019s left is the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still not leaving me down here,\u201d Ana assured her.</p><p>They went up the ladder, Ana on Christina\u2019s heels. Christina found the light switch and looked around. The attic was just as it had always been.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one here, Christina,\u201d Ana said. \u201cMaybe it wouldn\u2019t hurt for you to see a therapist. I mean, maybe you\u2019re having short-term memory loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Christina insisted stubbornly. But what else could it be?</p><p>\u201cChristie, thieves don\u2019t break in just to move things around and put the coffee on for you,\u201d Ana said gently.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get some sleep,\u201d Christina suggested firmly, ignoring Ana\u2019s unassailable logic.</p><p>Ana giggled. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a ghost who brews the coffee for you, I want him to move in with me.\u201d</p><p>Christina groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t need this from you, okay? Don\u2019t you dare mention a word of this. Promise me right now that you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. My lips are sealed.\u201d Ana hesitated. \u201cCan we sleep with the television on?\u201d</p><p>In a few minutes they were in bed, the hallway and bathroom lights still on, the TV tuned to a channel that ran nothing but sitcoms twenty-four hours a day. Pillows plumped, they settled down.</p><p>Ana was quickly and soundly asleep. Christina watched the television until she finally started to drift off.</p><p>Then it started again.</p><p>The feeling.</p><p>The feeling that someone was there. Standing at the foot of the bed.</p><p>Watching her.</p><p>Open your eyes.</p><p>No! she thought, ignoring what had to be an imaginary voice.</p><p>Christie...Help me, please....</p><p>She opened her eyes.</p><p>The room was in shadow, strange contrasts of light and dark created by the glow emanating from the bathroom and the hallway, which still left so much in darkness.</p><p>But there was something.</p><p>A figure.</p><p>At the foot of her bed.</p><p>\u201cAna!\u201d she cried, gripping her friend\u2019s arm.</p><p>Ana awoke, screaming. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The shadow...the figure...was gone.</p><p>Christina jumped up and ran to the foot of the bed, where she waved her hands through the air as if trying to feel something that clearly wasn\u2019t there. Ana stared at her as if she had gone mad.</p><p>Suddenly they heard a noise from outside, the slamming of a car door.</p><p>They stared at each other. Ana\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>Christina flew to the window, Ana right behind her.</p><p>There was a strange car in her driveway, parked on the far side of hers, so she couldn\u2019t see the make or model.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d Ana gasped.</p><p>Christina looked, and then she gasped, too.</p><p>A tall, dark, menacing figure was standing on the lawn. And as she watched, it started moving toward the house.</p><p>6</p><p>\u201cA nd ever since the coming of the creature to the cavern, eerie screams can be heard at night. No one dares enter, because the creature remains there still, deep in the earth beside the crystal waters...waiting.\u201d</p><p>Dan McDuff whispered the last word, then shut the book with a thump. To his deep gratification, several of the young women and two of the men in the audience jumped. He rose from the overstuffed armchair where the Grim Reader held court and swept a hand over the crowd, long black nails catching in the dim light. \u201cCome back tomorrow night, if you dare, and the Grim Reader will offer you more tales of mystery, mayhem and the bizarre. Until then, good night, my children. Morbid dreams to you all.\u201d</p><p>To the accompaniment of a nice smattering of applause, he walked down from the dais and headed for the doorway hidden in a hollow tree in the Mystic Forest, leading to a stairway into the tunnel system that was reserved for employees only. As the Grim Reader, it wouldn\u2019t do for him to be seen mingling with the crowd before or after his appearances, though he did sit atop one of the floats in the parade, his oversize book on his lap, using his silver-tipped cane to point in sham threat at people in the crowd.</p><p>When he reached the men\u2019s locker room, he scrubbed off the white-and-gray face paint that gave him the look of an aging corpse, then showered and dressed. He was off for the night.</p><p>He let out an irritated sigh as he shut his locker. There was still no word on final casting for the new show, and he was starting to get frustrated. He really didn\u2019t want to be Raccoon Ralph forever. It didn\u2019t pay enough, for one thing. It wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d gone through life wasting money, and he had the trust fund his grandmother had left him, but he was getting old. He needed something more substantial on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Either that, or he needed enough money to invest along with some of his fellow actors at the park who wanted to open their own theater.</p><p>He reflected for a moment that it was too bad Gran hadn\u2019t decided to sell the old house\u2014he didn\u2019t even want to speculate what it was worth. Even a third of the profit from the house would have set him up. Hell, he probably could have opened a theater all on his own.</p><p>He smiled suddenly, wondering just how Christie was doing on her own in the old house.</p><p>As he left the locker room he bumped into Marcie McDonnagh, who was up for the part of Hera in the new Greek gods show and was also currently a fluffy by day and scary creature by night.</p><p>Marcie was pretty, with shoulder-length auburn hair and huge dark eyes. She was a talented dancer, as well, an area where he was lacking. His strength was that he could glance at a page of new music and know the melody before it ever left his lips.</p><p>\u201cI wish they\u2019d cast that new show already,\u201d she said, obviously as frustrated by the situation as he was.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d He didn\u2019t tell her that he was relieved that she didn\u2019t know any more than he did.</p><p>She yawned. \u201cWell, good night. See you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m on.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a big smile. She really was pretty, he thought. Not to mention talented, and sweet.</p><p>She turned to walk away. \u201cHey, Marcie,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. \u201cI know. Who can miss the news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way out. Let me walk you to your car.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSure. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>As they walked, Dan slipped an arm around her shoulder. Maybe he wasn\u2019t the best dancer, he thought. But he had all the strength he needed.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! He\u2019s coming!\u201d Ana yelped.</p><p>The doorbell rang, and Ana turned to stare at Christina, who stared right back.</p><p>Then reason asserted itself.</p><p>\u201cBurglars don\u2019t usually ring the doorbell,\u201d Christina assured Ana.</p><p>\u201cBut...it\u2019s so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were tired, so we went to bed. It\u2019s really not that late. Only around ten-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get a lot of visitors this late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only lived here two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the rolling pin and your pepper spray,\u201d Ana advised.</p><p>Though she felt foolish, Christina did as Ana had suggested. Then they crept down the stairs and toward the front door. When the bell rang again, they both jumped, and Christina almost stepped on Ana.</p><p>Christina stepped up to the front door and looked through the peephole, then let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Ana demanded, pushing closer and trying to get a look.</p><p>\u201cJed,\u201d Christina said in surprise, balancing the pepper spray and rolling pin in one hand so she could open the door.</p><p>Jed stared at them with arched brows as the door opened. \u201cYou two look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost. Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone made coffee!\u201d Ana blurted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jed demanded.</p><p>Christina stared at Ana. So much for not saying anything.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Come on in,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked warily at the rolling pin.</p><p>\u201cJust a precaution,\u201d she said, blushing.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry,\u201d Ana added quickly. \u201cWe searched the house.\u201d</p><p>Jed looked at Christina, and she couldn\u2019t tell if she was reading doubt or concern in the dark depths of his eyes. \u201cWhy were you searching the house this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristina was convinced someone was here,\u201d Ana explained. \u201cSomeone who set the coffeepot to go on at seven-thirty.\u201d</p><p>This time Christina was certain the look he gave her was one of doubt.</p><p>\u201cYou think someone broke into your house to make coffee for you?\u201d he inquired, trying to keep the skepticism from his voice.</p><p>She waved a hand dismissively and glared at Ana. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she muttered quickly. \u201cWhat are you doing here so late?\u201d she asked, forcing cheer into her voice. \u201cAnybody want tea?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love some,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>Jed shrugged, staring at Christina, who headed for the kitchen, tossing a question over her shoulder. \u201cSo what are you doing here, Jed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I just came by to check on you.\u201d</p> <p>The others had followed her to the kitchen, where they perched on bar stools at the pass-through counter.</p><p>\u201cWe heard the news while we were out,\u201d Christina said. \u201cThat they found another girl.\u201d</p><p>She was certain she saw concern in his eyes. She let out a breath.</p><p>\u201cA redhead,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I just came by to say hi, make sure things were all right,\u201d Jed said, still staring at Christina with concern\u2014and wariness.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to see you,\u201d Christina said, privately thinking that she and Ana must be quite a sight, with tangled hair and scrubbed faces, and wearing pajamas.</p><p>Admittedly, he was just a friend, but still, she wished she looked a bit more dignified. Or even...sexy.</p><p>Not like the kid he had known forever.</p><p>\u201cDid I wake you guys up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ana said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t asleep, we were staring out the window. We should have Jed look around the place, too,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one here,\u201d Christina assured her.</p> <p>\u201cBecause whoever was here just put the coffee on and left?\u201d Ana asked flatly.</p><p>Christina stared hard at Ana again. Didn\u2019t her friend realize that she was adding to Jed\u2019s perception that she was crazy, or at least overemotional?</p><p>Christina knew that she\u2019d had a crush on the guy all her life, which was making her current embarrassment worse, but she couldn\u2019t help it. She didn\u2019t want him thinking she needed serious therapy.</p><p>\u201cNo harm in looking,\u201d Jed told her. \u201cI\u2019ll just take a walk through the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re not leaving me here alone,\u201d Ana warned them. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever seen a slasher film?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many,\u201d Christina said, and almost added, Real life is worse.</p><p>They followed Jed from room to room, floor to floor. Occasionally he asked Christina if anything looked odd or out of place, and once he asked if she could think of any reason why someone would come in to make coffee for her.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d he said when they were once again in the front hall, \u201cno one has broken in. Your lock hasn\u2019t been picked.\u201d</p><p>He was right, she realized.</p><p>If someone had been in the house, that someone had used a key. There was absolutely no sign of forced entry.</p><p>\u201cDoes Dan or Mike have a key?\u201d Jed asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. But I just can\u2019t see either one of them coming in to set up the coffeemaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s just one answer,\u201d Ana said softly.</p><p>Christina glared at her. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d They were both staring at her. Irritated, she said sharply, \u201cWhatever!\u201d</p><p>Jed looked away and cleared his throat. She remained stubbornly silent. He looked back at her and asked, \u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan\u2019s the type to play a practical joke,\u201d Ana suggested.</p><p>\u201cMike isn\u2019t,\u201d Christina replied.</p><p>They were all startled by a knock at the door, and Jed arched a brow questioningly. As if she should know who would be stopping by in the middle of the night, Christina thought, her irritation growing.</p><p>Jed opened the door to reveal Tony standing on the front steps.</p><p>\u201cI saw all the lights on and came over to check up on Christina,\u201d he said, looking questioningly at Jed. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, Tony. Thanks for looking out for me,\u201d Christina said. \u201cDo you want to come in? Would you like some tea or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, you haven\u2019t seen anyone hanging around the house, have you?\u201d Jed asked before Tony could answer.</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d Tony frowned in thought.</p><p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d Christina said firmly. \u201cWe\u2019re just a bunch of nervous Nellies, as Gran would say. So...would you like something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ve got to get back. Ilona will be worried.\u201d</p><p>Christina smiled. \u201cThanks for checking on me,\u201d she said with genuine gratitude.</p><p>\u201cGood night, then,\u201d Tony told them.</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d Ana echoed.</p><p>After Tony left and the door was shut, the three of them stood awkwardly in the hall once again.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m out of here, too,\u201d Jed said. He kissed his cousin on the cheek; then a beat passed before he took Christina by the shoulders and kissed her cheek, too. It was casual, one friend to another.</p><p>The warmth of his lips on her cheek seemed to rush through Christina like lava. Sensual. Sexual. She tried not to react visibly. Had her crush on the man always been this strong? It had always been there, that quality in him that made her want to be near him. Only now that she was older, she could see\u2014no, feel\u2014that she wanted so much more than just to be there in his shadow. The man who stood before her now was far more than just a handsome high school jock or a brooding Heathcliff on the moors. Shaped by the good and the bad he\u2019d faced in life, as were they all, he was the complete package now, a man worth loving.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Jed,\u201d Ana said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Christina managed politely, then stood there with a pleasant smile plastered to her face. If only Ana were leaving and Jed were staying.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the way of things, and in a moment he was gone.</p><p>\u201cLock the door. Carefully,\u201d Ana said gravely.</p><p>Christina wasn\u2019t sure if a door could be locked carefully, but she slid both bolts home as firmly as she could.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get some sleep,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>\u201cLet me just make sure the burners are off,\u201d Christina said. \u201cYou run on up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life,\u201d Ana said, and trailed behind her to check out the kitchen before they went upstairs, where they left the hallway and bathroom lights on again.</p><p>Christina was half asleep when Ana said, \u201cIt\u2019s strange, really. You\u2019ve always been afraid of the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the dark,\u201d Christina heard herself reply, the response instant\u2014and defensive. \u201cI just hate it,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen it\u2019s pitch dark...you can trip on things. You can\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point. For sleeping, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want more lights out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, no.\u201d</p><p>Ana fell asleep quickly moments later, while Christina found herself lying awake and wondering.</p><p>What was it about the darkness?</p><p>It could be the idea of the unknown, always lying hidden in the dark.</p><p>Or was it that, somewhere deep inside, to everyone, darkness meant death? Death without reprieve. Just a coffin in the earth, and nothingness...</p><p>She rolled over, and at last she slept.</p><p>Ana was a freelance makeup artist, a good one. She\u2019d been offered a permanent position by all the local theme parks, but she preferred to work her own schedule. This being October, though, business was booming. There were haunted houses everywhere, and haunted houses meant hundreds of performers dressing up as zombies, mummies, vampires, movie killers and creatures from lagoons of every color on a daily basis. She complained as she dressed, \u201cIt\u2019s so busy! And I\u2019m an idiot. A greedy idiot. I said yes to way too many people. I start off at one park this morning, then go to another in the afternoon, and then the park where Dan is working tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it. How can you do makeup for that many people every day?\u201d Christina asked her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do them all. I only do the major players. With most people, I help them at the beginning, teach them how to do what they need to. Plus all the parks have people in-house to fix up anyone who can\u2019t do it themselves. How about you? What are you up to today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have the locks changed, and I\u2019m going to buy a dog,\u201d Christina told her.</p><p>\u201cThe locks being changed sounds good, but...a dog? That\u2019s a big responsibility. Who\u2019ll take care of it when you travel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come over and feed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m traveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find a good vet.\u201d</p><p>Ana stared at her, then shrugged. \u201cA guard dog?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Christina told her. \u201cAnd the bigger the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food will cost you an arm and a leg. A cat would be better, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go out a buy a guard cat?\u201d Christina asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, Fuzzball can be ferocious,\u201d Ana said, defending her own beloved pet. Fuzzball had come from a shelter when Ana had been about twelve, and he was still going strong.</p><p>Fuzzball could be ferocious, Christina had to admit. He liked to lie in wait on top of a bookcase and whack people when they walked by. But he wouldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014bark if someone broke in.</p><p>\u201cA dog. A brute. A massive German shepherd, maybe,\u201d Christina said. \u201cI could look around for a trained one, I guess, but I\u2019d rather go to a shelter. The people there can help me, I\u2019m certain. So many pets need homes, and, anyway, what I mostly want is the companionship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cat is a great companion,\u201d Ana advised.</p><p>\u201cI want a companion that will warn me if someone is around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Ana said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get going. Oh, and whoever set the coffeepot? They did a nice job. The coffee was just the right strength.\u201d</p><p>In seconds she was out the door, totally unaware of how chilling her last statement had been.</p><p>Christina had planned to call a locksmith as soon as Ana left. Instead, she grabbed her purse and headed out to her car.</p><p>When she reached it, she hesitated and looked back. She loved this house. And she refused to let herself become terrified of it. And she wasn\u2019t, she realized. She didn\u2019t think there was anything evil about the house itself, and yet...she was still afraid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Afraid for her own sanity?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>She could move out, she supposed. If this were a movie and bad things were happening in a house, she would be irritated with the people who lived there, thinking that if they had any sense at all, they would move out.</p> <p>But this was real life, not a movie, and to move out...</p><p>To move out would be to betray everything that had meant anything in her life, everything that had formed her. It would mean abandoning her past and all her wonderful dreams of the future.</p><p>A dog, she decided, would solve everything. A huge one that would strike fear into the heart of any would-be invader, human or otherwise.</p><p>Her mind made up, she drove away.</p><p>It was frightening to see just how much alike the victims looked when they were lying on the autopsy table, Jed thought.</p> <p>She was lying there as if she were sleeping, but this was the forever kind of sleep.</p><p>Doc Martin was droning on about tearing and bleeding, and the absence of fluids, fibers or any other trace evidence that might help. Like the other victims, she had been manually strangled, a clear indication that the killer had strength. There were signs of force once again, but no signs of torture.</p><p>Jed stood silently by Jerry\u2019s side, listening. Doc Martin had spent a long time telling them what they didn\u2019t have, but the fact that they didn\u2019t have anything still gave them something.</p><p>The killer wore gloves, but not cloth gloves, that would have left fibers behind.</p><p>Were they looking for a doctor or a nurse, both of whom would have had easy access to plastic gloves? Or, for that matter, a dishwasher?</p><p>The women had been forcibly taken and raped, but not tortured before death. The high, the climax, was in the killing.</p> <p>\u201cShe was beautiful, huh?\u201d Jerry said softly.</p><p>She certainly had been, Jed reflected. Young and beautiful, with long hair highlighted with brilliant red.</p><p>Doc Martin continued to talk into his recorder as he prepared to open the corpse, and Jed turned away, striding from the autopsy room. He didn\u2019t need to see the invasion of her body; he didn\u2019t need to be there at all. If they learned anything new, anything pertinent, he would hear about it soon enough.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t optimistic, though. Their killer was clever, and so far they had found almost nothing scientific with which to work if and when there was a suspect. It was a case now for the most basic kind of detective work, and that meant hitting the street and asking questions.</p><p>He was surprised when Jerry followed him out. Jerry looked a little green, which was strange, since he\u2019d seen dozens of autopsies. As soon as they got outside the building, Jerry lit a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cThought you quit,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cI only smoke after I\u2019ve been in there,\u201d Jerry said as he drew heavily on his cigarette, then coughed. He took another drag. No cough that time. \u201cThink this guy knows his victims?\u201d he asked after a minute.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He either knows them or he has the kind of charm that puts them at ease. Think about Ted Bundy. Young women knew there was a dangerous predator out there, so he made himself look completely nonthreatening by wearing a fake cast, then lured his victims into helping him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you think this guy is pretending to have some kind of a handicap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Jed said. \u201cUnless he knows them or snatches them before they can fight free, it\u2019s either a fake handicap or he has some other way to appear to be nonthreatening.\u201d</p><p>Mal O\u2019Donnell joined them then, and Jed arched a brow at him. Doc Martin couldn\u2019t have finished with poor Patti Jo so quickly.</p><p>But even Mal had apparently decided that staying to the bitter end would be pointless. He scowled at the other two men. \u201cHe said he\u2019ll call us later about the tox report and her last meal,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t find alcohol or drugs,\u201d Jed predicted.</p><p>O\u2019Donnell looked irritated. \u201cHey, you gave up the cop thing, remember? Unless you got the killer, keep your opinions to yourself.\u201d</p><p>He shoved past them both, and Jerry looked at Jed. \u201cHe\u2019s just pissed because the FBI are on their way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe heat we\u2019re getting is unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get anything, call me,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Jerry handed him a sheet of paper before heading after his partner. \u201cDon\u2019t be pissed at Mal,\u201d he called over his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be dragged through the official ringer this afternoon, and you get to walk away.\u201d</p><p>When Jerry was gone, Jed looked at the paper he was holding. It held a list of names and addresses. Patti Jo\u2019s friends and co-workers, and the last place she\u2019d been seen alive.</p><p>The newest theme park, Jed noted.</p><p>And Dan McDuff was listed as one of her co-workers.</p><p>There was a new animal shelter in the area where Christina was certain she would find the ideal companion. The place ran on donations, and she was happy to give a large one. And because they had so much land, they were able to take in large dogs. Perfect.</p><p>From her car, she could hear the barking. Most of it was coming from the many wired-in runs that surrounded the main building. Some of it was coming from inside.</p><p>Christina headed in, where she saw a harried-looking young blonde behind a counter, and a middle-aged couple on their way out, beaming and leading what looked like a large Belgian shepherd. There. Just the kind of dog I want, Christina thought.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d the woman behind the desk said.</p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m Christina Hardy, and I\u2019m looking for a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dog are you looking for?\u201d the girl asked her.</p><p>\u201cHonestly? A guard dog,\u201d Christina told her.</p><p>The young woman sniffed. \u201cYou and every woman in the county,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cThe thing is, we don\u2019t want frightened people taking our pets, leading them on, making them think they\u2019re loved\u2014then dumping them back here when the killer is caught.\u201d She shivered. \u201cIf the killer is caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, I have a big house and a big yard. I won\u2019t be bringing back my dog,\u201d Christina vowed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to fill out an application, then wait to be approved, no matter what,\u201d the blonde told her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cWe do a thorough background check,\u201d the woman warned. \u201cTake a seat, Miss Hardy. And fill this out,\u201d she added, handing over a clipboard holding the application.</p><p>Christina did as ordered. When she went to hand the application back, she noticed that there was a stack of papers on the counter, applications bearing a large stamp that said they\u2019d been approved.</p><p>The door to the runs in the back of the building suddenly burst open, and Christina heard a ferocious bark.</p><p>The girl behind the counter cried out in alarm. \u201cOh, no! It\u2019s Killer!\u201d</p><p>Jed returned to his town house first, where he forced himself to be methodical and read over the twelve-year-old files from the original case first, focusing on the victims\u2019 lifestyles.</p><p>Janet Major had not been an entertainer, though she had worked in the business office of one of the local dinner shows. Grace Garcia had worked in a nearby restaurant as a singing, tap-dancing waitress. The others had worked at the theme parks, full-or part-time.</p><p>Surrounding every venue was an enormous parking lot.</p><p>Had they been taken from the parking lots? How? By force? Or had the killer appeared so trustworthy or nonthreatening that they never even suspected him?</p><p>Jed looked at the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of the two recent victims, both of whom were also connected to the entertainment business in some way.</p><p>Even so, he didn\u2019t think it was the show-business aspect that drew the attention of the killer. He thought it was the killer\u2019s ability to get to the women that made them the victims he wanted. He jotted down notes about the last time each woman\u2014then and now\u2014had been seen alive. As he stared at his notes he realized that, in his own mind, he was convinced.</p><p>Beau Kidd had never been the Interstate Killer.</p><p>So why had he drawn his weapon when Larry Atkins approached him?</p><p>Jed left his house and headed for the new park. Things were going to get a lot trickier now, since he didn\u2019t have a badge. However, he had learned long ago that the impression of authority was often worth more than authority itself.</p><p>When he reached the park, he was quickly given access to one of the entertainment managers, and he accompanied the man as he made his rounds to check on the performers. He learned that Patti Jo had been playing a vampire princess before she had scrubbed herself clean of makeup and headed out. She had been seen in the locker room by one of her best friends, Marcie McDonnagh, who had herself left soon after, and no one had seen her since. Not even in the parking lot. The trail ended right in the park.</p><p>\u201cThis is so awful,\u201d Ben Smith, the entertainment manager, told Jed. \u201cOctober is such a big time of the year for us, and these killings are going to scare off the tourists.\u201d They passed a tall man adjusting a bloody pirate mask. \u201cHank, tuck your hair in,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cYessir, Mr. Smith,\u201d the pirate called back.</p><p>\u201cOne of your employees has been brutally murdered, Mr. Smith,\u201d Jed reminded him.</p><p>At least the man had the decency to look ashamed at that point. \u201cI know, and it\u2019s terrible, but I assure you, the park is totally innocent of any wrongdoing. We allow nothing sexually explicit on the grounds, we stop serving alcohol an hour before closing...we\u2019re working hard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be a contender?\u201d Jed cut in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious. Patti Jo didn\u2019t get into a car with some stranger in a monster mask,\u201d Ben Smith said.</p><p>Jed tended to agree.</p><p>They had reached the employee cafeteria, and Ben Smith pointed to a woman at a nearby table. \u201cThat\u2019s Marcie McDonnagh. The guy with her is Dan\u2014Daniel\u2014McDuff. I\u2019ll introduce you and you can speak to Marcie. If she wants to speak to you, anyway. She was pretty shaken up by the whole thing. And she talked to the cops just a little while ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jerry and Mal had probably made this their first stop, Jed realized. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I know Dan. I\u2019ll introduce myself,\u201d Jed told Ben.</p><p>Smith nodded distractedly and looked at his watch. \u201cGreat. If you need anything else...\u201d</p><p>I won\u2019t be bothering you, Jed thought. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said aloud as Smith turned and left.</p> <p>Dan McDuff looked up and frowned when he saw Jed approaching. \u201cHi,\u201d he said when Jed reached the table. The pretty redhead at his side looked up curiously, and Dan made the introductions. \u201cMarcie, this is my old friend Jed Braden. Jed, Marcie McDonnagh, one of my co-workers. Jed, what the hell are you doing here?\u201d Dan frowned. \u201cAre you...are you working on the last...?\u201d He didn\u2019t say the word murder, but he might as well have, because the word seemed to hang in the air, anyway. \u201cBut...you\u2019re not a cop anymore.\u201d He seemed truly puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working it from the private sector,\u201d Jed explained, and looked down at Marcie, who grew pale.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I told the cops. I ran into Patti Jo after her shift. We talked about going to a Halloween party on the thirty-first, after we got off. She was in a good mood. Then she headed to the employee parking lot, and that was the last time I saw her.\u201d Tears suddenly welled in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Marcie,\u201d Jed told her.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t stupid!\u201d Marcie blurted out. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have gone off with a stranger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarcie, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Dan murmured, looking helplessly at Jed. There was a slight spark of irritation in his eyes, as if he were saying, She\u2019s already been through this with the cops. Just how bad do you want to make her feel?</p><p>\u201cHonest to God, she just wouldn\u2019t have gone off with a stranger or with anyone she didn\u2019t trust,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cOh, my God! I have a shift tonight,\u201d she said, as if she\u2019d just realized it.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Dan told her. \u201cSo I\u2019ll walk you to your car, and I\u2019ll follow you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint me to the employee parking lot?\u201d Jed said.</p><p>Dan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll do better. I\u2019ll take you to the exit Patti Jo used and point the way to the lot where they found her car.\u201d</p><p>Marcie gave him a hug before they left. Were the two of them just friends? Jed wondered. Or more?</p> <p>As at all the parks, the hall was part of an entire network that ran underground, so the comings and goings of the employees never had to intrude on the excitement above. The walls were painted with creatures, some friendly-looking, others grotesque, to indicate which section of the park they were beneath, and the corridors seemed to go on forever, with doors to dressing, locker, meeting and dining rooms along the way, as well as storage rooms and offices. Sometimes the halls were empty. Sometimes they were passed by a horde of people.</p><p>Finally they reached the door Patti Jo had used, which opened onto a huge parking lot enclosed by a fence. In the distance, Jed could see a guardhouse at the gate. Surrounding the lot were trees, nothing but trees. The new park had been built far enough away from the other parks that it was practically in the woods.</p><p>\u201cDid you know her well?\u201d Jed asked Dan.</p><p>\u201cPretty well,\u201d Dan said softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was nice. She got along with everyone.\u201d His voice hardened. \u201cBut like Marcie said, she wasn\u2019t a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...she walked out to the parking lot and she wasn\u2019t seen again until she was found off the highway?\u201d Jed murmured to himself as they headed back to the cafeteria.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s scary, huh?\u201d Dan said, studying Jed. \u201cWhat do you think it is, then? The ghost of Beau Kidd, come back to kill again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think ghosts commit murder,\u201d Jed told him. \u201cBut then again, what the hell do I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can help in any way...\u201d Dan offered.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is personal for me now, you know?\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jed agreed.</p><p>The two men said goodbye outside the cafeteria. Jed looked inside before he left. Marcie McDonnagh was still sitting where they had left her. A redhead. Jed could almost picture her lying on the autopsy table, just as Patti Jo had been today, as Sherri Mason had been earlier....</p><p>Redheads. Beautiful redheads.</p><p>Were they all interchangeable in the killer\u2019s mind?</p><p>He swore softly, afraid. As soon as he could get a signal, he flipped open his cell phone and called Christina\u2019s house.</p><p>No one picked up.</p><p>He ran for his car and started driving as quickly as he could in her direction.</p><p>Irrational? Hell, yes. But a sense of dread was growing within him, and he was powerless against it.</p><p>7</p><p>\u201cH a,\u201d Christina said, opening her front door.</p><p>Killer, woofing loudly, ran in ahead of her.</p><p>\u201cI have a dog now!\u201d she called out. \u201cA ferocious dog. He will bark and rip out the throat of anyone who dares to sneak in to play a prank on me.\u201d</p><p>There was no answer from inside, not that she\u2019d really expected there to be. In fact, as she entered, she couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly foolish, especially because there was nothing out of order.</p><p>She let out a soft sigh, following the dog through the house. He was curious and wanted to explore everything.</p><p>After they finished the circuit, she set down a bowl of water for him in the kitchen. Killer lapped up a bit, then stared at her, his tail wagging a thousand beats a minute. \u201cSo, you like it here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He wagged his tail some more.</p><p>The phone rang, and Killer gave one sharp bark, as if in warning.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she said, picking up the receiver.</p><p>Killer barked again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. Dan. What the hell was that?\u201d her cousin demanded over the line.</p><p>\u201cMy dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDog?\u201d he said with a groan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m going to love some big, slobbering beast that will eat my shoes if I step out of them,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love him, trust me,\u201d Christina said. \u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just calling to check up on you. You didn\u2019t answer your cell when I just tried you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I left my bag in the front hall when I came in,\u201d she told him. \u201cSo what has you so worried?\u201d</p><p>She heard him let out a long sigh. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear about the latest victim?\u201d he finally asked. \u201cChristie, she worked here. I knew her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dan, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried sick about you and Ana now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. We\u2019re smart, and careful and now I have a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be around later? I worked the early shift today, so I\u2019ve got some time before I have to go back for my Grim Reader duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here. Come on by if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJed was here earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems he thinks he\u2019s a detective again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, a private detective. I guess he\u2019s wondering if the case was ever really solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, you take care, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She hung up, but she had barely replaced the receiver before the phone rang again. This time it was her cousin Mike.</p><p>\u201cChristie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What\u2019s up, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, just calling to see if you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. Um...you don\u2019t have any late nights planned, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. And yes, I know another woman was killed. But guess what? I bought a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. Woof, woof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I guess. A big one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Killer. You\u2019ll have to come meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that. Seriously...you need to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I promise. Dan\u2019s going to come by later to meet Killer. Why don\u2019t you come, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If I can get out of here at a reasonable hour. Listen...\u201d His voice trailed away. \u201cTake care, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>She rang off and stared at Killer, who was still madly wagging his tail. He cocked his head at her, and she let out a sigh. She had gotten her dog, but it was too late now to get a locksmith out until tomorrow. Not that it mattered. The only two people who had keys to the house were her cousins. Who loved her. Who were worried about her.</p><p>She was still going to have the locks changed, she decided.</p><p>But for tonight...</p><p>\u201cI have Killer,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He looked up at her as if he were hanging on her every word. Then his tail stopped wagging and he began to bark like a mad thing before he turned and raced toward the front door.</p><p>As he ran, she heard the doorbell chime.</p><p>She strode to the door and looked out. She felt as if her heart caught in her throat, then was annoyed with herself for the pleasure that swept through her.</p><p>Jed.</p><p>She told herself not to get carried away. He was Ana\u2019s cousin. It only made sense\u2014especially after last night\u2014that he felt obliged to check up on her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Killer,\u201d she murmured as she opened the door. He stood by her side, wagging his tail but still barking maniacally.</p><p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s all right,\u201d she told the dog again. \u201cJed, what a surprise. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>Jed stared at the dog, then stared at her. \u201cKiller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming in?\u201d she demanded with a sigh, then started for the parlor without waiting for an answer.</p><p>He followed, but not before closing and locking the door in his wake. He found Christina sitting on the piano bench, but she indicated that he should take one of the comfortable wing chairs.</p><p>As soon as he did so, Killer jumped onto his lap, tail wagging as he tried to shower Jed with kisses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKiller?\u201d Jed asked again.</p><p>\u201cWhen I adopted him, that was already his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristina, this is a Jack Russell terrier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Jed firmly ordered the dog. Killer did so, sitting calmly on his lap and staring at him as if he were the most marvelous human ever to occupy the earth.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very well behaved,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cI...uh, don\u2019t want to burst any bubbles here, but Jack Russells aren\u2019t what usually come to mind when someone is thinking guard dog,\u201d Jed told her, looking a little bemused. His hair was slightly ruffled, and the rueful smile tugging at his features was extremely attractive, she thought.</p><p>\u201cHe has a great bark,\u201d Christina said, defending her dog.</p> <p>\u201cYes, he has a great bark.\u201d Jed cleared his throat. \u201cWere they all out of German shepherds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t second best or anything.

It was just that he came flying out and...and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd picked you,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d Christina agreed.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the idea is that he\u2019ll warn you if anyone comes around?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWhy are you so worried? You don\u2019t believe anyone has been here. You think I\u2019m emotionally disturbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot emotionally disturbed,\u201d Jed protested. \u201cJust...hurting,\u201d he said after a moment.</p><p>He patted the dog for a few moments, which somehow kept the silence from growing too awkward as it stretched between them.</p><p>\u201cI hear you were out at the new park,\u201d she said at last. \u201cDan told me the second woman who was murdered was one of his friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jed said, looking down at the dog.</p><p>\u201cAre you...investigating?\u201d she queried.</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not on the force anymore,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>He lifted his eyes to stare at her then. \u201cActually,\u201d he said, \u201cI have a client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA client?\u201d she echoed with a frown.</p><p>\u201cBeau Kidd had a younger sister.\u201d</p><p>Christina almost fell off the piano bench. \u201cBeau Kidd had a younger sister...and she\u2019s hired you to investigate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo figure, huh?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cBut...your book really did kind of...\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed away weakly.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s his sister like?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really gotten to know her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDid she...call you up? How did she find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were both in the cemetery,\u201d he said as he picked up the dog and stood, then set Killer down on the floor. \u201cCongratulations on the new addition to the family.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his last comment and said, \u201cYou met Beau Kidd\u2019s sister in the cemetery\u2014and she hired you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d she began, and then the rest of the words froze in her throat. The cemetery was one of the oldest in the area, but it was still accepting the dead. Her grandparents were both there, as were her parents.</p><p>And so was his wife. He must have been at Margaritte\u2019s grave.</p><p>He stared at her, and a strange look came over his face. When he spoke, his words sounded harsh. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know why, but I went to see Beau Kidd\u2019s grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she murmured, though she didn\u2019t see at all. He seemed so distant, all of a sudden, even though she\u2019d known him for so long.</p><p>She admitted that she had spent most of her life being fascinated with Jed. When he had married Margaritte, she had told herself that he was just Ana\u2019s older cousin, someone she\u2019d idolized but not someone she\u2019d ever really hoped to end up with. She had a life, loved her music, had a few serious relationships along the way.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>He\u2019d always been there for her. Strong, quiet, always saying the right things.</p><p>As she watched him sit there, she knew that she loved the contours of his face, the power of his build. But that wasn\u2019t why he stayed in her mind, like something etched into her heart.</p><p>There was something deeper in him. In those eyes, in the sound of his voice, in his soul, his mind.</p><p>Something that made her long to see him.</p><p>Something that made her draw back when she did.</p><p>He seemed to be deep in thought, but finally he spoke. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance Beau was innocent. If so, I need to do everything in my power to help clear his name. Naturally his sister wants the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Jed, none of it was your fault. It wasn\u2019t your case. You\u2019re a writer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a private eye, when I choose to be,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cI have the license to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI think getting involved in this could be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to her and, to her surprise, lifted her chin with his thumb. \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that not looking into it could prove to be even more dangerous,\u201d he told her. He stepped back then. \u201cWell, I guess I should get going. The, uh...hmm, is it really a whole dog?\u201d he said lightly, teasingly. \u201cThe little mutt is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiller,\u201d she said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cKiller. Right.\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>She was in love, she thought.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019ll keep you from imagining that things in the house are moving around, he\u2019ll definitely be worth his Alpo,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Her spine stiffened. \u201cRight. Thanks so much for coming by, Jed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should probably get those locks changed, though, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was already planning to. Maybe I should lock up my imagination, too,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cChristie, I wasn\u2019t trying to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well...those locks are older than the hills. Who knows who has a key? Your gran might have given them to anyone. It won\u2019t hurt to change them.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and rose. \u201cFor the moment, I\u2019ll just have to use the locks I have.\u201d</p><p>He took the hint. \u201cTake care.\u201d</p><p>With Killer in her arms, she followed him to the door. The dog whined as she watched Jed head down the walk to his car, then looked at her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, he looks great, sounds great, even smells great. But he can be a real asshole,\u201d she told the dog.</p><p>Killer just wagged his tail.</p><p>Michael McDuff\u2019s offices were on International Drive, and he was very glad to be far away from the insanity of the parks. He liked what he did; he made a decent income by putting together the pieces of a production: talent, direction and money, even costuming and effects, but he was grateful he didn\u2019t have to be physically on the spot when everything merged. On the side, he\u2019d also been working on the creation of a children\u2019s show, driven by a desire to overcome the prejudice he so often saw in the business.</p><p>All the parks employed actors, and they weren\u2019t usually discriminated against because of color, nationality, religion or sexual persuasion. But there was a pecking order, and it wasn\u2019t controlled by talent but by what amounted to luck: who\u2019d been on a TV show, who had been in a commercial, who had at least been in a park show before, all the way down to the hopefuls with no experience at all but lots of drive and often more talent than those at the top.</p><p>Far too often he had to deal with a nasty little ten-year-old who thought the world owed her everything because she\u2019d lucked into the role of fairy princess, or a fifteen-year-old who bossed around his parents and made sure to tell everyone he was tops because some commercial director thought he looked cute drinking a big glass of Florida orange juice. He wanted to create a show that gave lots of children with real talent a chance to get experience, so they would have a chance, now and later, to showcase that talent not just locally but anywhere there were performing jobs.</p><p>For now, though, he was done for the day, and he was glad of it. He felt tired of everything and suddenly anxious to get out, head to a pub, watch a football game.</p><p>Closing his desk drawer, he hesitated. He knew, of course, why this day had been so bitter.</p><p>Angie.</p><p>Angie, who still went by McDuff, since she thought it looked better on paper\u2014and in lights\u2014than Vladilovskya.</p><p>He felt his hands knot into fists and made a point of straightening his fingers. Angie. Tall, slim, silicone-breasted Angie.</p><p>He\u2019d paid for that silicone.</p><p>Just as he\u2019d paid for the tummy tuck\u2014not really necessary, he\u2019d been told by her surgeon\u2014and the liposuction. He\u2019d been madly in love. He\u2019d met her when she\u2019d auditioned for a show he was putting together, and she\u2019d fallen in love with him, too. Until she\u2019d gotten the role. And a few other roles. And the boobs, the lipo and the tummy tuck.</p><p>Then she\u2019d started to gain a reputation, even gotten a small role in a movie.</p><p>And he\u2019d been out on his heels like an old, used-up has-been.</p><p>Her name had come up in a meeting today. He\u2019d done all he could to keep his mouth closed. He hadn\u2019t dissed her, even agreed that she might be right for a role in a Christmas special one of the networks had asked him to pull together at the biggest theme park in the area. A role that could lead to more and better\u2014and bigger\u2014things in the future.</p><p>About to rise, he paused when he heard a tentative knock on his door. \u201cYes?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>To his amazement, she walked in. Angie McDuff. His ex. Tall, slim and now all but perfect. Her eyes were huge and light green, and her hair was tinted to the color of burnished copper, though she\u2019d been a brunette when he\u2019d met her.</p><p>\u201cMike,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cHello, Angie. I was just on my way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I just came by to say thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hear that my name came up today and you...agreed that I have the right look, and that I have talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d She stumbled over her words. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>He folded his hands on his desk. \u201cThis is business, Angie. Just business. I make big bucks for putting the pieces together. If you weren\u2019t right for the role, I would have said so. You don\u2019t owe me any thanks.\u201d</p><p>She smiled awkwardly. \u201cYou sound like a Mafioso. \u2018It\u2019s just business,\u2019\u201d she said in a mock-gruff tone.</p><p>He shrugged. It was hard to look at her, but he forced himself to meet her eyes. Something shot through him. A spasm of unease.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see her without remembering what it was like to sleep with her.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t it....</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Is that what you want to hear? Fine, you\u2019re welcome, and I wish you the best of luck, but there\u2019s only so much I can do. Hell, my own brother is on pins and needles waiting to hear if he got the role he wants. I only have so much control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you think. Thank you again, Mike.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSure. Like I said, good luck to you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOne day, maybe you\u2019ll forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive you?\u201d he said, as if puzzled. \u201cMost of the time, I don\u2019t even remember you,\u201d he lied.</p> <p>He could see her stiffen. \u201cSure. Thanks. Bye.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and left, and he sat, listening to the sound of the closing door. Then he rose\u2014and followed her.</p><p>The power of suggestion was a very strange thing indeed, Christina thought after Dan left for his late shift at the park.</p><p>She had never been one to go to a cemetery regularly. She didn\u2019t believe that visiting a grave meant visiting the soul of a loved one. Remembering was the greatest honor she could offer the departed; speaking about them, even laughing about their foibles, kept them alive. She visited the cemetery when it felt right, not on a schedule.</p><p>But Jed\u2019s visit had gotten under her skin.</p><p>She and Killer were going to do just fine, she decided. The little Jack Russell was a bit on the hyper side, but that was good. It meant he would notice\u2014and bark at\u2014the slightest disturbance. It was also good that he was already two years old. The woman at the adoption center had assured her that he no longer ate shoes and anything else he could find. But the best thing about Killer was that he was so affectionate, so eager to please. He didn\u2019t object when she clipped his leash onto his collar when she headed out with him. She had seen dogs in the cemetery before, so she figured as long as no one had a fit, it would be okay to take him with her.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d someone yelled as she stepped out her door. Tony and Ilona were in front of Tony\u2019s sprawling ranch-style house, throwing a Frisbee back and forth. Ilona paused after her greeting and waved at her, sending the Frisbee sailing toward her front yard. Surprised, she lost her grip on the leash, and Killer took off running.</p><p>To her astonishment, the terrier went flying down the porch steps and across the lawn, then made an impossible leap into the air\u2014and caught the Frisbee.</p> <p>\u201cWow!\u201d Ilona shouted, hurrying over.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that?\u201d Tony exclaimed, hot on her heels. He grinned at Christina when they came to a stop in front of her and put his arm around his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s shoulders. \u201cGood God, where did he come from? The dog circus? That was amazing. Is he yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine, and I\u2019m as amazed as you are,\u201d Christina assured him.</p><p>\u201cYou adopted him?\u201d Ilona asked, looking down at Killer, who was wagging his tail, Frisbee in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes, I just got him today,\u201d Christina said. \u201cHis name is Killer.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her. \u201cKiller?\u201d he said politely, but his lips were twitching.</p><p>\u201cHey, he was already named when I got him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, he is killer good with a Frisbee,\u201d Tony said. \u201cYou could enter him in a contest. I bet he\u2019d win, and some of those contests pay good money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pet. He doesn\u2019t have to make money,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cHe obviously loves to play, though. You should let him play with us sometime. Of course, you\u2019re welcome to play, too,\u201d Ilona told her, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as good as he is,\u201d Christina admitted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make allowances for old times\u2019 sake,\u201d Tony assured her.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll see. Meanwhile...Killer, give that Frisbee back. We\u2019re off.\u201d</p><p>To her amazement, the dog immediately obeyed.</p><p>He went over to Tony and whined until Tony hunkered down and took the Frisbee. \u201cThanks, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d she said, leading the dog toward her car.</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d Ilona called.</p><p>\u201cAnd, uh...be careful out there, huh?\u201d Tony added.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d she assured him, feeling heartily sick and tired of everyone\u2019s concern, no matter how well meaning it was.</p><p>She drove to the cemetery. Killer sat in the passenger seat, staring straight ahead, totally well behaved, just as he had been when she had first taken him home. He remained seated, giving only one little woof when she paused by one of the vendors near the entrance to buy two large bouquets of flowers.</p><p>She parked outside the gate, because some of the lanes were so narrow and winding that it was possible to get blocked in.</p><p>She looked around. Everything was quiet. Great oaks dripped with Spanish moss. The land actually rolled gently in every direction. Carved angels and cherubs rose above many of the tombs. The cemetery was really quite beautiful, she realized. Peaceful.</p><p>Sadly, she knew the way to her family plot far too well. Granda had built the mausoleum surrounded by a cast-iron fence when they had first come to America, and it was an impressive sight, with a large stone angel rising above the ornate building marked McDuff/Hardy.</p><p>At the moment the mausoleum held four sarcophagi. Anyone else who wanted to be buried inside would have to start piggy-backing on the others. She could go in, she knew, but instead she set one bouquet outside, where her parents were buried. She was at peace regarding her grandparents\u2019 deaths, but she didn\u2019t think she would ever feel the same about her parents. They had been robbed of so many years of life and had deserved so much more.</p><p>Killer, who seemed to recognize the solemnity of their mission, sat quietly at her side while she mouthed a little prayer. She looked at the dates carved into the stone marking her parents\u2019 grave and touched them, whispering a little \u201cI love you\u201d to each.</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe they heard her any more clearly here than they would anywhere else. This was just...a courtesy. More for herself than for them.</p><p>She held the second bouquet in her arms, but she wasn\u2019t sure where she was going with it.</p><p>She turned around and froze, feeling as if a cool breeze were washing over her.</p><p>Of course she was sure. She knew exactly where she was going.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t far.</p><p>Suddenly, just as clearly as if it had been the day before, she remembered back to her grandfather\u2019s funeral. She remembered how many people had been there, compared to the single couple who had stood by the other grave, the woman weeping pitifully.</p><p>She remembered how, when they had gone, she had walked over to the grave and cast a single flower onto the casket.</p><p>She hardly noticed Killer trailing along as she wended her way between graves, past markers and cherubs, crosses and angels, to that other grave.</p><p>Beauregard Kidd.</p><p>Beloved son and brother.</p><p>And the date...</p><p>He had died the same day as her grandfather, and he had been buried on the same day her grandfather had been buried.</p><p>And no one had come to his funeral because he had been suspected of being a serial killer.</p><p>The breeze picked up.</p><p>At her feet, the dog whined.</p><p>She set down the last bouquet of flowers. \u201cI hope that justice is served, Beau Kidd, and I pray for your family. For your sister.\u201d She had been raised in the Catholic Church, so she crossed herself and added, \u201cAnd I pray for you, Beau, and your immortal soul.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the breeze turned cold, and Killer whined again.</p><p>And darkness arrived in a rush.</p><p>She ducked low and scooped up Killer, then hurried out to her car. All the way home, she mocked herself for being a fool. But once inside with her little dog, she felt better. With all the lights on, the house felt brighter. Even normal.</p><p>She admitted that she actually felt at ease. All because of a little Jack Russell with an enormous personality.</p><p>She spent some time experimenting with a few ideas on the piano, Killer at her feet. Then, right when she was in the middle of something she thought had potential, he leapt to his feet and began to bark. She jumped, but a minute later, when she heard the doorbell, she smiled.</p><p>\u201cKiller, you\u2019re the best,\u201d she said to the dog as she went to answer the door. \u201cHello?\u201d she said when she got there, peering through the peephole.</p><p>\u201cChristie?\u201d</p><p>It was Dan, and she opened the door. He looked tired and depressed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about your friend,\u201d she told him with a big hug.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I knew her that well, it\u2019s just...things like that, they just don\u2019t happen to people you know, you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come out? We\u2019ll get something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to leave Killer alone just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiller. Right. Your monster guard dog.\u201d He almost smiled as he looked down at the terrier by her feet.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great guard dog. He barks when anyone comes near me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about fast food, then?\u201d Dan asked. \u201cWe can park and eat in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>They took his car, and by the time they\u2019d gone to a hamburger drive-up window, then parked, Dan was smitten by the dog.</p><p>Killer was obviously interested in hamburger, but he waited very politely to be offered a bite. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought you were getting a big dog,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was getting a big dog, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s great.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, did you hear anything about the new role yet?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cZeus? Nope. I think the park\u2019s getting nervous. Who knows? Tourism may plummet. There may never be a part, because there may never be a play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you pushed Mike to help?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cMike can\u2019t do anything now. He\u2019s finished with his part of it. He did recommend me, of course. And I did a damned good audition. So...\u201d He winced suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think Patti Jo was up for a part, too.\u201d</p><p>She let out a long breath and stopped herself from telling him that she was sorry. He knew it already. And it wasn\u2019t as if anything she said could make it better.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be all right going home tonight?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Dan glanced at her. \u201cAre you going to be all right in that old house by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not by myself,\u201d she assured him with a laugh. \u201cI have Killer.\u201d</p><p>When they got back to the house, he went inside with her, and together they walked through the rooms, making sure no one was there and nothing was out of place. She really only did it to make Dan happy. She was certain Killer would have pitched a barking fit if there had been anyone in the house.</p> <p>But she thanked Dan and gave him a good-night peck on the cheek, then locked the door behind him and went to bed feeling confident, the little dog at her side.</p><p>\u201cYup, kiddo, you get to sleep on the bed,\u201d she told him when he sat on the floor looking wistfully at the mattress.</p><p>She lay down, amazed at how tired she was and just how ready she was to go to sleep. Then again, she hadn\u2019t had much sleep since she\u2019d moved in.</p><p>She was just dozing off when she felt the dog move. Felt him rise and heard him sniff the air. Suddenly he hopped down from the bed.</p><p>\u201cKiller?\u201d she whispered, too nervous to call it out.</p><p>She slipped out of bed and started down the stairs, feeling the heavy silence of the house. She started to call out his name again, but the sound died in her throat. When she reached the front hall, she hesitated, listening.</p><p>She heard a little whining sound. Not a bark. Nothing that sounded like either pain or agitation. It actually sounded...affectionate.</p><p>\u201cKiller?\u201d she said, and followed the sound into the parlor.</p> <p>A scream froze in her throat.</p><p>A man was there.</p><p>Solid. Real. Sitting on the piano bench and stroking her dog.</p><p>He looked up, and her pent-up scream tore from her throat.</p><p>A look of distress crossed his features, and he rose, reaching out to her. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t scream. Help me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, another scream tearing from her lips. Because she knew who he was. Beau Kidd.</p><p>Except Beau Kidd was dead.</p><p>\u201cPlease...I need help,\u201d he told her.</p><p>But she hardly heard him, because the world was spinning, fading. As she sank into oblivion, the last thing she heard was Killer\u2019s whine of distress.</p><p>8</p><p>S itting at his dining room table, Jed spread out the files and notes he had accrued, the past on the left, the present on the right. And in the center, a list of the various commonalities he had come up with.</p><p>Most of the women were in the entertainment business in some way\u2014but nothing sleazy like stripping or pole-dancing. But he still didn\u2019t think it was their employment that had drawn the killer\u2014or killers\u2014to them.</p><p>The hair?</p><p>Every single victim had red hair or noticeable red highlights, whether natural or artificial.</p><p>The latest victim had last been seen leaving work.</p><p>He paused and flipped through his notes. Grace Garcia had last been seen leaving a shopping mall. He kept flipping. All the women had disappeared in parking lots, whether coming or going. None of them\u2014and the police had searched their apartments thoroughly\u2014had been abducted from home. The killer was taking them when they were in close proximity to the safety of their own cars.</p><p>Therefore the killer either appeared trustworthy or was someone all the victims had known.</p><p>The second option didn\u2019t seem likely. No one had discovered any common acquaintances between the women killed twelve years ago, much less between them and the newest victims.</p><p>He found himself pulling out an old file concerning the investigation following Beau Kidd\u2019s death. The detective who had written up the majority of the notes, a man named Bill Grimsby, had apparently taken Larry Atkins\u2019s word regarding the final killing, but he had checked out Beau\u2019s alibi for the death of the other woman he had dated. At the time she had been taken, he had been at his family\u2019s home. His parents had sworn that he\u2019d been there almost all day, a Saturday, helping his father take down the hurricane shutters, then had stayed for dinner.</p><p>Jed had wanted to interview Grimsby when he was writing his book, but had never gotten the chance, because Grimsby had retired and headed out on a sailboat somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Jed put the file down and picked up the phone to call Jerry.</p><p>\u201cGot anything?\u201d Jerry asked glumly when he picked up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but mostly just the obvious. We know he likes redheads, but beyond that...These women are walking away with someone they trust. They know him, or he has the ability to make them believe in him, just like we said earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be a connection,\u201d Jerry said disgustedly. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the legwork. Asking all the right people the right questions. But the last two victims...they were happy as little larks, heading home, then...they were reported missing, their cars found abandoned...and then...well, you\u2019ve seen the way they ended up. So far, we haven\u2019t got squat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got enough to save a few lives,\u201d Jed told him. \u201cYou need to speak with your public affairs person. Warn women matching the description not to go anywhere alone and not to trust strangers, no matter how harmless they seem. Get it on the air. It might to do some good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jerry murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He could almost hear Jerry sigh at the other end. \u201cPeople will ignore us, think they\u2019re safe, think they know better. This killer\u2014he\u2019ll find another victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it hard on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t kill again, if he doesn\u2019t make a mistake somewhere along the line, we\u2019ll never catch him,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>Jed was silent for a long moment, then asked, \u201cJerry, do you know anything about Bill Grimsby? I know he retired, but have you heard anything about him coming back to the States?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything, but you might want to call Larry Atkins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Larry know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no one ever told you when you were writing that book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBill Grimsby and Larry Atkins were tight. In fact, I think they\u2019re distant cousins or something like that. Give Larry a call. Maybe he can tell you where Bill has gotten himself off to.\u201d</p><p>How the hell had he not known that, and how the hell had that fact been ignored? Jed asked himself in shock. The officer verifying the facts regarding another officer who had fired his weapon and killed his own partner had been a buddy\u2014maybe even a relative\u2014of that same officer?</p><p>Surprised, disturbed and angry with himself as well as everyone else, Jed somehow kept a civil tone as he told Jerry to have a good night, then rang off.</p><p>He drummed his fingers on the table, wishing he still smoked.</p><p>How the hell had that information been ignored?</p><p>Everyone had wanted the case to go away. People wanted to sleep nights. They had all wanted it to be true that the killer was dead.</p><p>He looked at his watch. It was late. But not late enough. And since he was never going to sleep, what the hell? Might as well drive.</p><p>She felt Killer\u2019s cold little nose against her cheek. Frowning, she struggled to open her eyes.</p><p>When she did, she gasped, ready to scream again as she struggled to get up, desperately trying to get away from the man who was hunkered down by her side, an anxious expression on his face.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be real, she told herself. She had utterly lost her mind, and no dog was protection against that. Her poor little dog of one day was owned by a woman who was totally insane, living in a fantasy world where the dead came back to life.</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cGo away. I do not see you,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cBut you do see me. And you saw me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see me, all those years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? No\u2014don\u2019t answer me. I\u2019m getting up, and I\u2019m leaving. Hell, I\u2019m going to have myself booked into a lunatic asylum.\u201d</p><p>He reached out, as if to help her rise.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried softly.</p><p>Killer barked happily, as if this were some kind of a game, and looked from her to Beau Kidd.</p><p>Beau Kidd.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>But it was Beau Kidd. She knew his face. Was it from the newspapers? It had to be. They had never met. And she had never seen him before.</p><p>Except...</p><p>Except at the foot of her bed the other night. Except at the table at the caf\u00e9. Except out in her yard, when she\u2019d passed out. Passed out and been found in the morning.</p><p>By Jed.</p><p>Who was certain she was crazy, or at least emotionally disturbed.</p><p>She stared at him and told herself that she had to be dreaming, that in reality she was still passed out on the floor.</p><p>\u201cGo away. You\u2019re dead. You can\u2019t be here. You don\u2019t know me, and I don\u2019t know you. Now, go away,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou do know me,\u201d he said stubbornly. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added softly, \u201cyou know damned well that I can be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He smiled. He had dimples, and he was very good-looking. And she was insane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou put a flower on my grave,\u201d he told her. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? At the cemetery. You saw your grandfather. He came to you. And then you put a flower on my grave.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI never saw my grandfather after he died.\u201d</p><p>Beau sighed. \u201cBut you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m begging you, go away,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>He looked weary, defeated. \u201cBut I need your help,\u201d he all but whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to close my eyes, and you\u2019re going to go away. When I open my eyes, you\u2019ll be gone,\u201d Christina said, and she closed her eyes tightly.</p><p>She opened them.</p><p>And to her amazement, when she opened them, he was gone.</p> <p>She swallowed and stood, leaning on the wall, afraid to move away from it. Afraid that if she tried to stand on her own, she would merely slip back down to the floor, into oblivion.</p><p>Killer was still there, looking up at her with his trusting brown eyes. He barked, then whined and drew even closer.</p><p>\u201cKiller, huh?\u201d she said to him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even bark at him. You befriended the...the enemy,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, not the enemy. The guy who wasn\u2019t even here. You\u2019re supposed to be protecting me,\u201d she chided him.</p><p>But could anyone or anything protect her from herself?</p><p>She looked at her watch. Eleven-thirty. But she didn\u2019t want to be alone.</p><p>She was getting dressed and getting out of there.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, we\u2019re going upstairs,\u201d she told Killer. No need. He followed her, then waited on the bed while she washed her face, pulled on a navy knit dress and stepped into a pair of sandals. She grabbed her purse and made sure she had her cell phone. Suddenly she realized that the television was on.</p><p>Had she left it on?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t care. Not anymore. It was a proven fact. She was insane, which was leading her to believe she was seeing the ghost of Beau Kidd. There was no denying it now.</p><p>Her hand was on the remote, but she hesitated. A newswoman was talking about a police warning for woman\u2014especially young redheads\u2014to avoid being out alone and steer clear of strangers.</p><p>She flicked off the television. \u201cI have a dog now,\u201d she said weakly to the dark screen, then headed back down the stairs. She had just reached the front door and was going for the handle when Killer began to bark.</p><p>Christina screamed.</p><p>Someone was there, right on the other side of her front door.</p><p>There were no good games on at eleven-thirty at night. Didn\u2019t matter. Michael McDuff was happy enough to sit on a stool at O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, staring at ESPN while the good games were recapped. His family had always come here, and a man didn\u2019t have to drink at a place every night to lay claim to a bar stool. He was on his third Guinness, a big mistake, considering he had a meeting first thing in the morning.</p> <p>\u201cHey, handsome, don\u2019t you think you should maybe get some food into your system?\u201d</p><p>He spun around. Mary Donahoe, with her bright eyes, cheerful smile and unruly carrot-red hair, was standing at his side. He smiled. \u201cGuess you\u2019re right, Mary. Perhaps I should have something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood call. What\u2019ll it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShepherd\u2019s pie, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Mary cocked her head at an angle, staring at him. \u201cA young lady in here the other night ordered the same thing, and I just realized there\u2019s a likeness between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMust have been Christina. My cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I knew there was a lot of family. I\u2019ve not been here so long myself, but I hear from O\u2019Reilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much family now. Everyone\u2019s dead except me, my brother, Dan\u2014the truly charming one\u2014and my cousin, Christie. She just moved up here, and she\u2019s living in the old family house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice. It\u2019s good to have family,\u201d Mary said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family is all back across the great old ocean,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cI miss them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you live alone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAye, me and me cat.\u201d She laughed and turned toward the kitchen.</p><p>He caught her arm before she could walk away. \u201cMary, don\u2019t leave here alone, you hear me? It\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>She touched her curling mop of hair. \u201cWell, it\u2019s true it\u2019s red,\u201d she said. \u201cStill, I\u2019m a careful girl.\u201d</p><p>Mike shook his head. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t go home alone.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re still here when me shift ends, you can see to it that I get safe to me car, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re off,\u201d he told her grimly.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cShepherd\u2019s pie, sir. On its way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Christina heard an angry voice ask from outside.</p><p>She was almost paralyzed with relief. Quickly\u2014before he took it into his mind to break it down\u2014she opened the door. \u201cJed,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cYou were screaming!\u201d he said accusingly, then stared at her, frowning as he noticed that she was carrying her purse and her keys. \u201cYou\u2019re going out?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cUm...yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell do you think you\u2019re going at this time of night?\u201d</p><p>She drew her brows together, trying to think of a reply. Her hesitation etched a deeper frown into his forehead.</p><p>\u201cChristie, where were you going?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, opening the door wider to let him in. Killer barked happily. He obviously loved Jed, who continued to stare at her questioningly from the stoop.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cOut where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIf you need something...need to go somewhere...I can take you,\u201d Jed offered.</p><p>\u201cNo...just, uh, come on in. Shut the door. I guess I don\u2019t really need to go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristina, you\u2019re scaring me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She had started walking down the hall, toward the parlor, when his hands fell on her shoulders and spun her around. He was close. She was overwhelmed by everything about him. Not just his scent, which was always clean and somehow richly masculine. There was also his height, the perfect complement to her own. The heat, the vitality, emanating from him.</p><p>She\u2019d always had a crush on him, but it was getting worse. Deeper. Sexual.</p><p>She caught herself staring at his chest. At the cool striped cotton of his casually tailored shirt. She looked up slowly into his eyes. He had the greatest eyes. Dark. Bottomless. Hard sculpted features that added to the sexual allure of the man. He was clearly concerned as he stared back at her. He wasn\u2019t mocking her. Not at that moment.</p><p>She opened her mouth, feeling the need to say something to keep him from thinking she was stark raving mad. But he just kept staring back at her, as if...</p><p>He tilted her chin, and it wasn\u2019t just to look into her eyes.</p><p>She felt his mouth on hers, the merest touch, and it was as if intoxicating waves of heat rushed over her, filled her, fused into her body, blood and bone. She strained to reach higher, standing on her toes. She felt his lips brush hers again, not real, too real....</p><p>She pressed against the steely heat of his chest, shifting until her lips were fully beneath his. His arms went around her then, crushing her against him. His lips were no longer a whisper of air; they were crushing, like fire, hungering for and consuming her mouth.</p><p>In a thousand years, she never could have dreamed of this....</p><p>It wasn\u2019t real, she thought. This was the kind of thing that happened only in dreams, in fantasies.</p><p>But it was real, and it felt as if all the events in her life had led her toward that moment. She was touching him, stroking the incredible contours of his face, warming herself against the fluid heat of his body. She was all but melded against him, except, annoyingly, for their clothing, which neither of them seemed to be getting out of the way fast enough. The moment somehow felt both amazingly graceful and yet ridiculously awkward.</p><p>In dreams, in reality, her fingers trembled as she touched him. As she did all those things she had longed to do for so many years. She felt the texture of his skin, traced the structure of his bones. She pressed against him with the entire length of her body, feeling a new weakness wash over her, along with a new strength, a new life. Her fingers played over his shoulders and around to his nape, then down his back. And all the while she tasted his kiss, tasted his tongue, reveled in the power and sweep and naked sensuality of that touch.</p><p>His shirt lay discarded on the floor, and she traced her fingers over his bare chest. Her shoes were off, her dress tossed on top of his shirt.</p><p>They\u2019d been standing in the hallway, and then suddenly they weren\u2019t. At first she was leading him up the stairs, and then it was as if he grew weary of their slow progress and paused long enough to sweep her straight off her feet. She met his eyes as he made his way up the steps. She was preternaturally aware of the intensity of his gaze and barely even noticed the softness of the bed as they fell down onto it. She had ached for this for so long, her feelings submerged beneath pride and dignity and self-preservation.</p><p>As his mouth traveled across her flesh, her undergarments seemed to melt away, and she realized she had no idea where they\u2019d gone.</p><p>Lights blazed throughout the house, but she didn\u2019t care. The only thing that mattered was the amazing sweet fire of his kiss, the heat of his caress against her naked flesh, the pressure of his body, arms, hips, sex...hard against her. She was desperate, starving, to return his every touch. But he was the more experienced lover. There were moments when she lay still, almost like a deer in the headlights, all but paralyzed by the sensations the liquid trail of his tongue and the sweep of his hands aroused upon her flesh.</p><p>God, yes, he was good.</p><p>God, yes, he knew what he was doing....</p><p>The tiniest sensation in itself might have been enough to make her insane, just the feel of his frame next to hers, the brush of his hair against her flesh, his slightest movement. But there was more, so much more: the way his body moved against hers, the friction, the strength, the ease. He was everywhere. Kissing her ankles. Sweeping his tongue on her collarbone. She shivered at the power of his hand stroking down the length of her, at his fingertips on her inner thighs. Then his lips again, caressing her breasts, her abdomen, her hip, followed by a series of liquid caresses low on her belly, high on her thighs, directly between them, a touch of sheer madness, not of this world.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pressed her own lips against his flesh, tasted and teased, shuddering against him. She felt caught in a whirlwind, riding her tremors to climax, exploding like shards of shattered crystal, then riding that exultant wave again. She slid her ragged touch downward, stroked and caressed as he had done, until he sat up and she felt herself lifted in the steel vise of his arms, then brought down until at last he was inside her.</p><p>He held her hands and lifted their arms over their heads, then wrapped her arms around him and held them there, and all the while the dark enigma of his eyes seemed to pin her in place. She thought that she couldn\u2019t know a man better, and yet, for just a moment, she had to wonder if, even now, she knew him at all.</p><p>But then she was writhing, aware of nothing but the rise of desire and the feel of him within her, the kiss of coolness in the air, the surge of heat that seemed to rise like a ground fog around them. As he thrust and she arched against him, the friction of flesh upon flesh teased and tormented, awakening a desperate and almost unappeasable hunger, until, as mercurial and thunderous as a burst of diamonds in the air, she felt her climax sweep over and through her again, leaving her trembling against him, shaking and...</p> <p>Cold.</p><p>The air was cold.</p><p>Her flesh was warm where he touched her, so cold where he did not.</p><p>And the light...The room was so bright. She loved the light, but it meant there was no sweet darkness in which to hide. She didn\u2019t know whether she should be blas\u00e9 or embarrassed...whether she\u2019d even done this right....</p><p>He shifted and drew her down against him on the bed, fingers smoothing her hair, touching her face so gently.</p> <p>Oh, God, what should she say now?</p><p>Somehow he kept the moment from being awkward. \u201cYou do like it bright,\u201d he said softly, with both bemusement and affection.</p><p>She tried to match his tone. \u201cToo much?\u201d she suggested, as if they were sharing tea and she had just poured the milk.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019d find it a bit difficult to sleep this way,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Not if you were going mad, she thought. Not if you believed you had a ghost in your house. The ghost of a vicious murderer. Even then, a little voice inside asked, But had he ever been the murderer people said?</p><p>Suddenly she bolted up to a sitting position.</p> <p>He was leaning back, one elbow crooked behind his head. He stared at her, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI forgot about Killer,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI closed the bedroom door. He\u2019s cute and all, but not...well, you know.\u201d</p><p>She smiled for a moment, then swallowed uneasily. \u201cI...uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She decided to spit it out. \u201cJed, I was on my way out before because I was...because I didn\u2019t want to be here.\u201d</p><p>Because I thought I saw a ghost and I was terrified, she added silently.</p><p>He smiled, reaching out, touching her hair. \u201cI understand that feeling,\u201d he told her softly.</p> <p>No. He didn\u2019t. He understood how it had hurt to go on living where he had made his home with Margaritte. But she wasn\u2019t hurting. She was scared.</p><p>His smile turned rueful, and he arched a brow. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t all just because I, um, happened to be here and make a convenient distraction, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, no!\u201d she said in horror.</p><p>He had dimples in both cheeks, she noticed. They looked really nice when he smiled, and suddenly she was scared again\u2014in a whole different way.</p><p>\u201cJed, could you...would you stay tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need me,\u201d he said, his eyes on hers again. There was no smile in them.</p><p>She felt her own lips curve slightly. \u201cWhat if I just wanted you to?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I get the feeling that you really do need me tonight. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She curled against him, not daring to speak. She didn\u2019t trust anyone enough to tell them how deeply afraid she felt. Certainly not Jed, not tonight.</p><p>But fear didn\u2019t matter right now. Not when his hand was strong and gentle when he touched her. Not when his arm around her offered security, a bastion behind which she could hide from the world.</p><p>She lay there in silence and shivered slightly, feeling the air around them grow colder. He pulled her more tightly against him and reached for the covers.</p><p>How strange...She knew that if he stayed, the feel of him against her would arouse her again. But for the moment she heard his words like a whisper, as if from far away.</p><p>\u201cPoor thing. You\u2019re just exhausted, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She nodded. It was true. Sleep had been so lacking in her life. Well, sex had been lacking, as well, but now she felt as if she had feasted and exhaustion was taking its toll. She settled herself in his arms and closed her eyes.</p><p>A moment later she felt his breath as he whispered, \u201cChristie...the lights. Will you be all right if I turn just a few of them out?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and managed a nod, though she didn\u2019t open her eyes. She wasn\u2019t afraid of the dark. She wasn\u2019t afraid of ghosts. She simply wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><p>Not with him there.</p><p>9</p><p>W hen Christina woke up, Jed was gone.</p><p>There was a flower\u2014a hibiscus she was sure had been plucked from a bush in the front yard\u2014next to her pillow, along with a note. You were sound asleep, so I set the coffee for eight. Nothing strange\u2014it was me.</p><p>She bit her lower lip, hugging the covers close. No Had a wonderful time or See you later or even a Thanks for the memories.</p><p>But there was a flower on her pillow. And he had stayed until morning.</p><p>A short woof drew her attention. Apparently when Jed had left, he\u2019d opted to leave the bedroom door open. Killer was at the foot of the bed, sitting and watching her, his head cocked at an angle she was beginning to recognize and that always seemed to suggest that the terrier knew something she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDid he feed you, buddy?\u201d she wondered aloud. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll just hop in the shower, then get some coffee, and...well, if I\u2019m ever going to get paid, I\u2019d better start working on some ideas.\u201d</p><p>She hurried into the shower, where she hugged her arms around herself, dismayed at the occasional bouts of trembling that came on as she stood beneath the water. Sex happened all the time, she was certain. Well, for some people, anyway. She couldn\u2019t let herself read too much into it.</p><p>Despite that electric attraction she\u2019d felt to him forever...</p><p>Was he still in love with his wife?</p><p>Some people, even some men, believed there was only one perfectly matched person out there. Only one love to last a lifetime. One that was like a knife embedded in the heart, one soul to match another soul for all time. Interesting theory. What if Jed was that one for her but Margaritte had been that one for him?</p><p>She emerged from the shower and dressed quickly, noticing that Killer was no longer waiting for her. As she pulled on a pair of jeans, she heard him barking downstairs. Not a harsh, defensive barking, just one of his excited \u201cwoof-woof\u201d things, as if a friend were there.</p><p>She felt a strange chill and a sudden desperate need to hurry downstairs.</p><p>As she reached the landing, she heard her piano being played. Okay, she thought, apparently Jed hadn\u2019t left after all. He was downstairs, playing her piano.</p><p>Did Jed even play the piano?</p><p>She rushed into the parlor and came to a dead stop.</p><p>Killer was actually sitting on the piano bench, next to the man who was playing.</p><p>Beau Kidd.</p><p>He turned to face her, and she felt the familiar rush of fear\u2014no, terror\u2014sweep over her, like a dark blanket blacking out the world.</p><p>No! something inside her pleaded.</p><p>She leaned against the wall to keep from falling. \u201cWho are you really?\u201d she demanded harshly.</p><p>Killer wagged his tail. Great. She might have fallen in love with the little terrier, but he was proving to be no guard dog.</p><p>\u201cYou know who I am,\u201d the man at the piano said. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>He started to rise, and she lifted a hand to stop him. \u201cNo, stay right where you are.\u201d</p><p>He did, and though she couldn\u2019t stop leaning against the wall for support, she managed not to pass out.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou let me in,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cOh, no. No, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ouija board?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMore than the Ouija board, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see dead people,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled, lowering his head. He\u2019d been a nice-looking man, she thought, with an easy smile. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten the kindness of that flower on my grave,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here because of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows exactly why I\u2019m here?\u201d he murmured, and ran his fingers over the piano keys.</p><p>Killer gave a happy bark.</p><p>She shook her head again, hoping to clear her vision and find him gone. \u201cYou\u2019re not here. You can\u2019t be here,\u201d she said desperately.</p><p>He stood up. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled deeply, staring at him. \u201cBecause of the murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m obviously not the killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does that have to do with you being here, in my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, I don\u2019t want to be unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a gift,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any gifts,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cToo bad. It\u2019s yours whether you want it or not,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He lifted his hands. \u201cI\u2019m innocent.\u201d</p><p>She felt a chill overtake her. \u201cSo who is the Interstate Killer?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He stared at her in frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I swear to you, that\u2019s no copycat out there now. The killer who struck twelve years ago is at it again.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI am going crazy. That\u2019s the only explanation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was impatient now. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo normal people see ghosts?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cDefine normal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She let out a sound of irritation. He wasn\u2019t there. She was creating him in her mind, just as she had undoubtedly created that vision of her grandfather in her mind, all those years ago.</p><p>She turned her back on him and walked down the hallway to the kitchen, where she poured herself some coffee. When she turned around again, she started.</p><p>He was in the kitchen with her, leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou say you\u2019re here because you\u2019re innocent and you want me to help you somehow,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, you\u2019re in the wrong place. I can\u2019t help you. I write advertising jingles for a living. I\u2019m not a cop, and I don\u2019t speak to the dead. We\u2019re not all that far from Cassadaga. It\u2019s a charming little town founded by spiritualists. If you pop on over there, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of people who would just love to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it has something to do with the flower. You did see and talk with your grandfather, you know. He was a great guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew my grandfather?\u201d she asked, skeptical.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWe\u2019d have coffee now and then at a doughnut shop down on International Drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhy should you have known it? We weren\u2019t best friends or anything. We just used to chat some mornings over doughnuts and coffee.\u201d</p> <p>She studied him closely. He looked real. Flesh-and-blood real.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be. But then again, the alternative was just as ridiculous. Why would someone pretending to be Beau Kidd break into her house? Not just pretending to be him, a dead ringer for him.</p><p>Admittedly, this was Orlando in October. Costumes and makeup were plentiful. But how could anyone make his face resemble a newspaper photo to a T?</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going out now. When I come back, you\u2019re going to be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my cousins put you up to this\u2014if this is some kind of a joke, or worse\u2014you\u2019d better be gone when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Brave words. If he was a killer, she had certainly provoked him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d he asked her sadly. \u201cI can\u2019t go. And I need your help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to burn that Ouija board.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Sadly. \u201cWon\u2019t do you any good,\u201d he told her. Then his grin suddenly turned deep and real. \u201cWhich is it? I\u2019m a very strange kind of home invader\u2014made up to look like Beau Kidd and put up to these wicked deeds by one of your cousins. Or I\u2019m a ghost, tied to this house because you live here, and I can\u2019t just go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. I just have an overactive imagination,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you. I\u2019m not a cop.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet, staring at her. Then he said, \u201cBut you were sleeping with one. An ex-cop, anyway. Actually, the ex-cop who maligned me so badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou can try to run away,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t really go anywhere. We all learn that at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your philosophizing,\u201d she told him. \u201cNow...goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d he echoed, then gave her a thumbs-up sign. \u201cYou\u2019ve stopped blacking out on me, at least. We\u2019re moving in the right direction. I knew this would work out, because whether you want to or not, you already know that ghosts are real. When you were a child, you weren\u2019t afraid. Remember? You need to reopen the door on those memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Christina said firmly, then turned to her new pet, who was sitting just inside the kitchen doorway. \u201cKiller, come on. We\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>Instead of obeying, the dog walked over and stood next to Beau Kidd, whining mournfully.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d she snapped to the dog.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t budge, she picked him up and, without looking back, headed down the hallway, Killer in her arms. She slammed the front door behind her and made a point of locking it.</p><p>She got in the car and headed straight for a caf\u00e9, where her first order of business was to pull out her cell and call a locksmith, who agreed to meet her at the house in an hour. Her cousins were in the clear, she decided, but it still made sense to get new locks for the place.</p><p>The dignified gray-haired man stood stiff and unyielding in the doorway.</p><p>Jed wasn\u2019t sure just what he had expected. Of course Beau Kidd\u2019s father was going to be anything but glad to see him.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are. I know exactly who you are,\u201d Forest Kidd said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I offended you, sir\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffended me? That trash you wrote did more than offend me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a work of fiction,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cAs if that\u2019s any excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Forest Kidd said angrily, \u201cmy son has now been proved to be innocent!\u201d</p><p>Jed let out a soft sigh. \u201cSir, many people think this is a copycat killer.\u201d</p><p>The older man swore, then turned and strode down the hallway of his single-story ranch house, but he left the door open, so Jed shrugged and followed him.</p><p>He went on back to a pleasant family room. Glass doors led out to a pool area, and an open counter separated them from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Jed said, taking a seat across from Forest Kidd, \u201cyou said you were with your son when at least one of the killings took place. Whoever did kill those women\u2014and whoever is killing now\u2014isn\u2019t being quick about it. He rapes his victims repeatedly before finally murdering them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know every aspect of this case?\u201d Kidd demanded.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I\u2019m sure you know as much as I do,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>The older man shrugged, blue eyes sweeping across his backyard. \u201cI come from one of the real old-time families around here. My great-grandparents were up in Jacksonville during the Civil War.\u201d His gaze fell sharply on Jed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve never left,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully, it\u2019s a transient area now. People coming and going, working at the parks for a while, then moving on. Otherwise, we\u2019d have had to leave. Even though no one ever proved that Beau was guilty of a damn thing. My son was shot and killed, and as far as everyone was concerned, that was it. His partner\u2014Atkins\u2014he was pretty broken up. He came to see us, and at least there was an inquiry, but none of it mattered. Beau was dead\u2014and branded. The killing stopped, and no matter what I said or did...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said your son was with you when one of the women was killed,\u201d Jed said, hoping Forest might be willing to discuss the subject now.</p><p>Forest Kidd leaned forward and folded his hands before him and stared hard at Jed. \u201cI said it because it was the truth. My wife said it, and my daughter said it. No one called us liars right to our faces. They just gave us those pitying looks that said they thought we were liars. And that was it.\u201d He leaned back again. \u201cSo what are you going to do? Write another book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to find out the truth,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to make me care?\u201d Forest asked bitterly.</p><p>Jed stood up. \u201cI think you already care, Mr. Kidd. You have a daughter. A beautiful daughter with red hair. I think you have to care, and that\u2019s why you let me in.\u201d</p><p>Forest Kidd stood, a tall man, almost eye level with Jed, who rose along with him.</p><p>\u201cI care. But I\u2019ve just told you everything I can, everything I told the police before. My son didn\u2019t do it. The police were desperate. They were grasping at straws. The community was terrified, and there was Beau, a perfect suspect. He\u2019d been seeing two of the girls, and he was leaning over the corpse of the last victim. I don\u2019t believe he ever drew his weapon on his partner. I don\u2019t care how sincere and wounded and agonized that bastard likes to look. There was never any reason for him to pull a gun.\u201d Forest Kidd stared at Jed belligerently.</p><p>Jed frowned. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that even if he had been the killer, discovered there with the body, he could have just pretended he had discovered the corpse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo. You\u2019re a lot brighter than those louts down at the precinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suggested that to the cops?\u201d Jed asked. He\u2019d never seen it in any of the notes. He hadn\u2019t interviewed Forest Kidd or the family when he\u2019d written his book. He had been writing fiction, for one thing, and he\u2019d been convinced that the family of a serial killer would hardly want to talk to him about their beloved son. Not when they were still denying what everyone else was taking to be the God\u2019s honest truth.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you can tell me?\u201d Jed asked quietly.</p><p>Forest Kidd stared at him for a long moment. \u201cAsk my daughter, Kitty, about the truth,\u201d he said softly. \u201cKatherine. I hear you met her in the cemetery. She said you were there at Beau\u2019s grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your daughter there, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed to think that you...well, hell. She seems to believe you\u2019re a decent guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to discover the truth, Mr. Kidd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the truth. You ask any member of my family. Beau couldn\u2019t have been guilty. He lived in a small apartment. And trust me, they searched it. They looked and looked and looked for a hotel or motel where he might have stayed, where he might have held a woman and abused her until he killed her. They didn\u2019t find anything. And you know why? Because there was nothing to find. Beau wasn\u2019t guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jed said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou prove it,\u201d Forest Kidd told him as Jed started down the hallway. \u201cYou know, if you can prove it, maybe you can live with yourself again,\u201d Kidd called after him.</p><p>Jed didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI know your wife died of cancer,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cNo man out there can change that.

Please.\u201d</p> <p>When Jed reached the front door and looked back, Forest Kidd had disappeared.</p><p>Jed let himself out.</p><p>Dan was at the door of the old family house, about to ring the bell, when he saw Ilona come outside. She saw him, too, and waved. \u201cHey, there!\u201d he called to her.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she called back, but she didn\u2019t come over. Was she looking at him suspiciously? he wondered.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Christie?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cShe went out a while ago,\u201d Ilona told him.</p><p>\u201cDid she say where she was going?\u201d</p><p>Ilona shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask her. I just happened to see her car drive by. Can I help you? Hey, don\u2019t you guys all have keys to that place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I had a key at some point,\u201d Dan told her. \u201cOh, well. It\u2019s not that important. I had some spare time before work, and I just thought I\u2019d stop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Ilona said.</p><p>Dan felt a cold sweat break out at his nape. She was looking at him suspiciously. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll get going,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cGood to see you, Dan.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cTell Tony hello for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>He got into his car. Just as he did, he saw Christina coming around the corner. She waved to him cheerfully as she pulled into the driveway.</p><p>Ilona was still watching them, Dan thought as he got back out of his car and waited while Christina stepped from hers, a cup of take-out coffee in her hand.</p><p>Her new dog jumped from the car. He barked happily at Dan, his tail wagging.</p><p>\u201cHiya.\u201d Christina walked over, and gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had about an hour, so I thought I\u2019d stop by.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCool. I\u2019m waiting for the locksmith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d He looked at her questioningly. \u201cYou really think Mike or I would break in just to play a joke on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she told him, shaking her head. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how many keys might have wandered out over the years. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>When they went into the house, it seemed to Dan that she was behaving strangely. She kept walking around, looking into every room, almost as if she expected to catch someone there.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the dog\u2014and the new locks\u2014with be enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m feeling edgy, I guess. The newspaper headlines, the warnings on the news...I knew her, Christie. I knew Patti Jo.\u201d</p><p>Christina walked over to him, setting an arm around his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Dan. I\u2019m really okay. I\u2019m always careful, and I\u2019ve got Tony and Ilona right next door.\u201d</p><p>Just then the dog began to bark. He really did sound quite ferocious, Dan thought.</p><p>The locksmith was at the door.</p><p>While the man worked, Christina played some of her newest tunes for Dan. He\u2019d worked for her a few times, and he liked doing jingles. She had a nice voice herself. They had both loved singing with their grandfather when they were kids.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d he swore suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork. I\u2019ve got to go. The Grim Reader has a gig tonight.\u201d</p><p>When she walked him to the door, the locksmith was just finishing.</p><p>\u201cAll right. You got good old Killer and your new locks, so I\u2019m out of here. Don\u2019t forget, you said you\u2019d come see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Ana. Tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me. I\u2019m off Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can have a get-together here again.\u201d</p><p>They hugged briefly, and he left. He was halfway down the path when she caught up with him, holding out something toward him.</p><p>It was a key.</p><p>\u201cShould I have this?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Someone else has to have the key to the house. What if I lock myself out? And I\u2019ve told you and Mike, this will always be your house, too.\u201d</p><p>He hefted the key in his hand.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t take it, he thought. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but he just had a feeling he shouldn\u2019t have the key.</p><p>\u201cChristie...\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cTake it and get going. You have to go to work.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAll right. Love ya.\u201d</p><p>He hurried on to his car.</p><p>Jed called Jerry and arranged to meet him for coffee.</p><p>When Jerry arrived, he looked at Jed hopefully. \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2014other than the fact that I\u2019m convinced Beau Kidd never murdered anyone. I can\u2019t even find anything that resembles real evidence against him. When Larry Atkins shot him and Beau died, that seems to have created the case.\u201d</p><p>Jerry looked at him and shook his head. \u201cOkay, say you\u2019re right. So whoever is out there kills five women. Then he lets twelve years go by and starts again. Now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you come in.\u201d</p><p>Jerry groaned.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you guys have to be on this already. Whoever the killer is, no, I don\u2019t think he stopped, not unless he was in prison or otherwise out of commission. Maybe he slowed down. Maybe he left town. Maybe he even changed some of his methods. I don\u2019t know. But the facts on Beau Kidd are clear. The man was railroaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jerry protested. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wrote the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a novel. And I was suckered in by the fact that the man was dead and the killings had stopped.\u201d</p><p>Jerry leaned back in his chair. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with this? You get bought off by the family or something? I hear the sister is really good-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. I\u2019ve met her,\u201d Jed said. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful redhead.\u201d</p><p>Jerry threw up his hands. \u201cThere you go. Maybe it was Beau and it was some Freudian thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, she was twelve when this whole thing started,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jerry picked up his coffee cup, giving Jed a morose look. \u201cI have a twelve-year-old daughter, Jed. You should see the way she dresses, the way she acts. It\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><p>Jed shook his head impatiently. \u201cThat\u2019s not it. And you don\u2019t believe it, either. That\u2019s why you called me. That\u2019s why you let me back in on this.\u201d</p><p>Jerry shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI need everything you get, Jerry. You can talk to the FBI, looking for links to deaths in other states, and I need to know what you find out.\u201d</p><p>Jerry nodded, looking down at his hands. \u201cDo you know that the FBI believes there may be hundreds of serial killers at work in the United States at any given time?\u201d he asked wearily.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many are never caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, we\u2019re going to get this one,\u201d Jed told him.</p><p>\u201cActually, I have a meeting tomorrow with a behaviorist, if you want in on it. Tiggs, he doesn\u2019t care if you make an appearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Dan and the locksmith were both gone. But once she had locked the door behind them and headed down the hall, she hesitated, her footsteps slowing with dread. Then she squared her shoulders and forced herself to keep going to the parlor.</p><p>And when she looked into the room, he was there.</p><p>Once again Beau Kidd was at her piano, petting Killer, who was clearly fond of him.</p><p>She groaned.</p><p>Beau turned and grimaced ruefully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he told her softly.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you go haunt someone else?\u201d she asked him. \u201cSomeone who could actually help you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t. I...I have a connection to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because I tossed a flower on your grave when I was a kid?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell...that, and the Ouija board,\u201d he said. But he looked puzzled. \u201cThat and the Ouija board...and something else. But I don\u2019t know what. Only that there is something else, another link.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we discovered that link, would you go away?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>He lifted his hands. \u201cIf you would just help me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you. I would help you if I could. But I\u2019m not a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJed Braden could help you help me.\u201d</p><p>She ignored that and sat at the far end of the piano bench, setting Killer on her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s so strange,\u201d she murmured. \u201cKiller seems to know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDogs have special senses,\u201d he said. \u201cCute pooch, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. My Rottweiler,\u201d she joked.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou knew no one was breaking in, right? I was trying to be a good guest, trying to be helpful and make the coffee and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nearly gave me a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBecause you knew.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI knew not to play with that stupid Ouija board,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should play with it again,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Scowling fiercely, she stared at him.</p><p>\u201cOr, maybe a s\u00e9ance,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA s\u00e9ance might be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...\u201d She pointed at him in exasperation. \u201cYou really have to go away. People already think I\u2019m some kind of emotionally fragile flower. I don\u2019t need a damn ghost hanging around, driving me crazy for real.\u201d</p><p>She stood and headed for the kitchen, but he followed her and leaned against the wall, wistfully watching her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ignore me, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t?

He had set his hands on her shoulders.</p> <p>She spun around and stared at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ignore me because I\u2019m not just talking about clearing my name,\u201d he said very softly.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m talking about saving the lives of all the other women some monster out there is planning to murder.\u201d</p><p>10</p> <p>F iles and notes were spread out before Jed when the phone rang. He picked it up and said, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJed? Jed Braden?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t recognize the female voice on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cYes, this is he.\u201d</p><p>For a moment there was silence. He kept his number listed and sometimes got calls from nuts. Was this one? \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKatherine...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine Kidd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, wondering why he hadn\u2019t realized who it was as soon as she said her first name. \u201cHello. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I wanted to know...how are you coming along?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cHow am I coming along? Fine. I guess you know I went to visit your father. I no longer believe your brother was guilty. But I\u2019m not a cop. And though I believe I know who the killer wasn\u2019t, I\u2019ll be damned if I have any idea who it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that. It means a lot.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cWould you have coffee with me?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You don\u2019t think it would be such a great idea to get personally involved with a client. I\u2019m not looking to go on a date,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut if we talked...I think I might be able to help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere should I meet you?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see much that was going on inside the house. The old lace Victorian curtains hid pretty much everything, other than the shadow of her figure as she moved from room to room.</p><p>He should have gone inside when he had the chance. Too late. Now all he could do was watch. But he loved to watch. He always watched first. Half the pleasure was always in the anticipation. And talking and sharing, of course.</p><p>But tonight there was no chance to talk, so he settled for watching her as she moved through the old house.</p><p>She was so pretty. Just his type. Tall, with that rich, red long hair. And those eyes...But since he couldn\u2019t see any of those details tonight, a lot had to be left to his imagination. What he could see, even with the curtains in the way, was the elegance of her movements.</p><p>He felt a deep hunger, a pain that was almost agony, seize him. If only...</p><p>No, not tonight. Not tonight.</p><p>But the jaggedly slicing pain shot through him again. He had to have something, someone, to ease this agony.</p><p>He should go home, he told himself, and from there he could take care of everything.</p><p>He calmed himself by reminding himself that the time would come. And thinking that he could make history repeat itself...</p><p>That was even better.</p><p>Christina sat on the floor in the middle of the parlor, a box in front of her, and looked around warily. Beau Kidd was nowhere in sight. She hadn\u2019t seen him since he\u2019d followed her into the kitchen. Of course, even when he was gone, she couldn\u2019t stop doubting her own sanity.</p><p>She dug into the box in front of her, glad that Gran had never thrown anything away. The box was full of newspaper clippings, including the entire local paper from the day of her grandfather\u2019s funeral. She took a moment to read the memorial to him that had run right on the front page. Unfortunately, her grandfather\u2019s article had been shortened to make way for a long recap about the just-identified Interstate Killer. She read through it carefully, searching for clues.</p><p>Each girl had been on her way to or from her car when she disappeared. All the cars had been found abandoned in the same parking lot where the victim had left it. Other than that and the fact that all the women had been young, attractive and red-haired, there were no clues at all.</p><p>She set the paper down and sighed. No wonder everyone had been so willing to believe that Beau Kidd had been the murderer. The evidence pointing to him had been slight, but it was more than they had to incriminate anyone else.</p><p>Depressed over reaching a dead end, she decided to go through some of her own boxes and see what she could organize. Almost immediately, she came across a huge article from the Miami paper about a treasure ship. One of the divers who\u2019d found it was a friend of hers, Genevieve Wallace. She remembered going down to the Keys for her friend\u2019s wedding and meeting several people who worked for something called Harrison Investigations, a firm specializing in paranormal research. Now, why hadn\u2019t she remembered that sooner?</p><p>She jumped up and headed to the dining-room table, where she\u2019d set up her computer. As soon as she got online, she began to search for Harrison Investigations. Their Web site certainly made for interesting reading. They sounded like nothing less than real live ghostbusters.</p><p>She clicked on the Contact Us link, then hesitated and instead picked up her cell phone, went through her contacts and called Genevieve.</p><p>\u201cChristina!\u201d Genevieve said happily when she answered. \u201cHow are things going up there? Are you finding enough work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork is fine. With all the theme parks, it\u2019s an advertising Mecca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe, though, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Gen asked, suddenly serious. \u201cThe news media down here keep talking about those highway killings.\u201d</p><p>Christina paused for a minute. \u201cActually, that\u2019s sort of what I\u2019m calling you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe highway killings?\u201d Gen asked, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI met some friends of yours at your wedding. The ones from Harrison Investigations.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief silence; then Gen said warily, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGen, I need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a ghost living in my house.\u201d She rushed to get the words out, then waited for Genevieve to laugh at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d Genevieve asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>There was another silence. Then Gen asked, \u201cDo you know who this ghost is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau Kidd,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>Again silence. Then, \u201cYou\u2019re really not joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I was.\u201d She hesitated, then asked, \u201cDo you think you could call them for me, since you know them and all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make the arrangements as soon as I can,\u201d Genevieve told her. \u201cIn the meantime...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, be careful. Don\u2019t trust anyone, even people you think are your closest friends, your nearest relatives. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Christina felt a chill and bit her lower lip. The locks were brand-new. She was safe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be very careful. I promise.\u201d</p><p>They met in a caf\u00e9 right on International Drive. Katherine Kidd was already there, a large iced tea in front of her, when Jed arrived. He greeted her, went in for a cup of black coffee, then joined her at the table. This town was certainly tourist central, he thought, dodging the crowds on his way. Across a dozen lanes of traffic, he could see the dramatic facade advertising a dinner show. More signs touted an Arabian horse show and various theme parks. Two feet from where they were sitting, a wire rack held brochures and coupons for dozens of area attractions.</p><p>Once upon a time, and not so very long ago, the only thing here had been orange groves.</p><p>\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Katherine said to him. \u201cThey all know there\u2019s a killer out there, but they just keep going, no matter what. In a small town, a college town, something happens and everything comes to a stop. But here...\u201d</p><p>He reached across the table and took her hand, squeezing it. \u201cHave you thought about the fact that you fit the profile of the victims?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOf course. That\u2019s one of the things driving me crazy. Some people think my brother was some kind of sicko who was trying to kill me with every victim. It\u2019s ridiculous. I was just a gawky kid when everything happened.\u201d She shook her head as if to clear it of unhappy thoughts. \u201cYou said you believe my brother was innocent,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s something you should know. He didn\u2019t start dating either one of those women until after the killings began. I doubt if you\u2019ll find that in all your files. I think the case was a personal thing for Beau\u2014because of me. Because I said something about how the killer kept going after girls with red hair. So he started warning women who fit the description, and that\u2019s how he ended up dating two of the victims.\u201d She looked around and focused on a poster advertising the seasonal goings-on at one of the parks. \u201cYou\u2019d think that they\u2019d stop some of this gruesome Halloween stuff, what with a killer being out there and all,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to stop a money machine,\u201d Jed told her.</p><p>As they talked, he saw a woman entering the caf\u00e9 who looked vaguely familiar.</p><p>Tall. Long reddish-brown hair. He knew her from somewhere, though he was sure it had been a very long time since he had seen her.</p><p>\u201cAll right, so the news you have is that Beau didn\u2019t know any of the victims until he tried to protect them,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>Katherine nodded. \u201cAnd because of that, I think someone out there thought Beau would make a good scapegoat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the killer might have been Larry Atkins?\u201d</p><p>She let out a long sigh. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Jed mulled that over for a moment. Larry Atkins certainly had a remote place where he could be hiding women now.... But where had he lived twelve years ago? Jed thought back to his previous interviews with the man. Larry had lived in a town house. That didn\u2019t clear him, but...</p><p>The woman left the counter carrying a to-go cup with steam emanating from it. She paused by the table. \u201cHi, Jed, how are you doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Who the hell was she, and how did he know her?</p><p>Katherine smiled, rising slightly, extending a hand. \u201cYou\u2019re Angie McDuff. I saw you on TV a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>Angie McDuff. Mike McDuff\u2019s ex. How the hell could he have forgotten her? Though, admittedly, it had been a few years, and she had a lot more red in her hair than when he had seen her last.</p> <p>\u201cThanks so much,\u201d Angie said to Katherine, sounding genuinely pleased to have been recognized.</p><p>\u201cHi, Angie, how are you doing?\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cGood, thanks. Though not as well as you are, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYour face has been all over the news.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t keep that book of yours on the shelves. I mean, I know it was fiction, but you know how people are. They\u2019re interested in anything with a hint of scandal attached to it. I bet you\u2019ll be getting a lot of calls soon, people wanting to interview you about Beau Kidd and what you think is going on now. Was Beau railroaded while the real killer got away, or is the current murderer a copycat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngie, this is Katherine Kidd,\u201d he said politely. \u201cBeau Kidd\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Angie gasped, turning a mottled shade of red. \u201cOh. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to bring up bad memories.\u201d</p><p>Katherine shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, nice to meet you. Jed, good to see you again. I think I saw your cousin Ana a few months back. And I heard that Mike\u2019s cousin, Christina, has moved to town.\u201d She flashed him a broad smile. \u201cI bet she\u2019ll find a lot of work here, and she\u2019s going to need vocalists, of course.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to keep his smile in place. Angie McDuff never stopped.</p><p>\u201cPut in a good word for me, will you, if you run into her?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Was she kidding? But he kept his smile in place. Christina Hardy was one of the most loyal women in the world. No way would she hire her cousin\u2019s ex, not that he was going to tell Angie that. \u201cSure,\u201d he said, and left it there.</p><p>Angie waved goodbye to them both with another smile and walked away.</p><p>As soon as the other woman was gone, Katherine started speaking as if they\u2019d never been interrupted. \u201cMy brother was good friends with Larry Atkins, but still...All I know is that Beau wasn\u2019t guilty, and Larry\u2019s the one who shot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was kneeling over one of the victims. And he drew his own weapon,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cYou could at least talk to Larry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, why not?\u201d Jed told her. So what if he\u2019d just been out there? he asked himself, thinking again about the amount of land Larry Atkins had now. It was hill country out there, too. Maybe there were a few secret places out on the property.</p> <p>Katherine set her hand on his, breaking into his thoughts. \u201cWant to see me home?\u201d she asked softly. Suggestively.</p><p>He glanced at her hand. If this invitation had come a week ago...? But it hadn\u2019t, and things were different now. \u201cI\u2019ll follow you home, see that you get inside okay,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She drew her hand back. \u201cThere\u2019s someone else?\u201d</p><p>In the past years, there had been a number of someone elses, he thought. This could have been the same. But it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes, there\u2019s someone else,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be happy to see you home.\u201d</p><p>She rose, then hesitated, shaking her head. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m heading home after all. I think I\u2019ll go down the street and see a movie. But thanks. And thank you so much for agreeing to see me. Please, after you\u2019ve been to see Larry Atkins, will you give me a call and tell me how it went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call no matter what?\u201d she asked, her tone afraid and hopeful all at once.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what,\u201d he promised.</p><p>With a wave, she was gone.</p><p>Beau Kidd was back. He sat on the floor with her, going through clippings, while Killer dozed on the couch. \u201cThere just has to be an answer,\u201d he said.</p><p>She gazed up at him, gritting her teeth. He hadn\u2019t been there...then he was. \u201cYou were the lead detective on the case,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYeah, and as soon as I wanted to keep an eye on a girl...she died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau, did you draw your weapon on Larry Atkins?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He paused, staring blankly out across the parlor. \u201cI drew my weapon. But not on Larry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer was there? Who was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him as if he had taken leave of his senses. \u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was night. Dark. Someone had called in a tip about shadows moving by the highway, so I called Larry and told him to meet me there, but I reached the location first. I thought...\u201d He paused, and ghost or not, the look that flashed across his face was one of pure agony. \u201cI saw her, and I thought she was still alive, so I ran over to her. But then I heard something, so I drew my weapon. I thought that the killer was still there. She was...she was still warm, you see,\u201d he said very softly.</p><p>Killer suddenly stood up and barked once, his tail wagging.</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>Christina leapt up as Killer barked again, excited, anxious to go to the door with her. \u201cIt has to be someone I know,\u201d she explained, starting for the hallway. But when she turned back to see if Beau had heard her, he was gone.</p><p>Killer barked again. \u201cAnd they make fun of you,\u201d she told him affectionately as they reached the front hall. \u201cYou are a good guard dog.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated at the door. Somehow, she knew it was Jed, maybe because Killer was already so pleased. Her heart thundered as she looked through the peephole.</p><p>It was Jed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said as she opened the door, trying to sound casual.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself,\u201d he replied as she stepped back to give him room to enter. He hunkered down immediately to pet Killer, who seemed positively ecstatic.</p><p>Then again, Killer seemed to like her ghost just fine, too. She turned, anxiously looking down the hallway. Was Beau Kidd still there somewhere, just keeping out of the way?</p><p>She suddenly felt very awkward, and just a little worried. She sure as hell couldn\u2019t tell a man like Jed Braden that she had a ghost in her house. No need to give him any more reason to think she was seeing things. And yet...</p><p>The ghost was real. He wasn\u2019t just in her mind. He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t like the idea of the ghost listening in on their personal conversation. Or their personal...other communication.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d she asked, leading the way into the parlor. Might as well see if Beau had reappeared, she thought. \u201cI was actually going to call you later. I promised Dan that I\u2019d go see him doing his Grim Reader thing. I was going to get hold of Ana and ask her to go with me tomorrow, and I was hoping you would come along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to the new park?\u201d he asked, his voice fierce, and he was frowning.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I promised Dan I\u2019d go.\u201d</p><p>He followed her into the parlor and looked around at the multitude of boxes. \u201cI guess they\u2019re still doing all the Halloween stuff\u2014despite the danger,\u201d he said, and it wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cEveryone has to make a living,\u201d she said.</p><p>He took a seat on the piano bench, looking around some more. He froze when he spotted an old article on the Interstate Killer. \u201cWhat have you been doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust going through stuff,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re not getting involved in this case,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just sorting out some old clippings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you need to do is stay as far away from this case as you can,\u201d he said harshly.</p><p>Surprised by his tone, she shook her head. \u201cYou seem to be getting involved,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI used to be a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you should know that cops are grateful for any help they can get. If someone could figure out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might be in a lot of danger,\u201d he said.</p><p>She hesitated, and in the silence she could have sworn she heard some of the clippings rustling around.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is in danger until this killer is caught,\u201d she said.</p><p>He leaned forward. \u201cChristie, you write advertising jingles for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m a redhead,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cI\u2019d like to see this solved.\u201d</p><p>He stood, agitated. \u201cLook\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau Kidd didn\u2019t do it,\u201d she heard herself say.</p><p>\u201cAnd how the hell do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...I just...Well, look at what\u2019s happening now. I just know he\u2019s innocent,\u201d she said stubbornly. When he didn\u2019t deny her words, she whispered softly, \u201cYou agree, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgree?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat Beau Kidd was innocent,\u201d she said more loudly.</p><p>He stared at her as if puzzled by her vehemence. \u201cIn my opinion? Beau Kidd was not guilty.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd the cops have to know that, too, right? So they must be looking for someone who was here then and is still here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be logical, yes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could figure out the relationship between the victims then and the victims now,\u201d she said.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cGreat. All the law enforcement officials on this case, and you think that hasn\u2019t occurred to anyone yet?\u201d</p><p>She flushed.</p><p>\u201cChristina...why is it you suddenly seem to feel as if you have to personally make sure someone solves this and exonerates Beau Kidd?\u201d</p><p>Not knowing how to answer that without sounding as if she needed to be locked up in a padded room, she changed the subject and asked, \u201cHey, how about some dinner? We could call out for pizza, or I could throw some eggs on the frying pan....\u201d She paused. \u201cYou look kind of worn-out,\u201d she told him. \u201cLike you need a good meal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugged, clearly not about to tell her what was really on his mind. Then he let out a sigh. \u201cI just had coffee with Katherine Kidd,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cKatherine Kidd?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBeau Kidd had a sister,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI remember. She was about my age. You know, he was buried the same day as my grandfather. I remember...I didn\u2019t know whose grave it was, but I saw his parents there. His mother was sobbing. I didn\u2019t see his sister there, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they wouldn\u2019t let her go,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was so much hatred for Beau at the time, so many people who believed he was a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo has she hired you to work the case?\u201d Christina asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one needed to hire me for this case,\u201d he told her, then straightened his shoulders. \u201cSo, did I hear something about dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant eggs and toast?\u201d she suggested.</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked to the kitchen, leaving him standing there.</p><p>A minute later, she felt hands on her shoulders and froze.</p><p>Beau or Jed?</p><p>She spun around. It was Jed, pitch-dark eyes meeting hers. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to become an obsession, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she murmured. \u201cUm...do you want wine with your eggs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind running down to the basement?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He turned away and headed for the stairs. She reached for a spatula, then jerked when she felt a touch on her arm.</p><p>This time it was Beau Kidd.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded, irritated.</p><p>He looked hurt, but all he said was, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to haunt me. He\u2019s on it already.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet, looking perplexed. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. The flower on my grave, the Ouija board...there\u2019s a connection between us, though I have to admit, I don\u2019t get it, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got company, so there\u2019s no time to figure it out. Would you just go somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>They could both hear Jed\u2019s footsteps on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cGot a thing for him, huh?\u201d Beau teased.</p><p>\u201cGo away. Please?\u201d</p><p>He let out a sigh. \u201cI sure would love to see Kitty...my folks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry wafting over there, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d Jed called.</p><p>\u201cI was just talking to the dog,\u201d she returned, glaring at Beau.</p><p>Jed reentered, and when she looked back to where Beau had been, he was gone. Jed poured the wine while she finished the eggs. \u201cI saw an old acquaintance of yours tonight,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike\u2019s ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Christina felt herself stiffen. She couldn\u2019t help it. Angie had hurt Mike. She\u2019d cheated on him and hadn\u2019t particularly cared that he\u2019d found out, or that she\u2019d hurt him. He\u2019d been head over heels in love with her, and she\u2019d used that to her advantage. They hadn\u2019t had any kids, but Mike was still stuck paying alimony.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she have to say for herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted me to suck up to you,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>Christina stared at him, curious. \u201cSuck up to me? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re going to be looking for singers.\u201d</p><p>Christina laughed suddenly. \u201cWow. I don\u2019t think of myself as being particularly vengeful, but...well, she could suck up to me from now to eternity, and I still wouldn\u2019t use her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I figured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do think Mike is finally over her,\u201d Christie said as she dished out the eggs, saving some in the pan to give Killer later. As she set their plates out on the dining-room table, she realized that she was nervous.</p><p>Just what had last night been? A moment\u2019s insanity? The natural result of so many years of pent-up attraction, at least on her part?</p><p>Or was he here now because this was the beginning of something new, something different, for both of them?</p><p>She saw that she still had the Harrison Investigations home page up on the screen. Embarrassed, she closed it and got ready to shut down the computer, but just then a breaking news alert suddenly flashed on, and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jed demanded, just as his cell phone began to ring. \u201cAnother body?\u201d he asked, staring at the screen while he flipped his phone open.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, no...not a body. A missing woman.\u201d</p><p>A woman she knew.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jerry, thanks. I just heard about it,\u201d she heard Jed saying, though she couldn\u2019t seem to pull her eyes away from the screen. Then Jed strode into the living room and turned on the television. Immediately, the missing woman\u2019s face popped into view.</p><p>She was pretty. She was young.</p><p>She had long red hair.</p><p>And a voice like a lark.</p><p>\u201cI know her,\u201d she told Jed as he snapped his phone closed. \u201cHer name is Allison Chesney. I was supposed to record with her on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be going anywhere on Monday,\u201d Jed told her.</p><p>\u201cBut the computer only said that she was missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been found,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>11</p><p>H e watched. Waited. Analyzed their body language.</p><p>They were both young, attractive, the man obviously in a hurry, the woman just as obviously anxious. The man was talking, his expression firm. He was clearly the kind who tended to speak with authority. When she responded, he could see that she was the type to defy authority. But pretty, so very pretty...</p><p>And then they kissed. Not the kind of peck a husband gave his wife when he was in a hurry. Not the kind of halfhearted kiss a man gave a woman when he was already long gone mentally. It was a kiss like a promise, brief, but filled with the future. Then the man left, and from his vantage point, he heard the lock snap.</p><p>He drew a deep breath and smiled. She was alone.</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t the time. Not yet. It would come soon enough.</p><p>He left his hiding place and walked down the street, waving to the occasional passerby as he headed for the house, for the woman who knew him.</p><p>He felt as if his patience was paying off and things were finally going his way. All these years...He felt gleeful, like laughing. If they only knew.</p><p>Oh, if they only knew....</p><p>All the victims looked so much alike when they were laid out on an autopsy table. But it wasn\u2019t the resemblance in death that drove the killer. Jed was certain of that. The sex, the power he wielded and the humiliation of his victims before death...those were what mattered to their murderer. And then, after death, they were left naked. And posed. But this murder was different.</p><p>This one felt far too close.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Doc, tell us something,\u201d Jerry pleaded.</p><p>Doc Martin shook his head. In sadness? Frustration? Jed couldn\u2019t tell. Then Doc spoke. \u201cBruising...there, on the arms. And ligature marks on the wrists and ankles\u2014see? That\u2019s a change in MO. Maybe she refused to cooperate or almost escaped or something. She was gagged, too. You can see the marks, here. She lost a hunk of hair, too. Probably pulled out while she was being dragged around. Cause of death...just the same. Manual strangulation. Nothing found near her. She was killed elsewhere and dumped by the highway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t reach home two nights ago,\u201d Mal O\u2019Donnell read from his notes. \u201cBut her sister thought she was with her boyfriend. The missing persons report was filed yesterday afternoon, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was found by a family who pulled over because they didn\u2019t think their four-year-old would make it to the next rest stop,\u201d Jerry finished. \u201cGod...the uniforms said the little boy couldn\u2019t stop screaming. There\u2019s a kid who\u2019s going to be in therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Jed asked when he saw Doc Martin frown and pick up a pair of tweezers. Then he saw what Doc had seen: something in the girl\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cGrass. A long blade of grass,\u201d Doc Martin said.</p><p>Mal O\u2019Donnell produced an evidence bag. \u201cWe\u2019ll get it analyzed,\u201d he said glumly.</p><p>\u201cWho knows? Maybe someone will figure something out,\u201d Doc Martin said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That it\u2019s grass. Ever seen a grassier frigging state?\u201d Jerry demanded morosely.</p><p>\u201cShe was lying in the grass when she was found, but...was it that grass?\u201d Mal O\u2019Donnell wondered aloud, looking at Jed.</p><p>\u201cThis is the third young woman\u2014this is getting very bad,\u201d Doc Martin said, then began to recite the details into a tape recorder.</p><p>It was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, Jed thought. They had heard it all before, but each time, it seemed to cut more deeply into the soul.</p><p>Killer had to go out.</p><p>Christina had stayed inside after Jed left, reading everything she could find on Harrison Investigations, but eventually Killer\u2019s whining got to her.</p><p>At least he was housebroken, a fact she could appreciate.</p><p>\u201cOkay, boy. I\u2019ll wait on the porch,\u201d she said as she opened the door, then stood outside, and let him race up and down the front lawn. October could be such a strange month, she thought. During the day it could actually feel hot, but at night the breeze swept through, cooling everything down to the point that it could actually feel cold. She felt that chill now as she stood there waiting for Killer to do his business.</p><p>Suddenly the chill grew even worse, almost unnatural.</p><p>\u201cKiller!\u201d she called. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>She saw that the dog had gone dead still, standing with his nose in the air, sniffing. He was as rigid as if he were a lawn statue.</p><p>\u201cKiller?\u201d she repeated, a little less firmly. She looked around, trying to see what had caught the dog\u2019s attention, but she saw nothing. Despite that, she felt deeply chilled and had an uncomfortable sense that she was being stalked. \u201cKiller, now!\u201d she snapped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he still didn\u2019t move, she ran up behind him and scooped him into her arms, then ran toward the house as if she were being chased. She slammed the door closed behind her, and her fingers trembled as she slid the bolt home.</p><p>She turned, looking around to see if Beau Kidd was there. Maybe his presence was what was making her so uneasy. But no sooner had she walked through the downstairs and assured herself that he wasn\u2019t in sight than the doorbell rang. Somehow she kept from screaming as she hurried to the door and looked through the peephole.</p><p>Michael.</p> <p>She exhaled in relief and opened the door. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, a smile fading from his lips, a frown furrowing his brow as soon as he saw her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fine. You look...white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...have you heard the news?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo, why? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey found another victim of the Interstate Killer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. That\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>As she stepped back to let him in, Killer barked. \u201cKiller, this is Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiller?\u201d Michael said, arching a brow.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up and come in. That was the name he had when I adopted him. Can I get you something? Did you just leave work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few minutes ago, yeah. I was working late. I talked to Dan earlier, and he said you promised to go see him as the Grim Reader tomorrow. I figured I\u2019d just stop by now and make sure you were all right, and ask if I can crash the festivities. Is it okay if I go with you guys?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. If it\u2019s still open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill open?\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? They found another dead woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she work at Dan\u2019s park?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, in fact...she was going to work for me,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christie!\u201d He took a step closer and threw his arms around her, pulling her close. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I mean, someone you knew...\u201d</p><p>She accepted his hug for a minute, then pulled away when Killer gave a nervous bark. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, boy,\u201d she chided him. \u201cThis is your cousin Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a dog\u2019s cousin,\u201d Mike said indignantly.</p> <p>\u201cBe quiet. You\u2019ll hurt his feelings,\u201d she said lightly, then turned to lead the way down the hallway. Once again she felt that eerie sensation and paused.</p><p>She nearly jumped a mile when her cell phone rang.</p><p>It was in the dining room, she realized. \u201cHang on,\u201d she called over her shoulder to Mike as she hurried into the dining room. Mike followed, and she noticed absently that he was wearing a trench coat. He looked like such an executive, she thought as she flipped open her phone and said, \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you all right?\u201d</p><p>It was Dan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Killer started to bark, and the doorbell rang again. She frowned. What was going on tonight?</p><p>Mike shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled her thanks and returned her attention to the phone.</p><p>\u201cI saw that they found another dead woman, Christie. Another redhead,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have Killer?\u201d Dan said doubtfully over the line.</p><p>She looked up. Mike was returning, and Ilona Nelson was with him. Christina smiled at her while still listening to Dan. She mouthed the words, Where\u2019s Tony?</p><p>\u201cTony is still next door,\u201d Ilona said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cYou have a houseful?\u201d Dan asked over the line.</p><p>\u201cYour big bro is here, and now Ilona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them hi,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cDan says hi,\u201d Christina repeated. \u201cMike says he\u2019s going to come with us tomorrow night,\u201d she explained to Dan.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Ilona asked.</p><p>\u201cTo see Dan as the Grim Reader,\u201d Mike explained.</p><p>\u201cTony and I will come, too. If that\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they can come,\u201d Dan said, apparently having heard the entire exchange.</p><p>\u201cDan says of course you guys can come.\u201d She frowned and turned to Ilona. \u201cNeither of you has to work?\u201d</p><p>Tony owned a bar and restaurant on International Drive, where he worked most nights, and Ilona helped out.</p><p>Ilona shook her head. \u201cNope, we\u2019re off tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all coming, Dan,\u201d she said into the phone, feeling a sudden desire to scream.</p><p>The Interstate Killer had claimed another victim, someone Christina had known, and they were talking about the next evening\u2019s social events.</p><p>At least she wasn\u2019t alone, waiting for Jed to come back from seeing Jerry. Before he left, he\u2019d told her to lock herself in and not to open the door for anyone. But Killer had needed to go out, and she could hardly have refused, could she? And Mike and Ilona weren\u2019t exactly strangers.</p><p>Mike took the phone from her. \u201cHey, Dan. Christie isn\u2019t having a great night. Have you seen the news? She knew that last girl who was killed.\u201d</p><p>She took the phone back. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristie, I\u2019m so sorry. I know how you feel. I was friends with Patti Jo. This is getting...scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, honest. We\u2019ll all see you tomorrow night, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Love ya, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d she said, and hung up.</p><p>Ilona offered Christina a sympathetic smile. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019d better get back. Tony will be waiting, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Christina said.</p><p>Ilona glanced at Michael. \u201cWell, your cousin is here now, and you have that little cutie,\u201d she said, indicating Killer. \u201cTony worries about you, that\u2019s all. I hope you know we\u2019re both next door anytime you need us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Christina said. At the moment her head was pounding and she wanted everyone to leave. \u201cMike, will you walk Ilona home?\u201d she asked. \u201cI think I\u2019d just like to be alone for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Mike said. \u201cMeet you here tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d she said.</p><p>As soon as they left, Christina locked the door behind them, then got the feeling that someone was behind her. She spun around and stared at Beau.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowing up out of the blue like that,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock. Rattle chains. Do something,\u201d she said.</p><p>Christina heard a car door slam and looked out the peephole.</p><p>Jed was back.</p><p>She watched him get out of his car. She could almost feel Beau wince behind her.</p><p>\u201cHe...he went to see the body,\u201d he whispered softly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a cop. I know how a guy looks when he\u2019s seen what a killer has done...and he can\u2019t stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he can see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll forget and talk to you, and he\u2019ll think I\u2019m insane,\u201d she said, and turned slightly.</p><p>He was smiling, but his expression was pained. \u201cYou\u2019ve accepted it, haven\u2019t you? You have a gift. You can see ghosts. You can talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>She believed him and swung the door open as Jed approached the house. He walked in, but when she would have touched him, he lifted a hand. \u201cCan I use your shower?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He knew the way, so when he headed upstairs, she went into the kitchen, where she hesitated, then poured a large whiskey.</p><p>Irish medicine, she taunted herself.</p><p>And maybe it was, in a way. If so, this was certainly the right time for it.</p><p>She walked up the stairs to the bedroom. She could hear the water running as she walked into the bathroom. He was sitting on the shower floor, the water cascading over him.</p><p>\u201cJed?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to hear her.</p><p>She opened the frosted door. Forgetting her clothes and her shoes, she stepped in and hunkered down by him. As the water poured over them both, she could smell the heavy scent of soap. Somehow she knew that he had scrubbed with it, then scrubbed again.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He looked at her then. Looked at her as if he had just realized she was there, fully clothed and totally soaked.</p><p>\u201cChristie,\u201d he murmured. \u201cChristie, I\u2019m so sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did. Now, come on out of there.\u201d</p><p>She stepped out herself, turning off the water, then handed him a towel. He seemed impatient with himself then, all masculine and silent again. Wrapped in a towel, he found another one, drying her off as he stripped her of her wet clothing. She had meant to offer solace; instead, she found herself swept up in his arms and carried into her room, where he set her on the large upholstered chair by the bed. Then he found some logs in the basket beside the fireplace and set them in the grate on the hearth. It took him only a moment to get a fire started. She thought how striking and grave he looked, his features hard and chiseled in the light of the fire, and she wondered about the thoughts that went through his head. He\u2019d been a cop. He\u2019d seen so much.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean that what you saw couldn\u2019t tear at your heart.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked. \u201cI brought you a whiskey. There, on the night table.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her with just a trace of amusement in his eyes. \u201cA whiskey, huh?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed the generous shot she had poured without a breath, then winced slightly. He poked the fire, then walked over to her. She didn\u2019t know what to say, so she didn\u2019t speak. She simply stood and opened her arms. He stepped into her embrace and just held her for a long moment, then sat down on the bed with her on his lap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It seemed to her as if they sat there for a long time. She had the odd feeling that he was seeing today\u2019s dead woman. He was seeing the years gone by. Seeing his wife, so young to be so ravaged by disease. So much loss.</p><p>And he\u2019d been as helpless to save her then as he had been to save the dead woman today.</p><p>She wished that she knew the right thing to say to him.</p> <p>Life isn\u2019t fair.</p><p>It sounded so trite, but at the same time, it was so true.</p><p>She never did speak, because at last, he touched her face. Lifted her chin. Found her lips. It seemed as if a storm, a tidal wave of heat, washed over her, as if the hot spray of the shower was once again beating tumultuously against her.</p><p>His lips were crushing, almost violent. His hands were steel-strong, his passion volatile.</p><p>Suddenly the tempest ebbed, and his movements turned sweet, then wicked and wild. Before...there had been hunger and the thrill of exploration. Tonight it was as if the floodgates had opened. She couldn\u2019t taste enough of his flesh, his sex, couldn\u2019t ride hard enough against him. He was equally forceful. She had never felt so completely part of another human being, entwined as if they were one.</p> <p>She soared to a sudden climax, drifted in the still-volatile aftermath of what they had shared. She had barely calmed before she felt him moving above her once more. His eyes were darker than any abyss, his features tense with concentration. But this time his mouth was gentle, questing, as his tongue teased her collarbone and breasts.</p><p>He slid into her once again, then withdrew. His mouth began to ravage the length of her, but slowly. Slow torture. Prolonged seduction. She wrapped her fingers around his sex. Played him. Her teeth and tongue danced over his shoulders, down his chest, tasting the salt on his skin No words were exchanged in the darkness of the night. In the end, he simply wrapped his arms around her, and she curled against him tightly. If she spoke, she would break the spell, she thought, so she just closed her eyes and allowed sleep to come, knowing he was with her.</p><p>Knowing that as much as she wanted him, as sweet as it was to be with Jed, it was equally true that she did not want to be alone.</p><p>She slept like an angel.</p><p>Awakening, Jed rose up on one elbow and watched Christina sleep. Her hair was a true auburn, and as it splayed across her pillow, the touch of the sun turned it into a cascading torch. Her lashes, however, were darker, and they swept over her cheeks to add a touch of mystery. He felt a catch in his throat. And in his loins. But he didn\u2019t intend to wake her, so he only continued to watch her, feeling a flush of warmth, thinking how lucky he was, and yet afraid to think of what that meant.</p><p>At last he rose, impatient with himself.</p> <p>He\u2019d known her forever, and he\u2019d cared about her. How could he not? She was Ana\u2019s little friend. Ana\u2019s little friend who had grown up tall and stunning, elegantly built, with huge blue eyes. When he thought about it, he realized that he\u2019d been involved with her forever.</p><p>But he\u2019d been in love with Margaritte.</p><p>If he was in love again...</p><p>Did that make him disloyal?</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about that, so he strode into the shower. He had loved his wife; there was no question about that. And it had been torture to watch her die, little by little, day by day. He\u2019d never been disloyal then. Never been anywhere but at her side. Fighting. Hoping.</p><p>But in the end, fighting and hoping hadn\u2019t changed a damn thing.</p><p>There had been other women since then, of course. He hadn\u2019t lived like a monk. But Christie was different. This could hurt him. She could hurt him. Hurt him badly.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stay away. He wanted her far too much. Needed her, craved her...</p> <p>Damn it, he didn\u2019t want to think about it.</p><p>He finished his shower and got dressed, and then the dog followed him downstairs, where he turned on the television, checked his watch. He called Jerry, who invited him to come sit in on a meeting with the FBI, then found the dog food and fed Killer. Damn, but he was a cute little mutt.</p><p>He left, carefully making sure that the lock caught once he was outside. It was better when the door was double-bolted, but it was broad daylight. And the dog did bark like blue blazes when anyone came near the house.</p><p>There was dead silence when Jed opened the door to the bare-bones conference room at the police station. He knew some of the officers, didn\u2019t know others. Undoubtedly a lot of the men didn\u2019t think he belonged, but Tiggs handled the situation for him.</p><p>\u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t know him, this here is our celebrity ex-cop, Jed Braden. He\u2019s a licensed P.I. now, and he\u2019s working for Beau Kidd\u2019s family,\u201d Tiggs announced.</p><p>A murmur went around the room.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, you\u2019re kidding,\u201d someone whispered. \u201cAfter that book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, ironic, huh?\u201d Jed said, moving in to take a seat at the back and looking around the room. Mal O\u2019Donnell and Jerry were seated up front. Doc Martin was there, too, along with another twenty-plus cops, some local, but at least six of them from the state police.</p><p>One of the younger detectives leaned over to bring Jed up to speed. \u201cThat\u2019s Gil Barron talking. He\u2019s FBI, but he seems to have a handle on real life.\u201d</p><p>Exactly what that meant, Jed wasn\u2019t sure, but he nodded his thanks, then listened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that our perp is targeting a certain type of woman. Whether we\u2019re looking at the same guy as twelve years ago or a second killer, the victim is young, right around twenty-five. She\u2019s not a prostitute. She either is an entertainer or works with entertainers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat narrows it down. Doesn\u2019t he know this is theme park heaven?\u201d one of the cops muttered.</p><p>Gil Barron obviously overheard, but he didn\u2019t seem disturbed. He only smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a bitch, huh? I wish I could tell you something new. I can only reiterate what we do know. We\u2019ve profiled this guy, and we think the murderer is employed, and that he makes a decent income. He\u2019s not old. Personally, I see the same ID in the killings, which would suggest that Beau Kidd was innocent. The murderer is snatching women and hanging on to them, so either he has a place to stash them where their screams aren\u2019t heard or he\u2019s keeping them drugged, or perhaps it\u2019s a combination of both. It appears that, for the most part, they\u2019ve been snatched from public places. This would suggest that they\u2019re going with the killer with smiles on their faces. I hate to say it, but we\u2019re looking for the boy next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear that Beau Kidd was the typical boy next door,\u201d one of the younger officers interjected.</p><p>\u201cProfiling isn\u2019t an exact science,\u201d Gil Barron said. He was tall, lean and had an unlined face. He didn\u2019t look like the kind of man who dealt with sick minds on a daily basis, Jed thought. \u201cThe killer may be married, may even have a family. And I\u2019ll repeat. My personal opinion is we\u2019re looking at the same guy from twelve years ago.\u201d</p><p>Forgetting that he was no longer a cop, that he didn\u2019t really have a right to be there, Jed voiced his question. \u201cWhat the hell has he been doing for the past twelve years, then?\u201d</p><p>Gil Barron nodded in approval of the question. \u201cI was just getting to that. We\u2019ve pulled records from the national database. Three women disappeared and were found in similar circumstances in Georgia, near the Florida border, eight years ago. God knows why they were never associated with the earlier vics. I suppose most people thought the Interstate Killer was dead and just never thought about him. A recent international search pulled up a similar scenario just two years ago in Jamaica. The women\u2014there were three of them\u2014were black, but they all had their hair highlighted red. And though none of those killings were ever solved, the victims in each location did have a connection. In Georgia, the victims took piano lessons from the same teacher. In Jamaica, all three women worked in the same restaurant. We\u2019re looking diligently for something specific that connects our recent victims to the earlier women\u2014if, indeed, we are looking for the same killer.\u201d</p><p>Gil talked for a while longer, then Doc Martin got up to talk about the autopsies and the change in MO with the last victim. The meeting broke up then, and Gil Barron found Jed. \u201cGood book,\u201d he told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>Barron shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up. It was fiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Fiction.\u201d</p><p>Barron smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re hungry to end this. That\u2019s a good thing. Tiggs seems to think so, too. Well, good luck to all of us, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><p>In the morning, she woke alone.</p><p>Or almost alone.</p><p>When her eyes opened, she started violently, grabbing her covers, and stared at Beau Kidd, who was in the massive upholstered chair where she had sat the night before.</p><p>\u201cThis is very interesting,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cFirst a woman who worked where your cousin works is killed, then a woman who was working with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in my bedroom?\u201d Christina demanded angrily.</p><p>Beau waved a hand dismissively. \u201cWhat are you worried about? He\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, closing her eyes. \u201cGet out of my room. I\u2019d like to take a shower and get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting how important this is,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she said softly. \u201cLike you said, I knew Allison Chesney. There\u2019s no way I can forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are going to the wake, right?\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cYou know when it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBraden had the television on before he left. Oh, and he fed the dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he put the coffee on for me?\u201d</p><p>Beau smiled. \u201cWell, he did make coffee, but I chucked it and started over. I know just how you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now, get out of here. Please.\u201d</p><p>She could only suppose that he had done so, since he disappeared. She rolled out of bed, showered, dressed and headed downstairs. In the kitchen, she poured coffee, and it was just the way she liked it, damn it. A minute later, the phone rang. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>It was Jed. \u201cChristie, your grandfather played guitar for fun sometimes. Played his guitar and sang at a local pub, right? I seem to remember hearing him a year or so before he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe used to play at O\u2019Reilly\u2019s. It was a real hangout for the Irish in the area. It\u2019s still there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for the info.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m just looking at all kinds of stuff. You just keep your door locked, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always do.\u201d As she spoke, Killer started to bark, followed by the doorbell. It was uncanny how he always knew ahead of time when someone was coming. \u201cSomeone is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t open the door till you know who it is,\u201d he said, but she had already set the receiver down.</p> <p>12</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Dan breathed. He was standing in front of the bulletin board, staring at the piece of paper announcing the casting for the new show had been done. He touched the sheet reverently.</p><p>Zeus, main: Daniel McDuff. Stand-ins...</p><p>He didn\u2019t see who would be standing in for him. He didn\u2019t care. He couldn\u2019t believe it. His own name was there, and he was too excited to think past that.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d someone said, and he turned. The face in front of him was blurred. Tears? he thought. No, it couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, and his voice was hoarse.</p> <p>Other people came by, and the congratulations continued to flow. It was incredible. His life was incredible. He was so happy....</p><p>\u201cPatti Jo was up for this show,\u201d someone said, and Dan swallowed, wincing. How could he have forgotten?</p><p>But...oh, hell. He had made it! He couldn\u2019t help the huge smile on his face, couldn\u2019t help feeling as if he had conquered the world.</p><p>\u201cChristie?\u201d</p><p>Jed knew she hadn\u2019t hung up on him, that she had just set the phone down, because he could hear the dog barking and some kind of commotion.</p><p>\u201cChristina!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t pick up the phone again, and, swearing, he headed out, unable to explain the sense of sheer panic he was feeling.</p><p>\u201cGen? My God\u2014I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChristie!\u201d</p><p>It was so good to see her friend, it seemed almost impossible. Genevieve was standing on the front porch, and she wasn\u2019t alone. She was with her husband, Thor, and an older man she introduced as Adam Harrison.</p><p>Christina knew who he was from her Internet research. He was the head of Harrison Investigations, specialists in the paranormal, though he never actually claimed when speaking to the press that he believed in the supernatural or the occult. He seemed an expert at double-talk, at sounding forthcoming without actually saying anything at all.</p><p>He was an impressive-looking man. He was obviously in his seventies\u2014or more\u2014but he stood ramrod straight and had a full head of snow-white hair. His eyes were both warm and sharp, the kind of eyes that seemed to see far beneath what was obvious on the surface.</p><p>She led them all into her parlor together, where the conversation was casual at first. Then, as if they\u2019d simply run out of script, everyone stopped speaking and they all just stared at one another.</p><p>\u201cI have a ghost,\u201d she said into the silence.</p><p>\u201cSo you told Gen,\u201d Thor said, and she had to smile. His tone was so soft and reassuring, though the man himself was pretty much a giant, and very blond. No one, she was certain, had ever fit the name better. She had met him for the first time when she had attended Gen\u2019s wedding, but she had liked him right away.</p><p>Christina looked at him. \u201cSo you...you believe I have a ghost?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Adam with a trace of amusement. \u201cI\u2019m fairly open to the possibility,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou told me you think Beau Kidd is haunting your house,\u201d Genevieve offered encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Christina echoed. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Genevieve said, a small smile curving her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he be haunting this house?\u201d Thor explained.</p><p>\u201cDid he ever live here?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he...threatened you in any way?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>Christina shook her head. \u201cNo. Though he had me thinking I was going crazy, moving things around in the house, putting coffee on,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI thought maybe my cousins were playing tricks on me.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve frowned, hands clasped before her, leaning forward. \u201cChristina, you don\u2019t think Dan or Mike would...would try to scare you out of here, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr worse?\u201d Thor added.</p><p>\u201cWorse?\u201d she demanded. She felt as if she were bristling, just like Killer when his hackles rose.</p><p>The dog, in fact, seemed to know intuitively that she was upset. He barked, then walked over to stand next to her, glaring at the others.</p><p>\u201cDan had quite a sense of humor when you were kids,\u201d Genevieve reminded her. \u201cOnce, down in the Keys, he threw a bunch of fish he\u2019d bought into the water and they died, remember? And they thought they had a real problem on their hands. The park service wound up getting involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan has grown up,\u201d Christina said. \u201cAnd my cousins aren\u2019t playing tricks on me,\u201d she added firmly, then turned to stare at Adam, as if daring him to disagree.</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>He was such an interesting combination, she thought. So dignified and authoritative in looks, but when he spoke, his words were quiet, and his smile made you feel you\u2019d known him forever.</p><p>\u201cGen...\u201d she said, then took a deep breath. \u201cLook, I know you all kept a low profile over the events in the Keys...The treasure you found, how you found it. The fact that you were nearly killed. But there was something else going on there, wasn\u2019t there?\u201d She stared hard at her friend. \u201cGhosts.\u201d</p><p>Gen smiled, meeting Christina\u2019s eyes. \u201cGhosts can be good, you know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo, can you see Beau Kidd?\u201d Christina asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you see him right now?\u201d</p><p>Christina shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s...not here right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he visits you because he wants his name cleared, right?\u201d Adam suggested.</p><p>\u201cYes. But...I hoped you could talk to him. He should really be haunting someone else, someone who can help him. Can you...can you at least feel him?\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled gently. \u201cI rarely have any direct connection with the supernatural, but I know those who do,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cHe talks to you? He actually carries on conversations with you?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen did he first appear?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cHe first appeared at the foot of my bed a few days ago. I thought he was a dream\u2014or that I was dreaming, I should say\u2014but he...he seemed so real that he scared me half to death. I ran out of the house, and then he came up behind me. He tapped me on the shoulder, and I ended up passed out on the lawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou passed out\u2014outside?\u201d Thor asked, then turned to Adam in concern.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. I should stay inside, because the killer\u2014the Interstate Killer or the copycat, whoever\u2014isn\u2019t snatching women who are safely locked in their houses. But anyway, later...later I had to accept that Beau was here, that he does exist.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve was watching her. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember, Christie?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cRemember what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we were kids. We\u2019d go places, and you would rattle off all kinds of history, stuff you had no way of knowing. Christie, you saw things back then. And then, when your grandfather died...when I talked to you after, when I told you how sorry I was, you said that you knew he was okay, that he told you he was fine. Christie, you\u2019ve always had...a connection to the other world.\u201d</p><p>Christina shook her head. \u201cNo. I...I don\u2019t have a connection or a gift or whatever you want to call it. If I did, I\u2019d be able to see my parents. And if ghosts are so real, why doesn\u2019t Granda, the nicest man in the world, haunt this place instead of Beau Kidd?\u201d</p><p>Thor cleared his throat. \u201cMaybe because your grandfather doesn\u2019t have anything to prove and Beau does?\u201d</p><p>Christina looked pointedly at him. \u201cYou talk to him, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s chosen to talk to you, and he\u2019ll either let the rest of us in or he won\u2019t,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Christina groaned softly. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know why he\u2019s connected to me. It might be something as simple as a flower I put on his coffin\u2014he was buried on the same day as my grandfather, right nearby, and I went over and left a flower. I don\u2019t even know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a connection, however tangential,\u201d Adam mused.</p><p>\u201cThen again, it might have been the Ouija board,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cOuija board?\u201d Adam repeated, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYes...it\u2019s from when I was a kid,\u201d Christina said defensively. \u201cA bunch of us pulled it out the other night, and he...talked to us. To me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuija board...\u201d Adam said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cShould we get it out?\u201d Genevieve suggested.</p><p>Adam shook his head. \u201cNo, not at this point. I think we\u2019d be better off trying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Thor said, looking at Adam.</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Christie demanded.</p><p>\u201cA s\u00e9ance. A full-scale s\u00e9ance,\u201d Adam told her, his tone serious.</p><p>Dead serious.</p><p>Silence filled the room after he spoke. Then Killer suddenly jumped up and began to bark, followed by a thunderous pounding on the door.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it. He didn\u2019t like it one bit. There was too damn much activity.</p><p>He took a deep breath. Time to take a break. Time to lay low. He could do it; he\u2019d done it before. Of course, he could also go away for a while, get a change of scenery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No.</p><p>He was good. They\u2019d never been able to catch him, so he could play it out the same way again and let someone else take the fall. It was easy to arrange. So easy.</p><p>He had to stay calm, confident. He couldn\u2019t let the little things tear down the brick bastions of his own talent. He was good, and this was all a challenge.</p> <p>He started; his name was being called.</p><p>With a smile, he answered.</p><p>\u201cYou look great tonight.\u201d</p><p>Dan McDuff turned. Marcie McDonnagh was standing there, just outside the women\u2019s locker room.</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty damned good yourself,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cAw, shucks,\u201d she said, and smiled. Her hair was hidden beneath the black-and-gray wig she wore, but the exaggerated female vampire makeup just made her look wickedly, sensually attractive, he thought.</p><p>She ran up and hugged him suddenly, then pulled away self-consciously. \u201cWe made it, Dan! We both made it. Our pay goes up. Our prestige goes up. Hera and Zeus, here we come.\u201d</p><p>He had to smile in return. \u201cI wanted it so badly, I\u2019m still not sure I believe it\u2019s real,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d She let out a happy sigh.</p><p>\u201cWe should celebrate,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cMy cousin and some friends are coming tonight. Maybe we can all go out after the show and celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to celebrate, but I\u2019ve got an early class tomorrow. I\u2019m going to have to ask you for a rain check.\u201d</p><p>Was that the brush-off? he wondered. He wasn\u2019t sure, and he didn\u2019t really care. It wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d been trying to pick her up. He had just wanted to celebrate their victory.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>Suddenly they both started. Above them, from the main park, a scream had echoed so loudly that it had penetrated to the catacomb of hallways and workrooms below.</p><p>Dan laughed. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a good job up there,\u201d he said.</p><p>Marcie shuddered. \u201cYeah? Strange, isn\u2019t it? People, tourists, are paying to be scared, but all we have to do is live in the area, walk into a dark parking lot alone, to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here if you need me,\u201d he told her gravely.</p> <p>He could have killed her. Grabbed her right then and there, and shaken her.</p><p>She\u2019d scared the hell out of him.</p><p>There was an unknown SUV in her front yard, a late-model Volvo, nice. Just the type of car for a boy-next-door serial killer to drive, he had tormented himself, his heart in his throat, when he reached her house. He\u2019d heard the dog barking, but she\u2019d never come back to the phone, and now there was a strange car in her driveway.</p><p>But Christina was evidently just fine. She opened the door and stared at him, her eyes wide with dismay as the realization of what she had done dawned on her. \u201cOh, my God, Jed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jed,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>She winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She swallowed hard, and Killer barked. Jed absently patted the dog to quiet him. \u201cCome in, please. My old friend Genevieve arrived with Thor, her husband, and I forgot all about the phone. Did you ever meet Gen? She came up here with me a few times when we were kids. She grew up in Key West, but we\u2019ve been friends for years. I thought she was so lucky, growing up, actually living in Key West.\u201d She was babbling, and she knew it. She forced herself to stop, then stared at him, looking stricken. \u201cJed, I am honestly so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. There\u2019s only a serial killer running around with a penchant for gorgeous redheads, and then you\u2014a redhead, I might mention\u2014drop the phone and don\u2019t come back to it. No problem.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cJed...\u201d</p><p>He sighed in a combination of resignation and relief. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on in. I have people for you to meet.\u201d</p><p>He decided that he hadn\u2019t met Genevieve before, because he would certainly have remembered someone so beautiful. She was tall, tanned and attractive, and she and Christie must have made a pretty sight, walking along the water\u2019s edge together. To his surprise, he did know the very tall, very blond man who was Genevieve\u2019s husband. \u201cThor Thompson!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJed Braden,\u201d Thor returned, grinning.</p><p>The others stared at them blankly. \u201cI was in underwater retrieval and recovery for a while,\u201d Jed explained.</p><p>\u201cHe was a cop,\u201d Thor said to his wife.</p><p>\u201cJed Braden\u2014the author,\u201d the older man said, offering his hand. \u201cAdam Harrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam,\u201d Christie supplied.</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam?\u201d Jed said dubiously, staring at her. He knew Christina\u2019s family and knew she had no one left but her cousins. He would have known if there was an Uncle Adam.</p><p>\u201cMy uncle Adam,\u201d Genevieve supplied quickly.</p><p>It was a lie. Jed knew it instinctively. But why were they lying?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I am the author, Mr. Harrison,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAdam. Just Adam will be fine. And congratulations. You\u2019ve created a couple of real page-turners, including one on the Interstate Killer, if I remember correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Fictionalized, but...yeah,\u201d Jed said flatly.</p><p>\u201cUm...well,\u201d Christina said, glancing at her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit early, but how about lunch? Do you guys want to stay here? There\u2019s plenty of room. Why don\u2019t you all bring your things in, and then we can go out and grab a bite? Later tonight a bunch of us are going to go over to the new theme park and see my cousin Dan. He\u2019s the Grim Reader in their Halloween extravaganza.\u201d</p><p>She looked anxious, Jed thought. As if she didn\u2019t quite know what was going on herself.</p><p>\u201cLunch sounds wonderful,\u201d Genevieve admitted.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to impose, though,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be imposing,\u201d Christina told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hand. Let me help you get your things,\u201d Jed offered.</p><p>They all went outside, Killer jumping up and down happily as he followed. As he was reaching into the back of the SUV, Jed saw Ilona, in her minivan, pull into the drive next door. She waved as she got out of her car.</p><p>\u201cAre we still on for tonight?\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cYes, come meet my friends,\u201d Christina called back.</p><p>Ilona walked over and shook hands as she met Genevieve, Thor and Adam.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to head out for lunch,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s down overseeing a new menu at the Mainstay.\u201d She flashed them a smile. \u201cYou know where it is, Christina\u2014right down the street from that place where your family hangs out all the time. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s. Why don\u2019t you go there? Tony would be thrilled. He\u2019s added a new line of low-carb, low-fat entr\u00e9es, really good stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d she said, and looked at the others for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Jed hadn\u2019t exactly been invited to lunch, but he didn\u2019t care. It suddenly seemed important that he go along.</p><p>Christina felt nervous all through lunch.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t difficult to explain Gen and Thor to Jed. Gen was a very old friend, and Thor was like a Christmas present, since he and Jed knew each other. But Jed was suspicious of Adam, and she knew it. She could see in the way his dark eyes measured the older man that he had strong doubts about the uncle story.</p><p>Tony greeted them at the restaurant door, and they were given a great, circular table that made conversation easy. Christina was glad they had listened to Ilona, except that Tony insisted lunch was on the house.</p><p>\u201cAs long as I get a real evaluation when you\u2019re done,\u201d he told them.</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019ll be totally honest,\u201d Christina promised. \u201cBut you really don\u2019t have to buy us lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure. Hey, how many times have I mooched off your family over the years?\u201d Christina could tell that his feelings would have been hurt if they refused, so she gave in with good grace and they ordered.</p><p>\u201cI gather you\u2019re not from Florida,\u201d Jed said to Adam. He was leaning back comfortably, casually, in his chair, but Christina could tell that there was nothing casual about him at all as he studied the older man, waiting for his response.</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m a Virginian, by birth, choice and the grace of God,\u201d Adam said, grinning. He lifted his beer to Jed. \u201cBut I do admire your great state, as well. There\u2019s a lot of history here\u2014and some great ghost stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Jed said. \u201cWe\u2019re not far from Ocklawaha, where Ma Barker and her son Fred had their massive shoot-out with the feds back in 1935. The place was shot to pieces, more rounds fired than you could ever imagine, but one chandelier went untouched. The place is supposed to be haunted to this day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite Florida ghost is up in Tallahassee,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cIn Tallahassee Old City Cemetery.\u201d</p><p>Christina chimed in then. \u201cI know that place. It\u2019s a beautiful old cemetery, very haunting, with lots of old trees dripping with Spanish moss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Elizabeth Budd Graham, right?\u201d Jed asked politely.</p><p>Tony had come up while they were talking and overheard the last bit of their conversation. \u201cWho\u2019s Elizabeth Budd Graham?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cA well-known ghost,\u201d Jed answered, looking intently at Christina.</p><p>\u201cShe was born sometime around 1886,\u201d Gen said. \u201cShe was supposed to be a witch, though not a mean one. In fact, she married, had a child and was apparently well loved, but she died young. Her grave faces west, and there\u2019s a beautiful epitaph on her stone. \u2018Doubly dead that she died so young.\u2019 Very sad. You\u2019ve never heard about her or been to the cemetery, Tony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I have. What does she do?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing bad. People bring flowers to the grave. Supposedly, when you\u2019re there, you can feel a sense of peace and solve problems in your own heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlorida is just full of ghosts, huh?\u201d Jed said politely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFull of tourists, thank God,\u201d Tony breathed, then frowned and looked at Christina. \u201cChristie, with everything going on...you know that Ilona and I are right next door if you need us, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. And thank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019d better leave the ghosts to you guys and get back to the kitchen. Enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>When they finished lunch, they drove back to Christina\u2019s house. Before they even went inside, Jed started to excuse himself, but Christina slipped around in front of him, trying to manage a little privacy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still coming tonight, right?\u201d she asked him, annoyed that she sounded so anxious.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in time. It\u2019s the late show, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So...where are you going?\u201d she asked him, then backpedaled. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s not really my...business.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised when he openly smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m going out to see Larry Atkins again. Beau Kidd\u2019s partner. His place is huge.\u201d</p> <p>She was startled. \u201cYou think Beau Kidd\u2019s old partner...you think he might be the killer?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhy would he have shot his own partner? He said Beau drew a bead on him, and that was why he shot, but it seems strange to me that Beau didn\u2019t just drop his own weapon when Atkins drew on him. Hell, why did Beau pull a weapon in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau drew his gun because he\u2019d discovered the body when it was still warm, and he heard a noise and thought the killer was creeping around behind him,\u201d she said, then saw that he was staring at her and realized what she\u2019d said, what she\u2019d revealed. She inhaled quickly. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s certainly one way it might have gone, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d he said, still looking at her skeptically.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019ve developed an interest in the new killing spree,\u201d Thor said, his tone casual as he walked over to join them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I kind of had to,\u201d Jed admitted.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have plans for the rest of the day?\u201d Thor asked him.</p><p>Christina watched the way Jed studied Thor, then shrugged and looked down for a moment before meeting his old friend\u2019s eyes again and replying, \u201cI\u2019m off to see someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you go where you need to without a badge?\u201d Thor asked him.</p><p>\u201cRight now, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have a badge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant some company?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>Jed weighed the question. \u201cSure,\u201d he said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Genevieve asked Christine a few minutes later, as they stood on the lawn and watched the two men drive away in Jed\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking he\u2019s never going to believe me when I try to tell him that the ghost of Beau Kidd has taken up residence in my house,\u201d Christina said. She looked anxiously at Genevieve and Adam. \u201cHe is in there, I swear it.\u201d</p> <p>Killer started going crazy behind the front door, so she let him out. He ran to the front of the lawn, where he sniffed the air, then started running in circles.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is the matter with him?\u201d Christina wondered aloud.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s guarding you against a swarm of mosquitoes, obviously,\u201d Adam said with a smile.</p><p>She smiled, the tension broken.</p><p>\u201cWell, we might as well unpack,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to a park tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. All the parks make a big spooky deal out of October,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cOctober,\u201d Adam repeated. \u201cA big spooky deal in a great many places. And,\u201d he added softly, \u201cit ends with All Saints\u2019 Day.\u201d</p><p>A while later, their unpacking done, Christina entertained them with a few of her jingle ideas on the piano, then came to an abrupt halt.</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to go into the studio to record that last piece on Monday.\u201d She inhaled deeply. \u201cMy singer was the third victim.\u201d</p><p>Adam, who had been sitting back with his eyes closed, appeared to have drifted off, but appearances were obviously deceiving, because he spoke up immediately. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s more to Beau Kidd showing up here than you know,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Christina asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s here to protect you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Chills shot down her spine.</p><p>\u201cWe will have a s\u00e9ance,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she asked doubtfully.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. We need everyone here who was here the night you used the Ouija board. Saturday night?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>She nodded, suddenly terrified.</p><p>There was no reason for her to be frightened, she told herself. She wasn\u2019t alone in the house any longer. Adam, Genevieve and Thor were all installed on the second floor, and that was reassuring, right?</p><p>And Jed? she asked herself.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid at all when she was with Jed.</p><p>She stared at Genevieve. Her friend seemed so relaxed, so confident, despite the fact that they were talking about ghosts. And despite the fact that a serial killer was roaming the state.</p><p>Christina realized that Adam was watching her.</p><p>\u201cIt is a gift, talking to the dead,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIf you can just learn to accept it.\u201d</p><p>A gift? she thought. Maybe so.</p><p>A very dangerous gift.</p><p>13</p><p>\u201cI told you, Jed. You need a horse. You need to quit going over old history, quit trying to make a monster out of a good man, and buy a horse.\u201d</p><p>Larry Atkins had been sitting in the rocker on his front porch, as if waiting for Jed. He barely seemed to notice Thor getting out of the car with him, not that it was easy to ignore Thor.</p><p>\u201cHello, Larry,\u201d Jed called.</p><p>Larry Atkins stood up. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Jed. You\u2019re a little ahead of the guys wearing the badges, but go ahead. Search the place. Sure, now I\u2019m a suspect. Hell, I shot my partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice place you have here,\u201d Thor commented.</p><p>\u201cRight. Nice place. Off the beaten track. Means I must have been a sick killer, right? I even shot my partner so he\u2019d take the blame. I might be at it again. Hell, I have room, I have privacy. I must be bringing women here, tormenting them, their screams going unheard.... Search the place if you want, Jed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a warrant, Larry,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t. Damn it, Jed, I\u2019m not guilty of anything. Come with me, and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarry, no one is accusing you of anything,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here, aren\u2019t you? With that Scandinavian bruiser over there.\u201d</p><p>Jed glanced quickly at Thor, who grinned with amusement, unoffended.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Larry insisted.</p><p>There was little help for it, and hell, they had driven all the way out there. Larry led the way, and he did a thorough job of it. They went through all the rooms, then down to the small basement, which was really more of a glorified crawl space, and then out to the stables. He took them through the tack room and every single stall.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d Larry demanded when they were finished \u201cI have a question for you,\u201d Jed countered.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Larry said.</p><p>\u201cToday, looking back, do you think Beau meant to draw on you? Do you think there\u2019s any possibility he thought you might have been someone else?\u201d</p><p>Larry stared at him blankly; then he swallowed hard. \u201cHe drew on me,\u201d he said at last.</p><p>\u201cBut it was dark, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killing stopped,\u201d Larry said.</p><p>\u201cRight. But you\u2019re not answering my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to draw my gun. I was cleared,\u201d Larry told him.</p><p>\u201cRight. Thanks, Larry.\u201d</p><p>They left, and Jed found himself staring at Thor when they got back in the car. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was dark, and Beau Kidd did draw his weapon. I suspect that Larry Atkins didn\u2019t identify himself. But other than that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Thor shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Underwater mysteries are more my thing. But I don\u2019t think this guy is guilty of killing those women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not the killer,\u201d Jed agreed. \u201cThe thing is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Thor asked him.</p><p>Jed shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s something I should be seeing. Something I need to see. The connection...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe connection to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s it. I can\u2019t even figure out why I\u2019m so certain that there is a connection, but I know it\u2019s there.\u201d He hesitated for a moment, then stared at Thor as he finally turned the key in the ignition. \u201cSo just what the hell are you really doing here? What\u2019s your connection to all this?\u201d</p><p>There was mist everywhere, so much artificial mist that it was almost impossible to see.</p><p>But then, this was October in a theme park, Christina thought, and the customers were paying extra for the privilege of being scared right down to their Nikes.</p><p>\u201cChristie?\u201d Ana called softly.</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p>Ana giggled. \u201cI think they got a bit carried away with the fog. Did you see the monster in the lagoon? Incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you do any of the makeup?\u201d Christina asked her.</p><p>\u201cI gave a workshop for most of the vampires. There\u2014if you can see it.\u201d She pointed. \u201cThat one is my design.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood look,\u201d Christina complimented her.</p><p>\u201cThank you. And the zombies over there...my design, as well,\u201d Ana said proudly.</p><p>\u201cNice and gruesome,\u201d Christina told her. And it was true. They were walking down what was referred to as the Hallway of Horror, heading toward the giant chair where the Grim Reader was about to tell a heart-stopping tale. The mist was not just ample, it swirled around them. The makeup on the \u201ccreatures\u201d who strolled alongside them was excellent, and the effects along the way were done extremely well. It should have been delightfully spooky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Except that Christina felt as if nothing could spook her anymore.</p><p>She had a ghost living in her house.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d Christina asked, finding Ana in the mist.</p> <p>\u201cBehind us, I think.\u201d Ana laughed softly. \u201cI think Thor is scaring all the creatures away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not spooky. He\u2019s just very good-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just so tall, looming out of the mist and all.\u201d Ana linked her arm through Christina\u2019s and shivered, lowering her voice. \u201cIt seems so strange, doesn\u2019t it? One of the victims worked here. And everyone is still...still trying to creep out the audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that this place is chock full of security,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly they heard a scream, and Christina felt genuine panic rush through her for the first time all night.</p><p>But then the scream was followed by laughter, and Ilona and Tony broke through the mist to join them.</p><p>\u201cIlona was shrieking like a girl,\u201d Tony announced.</p><p>\u201cI am a girl,\u201d Ilona reminded him. \u201cAnd when that huge tree thing just appeared out of the mist, it scared me.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, the others caught up with them, as well. Mike was deep in some kind of philosophical debate with Adam, and Genevieve was walking between her husband and Jed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s way too much mist,\u201d Jed said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a new park. They\u2019re probably trying to get a handle on it,\u201d Tony said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cDan should be just ahead, up in a big chair where those freaky lights are,\u201d Mike told them.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d Ana said cheerfully. \u201cOh, look at the ghouls over there. Those are mine. I\u2019m especially proud of them.\u201d</p><p>The mist swirled around Christina again as she stopped to stare at Ana\u2019s ghouls. Then, when she turned back around...mist. Nothing but mist.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she called uncertainly.</p><p>No one answered.</p><p>She felt...something. Someone touching her. Fingers stroking her hair...</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she protested, then spun around. No one was anywhere near her, and she felt panicked again.</p> <p>Don\u2019t be ridiculous, she told herself. She was in a theme park. She might not be able to see them, but there were lots of people\u2014undoubtedly including plenty of security personnel\u2014around.</p><p>She turned, forcing herself not to panic, to look up toward the lights. Dan would be in that direction. She started to move, but her foot lodged against something hard. She cried out as she lost her balance and went crashing down to the ground. Into the swirling mist.</p><p>She lashed out and struck someone, then heard what sounded like someone sucking in their breath. She reached out, fumbling around, trying to find something to grab for balance so she could rise, and touched...</p><p>A body.</p><p>The mist began to clear, and she blinked, peering more closely at the woman on the ground next to her. The woman\u2019s eyes were closed, her face deathly white. Christina swallowed the scream that rose in her throat when she realized it was white makeup, and that the other woman had on a long wig, black and gray and white. She was one of the vampires, Christina realized quickly.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked anxiously, when she noticed that the woman wasn\u2019t moving. \u201cHey,\u201d Christina said, reaching for her.</p><p>She was cold.</p><p>And there was a thin line of blood seeping from her lips....</p><p>\u201cAnd there, my children, you have it. Another tale from the ghastly, ghoulish pen of our renowned literary giant, Edgar Allan Poe. Come back tomorrow for a story straight from the pages of another American literary great\u2014along with a few suggestions of the Grim Reader\u2019s favorite places, where the mist and the graves and the hauntings are real.\u201d</p><p>God, he loved applause, Dan thought as he listened to it. He relished the sound; he lived to perform.</p><p>As he stepped down from his chair, his smile brightened, though he wasn\u2019t at all sure anyone would realize that it was a smile. Not with his makeup, which was one of Ana\u2019s designs.</p><p>And there she was, he realized. Tiny, adorable, standing at the front of the audience. While the others began to break away, she just stood there, rapt.</p><p>\u201cHiya, kid,\u201d he said, striding toward her. He was on such a high from performing that he grabbed her, dipped her and planted a kiss on her lips.</p><p>A park-goer passing by looked at him, startled.</p><p>\u201cThat was great,\u201d Ana cried, struggling up.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Michael said, coming up and patting him on the back. \u201cCongratulations, that was terrific. And I hear you got your part. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dan said, grinning.</p><p>Mike rolled his eyes. \u201cAll we need is you walking around thinking you\u2019re a god. Hey, do you remember Christie\u2019s friend Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure do,\u201d Dan said, reaching out to give Genevieve a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cThis is my husband, Thor,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>Dan looked up. He was tall himself. This guy was taller.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Adam Harrison,\u201d Michael finished.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know us,\u201d Ilona said, waving to him.</p><p>\u201cTerrific show,\u201d Tony told him.</p><p>Dan frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s Christie?\u201d</p><p>They all stared at him, then looked around.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is she?\u201d Jed, who\u2019d been silent until then, demanded. Then he turned and disappeared into the mist. As he did, a bloodcurdling scream tore through the night.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Ana gasped.</p><p>A teenage girl burst through the fog, screaming, then giggled.</p><p>Mike looked at her in disgust, then turned to the others and asked, \u201cWhere the hell is Christie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp! Help me!\u201d Christina shouted.</p><p>She had found the other woman\u2019s wrist and checked her pulse. She was alive but unconscious, and she wasn\u2019t responding to Christina\u2019s anxious attempts to revive her.</p><p>Around her, Christina heard screams and laughter. \u201cI need help here!\u201d she shouted, trying to make herself heard above the general revelry.</p><p>A moment later, she heard footsteps and someone calling her name.</p><p>Jed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over here, Jed. Help me!\u201d</p><p>A dark shadow moved through the silver mist, and seconds later, she saw his face. \u201cShe\u2019s hurt!\u201d Christina cried out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cOne of the vampires. Help me. She\u2019s hurt.\u201d</p><p>He got down on his knees beside her, his police training evident as he moved efficiently to determine the woman\u2019s condition.</p><p>She heard her name called again. Ana\u2019s voice, followed by Tony\u2019s, then Mike\u2019s and Genevieve\u2019s...</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d Jed yelled. \u201cCall an ambulance and park security!\u201d</p><p>A floodlight suddenly cut through the mist. A park employee who introduced himself as Dr. Saryn knelt down to help, and while the others crowded around, Christina saw two nurses hurrying over with a rolling stretcher.</p><p>Suddenly she had a terrifying thought. Half the people here tonight were in costume. What if they weren\u2019t real medical personnel? What if they were going to take the woman away and...She told herself not to be ridiculous and returned her attention to what was going on.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Dan said, his eyes on the girl being lifted onto the stretcher. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cWho knows, in this fog,\u201d one of the nurses said irritably.</p><p>\u201cI know her,\u201d Dan said, upset. \u201cHer name\u2019s Marcie...Marcie McDonnagh. She\u2019s my friend, she\u2019s my...Hera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs of now, she\u2019s my patient,\u201d Dr. Saryn said. \u201cI\u2019ve sent for an ambulance. Her pulse is strong, and she doesn\u2019t seem to have any broken bones. It looks as if she tripped. There\u2019s a good-size hematoma on the back of her head.\u201d Saryn turned to Christina. \u201cYou found her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she owes you her thanks. She could have gone unnoticed for a long time in all this.\u201d He waved to indicate the mist, which seemed even more surreal as it swirled in the beam of the floodlight.</p><p>Arms slipped around Christina from behind. Jed\u2019s. She was amazed to realize that she wasn\u2019t feeling afraid anymore; instead, she was angry. But she didn\u2019t mind the support.</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to report this,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cShe didn\u2019t trip, she was pushed. Someone attacked her.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Saryn said, \u201cI have to get this woman to a hospital. If you want to report a crime, call the police.\u201d</p><p>He left, the nurses following with Marcy on the stretcher. Dan cast Christina a worried glance, then ran after them.</p><p>\u201cQuite a night,\u201d Adam Harrison murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d Jed asked Christina, eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat did you mean when you said someone attacked her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt just seemed like someone in the crowd was getting rowdy or something. I felt as if...as if I was being pushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeenagers!\u201d Ilona exploded.</p><p>And why not? Christina asked herself. Even if someone had pushed her, why was she so sure there had been any malice behind it? Ilona was right; it had probably just been some rowdy teenager. \u201cLet\u2019s go get some dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cSeeing as the Grim Reader is done for the night.\u201d</p><p>Jed hadn\u2019t intended to stay at Christina\u2019s house, but wasn\u2019t at all sure about \u201cUncle\u201d Adam. Not that Christina would be alone with him. Genevieve and Thor would also be there\u2014and Killer, of course.</p><p>But there was just something bugging him. About the house? Or about Christina?</p><p>She had almost certainly been right about whatever had occurred between Beau Kidd and Larry Atkins on that day twelve years ago when Larry had killed his partner. Larry didn\u2019t act like a man who was coming unglued because he had committed murder. He did act like a man with a serious guilt complex, a man who was afraid that he had killed his partner over a mistake. There was really only one explanation for why Beau Kidd had pulled his weapon: because he hadn\u2019t seen his partner and was afraid of who was out there in the dark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But how the hell had Christina figured that out?</p><p>Ilona and Tony had opted to stay at the park when the rest of them went to dinner. While they were eating, Christina\u2019s cell phone rang. It was Dan, reporting that Marcie was going to be all right, though she didn\u2019t know what had happened. She only remembered waking up in the hospital. Despite the good news, Christina looked distraught when she hung up.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Mike asked her.</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s worried\u2014any more problems and the park might wind up closing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore problems?\u201d Adam asked. \u201cWhat else happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the women who was killed, the second victim, worked at the park,\u201d Christina explained. \u201cAnd I hate to say it, but that mist tonight was a pretty major mistake on someone\u2019s part, a lawsuit waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have insurance up the wazoo, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>Dinner broke up and people started heading their separate ways at that point. Back at Christina\u2019s, Jed found himself striding in without waiting for an invitation. If his presence seemed unusual to anyone, it wasn\u2019t mentioned.</p> <p>Christina immediately went into the kitchen to make tea, despite the fact that they had just eaten, and Jed realized that was simply the way things had always been done in that house when Christina\u2019s grandmother had been alive. You came over and you had tea. It was a nice tradition, he realized.</p><p>As they drank tea and munched shortbread, the conversation turned to diving for treasure, which was the way Gen and Thor made their living. Jed talked about some nearby underwater caverns Thor had never been to, and they decided to take a group dive trip.</p><p>\u201cBetter do it before it gets much later in the year,\u201d Christina said. \u201cThat water gets chilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far are they from here?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say an hour and a half,\u201d Jed said, and as he spoke, he realized he was seeing a map of the state in his mind\u2019s eye.</p><p>A map with all the highways.</p> <p>And an X where each body had been found.</p><p>Twelve years ago, the first and last had been found alongside I-4, off International Drive, right where the tourists went. Another was found off the turnpike, two more off the Beeline Expressway.</p><p>This time...</p><p>The first body had been found just off I-4, off International Drive, the next two by the turnpike.</p><p>The killer was even choosing the same highways as the dumpsites for the bodies.</p><p>He surfaced from his thoughts when Christina said, \u201cI\u2019m going to have a get-together on Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA big party?\u201d Jed asked \u201cNo, just Tony and Ilona, Mike and Dan, you and Ana, Adam, Thor and Genevieve. And myself, of course.\u201d</p><p>She was testing the idea out on him, he realized. Why? \u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d he said. \u201cWill Dan be off?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, he can put in for the early shift. He\u2019s not the only Grim Reader, of course, plus he\u2019s got his role as Zeus now, and they\u2019ll be starting rehearsals soon. In another couple of weekends, the whole Halloween thing will be over, anyway.\u201d</p><p>It seemed like a long explanation, he thought. Was she nervous? \u201cAny special reason for this get-together?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cSure...to get together,\u201d she said.</p><p>Genevieve yawned then, and everyone started excusing themselves to go up to bed. Jed had just reached the upstairs landing with Christina when his cell phone rang.</p><p>It was Jerry Dwyer.</p><p>He dreaded learning that another body had been found, but Jerry hadn\u2019t called to report another murder.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a wake tomorrow night for Allison Chesney. Seven to nine. You coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll definitely be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You never know who might show.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. Christina was staring at him. \u201cAllison Chesney\u2019s wake is tomorrow,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking it would be a good idea to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were? Me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJed, I actually knew her.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cSometimes a killer will go to a funeral or a wake. Depending on what makes a monster tick, sometimes he takes pleasure from seeing his victim\u2019s loved ones mourning her. I don\u2019t think you should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristina...I don\u2019t want the killer to get a good look at another gorgeous redhead,\u201d he said.</p><p>Once again, she stared at him before turning away. \u201cThese killings have to stop!\u201d she said passionately.</p><p>He walked over to her, taking her hands. \u201cChristina, I know that. Is there something I don\u2019t know? Something I should know?\u201d</p><p>She seemed to be looking past him. And she looked irritated. \u201cNo,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cThen...?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind that I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Was that like, Not tonight, dear. I have a headache? They hadn\u2019t really been together long enough for that, he thought. But the only thing he said was \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He walked across the room, stripped off his shirt and jeans, and slid beneath the sheets. When he turned back to look at her, she was staring across the room, toward the door.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He started to rise. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She spun around. \u201cWhat?\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say, \u2018go away\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not to you. Really.\u201d</p><p>She stripped with an admirable and arousing speed, sliding next to him beneath the sheets, far too naked to be ignored, so he pushed aside the question of who she had been talking to and simply took her into his arms.</p><p>She pressed closer and closer to him, as if she were trying to become one with him.</p><p>Her flesh rubbed against his, her nipples hard against his chest. She slid her arms around his waist, and her hands moved, fingers teasing, so light at first. When he didn\u2019t allow himself to react, her touch became more insistent, more erotic. There was no way in hell that what she intended could be misinterpreted\u2014or resisted.</p><p>He drew her more tightly into his arms, his mouth fusing to hers. Her body seemed to melt against him, insinuate itself with explicit intimacy against his hollows. He broke the kiss and stared at her. Her eyes were brilliant, and he could hear the rampant thunder of her heart.</p><p>Her lips were wet, parted...</p><p>She rose against him, meeting his eyes again. \u201cJust hold me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling tired after all.\u201d</p><p>Evidently not, he thought, wondering what had changed.</p><p>Her lips skittered across his flesh like liquid fire. Her mouth closed around him.</p><p>He made love to her until they were both panting and exhausted, and then he held her through the night.</p><p>Still, he was puzzled. She kept staring at the door, as if she were afraid that someone was going to enter. Someone she didn\u2019t want to see.</p><p>She was dreaming. She knew it, but she couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><p>She was in a room, but there was a blindfold over her eyes, so she couldn\u2019t see, And everything ached. Everything. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t move, because there were ropes binding her wrists and ankles to a chair. She couldn\u2019t even scream, because she was gagged.</p><p>Suddenly she heard footsteps. Leisurely footsteps, coming closer...</p><p>Her terror was overwhelming, because she knew what was going to happen. Knew...</p><p>She wanted to escape. She had to escape.</p><p>Christina.</p><p>Beau Kidd was calling to her. She recognized his voice.</p><p>Help me. Get me out of here, she pleaded.</p><p>My hand, take my hand...</p><p>\u201cChristina?\u201d</p><p>She woke up to find Jed at her side, staring at her with concern in his eyes.</p><p>Her night-light was on, as always, and she could see his face. Feel the vitality and heat of his body, the power of his slightest movement. The life in him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, and softly touched her face. \u201cNightmare?\u201d</p><p>It was fading already. She could barely remember anything at all.</p><p>Not that there was anything to remember, anyway. She hadn\u2019t seen anything, hadn\u2019t seen anyone. All she had was an impression, a trick of the mind.</p><p>She moved closer to him, secure in the clasp of his strong arms. \u201cI guess,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe all have them sometimes,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou have nightmares?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then said, \u201cSometimes we live our nightmares.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled, watching the shadows play across his face. \u201cAnd sometimes we have to let them go,\u201d she told him softly.</p><p>He smiled slowly, smoothed back her hair. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. And she was all right, of course. It had just been a nightmare. It meant nothing.</p><p>So why did she suddenly feel such a sense of fear? Of danger awaiting her somewhere in the darkness?</p><p>14</p><p>C hristina awoke and found herself relieved that Jed had gotten up early and, according to the note he\u2019d left her, gone downtown to meet Jerry. She quickly showered and dressed, reflecting on how amazing it was to find herself feeling that way, given that she had been at least a little in love with Jed Braden most of her life. And she was grateful that he\u2019d been there, but there were some dangers even he couldn\u2019t help her fight.</p><p>Like those in her mind.</p><p>Or the fact that she was seeing a ghost.</p><p>And now...what? Was she feeling what the victims had felt?</p><p>Downstairs, Adam Harrison had already made coffee. He was sitting in the wing chair in the parlor, her box of newspaper clippings at his side. \u201cMorning,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked around. The parlor was quiet. \u201cHave you seen...Beau?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSorry. Genevieve may see him, but sometimes...well, it\u2019s really up to him. That\u2019s why we need to have a s\u00e9ance,\u201d he told her. \u201cSometimes ghosts only appear to specific people, and for specific reasons. Other ghosts will appear to several people, or just to anyone.\u201d He offered her a rueful grin. \u201cIt\u2019s not an exact science. Beau may be feeling uncomfortable now, with the house suddenly so full,\u201d he told her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hadn\u2019t had any difficulty showing up last night to remind her that he needed her help, she thought. He\u2019d sat in the chair in her room, insisting that she tell Jed all the information that he gave her. But when she had given him an imploring look and begged him softly...he\u2019d left.</p><p>In the daylight, her anger was asserting itself. He showed up to haunt her, to confuse her and make her talk to the air, so Jed would think she was genuinely crazy. To give her horrible nightmares...and then leave without telling her anything useful.</p><p>Thor and Genevieve came in then. \u201cGood morning,\u201d Thor said.</p> <p>\u201cBeautiful day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Genevieve said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cCoffee on?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>It might have been an ordinary visit. Except that when Thor left to get coffee for himself and his wife, Genevieve walked into the center of the parlor and stood very still.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Christina heard herself ask hopefully.</p><p>Genevieve let out a sigh. \u201cYes...and no. I can feel something, but...\u201d She smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s take a trip to the cemetery, shall we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Genevieve asked her.</p><p>Christina shook her head, then tried to explain. \u201cI had a nightmare last night. I was tied up, gagged and blindfolded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the killer bind, gag and blindfold his victims?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what then?\u201d Genevieve prodded.</p> <p>\u201cThen I woke up.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve watched her thoughtfully. Adam Harrison stepped closer and looked into her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat...?\u201d Christina asked, not entirely sure she wanted to hear the answer.</p><p>\u201cWe know Beau Kidd has made a connection with you,\u201d Adam said, \u201cso maybe, because of Beau, one of the victims is managing to speak to you, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. So I was feeling what she felt. Before...\u201d Christina stared at him, fighting a wave of debilitating fear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You woke up. But no one ever really knows how far the mind can go. A dream like that is all right, Christina,\u201d Adam said reassuringly. \u201cA dream could end up providing the clue that cracks the case. The dead do tell tales.\u201d</p><p>Jed waited in Jerry\u2019s office until his friend came back and tossed a file on the desk. \u201cIt\u2019s all copies\u2014you can have everything there,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jed arched a brow to him. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d</p> <p>Jerry had taken the chair behind his desk. \u201cAmazingly little. I suspect their private work stays private, but there are a few articles in there about several cities, even a few states, hiring Harrison Investigations in...abnormal circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike UFOs?\u201d Jed asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, more like things that go bump in the night.\u201d Jerry leaned forward, opening the folder. \u201cHere\u2019s one...a Florida story, even, about Old Dixie Highway, outside St. Augustine. There was a rash of abductions of teenagers. The locals were claiming there were lights in the trees by the highway, that the kids were being abducted by the ghosts of three women who\u2019d been hanged there by a lynch mob soon after Florida became a state. The city brought in the state, and the state brought in Harrison Investigations.\u201d</p><p>Jed looked skeptically at Jerry. \u201cLet me guess. Harrison Investigations performed some sort of a voodoo rite and the abductions stopped?\u201d</p><p>Jerry leaned back, shaking his head. \u201cHarrison Investigations found the kids being held in a shack in the woods. One kid\u2019s dad was head of an oil corporation. The kidnapper, an ex-employee with a grudge, intended to ask for ransom eventually, but first he wanted his old boss to suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police couldn\u2019t find this shack, but Harrison Investigations did? Was there ever an explanation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam Harrison found the shack himself,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cHe claimed he heard noises when he was walking through the woods.\u201d</p><p>Jed shook his head, clearly still doubtful.</p><p>\u201cOur own fed, Gil, told me that Adam Harrison is totally legit. He hasn\u2019t worked with him personally, but he knows people who have, and they swear by the guy.\u201d</p><p>Jed stared at Jerry, feeling irritated. He didn\u2019t know why, but he\u2019d wanted to find a reason to mistrust the man, especially once he\u2019d discovered the Harrison Investigations angle. The guy had to be some kind of charlatan. Didn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d Jerry told him, \u201cis why this man just appeared on your girlfriend\u2019s doorstep.\u201d</p><p>Jed shook his head, not bothering to dispute Jerry\u2019s use of \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d In fact, he realized to his own amazement, he kind of liked it. \u201cNothing to do with the case,\u201d he said. Which he knew was a lie, but since no one was letting him in on the truth...</p><p>\u201cHe just arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday. He came with a couple of her friends. Christie\u2019s known the wife, Genevieve, forever,\u201d Jed explained. \u201cShe\u2019s married to some guy named Thor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve Wallace and Thor Thompson?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>Jed frowned, staring at him. \u201cYeah. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>Jerry offered him a wry grimace. \u201cThor\u2019s not exactly a common name. And there\u2019s a story there. They were involved in a dive down in the Keys and somehow unearthed a centuries-old mystery\u2014and a killer. I read about it. It was in all the papers. How the hell did you miss it?\u201d</p><p>Jed stood without answering, picking up the file Jerry had put together for him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jerry called as he started out of the office. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet Adam Harrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if he can do lunch next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Let me know.\u201d</p><p>Jed gritted his teeth. Jerry was serious.</p><p>But as he walked out onto the sidewalk, Jed realized that he was glad of one thing. Adam Harrison might be nuts for believing in the supernatural, but at least he was a legitimate nut.</p><p>And he did feel better knowing there were more people in the house with Christina, because there was no escaping one crucial fact: she was a beautiful redhead.</p><p>He was still searching for a deeper connection between the victims. Or was it entirely random and based on looks? But where was the killer first seeing his prey? How did he know who to snatch, and how to snatch her so she disappeared into thin air? Why did no one ever scream when she was being taken? What trick was the killer using?</p><p>They bought bouquets. Lots of them.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Christina told Genevieve as they walked along a path through the cemetery. \u201cI don\u2019t believe\u2014I can\u2019t believe\u2014that the souls of the people I loved are still here beneath the ground or in a coffin, or...or that they stay behind at all.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve was quiet for a minute. \u201cSometimes souls do remain behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how come I can\u2019t say hi to my mom, and tell her that I love her and miss her? Why do I have to see a man I never knew when he was alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one really knows, but I\u2019m guessing your mom knows you loved her very much. Same with your dad,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cThey were good people, and they lived good lives. Whatever heaven really is, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s where they are. But some people...some people stay behind, and other people can see them. Think of a dog whistle. The dog hears it just fine. We don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which...\u201d Christina dropped down to pick up Killer. No need taking a chance on him running off and getting into trouble.</p><p>\u201cYour parents and grandparents first?\u201d Genevieve suggested.</p><p>Christina saw that Adam and Thor had gone ahead and were already waiting at her family grave site. She and Genevieve joined them, and she arranged some of the flowers, then stepped back and pointed to a nearby grave. She closed her eyes, feeling the breeze waft across her skin and through her hair, and pictured the scene as it had been twelve years ago.</p><p>The priest, reading the service.</p><p>Beau Kidd\u2019s mother, crying her eyes out.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, the others had moved closer. \u201cGenevieve?\u201d Adam said softly. She nodded, then walked over to Beau Kidd\u2019s grave, knelt down, placed a bouquet of flowers and laid a hand against his stone.</p><p>The world had to know her brother was innocent, Katherine Kidd thought, walking along the sidewalk that surrounded the cemetery and feeling an overwhelming sense of sadness. Beau\u2019s name had to be cleared. She felt a moment\u2019s anger as she wondered if the powers-that-be would eventually wind up shooting some other innocent man and claiming the killer had only been a copycat after all.</p><p>That couldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>The truth had to come out.</p><p>Beau\u2019s death and the widely accepted accusations had ruined their lives. Her mother was no more than a shell of her former self. They\u2019d only been able to stay in the area because they\u2019d had some genuinely good friends, people who knew that Beau couldn\u2019t have been guilty, no matter what everyone else said.</p><p>But she\u2019d had some very bad times, growing up. Very bad. Teenagers were often cruel by nature, and so many of them had pointed at her, whispered about her. She had learned in high school to stay away from boys, to keep her distance from the popular crowd. If she kept a low profile, she wouldn\u2019t hear the whispers.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t gone far away for college, but somehow, in Gainesville\u2014which she had chosen so she could be near her parents if her mother fell into one of her depressions\u2014she had found that there were people willing to let the past stay buried.</p><p>Like her brother.</p><p>She\u2019d majored in theater arts, with an emphasis on scenery design. She had a perfect job in her field now, and she was gaining a reputation. She was doing well.</p><p>Yeah, right. She was twenty-five, lived with her parents and didn\u2019t date.</p><p>She stopped walking for a moment, looking through the wrought-iron fence. The cemetery was really quite beautiful, she thought, So many of the old oaks flourished here, but then, it was a very old cemetery. She smiled, thinking of the transplants she worked with. So many New Yorkers, a lot of Midwesterners. They thought of Florida as new and raw. They didn\u2019t realize just how old some of the little towns and cities were. The path she was on led her under the trailing moss draping from the old oaks like dripping tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Most of the funerary art was old, a lot of it broken, some covered with lichen, giving the cemetery a forlorn and haunting feel. Even the sidewalk that rimmed it was broken in places, tree roots cracking the concrete and breaking through. Too often the city looked to the new when it came to repairing things, seldom to the old.</p><p>She was just about to head into the cemetery itself when she felt the wave of cold rush over her, followed by the sensation of being followed. She turned around to look, but the sun was in her eyes, blinding her.</p><p>Suddenly she heard a car engine rev, and a vehicle went rushing by her, sending adrenaline jetting through her.</p> <p>Had someone been planning to run her down? Or was she getting paranoid now, afraid of threats that existed only in her own mind?</p><p>She turned around again and saw a woman approaching her, a tall redhead, with stunning blue eyes, carrying a Jack Russell terrier. She was followed by another woman, and two men, one older and the other blond and extremely tall.</p><p>Maybe these people had been following her. They could have tracked her from inside the cemetery. Or had she been stalked by whoever was driving that car, and then they had hurriedly driven past because...</p><p>Because these people would have been witnesses if something had happened to her.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d the redhead said. \u201cKatherine? Katherine Kidd?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Who are you?\u201d Katherine demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Christina Hardy. I...well, I know this will sound very strange, but my grandfather was buried the same day as your brother. I...brought him some flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know who I was?\u201d Katherine asked.</p><p>\u201cYou look like your brother,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cI look like my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen pictures,\u201d Christina said quickly. \u201cAnd these are friends of mine,\u201d she said as the others caught up, then introduced them.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d Katherine said politely.</p><p>Should she be afraid? she wondered. There were four of them and only one of her.</p><p>But she no longer had that unnerving sense of being followed, the sense of danger that had tormented her before, and she realized that she had decided they meant her no harm, unlike the driver of the car, who...well, she wasn\u2019t going to think about that right now.</p><p>\u201cMy brother was innocent,\u201d she said without thinking. She should have recorded the words years ago, she thought. She could never stop herself from saying them.</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Christina Hardy told her. \u201cAre you here to visit his grave? We\u2019ll walk you back.\u201d</p><p>Kathleen realized she must have looked spooked, because Christina spoke up again right away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a...friend of Jed Braden\u2019s, and I know you talked to him about looking into your brother\u2019s case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kathleen answered. She indicated the flowers in her arms. \u201cYes, I spoke to him about my brother, and yes, I\u2019m here to visit Beau\u2019s grave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Christina said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll see you back to your car.\u201d</p><p>Kathleen felt a sudden fierce chill and wondered why she hadn\u2019t felt it before. She was in danger. Grave danger. No pun intended, she thought, trying not to show her fear.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Michael McDuff said absently. He was busy planning a St. Patrick\u2019s Day show for one of the parks. He thought if they worked on it, they could probably start right after Valentine\u2019s Day and stretch St. Patrick\u2019s Day out for an entire month.</p><p>Like Halloween.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mike.\u201d</p><p>He should have sensed her coming; should have felt her. But he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d been too absorbed in his project. He looked up.</p><p>Angela was back. He\u2019d seen more of her in the past few days than he had in the past two years, he thought. And part of that time, they\u2019d been married.</p><p>\u201cHello, Angela.\u201d</p><p>She walked in and perched on the edge of his desk. He leaned back and asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust checking in to see how you\u2019re doing,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and looked sullen for a moment, then apparently decided to be forthright for once. \u201cI heard that the lead for Hera was hurt the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan and I always got along pretty well, and I know he\u2019s been cast as Zeus, so if they need another Hera...\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, amazed at her gall. \u201cI\u2019m not the casting director. You know that. If I were, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have put my own brother through the torture of waiting to hear if he got cast. And Marcie McDonnagh is going to be fine, not to mention that they cast her understudy, as well.\u201d</p><p>Angela slid off his desk. \u201cI just thought you should know that if, and I mean if, you discover that they need someone to cover until she\u2019s ready to go back to work, I\u2019m available.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re available.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and, apparently thinking better of pushing further, left, swinging her hips as she went.</p><p>Once she was gone. he realized he had clenched his hands into fists in his lap. \u201cI know where I\u2019d like to have my hands,\u201d he said out loud as he forcibly relaxed his fingers.</p><p>He stood, grabbed his jacket and started out of his office. No sense trying to work anymore today.</p><p>When they returned to the grave with Katherine Kidd, Beau was there. Christina saw his eyes as they lit on his sister. Saw the tears that welled in them.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, huh?\u201d he asked Christina.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Christina replied without thinking.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Katherine Kidd looked at her, frowning.</p><p>\u201cIs he here?\u201d Adam asked Christina softly, but Katherine overheard.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s eyes grew shielded, and she stared at Christina. \u201cYou\u2019re not one of those kooks, are you?\u201d she asked harshly.</p><p>\u201cTell her how much I love her,\u201d Beau said. \u201cTell her how sorry I am that she had to suffer for what everyone said I did.\u201d</p><p>Christina stood silent, swallowing.</p><p>Beau was nearly in tears, clearly wanting so badly to communicate with his sister in some way.</p><p>\u201cTell her that...that I had friends over my first year in college and we were drinking, and that\u2019s why that stuffed dog she called Calliope wound up drenched in booze and had to be thrown away. I should have confessed to that sin a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Katherine started to turn away in disgust. The others were standing silent, waiting.</p><p>\u201cTell her. For the love of God, tell her!\u201d Beau pleaded.</p><p>\u201cBeau says...Beau wants me to tell you that you had a stuffed dog you called Calliope,\u201d Christina said in desperation. \u201cBeau had some friends over, and they spilled liquor on it, so you had to throw it away.\u201d In her arms, Killer barked, as if for emphasis.</p><p>Katherine spun on her in sudden fury. \u201cYou\u2019re horrible! A horrible person. I don\u2019t know where you heard about that, but...you\u2019re cruel. Stay away from me. Stay away from me, and stay away from my family!\u201d</p><p>She walked away, her stride long and determined.</p><p>Silence followed her exit, except for Beau, who began to cry. But only Christina heard him.</p><p>Suddenly he stopped crying and said emphatically, \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be alone. Not right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau thinks we should follow her,\u201d Christina said tensely.</p><p>\u201cFollow her?\u201d Genevieve said in disbelief. \u201cShe\u2019d probably call the cops on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Jed,\u201d Thor suggested. \u201cTell him to call her and ask her to meet him...where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt O\u2019Reilly\u2019s,\u201d Genevieve offered.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Christina said. \u201cWe can follow discreetly and make sure she\u2019s not in any trouble without scaring her even worse,\u201d she said, already dialing.</p><p>Jed sounded both surprised and wary when she explained as much as she could. He was clearly hesitant to do as she asked. \u201cJed, I\u2019m afraid for her,\u201d Christina finally said, and that was all it took. He promised to call Katherine right away, and she hung up.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll protect my sister?\u201d Beau asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Christina said, and Beau let out a sigh of relief. \u201cWhat don\u2019t you follow her? Why don\u2019t you let someone else see you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I would if I could?\u201d</p><p>Killer whined. Christina let him hop out of her arms, and he ran right over to Beau and lowered his head to nudge the man affectionately.</p><p>\u201cKiller can see him,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Me, and my little dog, too,\u201d Christina said. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go catch up to Katherine and follow her to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s. At least we can get lunch.\u201d</p><p>Jed didn\u2019t know why he felt such a sense of urgency, but he drove faster than he should have and arrived at O\u2019Reilly\u2019s within minutes of Christina\u2019s call, grateful that Katherine had agreed to a meeting at the pub.</p><p>He entered and immediately saw her at one of the high tables near the bar. He was relieved to see that she seemed to be okay.</p><p>\u201cHave you learned anything that can help Beau?\u201d she asked him eagerly as soon as he sat down.</p><p>\u201cAnything I tell you is my own opinion, and nothing official, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I know you\u2019re not a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a connection between the victims, but I\u2019m not sure what it is yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI think I know a few things that may get us closer to the truth, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarry Atkins pulled his weapon too quickly, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a murderer.\u201d</p><p>Her features hardened. \u201cHe is a murderer. He murdered my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shot him,\u201d Jed said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand dismissively. \u201cBeau is still dead. And despite the rising body count, most people still believe he was a psychotic killer. Larry Atkins received a nice pension, and he\u2019s living out in the hills with his horses. Excuse me for being just a little bit bitter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m all for vindicating your brother,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m all for stopping the murderer at work now.

He turned around to see what was upsetting her and saw that Christina was there with Genevieve, Thor and Adam. And Killer. She had been coming to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s her whole life and undoubtedly knew she could keep the dog with her if they ate outside.</p><p>But why was Katherine so upset to see them?</p> <p>Katherine stared at Jed. \u201cDid someone tell you to call me?

And you tell her...you tell that woman that...just tell her to leave me alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine, she isn\u2019t trying to hurt you,\u201d Jed assured her, then let out a sigh of exasperation. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened at the cemetery, but I do know this. The two of you\u2014as in you and Christina\u2014should be scared to death. You\u2019re both fools if you don\u2019t see your own resemblance to the victims. You need to be really careful. Yes, she called me. She was worried about you. She\u2019s out with a group of people she knows and trusts. You were hanging in a deserted cemetery by yourself.\u201d</p><p>She sat back in her chair, staring at him \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Stop visiting my brother\u2019s grave? Stop going to work?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to work this afternoon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cNot till Monday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you home from here, then,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want you stay in this weekend, unless you\u2019re out with both your parents. Or the Fifth Army Brigade,\u201d he added with a smile.</p><p>She actually smiled back. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ordered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. You don\u2019t have to have lunch with me,\u201d she told him. \u201cI can eat at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Lunch is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>He waved the waitress over, and they ordered. Then she leaned toward him. \u201cJust keep her away from me, okay? I can see the attraction, but...\u201d</p><p>Jed looked out the window. Christina caught his eye, blushed and turned away.</p><p>Jed looked more closely and frowned. The dog was seated several feet away from her on the bench, as if leaving room for someone to sit between them. Killer suddenly moved his head, as if he were having his ears scratched\u2014except no one was scratching them.</p> <p>Jed turned away quickly, gritting his teeth. He was not getting sucked into whatever delusion Adam Harrison was there to investigate. A real killer was on the loose, and they needed logic and sanity to catch him.</p><p>\u201cHey, McDuff!\u201d Mr. Smith shouted.</p><p>Dan had been just about to head out. He wondered why Smith was stopping him now, when the man knew the Grim Reader had an audience waiting for him. He got his answer right away.</p><p>\u201cDan, I just got word. They\u2019ve canceled the shows for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re kidding!\u201d</p><p>He frowned, his heart thundering quickly. This wasn\u2019t anything to do with him, was it? Did they think they knew something about him?</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dan. They should have told us sooner, so you could have been called,\u201d Smith told him. \u201cThey\u2019re keeping the rides and some of the special attractions at the front of the park open, but they\u2019re closing everything down back here until they get a handle on the fog situation and why it went crazy last night. It\u2019s just for tonight. I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m early shift tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your last show finishes just before dark and you\u2019ll get paid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, congratulations on Zeus. I think the show is going to be huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I hope so. Hey, have you heard anything more about Marcie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still going to play Hera, right?\u201d</p><p>Smith nodded. \u201cYeah. They kept her in the hospital overnight, but the doctors say she just tripped and banged the back of her head. It was a mild concussion, nothing more.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cThank God. We don\u2019t want another Patti Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t. Anyway, I\u2019m glad to hear she\u2019s doing well,\u201d Dan said, and forced a smile. \u201cWell, good night, then. Guess I\u2019ll take off this makeup and head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a Halloween party to go to, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can find something to do with an unexpected night off,\u201d Dan replied.</p><p>It was dark.</p><p>Angela McDuff noticed just how dark the minute she left the salon. The bright forest-green neon lights over at O\u2019Reilly\u2019s had gone on, deepening the shadows and rendering them even more mysterious. She shouldn\u2019t have made an appointment for so late, she supposed, but she\u2019d needed to have her hair done. After all, appearances were everything in her business. And she meant to offer a damn good appearance wherever she went. Because she sure as hell didn\u2019t intend to stay here.</p><p>Not that Orlando could be considered a hick town. Not these days. It had too much going on, thanks to the multiple tourist attractions that drove the area. But it had been a one-horse hick town once, and it was still surrounded by hick towns full of old Florida crackers, and she absolutely was not going to stay here forever.</p><p>There was only one place for a woman of her talents and abilities. Hollywood. And she didn\u2019t mean Hollywood, Florida.</p><p>She swore softly, not sure why she was quite so worried, except that she had seen him today, and the absolute hatred in his eyes when he looked at her now, well, that was scary.</p><p>And then there were the murders. Women were just so damn vulnerable.</p><p>With long strides, she headed for the parking lot, noticing along the way that shadows seemed to be everywhere. She cursed the fact that the mall had planted so many trees, because in her overactive imagination, it seemed as if someone was hiding behind every one of them.</p><p>It was just because she was alone, she told herself. Because it was so dark. And it had to be the darkness that made the air feel cooler, and the breeze that made the trees sound as if they were whispering.</p><p>There was someone behind her, she realized. A man. She risked a quick glance, and even in the darkness she could tell that he had on a dark sweatshirt and a baseball cap. His shoulders were hunched over, and he was gaining on her.</p><p>The cap must be to conceal his identity. And his clothing was dark so he could move unnoticed through the night.</p><p>She told herself not to be ridiculous, that she was all right. She reached into her purse and pulled out her keys. She would reach her own car in a minute and set off the alarm.</p><p>She forced herself to quicken her pace, but not to run.</p><p>Just then she was blinded by headlights.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you all right?\u201d someone called out to her.</p><p>She let out a sigh of relief and looked quickly over her shoulder. Whoever had been following her was gone. She felt giddy inside and walked past the car, waving to thank her savior. She smiled, catching a glimpse of the interior of the vehicle.</p><p>A moment later, she was inside it.</p><p>And she knew everything she shouldn\u2019t know. Mainly...</p><p>That she was going to die.</p><p>15</p><p>J erry Dwyer and Mal O\u2019Donnell were attending Allison Chesney\u2019s wake, taking a shift and representing the city\u2019s finest. They stayed to the rear of the room, where Jed and Christina joined them.</p><p>Jed spoke quietly with Jerry while they scoped out the attendees. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of family. No parents, just an aunt and a number of cousins. The aunt was a dignified woman with blazing red hair who had thanked them for coming when they entered.</p><p>Christina stepped over to speak with her, and Jed could see that the aunt was grateful for her words. After a while, when the pew in front of the coffin was empty, Christina walked over to it, knelt down and lowered her head in prayer.</p><p>Watching her, he couldn\u2019t help feeling uneasy. What did she think she was doing? Talking to the dead? Did she think Allison Chesney would sit up and begin to chat?</p><p>He stayed away from the coffin himself. He\u2019d been to the autopsy, and that was more than enough for him.</p><p>While Christina did...whatever she was doing, he thought about the pressure the police were under to solve this case. Though he couldn\u2019t see them, he knew that several hundreds of people were lined up outside the funeral home. They were quiet and orderly, out of respect for the family, but they all bore placards demanding that the police find the killer.</p><p>At last Jed walked over to Christina, ready to get her attention and lead her away. He couldn\u2019t help but look down at the body of Allison Chesney.</p><p>The undertaker had done a good job, but it didn\u2019t matter. No matter what anyone did, there was no escaping the fact that she looked like exactly what she was: dead.</p><p>He\u2019d seen people look deader, he thought. Was there even such a thing as deader?</p><p>This poor woman did look almost as if she could sit up and talk.</p><p>Margaritte had never looked that way.</p><p>He closed his eyes, and in his mind he saw his wife lying in the coffin, her features gray and skeletal. What if Margaritte could suddenly sit up and...</p><p>He took Christina\u2019s elbow to get her attention. \u201cWe need to go,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>They were silent as they walked out.</p><p>He had scanned the guests in the funeral parlor and searched through the crowd outside, hoping to trigger something in his mind, some memory. He knew Jerry and Mal had done the same, hoping the killer would show up.</p><p>And he probably had. He was most likely one of the people ringing the mortuary carrying a placard demanding his own capture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they reached her house, he turned off the engine and sat in the drive. She didn\u2019t seem to notice at first.</p><p>Being at the wake had been hard for her, he knew, but he couldn\u2019t change the way he was feeling right then, and he just didn\u2019t have any sympathy to give\u2014especially when he knew she was lying to him about what she thought she was seeing and what Adam Harrison was doing there. Finally he said, \u201cI\u2019ll walk you in.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him with a slightly puzzled expression on her face. Then her expression changed, resigned at first, followed by full-scale angry.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can find my door from here,\u201d she told him. He caught her arm with a groan when she started to exit the car, and she turned and glared at him angrily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I apologize for embarrassing you with Katherine Kidd,\u201d she said politely.</p><p>\u201cLook, I just don\u2019t believe in ghosts. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got your reasons for thinking you see the dead rising, but I just don\u2019t believe in the possibility myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are seeing ghosts, right?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cSingular, sorry,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>\u201cBeau Kidd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not trying to hurt Katherine or anyone else,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see Beau Kidd. And I\u2019m sorry you got involved with someone you think is a fruitcake. But don\u2019t worry. You can walk away. Ana and I will still be friends, but you don\u2019t have to have anything to do with me.\u201d She stared at him, her eyes cobalt with indignation. \u201cNow let me go.\u201d</p><p>He had no choice but to do so, and the minute he did, she slammed her way out of the car.</p><p>\u201cChristina!\u201d he said, following, catching her arm again.</p><p>Just then Tony Lowell\u2019s minivan, with Tony at the wheel and Ilona beside him, pulled into their drive next door. Jed groaned inwardly at the thought that they could see what was going on, and who the hell knew what they would think. It looked like trouble in paradise over here for sure, and they were both looking at him with disapproval.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys!\u201d Christina called to them, and forced a smile.</p> <p>They drove on toward their garage, but they didn\u2019t look convinced.</p><p>\u201cLook, Christina\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just let me go. I\u2019m safe. I have friends staying with me. Go keep an eye on Katherine Kidd, why don\u2019t you? I\u2019m sure she could use your help.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell whether she sincerely meant that he should be looking after another potential victim, or if there was a touch of jealousy in her words.</p><p>Maybe he wanted her to be a little bit jealous, he thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head, staring at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what anything means at the moment. Good night.\u201d</p><p>As she started toward the house, the door opened. Genevieve was standing there, another witness to the whole thing, he suspected.</p> <p>Killer came rushing out to meet his mistress. He jumped up and down, happy to see Christina, then made a beeline for Jed, who bent down to pet the dog.</p><p>\u201cKiller, come on in now,\u201d Christina called, and the little dog ran back over to her. From the doorway, Genevieve said something to her, and she turned and stared at Jed. \u201cYou are coming tomorrow night, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s the big deal with tomorrow night?\u201d he asked, pushing, hoping for the truth at last.</p><p>\u201cAdam thinks...\u201d Her voice trailed off, and she looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked harshly. \u201cWhat does Adam think?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him again, and said in a rush, \u201cAdam thinks we should have a s\u00e9ance. He thinks it might help catch the killer.\u201d Her eyes met his pleadingly. \u201cWill you come? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she said lightly, then walked inside.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to tell her to lock the door. He heard the bolt snap into place.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he was there?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>She jumped, having lost total track of the conversation. She had tried not to appear upset about Jed, since no one there knew about the details of their relationship. Actually, she didn\u2019t really know the details of it herself, she realized in mocking silence. Still, there was no reason to let anyone else know she was upset, so when she\u2019d come in, she had started talking about the wake.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that the killer was there,\u201d Adam said, answering his own question.</p><p>\u201cI think half the state was there,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Beau?\u201d Adam asked. \u201cIs he here?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve had made tea, which they were all sipping now in the parlor. She hadn\u2019t seen Beau Kidd since she\u2019d come in, though. Great. No Jed, and now no Beau.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBeau isn\u2019t here. But the problem is, he doesn\u2019t know anything. He thinks the real killer was somewhere behind Larry Atkins, his partner, and that\u2019s why he pulled his weapon. But Larry thought Beau was aiming at him, so he shot him. And since he died and never got the chance to explain, everyone decided he was the Interstate Killer and they stopped looking for anyone else. So he\u2019s haunting me, haunting this house...but he can\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>Adam was quiet, thoughtful. \u201cWhat about the funeral?\u201d he finally asked her.</p><p>\u201cIt was sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to know if the victim haunted her own services,\u201d Genevieve explained.</p><p>Christina shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cOr if she did, she didn\u2019t show herself to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still say that tomorrow\u2019s s\u00e9ance will change things,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Christina asked. \u201cWill other people be able to see Beau?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not,\u201d Adam told her.</p><p>\u201cThen what...?\u201d</p><p>Thor came over and sat on the couch next to her, taking her hands. \u201cHey, look at me. You can\u2019t imagine a bigger doubter than me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, thinking, Oh, yes, I can. He just left a few minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cWe will discover something tomorrow night,\u201d Thor promised her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure Jed will be here, though,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll show. I guarantee you,\u201d Adam said. \u201cHe\u2019ll show.\u201d</p><p>Life could be a real bitch sometimes, she thought. She\u2019d slept alone most of her life. Jed Braden had slept with her for only two days, yet she felt the loss as if she were bereft of a limb. What an idiot she was. She should have known better than to fall so quickly. Hell, hadn\u2019t she known her whole life not to fall for him at all?</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d</p><p>She had been brushing her hair in front of the old full-length mirror by her bureau. She could see Beau in the mirror, making himself comfortable in the overstuffed chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to...chase Jed away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I did that all on my own.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sympathetically, then moved on to what was really concerning him. \u201cI wish Kitty would believe you...believe in me.\u201d</p><p>Christina wasn\u2019t feeling all that generous toward Katherine Kidd at that particular moment, but she refrained from saying so to Beau. \u201cShe does believe in you, Beau. She\u2019s believed in your innocence all these years. And I\u2019m sure there were many times when it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wish she believed I was here now.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him. \u201cYou\u2019re a ghost\u2014that\u2019s pretty hard for most people to believe. But you\u2019re here for a reason. We have to figure out this case, Beau. I went to Allison\u2019s wake tonight. It\u2019s so unfair. There has to be a reason why you\u2019re here. Can\u2019t you tell me anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you everything I know,\u201d he said irritably.</p><p>She walked over to the foot of the bed, sat across from him and set a hand on his knee. It felt real, as if she really were touching something. Someone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a s\u00e9ance tomorrow night. Adam thinks it will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he said, though he didn\u2019t sound entirely convinced. \u201cWhere is Jed, anyway?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cLooking after your sister, I hope,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I hope so, too. Oh, sorry. I hope that I\u2019m not ruining your relationship. I do take off whenever it seems that...well, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m not a voyeur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters anymore, anyway,\u201d she murmured, rising. \u201cI\u2019m going to brush my teeth, wash my face, turn in.\u201d As she walked toward the bathroom, she heard Killer barking at her bedroom door. \u201cHey, let him in, will you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The door opened, and Killer bounded in. It wasn\u2019t until she had a mouthful of toothpaste that she realized she had asked a ghost to open a door, and he had done so.</p><p>She walked back out. \u201cYou opened the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I make coffee, too, remember?\u201d Beau said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI just...well, you know. Ghosts are supposed to be insubstantial, able to walk through walls, stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSometimes I know where you are, and I can just...be there. Sometimes I can\u2019t. Sometimes I can move things, and other times I can\u2019t. I didn\u2019t get instructions on how to be a ghost, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cGo to bed. I guess I cost you the guy of your dreams tonight, but I\u2019ll be watching over you. I guess that doesn\u2019t mean much, huh?\u201d</p><p>She walked around and kissed his cheek. He really did feel solid, and even warm.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Beau,\u201d she said. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Killer curled up at the bottom of the bed. She missed Jed with a longing that was both emotional and physical, but it was still good to have the dog at her feet.</p><p>And the ghost of Beau Kidd standing watch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dream began just as it had the first time.</p><p>There was the feeling of being confined. Tied up. The awful darkness.</p><p>She was trying so hard to make a sound, to scream, but she was bound and gagged, and the worst was that she knew what was coming next. There was terror in the darkness, because soon her tormentor would come back.</p> <p>She listened for the telltale footsteps, and every cell in her body seemed to scream. She would die. Eventually, she would die. The time would come when she was no longer entertaining, and then...</p><p>She started to fight the terror, clawing her way to consciousness. She was in her own bed; her Jack Russell was lying with her. She had to wake up, had to wake up....</p><p>With a cry, she finally found her way back, and she gasped in relief. The night-light was on, as always, and Killer was standing by her side, staring at her, whining.</p><p>\u201cBeau?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She saw him. He was in the chair, his head between his hands, and he looked up at her in absolute misery. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said to him. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. None of this is your fault. My grandmother warned me once that it was dangerous to see the dead, to talk to them. But now...Beau, I am not going to be so afraid anymore. We have to find the truth.\u201d</p><p>Beau shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I just stay in my dream...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can\u2019t really be hurt in a dream,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then again, what if a dream can kill...?\u201d</p> <p>It was irritating but true.</p><p>There was no way Jed intended to stay away from Christina\u2019s get-together. As much as he might mock and actually be angry that they seriously meant to hold a s\u00e9ance, he didn\u2019t intend to stay away. He was too worried about Christina. And he couldn\u2019t help it, but he was worried about Katherine Kidd, as well.</p><p>Hell, he was worried about any attractive young woman right now, but especially redheads. He wondered if the smartest thing for women to be doing right now was stock up on black hair dye. But that wasn\u2019t the solution, or not the whole solution, anyway. The red hair was a factor, yes, but he was convinced it wasn\u2019t everything.</p><p>When he arrived at the house, he could hear music. There were great aromas emanating from the house, as well. Something was being barbecued, and a lot of baking had been going on.</p><p>The door was unlocked, an oversight he decided to forgive, since there was such a crowd. Even so, he made sure to lock it behind himself. He stood unnoticed in the front hall for a moment, just observing. Mike and Thor were engaged in conversation in the hall, Mike expressing himself with his hands and somehow not spilling the beer he held. Jed waved hello and headed into the living room, where Dan was hunkered down by the CD player, apparently having put himself in charge of the music.</p><p>Adam was seated in a comfortable chair, leaning back and listening to the music, and he seemed to be pleasantly relaxed. Tony was carrying on a conversation with Genevieve about the perfect way to dress a turkey.</p><p>Ana and Christina seemed to be doing the most work. He found them in the kitchen, setting out trays and plates.</p><p>\u201cOlives?\u201d Ana asked.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d Christina held out the jar.</p><p>\u201cI already put out the celery, carrots and cukes,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Hey, just grab the potato salad, will you? Hey, Mike!\u201d she shouted. \u201cGo check the barbecue, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Jed said. \u201cWant me to do it?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, eyes a very cool blue. \u201cSure, but hurry. I don\u2019t want it to burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>He went out back, where steps led down from the wraparound porch to a covered patio. Beyond that was a pool. It was a small pool, kidney-shaped, but they\u2019d had a great time in it, growing up. The McDuffs had always welcomed kids.</p><p>He went over to the big grill and discovered that the meat was safe. He quickly flipped the burgers, then the ribs and chicken. A minute later, he felt Christina come out.</p><p>Felt her.</p><p>He knew the scent of her cologne, but that didn\u2019t matter. He knew the way the air moved when she was near. He just knew that she was there.</p><p>\u201cI have a plate for the burgers,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed help out here?\u201d Thor asked, walking over behind Christina.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back in and help Ana get stuff out on the table,\u201d Christina said. \u201cYou can give Jed a hand, Thor.\u201d</p><p>Jed looked down at the grill, trying to hide a dry smile. Great. Send out the Incredible Hulk. If a man like that believed in ghosts...</p><p>\u201cHave you been keeping an eye on Katherine Kidd?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>Jed shrugged. \u201cI followed her to the store, I followed her home,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought about asking her over here, but...\u201d</p><p>Thor frowned. \u201cMaybe you should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my house. Not my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall her now and see if she wants to come.\u201d</p><p>Jed turned to him, arching a brow. \u201cShe\u2019s even less amused by this than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be amusing,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cHow do they want them cooked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for half medium and half well, I guess,\u201d Thor said. \u201cSeriously, why don\u2019t you give Katherine a call? Two good things about that. One, she\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd number two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be home alone on a Saturday night, tempted to go out.\u201d</p><p>The first batch of hamburgers was done. Jed slid them on to a plate and asked Thor, \u201cYou want to be in charge of ribs and chicken?\u201d</p><p>Thor grinned and nodded. At that moment, Christina and Ana came outside. Ana had plates, cups, napkins and silverware. Christina was balancing two large platters, one holding buns and bread, the other divided into sections and containing baked beans, potato salad and coleslaw.</p><p>Thor walked over to join them at the picnic table, carrying the burgers. \u201cI told Jed he should try to convince Katherine Kidd to come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Christina asked, blindsided.</p><p>\u201cI said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you.\u201d She gazed over at Jed for a moment, then turned back to Thor. \u201cYou heard what she said at the cemetery. She thinks we\u2019re all nuts, you know. And cruel. She won\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she will,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>Genevieve had walked over while they were talking and picked up the gist of the conversation. \u201cJed, let\u2019s just go over there. She\u2019ll be much more likely to accept if you ask her in person. Come on. I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>Christina couldn\u2019t have been more surprised when Jed and Genevieve returned\u2014with Katherine Kidd.</p><p>Whatever Jed had said to her had led to a complete change of attitude. She mingled cheerfully and had actually worked with Mike, so they had that to talk about.</p><p>When she approached Christina, it was ruefully. \u201cThank you so much for inviting me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Christina said, trying to sound as if she meant it. At her feet, Killer barked happily, then looked up, wagging his tail hopefully as he eyed the plate of leftovers she was carrying. \u201cNo more, Killer, you\u2019re going to explode,\u201d she told the dog.</p><p>Katherine was still there, smiling awkwardly, as if unsure what to say next.</p><p>Christina cleared her throat. \u201cWe\u2019re having a s\u00e9ance tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Katherine said, \u201cI was awake all last night trying to figure out how you could have known about Calliope, and Beau and his friends getting drunk. I don\u2019t know what I think. I don\u2019t believe in ghosts, but maybe...I don\u2019t quite disbelieve as much as I used to.\u201d</p><p>Christina didn\u2019t quite know what to say to that, but luckily she was saved from having to figure it out by Ana\u2019s announcement that the desserts were laid out in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cEvery man for himself,\u201d Christina said. \u201cWe\u2019ll regroup in the parlor.\u201d</p><p>That morning, Adam and Thor had brought an oblong table into the parlor and set enough chairs around it for all of them. All they had to do now was add one more for Katherine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really having a s\u00e9ance?\u201d Dan asked, looking around the room. \u201cDo you honestly want to make Gran come back so she can yell at us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did not yell at us,\u201d Christina protested.</p><p>\u201cConstantly,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cYou two are horrible. I hope she does come back and yell at you,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we having a s\u00e9ance?\u201d Ana asked. \u201cAre we trying to contact someone special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s October, and it sounded like fun,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cWhat, no candles?\u201d Ilona asked when she walked into the parlor, nibbling on a piece of cake.</p><p>\u201cCandles! Good idea,\u201d Genevieve said, then left in search of some.</p><p>\u201cIf this is good, we should do it again and charge admission,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI wonder if any of the parks have tried this yet. Hey, Mike, you\u2019re the idea man. You should suggest it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bad idea,\u201d Mike said thoughtfully.</p><p>Christina watched as Genevieve returned and lit a few tall candles. Everyone seemed to be into the idea of the s\u00e9ance. Even Jed wasn\u2019t complaining.</p><p>Dan bent down to look under the table. \u201cNo tricks here that I can find,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGet out of there, Dan. No one\u2019s rigged the table,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cI take it we\u2019re trying to contact my brother,\u201d Katherine said as they all took their seats. She looked at Christina and gave a slight smile. \u201cI thought that he had a connection with you already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, lights off,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cIs it going to be really dark?\u201d Ilona asked, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right next to you, babe,\u201d Tony told her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dan began to hum the theme song to The Twilight Zone.</p><p>\u201cDo we need some incense or anything?\u201d Mike suggested.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re just fine the way we are,\u201d Adam Harrison said, then started considering the seating arrangements. \u201cLet\u2019s see, the house belongs to Christina, and Dan and Mike spent a lot of time here, too. Christina, you\u2019re good where you are. Dan, Mike, either side. Then, let\u2019s see...Ana next to Dan, Katherine next to Mike. Jed, you sit next to Katherine. Tony and Ilona...next to Ana. Who am I forgetting? Ah, Genevieve, you go at the end of the table, with Thor next to you, and I\u2019ll be on the other side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we listening for?\u201d Katherine asked. \u201cKnock three times or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know, at a s\u00e9ance,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>The music had been turned off. The few candles that Genevieve had lit were burning, but even without them, the room wouldn\u2019t have been totally dark, because light was still filtering in from the hallway.</p><p>Christina clenched her teeth, already feeling a sense of dread. When she and Ana had played with the Ouija board Beau had appeared. Now here they were again. With any luck, Beau would appear to someone else tonight.</p><p>\u201cJoin hands,\u201d Adam advised the group. As soon as everyone did, he began to speak. \u201cLife is crisscrossed with lines connecting the dimensions. Death is perhaps only another line, a different dimension. We know that sometimes lines can be crossed, and we know that sometimes those who should move on, should cross a line, cannot, because their business in one dimension was not complete, or because someone must be helped.\u201d</p> <p>His voice had a deep, resonant quality. It was almost hypnotic, Christina thought.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Adam went on softly, \u201cthere are those with very special powers who depart this life and should find eternal peace, finished with the woes of this earth, but they stay because they have found a calling. Sometimes, they help us when we need to speak to the dead.\u201d</p><p>He had never once suggested that they close their eyes, never asked them to do anything except hold hands. But as Christina stared down the length of the table at him, the world seemed to change.</p><p>The room filled with mist, gently swirling, almost gentle. Now when she looked at Adam, there was something different about him. And when he spoke again, his voice had changed.</p><p>\u201cI am Josh, and I am here to help you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJosh?\u201d Christina murmured.</p> <p>The only things she could see were Josh and the mist, though she could still feel pressure on her hands from Dan on one side and Mike on the other.</p><p>Strangely, she wasn\u2019t afraid, even though she couldn\u2019t see them anymore.</p><p>\u201cBeau Kidd, will you show yourself?\u201d Josh asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Beau Kidd said, and he was, Christina realized. He was standing behind Josh.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you rest, Beau?\u201d Josh asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m innocent,\u201d Beau said. \u201cAnd also...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso?\u201d Josh echoed questioningly.</p><p>\u201cI feel a sense of danger surrounding this house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Josh asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but there\u2019s a connection, and someone has to find it.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly a horrific, painful keening tore through the night and Beau simply...shattered.</p><p>The mist faded as everyone at the table leapt to their feet, staring at Katherine, who was backing away from the table, still moaning. \u201cI saw him,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cOh, my God...I saw my brother.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>T here was silence.</p><p>Dead silence.</p><p>Adam Harrison turned on the lights and returned the parlor to its former self.</p><p>This was a family of performers, Jed reminded himself. And yet...Katherine Kidd had been the one to scream.</p><p>Sucked in by the show? Even he had to admit that it had been a good one. Adam Harrison had done an excellent job of speaking in a different voice, every bit as convincing as Christina carrying on conversations with dead people.</p><p>Katherine still looked simultaneously ecstatic and sorrowful.</p><p>\u201cI saw him,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI saw Beau.\u201d When no one else spoke, she turned to Adam and asked, \u201cI ruined it, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...no,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cIt was so...real.\u201d</p><p>Mike cleared his throat. \u201cMaybe for you. I didn\u2019t see a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you weren\u2019t looking,\u201d Katherine insisted.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was creepy,\u201d Ilona said.</p><p>\u201cThere was fog,\u201d Mike said, sounding genuinely unnerved. \u201cThere was fog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it, too,\u201d Ana breathed.</p><p>Jed noticed that Adam was looking pale, exhausted. \u201cAdam,\u201d he said softly, \u201cyou should sit down before you fall down.\u201d Jed might think the man was nothing but a clever fake, but he looked ill, and he was no spring chicken. \u201cIn fact, you should probably go lie down. Let me help you upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded.</p><p>Christina sprang into action then. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some water, Adam. And put on more tea.\u201d She hurried out of the room.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d Thor said with a frown, watching as Adam accepted support from Jed.</p><p>Adam lifted a hand. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>They made it up the stairs, and Christina arrived a moment later with a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my dear,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThe tea is on.\u201d</p><p>After she left, Jed said, smiling to take the sting out of the words, \u201cThe Irish think you can fix anything with tea. Frequently laced with whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not really so far off, are they?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout the tea or the whiskey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d Adam said, and sat down at the foot of his bed.</p><p>Jed sat across from him in a wicker chair and asked, \u201cSo...what are you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see tonight?\u201d Adam asked instead of answering.</p><p>\u201cMist. And I\u2019ll be damned if I can figure out where it came from, unless it was just a mass hallucination.\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled. \u201cThink I hypnotized a whole roomful of people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your voice...Your voice was entirely different,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Katherine Kidd saw her brother.\u201d Adam sighed. \u201cToo bad. We were on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the way where? Where would we have wound up?\u201d Jed asked, well aware of the skepticism in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWith a link, perhaps. Although...perhaps we found a link after all,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cAdam, do you really think the ghost of Beau Kidd haunts this house?\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled. \u201cI seldom tell anyone exactly what I think, unless they happen to be very good friends or in my employ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrison, I\u2019ve heard nothing but good about you. Still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in ghosts.\u201d</p><p>Jed shrugged but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Adam went on. \u201cYou, of all people, should believe in ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts can haunt us in many ways. And you are haunted every day of your life.\u201d</p><p>Jed stiffened. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he demanded harshly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let go. You feel guilt for your wife\u2019s death. You can\u2019t understand how someone so young and beautiful, with everything to live for, should die\u2014and you should still be alive. You see your wife every day of your life. You need the guilt to keep going. And now you\u2019ve transferred that guilt to everything that happened with Beau Kidd. So maybe Beau is really haunting you?\u201d Adam suggested.</p><p>Jed drew back, feeling anger\u2014and a strange creeping sensation. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I wasn\u2019t even here when they pulled out the stupid Ouija board.\u201d</p><p>Adam didn\u2019t reply to that. Instead he said, \u201cI understand they\u2019ve uncovered similar murders in other places.\u201d</p><p>Jed stared at him, frowning. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled. \u201cI have my contacts in the FBI, Mr. Braden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re right and the killer was very busy here twelve years ago. Then Beau Kidd was killed, and the killer knew he had an out for the murders here, so he started to travel, committing his crimes wherever he found himself. But finally he came back here\u2014back home\u2014and started killing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNature of the beast,\u201d Adam said softly.</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what I think, and I believe you and I are pretty much in agreement on this. The killer started here, and now he\u2019s back, after using Beau Kidd to buy some breathing time. He is intelligent, and criminally clever. He knew when not to kill in his own backyard. But it\u2019s in his nature. He managed to satisfy his blood lust undetected while he was away, and now he\u2019s convinced he can get away with his crimes again here, maybe even find a way to trick someone else into taking the fall for him again.\u201d</p><p>Jed nodded. \u201cBut what\u2019s going on with Beau Kidd and Christina and this house?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA connection,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cBut what kind of connection? And how does it relate to the connection between the victims, a connection I still can\u2019t figure out? I feel as if we\u2019re just going in circles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Jed asked.</p><p>Adam shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I should share my thoughts with you, Mr. Braden. You\u2019re far too skeptical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I still can\u2019t embrace the idea that ghosts walk the streets at their leisure?\u201d</p><p>Before Adam had a chance to answer, Christina came in bearing tea. She stared daggers at Jed as she poured.</p><p>Jed stood. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll take Katherine home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d Christina said. \u201cAdam, how do you like your tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne sugar and milk, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Jed hesitated by the door, but Christina wouldn\u2019t even look at him. He wanted to tell her that he would be back, that he hated leaving her alone in the house with a group of people who were seriously misguided at best, completely loony at worst\u2014even if she apparently shared their delusion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was surprised when Adam looked at him with a pleasant smile. \u201cCome back again, Mr. Braden. I enjoy our conversations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I will.\u201d</p><p>Christina still didn\u2019t even glance his way.</p> <p>Jed walked down the stairs, furious with himself. Dammit, he was getting sucked in. There were no such things as ghosts, he told himself. There were only memories. Memories that plagued and haunted and hurt. But somewhere inside he was beginning to believe he was wrong, had been wrong his whole life, and there were ghosts after all.</p><p>And maybe someday, when this was all in the past, he could even learn to let his own ghosts go.</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re all right. You really scared me,\u201d Christina told Adam once Jed was gone.</p><p>A moment later, before Adam had a chance to say anything in response, Genevieve arrived at the doorway, Ana right behind her.</p><p>Adam looked over at them and grinned. \u201cWow. All these beautiful young women. I should feel a little woozy more often.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Ana asked, coming in and sitting on the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI am absolutely fine,\u201d Adam assured her.</p><p>Ana looked at him for a moment before she spoke again. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my asking, but Josh...Josh was your son, right?\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Christina started; you could have heard a pin drop in the room, it had gone so silent.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s been...gone a long time,\u201d Ana went on.</p> <p>Adam smiled reminiscently. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was like you were him, you know?\u201d Ana said, simultaneously certain and questioning.</p><p>Again everyone else stayed silent, watching her as she kept speaking.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see Beau Kidd, but I could have sworn I saw your son. That...that he was real.\u201d</p><p>Adam reached out and touched her face. \u201cHe is very real, thank you. He had the gift. And he died young. I never had the gift, but I do believe in it, and I\u2019ve been able to gather people around me who have the gift and the courage to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I have a gift?\u201d Ana asked.</p><p>Christina grimaced. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019re welcome to mine,\u201d she said dryly, breaking the tension in the room. Everyone laughed.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Adam said gently to Ana.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s let Adam get some rest,\u201d Genevieve said firmly.</p><p>They went downstairs. Katherine and Jed had gone, and Christina suspected he would be going home after he\u2019d dropped her off. It was obvious that the night was over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to head on out,\u201d Ana said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll walk you to your house,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019ve walked from here to my house a thousand times,\u201d Ana assured them, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but not tonight,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe live right next door,\u201d Ilona reminded him. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for us to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd deprive me of the pleasure of the midget\u2019s company?\u201d Dan teased.</p><p>Ana groaned.</p><p>\u201cI can walk you home if my brother is being a jerk,\u201d Mike told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, let the jerk do it,\u201d Ana said. \u201cGood night, Christina. Thanks for the barbecue. And the s\u00e9ance. That was...cool.\u201d</p><p>Dan gave Christina a kiss good-night, waved to the others and headed out with Ana. Ilona and Tony left next, and Mike was right behind them. Christina was left standing in the doorway with Genevieve and Thor.</p><p>She was disturbed by the sense of loneliness that swept over her. She didn\u2019t remember feeling quite so forlorn in a very long time. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said softly, \u201cI really thought...I thought Gran or Granda, even my mom or dad, might show up. If only for a minute,\u201d she said.</p><p>She felt Thor\u2019s hand on her shoulder, gentle, reassuring. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need to stay behind,\u201d he said. \u201cThey loved and were loved. Their lives were full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my parents were so young,\u201d Christina said, all the remembered pain in her voice.</p><p>\u201cThey still lived their lives as they were meant to be lived,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Christina nodded. \u201cWell...I\u2019m going to bed, I guess,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThank you, both. Though I\u2019m not sure we really got anywhere tonight.\u201d</p><p>She was startled when Adam suddenly called down the stairs, \u201cWe\u2019re all in and the house is locked up for the night, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Unless Jed thinks you meant for him to come back tonight,\u201d Christina replied.</p><p>\u201cHe will or he won\u2019t,\u201d Adam said, sounding unworried either way. \u201cJust make sure this place is locked up tight, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Thor promised, suiting his action to his words, then said he was going to go watch TV for a while. The women decided to go up to bed. A minute later, Christina closed the door to her room and slipped into a thin flannel nightgown, washed her face, brushed her teeth and started brushing her hair, waiting.</p><p>She felt Beau\u2019s presence as soon as he entered her room.</p><p>\u201cThe guy is a jerk,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cJed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jed. You know the type. Hell, I know the type. I used to be the type. All macho bravado. But you need to cut him some slack. He\u2019s afraid, only he doesn\u2019t know how to be afraid. He knows what it\u2019s like to lose someone he loves, and he doesn\u2019t want to go through that again, so...he\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, though. I\u2019ll watch over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again.\u201d He looked troubled, so she frowned and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI think I\u2019m starting to understand why I\u2019m here,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI think I showed up because...because the real killer was in this house,\u201d he told her.</p><p>What do to? Jed wondered.</p><p>He dropped Katherine off at her house, watching her until she was safely inside. She waved from the doorway, then closed\u2014and, he assumed, locked\u2014the door behind her.</p><p>During the ride, he had once again stressed to her that she was an attractive redhead and needed to watch out. She had only smiled and said, \u201cNow, there would be an irony. Beau Kidd\u2019s sister killed\u2014by the real Interstate Killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about just being careful, and avoiding all irony?\u201d he\u2019d suggested.</p><p>A part of him wanted to rush right back to Christina\u2019s, but another part of him wanted to go home and look at his files again. The second part won out, so he put the car in gear and drove to his town house.</p><p>The minute he entered, he realized how barren his home was. Of course it was. He had made a point of it. He hadn\u2019t been able to stand looking at the pictures, the knickknacks, the souvenirs of laughter shared, of...life.</p><p>There was no personality here, while already the house Christina now claimed as her own was full of individuality.</p><p>He smiled to himself.</p><p>Hell. If he were a ghost, that was definitely where he would go if he had to pick a place to haunt, he had to admit. The house was steeped in personality. It held a whisper of the music that had been her grandfather, and the homey atmosphere that had always surrounded her grandmother. There were pictures everywhere.... Christina\u2019s mother as a child, as a teenager, posing with her date for the prom, her wedding...</p><p>He gave himself a shake, walked over to his desk and impatiently spread out the files. He found the notes Larry Atkins had made after interviewing Beau about Janet Major. According to Officer Kidd, they were not heavily involved. The officer said they had met at O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, off International Drive. He kept reading, but the words began to jumble on him.</p><p>He picked up another file, the one on Grace Garcia. Again Larry Atkins had written the notes.</p><p>\u201cMiss Garcia worked part-time at O\u2019Reilly\u2019s,\u201d Atkins had written. \u201cHer manager, Peter Hicoty, was in tears when I spoke with him. \u2018We all loved her,\u2019 he said. \u2018We all loved her here.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jed set down the file. He glanced quickly through the rest of them. He\u2019d read them all before, but he hadn\u2019t realized what he was looking for then. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t find a connection in every file, but given where the dead women had lived or worked, it seemed likely that, at the very least, they had all stopped in at O\u2019Reilly\u2019s to eat or grab a drink.</p><p>How had everyone missed the possibility?</p><p>He immediately called Jerry, even though it was late.</p><p>Jerry immediately asked, \u201cYou got something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Reilly\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a pub down near International Drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>\u201cCheck it out. I\u2019m not suggesting that anyone at O\u2019Reilly\u2019s is the guilty party. But I think it\u2019s where the killer chooses his victims,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something,\u201d Jerry told him. \u201cI\u2019ll get a car out there.\u201d</p><p>They rang off. Jed looked around his town house. The emptiness, the coldness, weighed on him. He glanced at his watch. It wasn\u2019t really that late, he told himself. He went out, got in his car and drove back to Christina\u2019s.</p><p>He parked out front, then sat in his car and looked around. Only two cars remained in the driveway: Christina\u2019s, and the SUV Thor, Genevieve and Adam had driven up in.</p><p>The house looked quiet. He told himself that he should just drive away, but he hesitated. He had said that he would come back, even if he hadn\u2019t said when.</p><p>He exited his car and started up the walk. Before he could knock, Thor opened the door. \u201cI thought I heard a car.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI see you decided to come back tonight after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come on in.\u201d</p><p>Together they walked into the living room, where Thor had been watching a movie.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you think about tonight?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>Jed shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. When Adam and I were talking earlier, he was about to say something, but then we were interrupted. I suspect he\u2019s sleeping now, though.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go up and check?

He won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Jed headed for the stairs.</p><p>Christina tossed and turned.</p><p>It was happening again.</p><p>She was in agony from the things that had been done to her, and she swallowed, choking down her tears. The monster would come again, she knew, but that wasn\u2019t as bad as knowing that her time was ticking away. She read the papers. She knew. Once they were taken, the victims had only a few days left. And then...</p> <p>She tried to scream. It was a silent sound behind the gag.</p><p>And then it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Jed never made it to Adam\u2019s room. He heard Christina scream, and he turned, tearing down the hallway, throwing open her door.</p><p>She was sitting up in the bed, but she didn\u2019t seem to be seeing anything.</p><p>He rushed to her side. Shook her. Sat beside her and drew her against him. \u201cChristina? It\u2019s me. Jed. Christina!\u201d</p><p>By then Thor, Genevieve and Adam had rushed into her room and were standing around the bed, looking concerned.</p> <p>\u201cChristina?\u201d Jed said again.</p><p>She shuddered, cried out, then buried her face against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jed asked.</p><p>\u201cHe...he has someone right now,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it. When I dream, I\u2019m...her. I know it sounds crazy, but it\u2019s true. He has a woman, and she\u2019s terrified. She knows she\u2019s going to die.\u201d</p><p>Adam walked closer, taking her hands. \u201cWhat does she see?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s dark. She\u2019s blindfolded. And she can\u2019t cry out, because she\u2019s gagged.\u201d</p><p>Jed inhaled and held his breath. What she was claiming was...impossible.</p><p>And yet, it sounded so convincing. Christina wasn\u2019t lying. He would stake his life on that. Whether what she had seen was a dream or something more didn\u2019t really matter. To her, it had been real.</p> <p>\u201cAnd they were all here tonight...\u201d Adam murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jed demanded.</p><p>\u201cAdam thinks Beau appeared because someone in the house is the killer,\u201d Thor explained.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d Christina exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about Ana, and Mike and Dan. Or my next-door neighbor and his girlfriend. It\u2019s impossible. There has to be another explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere could be, of course,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>O\u2019Reilly\u2019s. The name filled Jed\u2019s mind like a giant neon sign.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he murmured consideringly. He hated to think it, but Dan was an actor, used to pretending to be someone he wasn\u2019t, and he\u2019d known one of the recent victims, as well as the woman who\u2019d supposedly fallen in the fog.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Christina demanded indignantly.</p><p>She was furious, and he knew it. He should have seen it coming, in fact. Christina was fiercely and understandably loyal to her only living relatives.</p><p>She leapt out of bed. \u201cThat\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard. We\u2019re going to go see him right now and he can tell you so himself.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, all five of them went downstairs and headed for Jed\u2019s sedan. Killer followed, barking and running around their feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lock him in the house,\u201d Christina said. She picked up her dog, hugged him and talked to him on the way back to the house, but she was firm. He was locked inside.</p><p>When she rejoined the group she turned to Jed and said challengingly, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to knock on my next-door neighbor\u2019s door and accuse him of being a murderer, too, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, why not?\u201d Jed said equably, and together they walked over to Tony\u2019s door. He could almost feel the waves of anger emanating from her. He had attacked her family. That was a sin for which there might be no such thing as forgiveness.</p><p>She knocked at the door of Tony\u2019s sprawling ranch. All the windows were dark, but in a few seconds they heard a sleepy voice asking what was going on, and Tony opened the door. He was wearing a robe, which he had apparently thrown on quickly, since it was inside out, and his hair was tousled.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Tony, you were sleeping, I take it?\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cUm...yeah.\u201d He was only half awake, but he still tried to offer a smile.</p><p>Ilona appeared behind him, asking, \u201cWhat is it, Tony?\u201d She, too, was wearing a robe, and she was yawning.</p><p>Jed thought he could hear a television from somewhere deep in the house. They must have fallen asleep in front of the bedroom TV.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Tony told her, then turned to Jed and Christina. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just checking to make sure you guys got home safely,\u201d Christina lied.</p><p>\u201cUm, Christina,\u201d Tony said as if he were talking to someone who wasn\u2019t quite there mentally, \u201cI live next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you guys make sure Ana got into her house okay?\u201d Jed asked.</p><p>\u201cDan walked her home,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>Christina could be as angry as she wanted, Jed thought, but he wasn\u2019t taking any chances. He turned, leaving her to say good-night, and he was running by the time he reached Ana\u2019s property.</p><p>He banged the door hard.</p><p>He heard what sounded like a scream inside and got ready to break down the door, but in the end he didn\u2019t need to. There was a flurry of footsteps and the door was flung open, revealing Ana, in pajamas and a robe. She stared at him as Christina came loping up behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing here?\u201d Ana asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay?\u201d Jed asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m okay,\u201d Ana said, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cDan walked you home, right?\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cYes. So why are you...?\u201d She paused, staring at them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Christina asked.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Ana said. \u201cThere\u2019s an alert out. Another woman is missing.\u201d</p><p>Christina let out a moaning sound.</p><p>\u201cAnd...we know her,\u201d Ana went on.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Jed demanded.</p><p>\u201cAngela McDuff,\u201d Ana said. \u201cMike\u2019s ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>17</p><p>T he cop who interviewed Mike was named Jerry Dwyer, who, it turned out, knew Jed well.</p><p>As soon as Mike heard about Angie he had expected to be called in and questioned. After all, wasn\u2019t the ex always the first one to be suspected? He\u2019d expected to be stuck in a bare-bones interrogation room and questioned harshly.</p><p>You were married to her, but she twisted you around her little finger and used you to get ahead. Then she left you and tried to take you for everything you had. A real redheaded bitch, huh?</p><p>Then they would start trying to tie him to the earlier murders. Of course, he would point out that he\u2019d been a kid back then, only eighteen, to which they would respond that lots of sickos started killing by eighteen.</p><p>But apparently he\u2019d been watching too much TV. Dwyer hadn\u2019t been anything like what he\u2019d expected. The man had asked him questions, of course, but sitting in Mike\u2019s own living room and perfectly pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last see your wife?\u201d Dwyer asked.</p><p>\u201cEx-wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at work. She stopped by my office almost a week ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she want more money or anything like that?\u201d Jerry smiled to show it was nothing personal. \u201cSorry, I have to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She didn\u2019t want more money. She keeps thinking I can do more to advance her career,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no. I suggest names. But the producers and sometimes the directors have the last say on any casting decisions.\u201d He\u2019d dragged on a pair of jeans when he\u2019d heard the pounding on his door, but for some reason Mike felt as if he were wearing a tie and it was getting too tight. He inhaled, exhaled. \u201cLook, if I\u2019d been going to kill Angie, it would have been a long time ago, back when she took me for a ride until I couldn\u2019t help her anymore, then dumped me. I\u2019m not that patient.\u201d</p><p>The cop almost smiled. \u201cShe like to get her hair done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou name it, she likes to get it done. She likes being perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you still know her pretty well.\u201d</p><p>Mike smiled. \u201cHey...if you knew Angie once, you know her forever. She\u2019s not what you\u2019d call deep.\u201d</p><p>Jerry watched him, nodding gravely. They were sitting on the sofas in the living room, two modern light-toned leather pieces perpendicular to the gas fireplace. Mike couldn\u2019t help thinking that the cop was going to get up at any minute and start going through the place room by room, taking it\u2014and him\u2014apart.</p><p>Instead Dwyer simply stood and said, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, at least for now.\u201d</p><p>Mike stood, as well, and stared at Dwyer. Swallowed hard. \u201cYou\u2019ll call me if...you find her?\u201d</p><p>Dwyer stared back at him. \u201cOf course. And keep thinking. You never know...you might be able to tell us something that can help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Mike walked Dwyer to the door. He could feel his heart hammering, and all he could think of was the old Edgar A. Poe story\u2014\u201cThe Telltale Heart.\u201d</p><p>He was sweating bullets.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>And his heart was beating so loudly they ought to be able to hear it on Mars.</p><p>\u201cGood night, and thank you again, Mr. McDuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, Detective Dwyer.\u201d</p><p>As he closed the door behind the policeman, Mike thought he might have to dial 911; he was practically gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t break it down!\u201d Dan called out irritably. A second later, he opened the door. His red hair was tousled, he was clad in gray sweats, and his feet were bare. He stared in confusion at the group on his doorstep\u2014a group that now included Ana, who\u2019d declared herself too spooked to stay home alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it trick-or-treat already? Did someone drop a bomb? What the hell is going on?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cCan we come in?\u201d Christina said.</p><p>He backed away from the door, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cSure, why not? You guys do know it\u2019s late, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDan,\u201d Christina said, leading the way in, \u201cAngie is missing.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her blankly for a moment, then said, \u201cAngie is...missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked genuinely shocked and confused, Jed thought. And why not? He was an actor.</p><p>Still sounding at sea, Dan asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t she divorce Mike a long time ago? Drag him through an emotional wringer and hang him out to dry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point, Dan,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>Dan looked more confused than ever. \u201cI should be concerned because the woman is a total bitch who did her best to destroy my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a totally bitchy redhead who\u2019s missing!\u201d Ana exploded.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Adam Harrison explained quietly, \u201cthe police have probably questioned your brother about her disappearance already. She was supposed to meet friends for dinner the other night, but she didn\u2019t show up. The friends called the police, and since she\u2019s an attractive redhead, the police are taking her disappearance seriously.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s jaw dropped, as if he\u2019d suddenly figured out the reality of the situation. \u201cOmigod!\u201d he said in one breath. \u201cI\u2019ll call Mike right now.\u201d</p><p>He went to get the phone, and Christina stared at Jed. She looked disdainful, but he realized as she turned away that she was going to search Dan\u2019s house.</p> <p>\u201cMike?\u201d Dan, who either hadn\u2019t noticed or didn\u2019t care what Christina was up to, said anxiously into the phone.</p><p>While Mike was talking on the other end, Jed\u2019s cell phone began to ring. He knew it was going to be Jerry Dwyer, and it gave him no satisfaction to be right.</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me?\u201d Dwyer asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, sure. Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else?\u201d Jerry demanded dryly. \u201cO\u2019Reilly\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need a little time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be as quick as you can. I\u2019m wondering how much more time she\u2019s got,\u201d Jerry said morosely.</p><p>Christina sat next to Dan on his couch, her fingers entwined with his. Ana was on his other side. Everyone else was dispersed around the room, and everything seemed fine.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Jed had taken off without a word about where he was going. She had a feeling it had something to do with Angie\u2019s disappearance, though, and she was furious with him for not sharing whatever he knew, or even what he thought he knew.</p><p>Not to mention that he didn\u2019t believe in ghosts and clearly thought she was nuts because she did. And on top of everything...</p><p>How dare he suspect her cousin of being the killer? Just to satisfy his curiosity, she\u2019d searched Dan\u2019s place, and she\u2019d found nothing to indicate that he could possibly be holding anyone captive.</p><p>Just then the doorbell rang, and Dan went to answer before sitting back down next to her.</p><p>It was Mike. He paced the room, trying to remember every word he had said to Angie, every word she had said to him, in hopes of remembering something that might help the police. Then he threw up his hands. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything at all, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure she\u2019s not doing this herself as some kind of a publicity stunt?\u201d Dan asked. \u201cGod knows, she\u2019s ambitious enough to try damn near anything,\u201d he argued.</p><p>Mike let out a long sigh. \u201cYou want to know the really sad thing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Christina asked him.</p><p>\u201cI should be worried about being questioned by the police, about being a suspect. But you know what gets me the most?\u201d His words were almost a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m half insane because I\u2019m worried about her. Is that pathetic or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s just human,\u201d Adam told him. \u201cSo don\u2019t give up hope. They may find her yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You think we made a mistake, putting her name and picture out there?\u201d Jerry asked Jed. \u201cThink the killer will panic and kill her? I mean...sooner than he would, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jed told him.</p><p>\u201cI questioned Michael McDuff. I wanted to tell you, since I know you know the family,\u201d Jerry said, motioning to the woman behind the bar. \u201cAnother Scotch, neat, please,\u201d he said, then looked at Jed and scowled slightly. \u201cI\u2019m off duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you were a by-the-book kind of guy, but I\u2019m almost as legit,\u201d Jerry told him.</p><p>\u201cI just came from Daniel McDuff\u2019s place,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cFigured it might have been something like that. Word has it you\u2019ve been seeing a redhead yourself\u2014Christina Hardy. Come to think of it, you\u2019re connected to Christina Hardy, who\u2019s connected to several of the victims, and Katherine Kidd. You\u2019re starting to look pretty interesting yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>Jerry shrugged and grinned. \u201cHell, I can\u2019t get a decent date, and there you go...seeing two gorgeous redheads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not seeing Katherine Kidd. I\u2019m working for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s paying you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working for her because I feel like a piece of crap where her brother is concerned. Jerry, you know that, so why the third degree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExasperation, frustration,\u201d Jerry admitted.</p><p>Mal O\u2019Donnell came in and took the bar stool to Jed\u2019s left. \u201cBlack and tan, sweetheart, thanks,\u201d he said to the bartender.</p><p>When the woman had moved away, O\u2019Donnell stared at Jed. \u201cYou\u2019re on to something.\u201d It was a statement, not a question.</p><p>\u201cI wish I was,\u201d Jed said tensely.</p><p>\u201cWant to know what I think?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked.</p><p>\u201cClue me in,\u201d Jed told him, taking a long swallow of his own beer.</p><p>\u201cBeau Kidd did kill the first set of girls,\u201d Mal said.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is a copycat. Beau killed the first girls. Then he was shot, and the killings ended,\u201d Mal said.</p><p>\u201cThey ended because Beau made a good scapegoat, and because you\u2019ve got a damned smart perp, one who moved on to other places to feed his sick fantasy,\u201d Jed told him.</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re so sure?\u201d Jerry asked him.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s got a thing for the guy\u2019s sister,\u201d Mal said, nodding knowingly.</p><p>Jed shook his head. \u201cI really don\u2019t think Beau did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou helped with one thing, anyway,\u201d Jerry said to Jed.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe reinterviewed everyone in hell today, and you were right about one thing,\u201d Jerry told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd that was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place.\u201d Jerry lowered his voice. \u201cEach victim\u2014then and now\u2014frequented O\u2019Reilly\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve interviewed everyone who works here, then?\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Jerry shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhoever\u2019s taking the women has seen them here, then followed them from here at some point to figure out the pattern of their movements,\u201d Jed murmured.</p><p>Jerry leaned closer to Jed. \u201cAngela McDuff was last seen leaving the Straight-N-Hair-O Salon, right across the parking lot over there.\u201d</p><p>Jed looked out the large plate-glass window. The parking lot was huge. There were plenty of lights, but also plenty of areas in deep shadow.</p><p>Jerry pointed. \u201cHer car was found right over there. She left the salon with a big smile on her face. And then she was gone. No one saw anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must have been a fair amount of people in the mall and in the parking lot,\u201d Jed mused aloud, studying the layout.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Mal said. \u201cBut no one saw anything. She disappeared, and it had to be with someone she either trusted or knew, because she didn\u2019t scream or someone would have noticed. She knew there was a serial killer out there targeting women just like her, and she still got into a car and didn\u2019t even scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that give you that we haven\u2019t had from the beginning?\u201d Jed demanded. \u201cThe women are being taken by someone they trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr someone they know,\u201d Jerry added.</p><p>\u201cEither way, someone they see as nonthreatening,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>What the hell was his own reasoning? Jed asked himself. Adam Harrison claimed\u2014based on the appearance of a ghost, for God\u2019s sake\u2014that the killer had been in Christina\u2019s house. The first night...the night of the Ouija board. And at the s\u00e9ance, too? That meant Mike, Dan or Tony Lowell. Or himself. Or one of the women.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing here tonight? Why did you call me out?\u201d he asked the two cops.</p><p>\u201cFair warning,\u201d Mal O\u2019Donnell told him gravely. \u201cWe feel we have a real suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike McDuff,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>\u201cYou interviewed him tonight, right?\u201d Jed inquired.</p><p>\u201cI chatted with him at his home,\u201d Jerry admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just drag him in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause his ex-wife is out there somewhere. Hopefully, at this moment, still alive. We\u2019re going to be watching him. So if you know anything...\u201d</p><p>Jed swore with disgust and slid off his bar stool. \u201cYou really think I wouldn\u2019t tell you if I knew who a killer was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Jed,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Good night.\u201d Assholes! he added silently as he left.</p><p>And yet...hadn\u2019t he been thinking in nearly the same direction? And he hadn\u2019t said a word.</p><p>And as for Beau Kidd...Did he just want the man to be proven innocent simply because the family deserved some peace? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam, Genevieve and Thor had gone to bed. The house was quiet. Christina stood at her bedroom window, looking out at the lawn.</p><p>She felt numb. She believed in Adam Harrison, and in Genevieve, her good friend, and in Thor. She had even come to believe in the ghost of Beau Kidd. And now...</p><p>And now she was exhausted, but she waited, thinking\u2014hoping\u2014that Beau would certainly make an appearance.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p> <p>As she stood there, she saw Jed drive up and park. He didn\u2019t get out of the car, though, just sat in it and stared up at the house.</p><p>Had she been waiting for Beau? Or Jed?</p><p>She left the window, walked downstairs, opened the front door and waved him in.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might be sleeping,\u201d he said when he got to the door.</p><p>A logical assumption, given that it was...what? Three or four in the morning?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming in?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYes. I wanted to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d There was a hard tone in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure you were all right,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cI was with both my cousins, your cousin, Adam, Genevieve and Thor. Just being with Thor, I should have been okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he acknowledged with a smile.</p><p>He followed her inside, and she hesitated for a long moment, then started up the stairs. She heard him lock the door, then heard his footsteps on the stairs behind her.</p><p>In her bedroom, she closed the door, hoping Beau wouldn\u2019t suddenly decide to make an appearance. Then she turned and stared at Jed. \u201cAre you working for the cops now?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you left because a cop paged you, right? The one who interrogated Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike wasn\u2019t actually interrogated.\u201d He told himself he wasn\u2019t lying, exactly. Mike hadn\u2019t been interrogated\u2014yet. And he certainly couldn\u2019t break what he knew was a confidence and tell her that Mike was considered the chief suspect right now.</p><p>\u201cBut that cop went to his house\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJerry\u2014that cop\u2014went to his house and asked him a few questions. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He spoke quietly, but the whole conversation still scared her. \u201cJust because he was married to a missing woman, that does not make him guilty,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. And they don\u2019t have anything on Mike. Anything at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing to have on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristina, I don\u2019t know what to say to you. I don\u2019t believe in ghosts, including Beau Kidd\u2019s, but I also can\u2019t help but believe that I\u2014like most of the rest of the world\u2014made a mistake by believing he was guilty. But if I\u2019m wrong and your house is haunted, if the ghost of Beau Kidd keeps visiting you, why the hell can\u2019t he help in his own defense?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cHe saw Grace Garcia. He hoped she might still be alive. He went to her, and she was dead but still warm, so he figured the killer had to be close. He drew his weapon because he heard noise from the shadows. He thought it was the killer. He never meant to shoot his partner. The evidence against Beau was just as ridiculous as anything the cops could trump up now against either of my cousins. It\u2019s grasping at straws. It\u2019s circumstantial. No court in America would convict a man because he was once married to one of the victims.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her. \u201cWe should get some sleep,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re asking me to leave,\u201d he said, turning around to meet her eyes again.</p><p>Christina stood very still, staring back at him. \u201cI never want you to leave. I guess you don\u2019t know, but when we were kids, I had such a thing for you. You were a hunk on the football field, and then you were a hunk in uniform. But you were also my friend\u2019s cousin, and then you got married. I knew some of what you were going through when Margaritte got sick, when she died. I guess we both knew what it\u2019s like to lose the people closest to us, to feel as if we\u2019re facing the world alone. Even to feel guilty, like why are we still here when they\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristina...\u201d he murmured uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cNo, listen to me. What I\u2019m trying to say is that I\u2019ve always been crazy about you and I still am, but the thing is...I don\u2019t want you if you think I\u2019m really crazy. I just wonder if maybe you don\u2019t want to believe in me. You don\u2019t want to believe in ghosts for the same reason I didn\u2019t want to myself. It made me angry. If ghosts were real, why didn\u2019t my mom come see me? Why can\u2019t I tell my father one last time that I adored him, and I\u2019m sorry about all those times I was a wise-ass and tried to sneak around! Why can\u2019t I say thanks to Gran for believing in me, or my grandfather, who I swear visited me when I was a kid, but I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ve seen him anywhere since. You would want to believe in ghosts if you could see Margaritte one more time. But you\u2019ll probably never see her. Because she was good and loving, and she doesn\u2019t have anything to prove, to solve, by coming back. Beau is here because he wasn\u2019t guilty. He wasn\u2019t guilty then, and he isn\u2019t guilty now. And he needs people to know that.\u201d</p><p>He was staring at her, and she realized she\u2019d said a hell of a lot more than she had intended to.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d She tried to make the word a challenge, tried not to let her voice falter, tried not to show that she was terrified she had scared him off by proving herself desperate and far crazier than even he had ever believed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot to think about,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to...respond to all of it tonight?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He walked on over to her and pulled her into his arms. \u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. You must have something to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we all see and believe whatever we need to so we can get by, so we can go on,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She frowned, and he spoke quickly again. \u201cBut when I see you, I see life. I see the promise and hope of the future. I see someone who bounced back from every wicked curve thrown her way. I see someone beautiful, strong, full of character, talent...and sexy. Did I say sexy?\u201d he murmured, his lips teasing her earlobe.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t exactly a declaration of undying loyalty.</p><p>\u201cI see life,\u201d he whispered again. \u201cI see the prayer that I might find a life again myself.\u201d</p><p>It was definitely enough.</p><p>She slipped her arms around his neck, returned his kiss and savored the pressure of his body against her own. She should have been exhausted, but adrenaline was racing through her.</p><p>It was like the first time....</p><p>Clothes ended up strewn everywhere. Kisses were openmouthed, wet, hot, awkward, sweet and flaring with hunger. Hands were everywhere.</p><p>Each touch of his naked flesh was more erotic than the last. She couldn\u2019t believe it was possibly to love so hotly, burn so brightly. Ecstasy tore through her when his lips teased her navel, then tasted the flesh between her thighs, when his legs parted hers and he became like one with her, throbbing inside her....</p><p>She knew it couldn\u2019t always be so hot, so frenzied. Sometimes it would be the way it was later, when they were both half asleep. When a slight touch stirred something in one of them, and a second touch stirred something in return...</p><p>Lazy, drowsy, they began to make love again, and for a while it was sweet and slow, before gaining momentum, becoming cataclysmic.</p><p>Darkness, she decided, was good.</p><p>Darkness meant not having to face the truth, but darkness meant trust, as well. Because in the darkness she did trust him. For the first time in her life, she was sorry when the first light of morning came to drive away the shadows.</p><p>But finally she slipped back into sleep, and in sleep there were dreams. Dreams of someone else, dreams in which she was someone else. Dreams that were far too real.</p><p>Tears streamed down her face.</p><p>She had been close, so close, to salvation.</p><p>Or maybe she hadn\u2019t been. Maybe she was just hallucinating before dying. Maybe, until the very second that the life was snuffed from her body, she would believe, would hope...</p><p>Her agony was growing. Wrists, ankles, back...the pain was constant.</p><p>She needed to stop crying. Even her tears hurt.</p><p>And they brought an ever greater pleasure to the fiend who savored her degradation and humiliation.</p><p>Actors, actresses, performers...they thought they were so great, according to her killer, so much better than everyone else.</p><p>But he...he knew better.</p><p>18</p><p>C hristina was more than half asleep\u2014mostly asleep, she decided somewhere deep in the recesses of her mind\u2014when she heard a phone ringing. Then she heard Jed answer, heard him say that he would be along in a bit.</p><p>She opened one eye and looked at him questioningly as he flipped his cell closed.</p><p>\u201cKatherine Kidd,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just heard about Angela McDuff being missing. She called to say that she\u2019s sorry, that she wants me to come by. She wants me to bring Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she said, trying to sound unconcerned.</p><p>\u201cWe can all go,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, she only asked for you and Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I think she\u2019d be happy if you came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she feels that she owes you some kind of apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>At her side, he was silent for a minute. \u201cShe really thinks she saw her brother last night.\u201d</p><p>Christina rolled over on her back. \u201cI\u2019ve got it! Here\u2019s a theory for you. Beau really was a killer twelve years ago. Now he\u2019s back, and even though he\u2019s a ghost, he\u2019s killing again. He has Katherine doing all the dirty work for him. She lures the victims, then he holds them prisoner down in his grave. Later on, she dumps the bodies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jed didn\u2019t look at her. He rose and headed for the bathroom. A minute later she heard the shower come on.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to appreciate her sense of humor, she thought, or understand that it seemed every bit as ridiculous to her to think that her cousins could be involved.</p><p>He came out, dressed, and drying his hair with a towel. \u201cYou should come with me,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go see if Adam will join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Thor will go, too. Then Genevieve and I can talk about old times, and dish about you and Thor,\u201d she said lightly, forcing a smile.</p><p>He paused by the bed and lifted her face. He kissed her lips. \u201cCan a ghost kill?\u201d he asked in all seriousness.</p><p>Was he mocking her? She couldn\u2019t tell. She hesitated, then said, \u201cHe...uh...makes a decent cup of coffee,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d He started for the door, then turned back. \u201cWait for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean I shouldn\u2019t go anywhere\u2014especially with my cousins\u2014right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no real evidence,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence at all,\u201d she snapped in return. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I want to decorate the house for Halloween, so I think I\u2019ll get started on that. I\u2019m a bit late, but, hey...there are still ten days left. And I can hunt up all the Thanksgiving stuff while I\u2019m at it,\u201d she said. \u201cAna wanted to go out for Halloween,\u201d she said softly. \u201cShe wanted all of us to get dressed up like characters from the Wizard of Oz. She was going to be Toto.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds lame when you\u2019re talking about a serial killer in the same breath, huh?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say to that, so he just said goodbye and left.</p><p>She sat there in her bed and listened to his footsteps on the stairs, followed by voices. Adam\u2019s, Genevieve\u2019s, Thor\u2019s...Jed\u2019s. Even Killer woofed his two cents. Finally the front door opened and closed, and then she heard a car start up, drive away. And still she stayed in bed, listening to the sound of silence.</p><p>\u201cAdam, do you think you can help Katherine in any way? Do you think maybe she knows something that can help clear Beau but doesn\u2019t realize it?\u201d Jed asked, meeting the older man\u2019s eyes in the rearview mirror. Thor was next to him, too tall to fit comfortably in the back seat. Jed wasn\u2019t sure he was ever going to believe in ghosts, but he was intrigued by the efficacy of the power of suggestion and hypnosis. He was sure Adam knew that he didn\u2019t believe in the supernatural, but then again, from everything he\u2019d gathered, Adam Harrison never actively tried to convince anyone that the spirit world existed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure how much she could know. She couldn\u2019t have been more than twelve or thirteen when the first set of murders took place. She believes in her brother, blindly, because she loved him. That doesn\u2019t mean she actually knows anything, even subconsciously.\u201d</p><p>When they arrived at the Kidd house, Katherine had obviously been waiting. She walked out to greet them, looking thin and tense, despite her jaunty earrings and her gypsy-style skirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching the news. Lieutenant Tiggs is being interviewed. He just told the reporter that authorities think they\u2019re looking for a copycat killer!\u201d She shook her head in dismay. \u201cHow can they say that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t found any reason to fault Larry Atkins for shooting your brother, Katherine,\u201d Jed explained. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of departmental pressure to keep the story as-is until they know something different. It\u2019s also smart. If you and I are right and we\u2019re still looking for the same killer, he\u2019s more likely to make a mistake if he doesn\u2019t realize they\u2019re on to him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but her attention was already focused on Adam. Her lips trembled suddenly. \u201cI saw my brother last night,\u201d she said. \u201cI really saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d Adam said quietly.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cCan you hypnotize me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help thinking...if I could only remember the night he died, I might think of something we don\u2019t know, something that would help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bring your brother back, you know,\u201d Adam said gently.</p><p>\u201cNothing can bring my brother back. I know that. But I still think there\u2019s something from back then I need to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Adam said after a minute. \u201cLet\u2019s go in, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s one of the boxes of Thanksgiving decorations,\u201d Christina said, pleased. She and Genevieve were down in the basement, where it was cool and pleasant. Her grandmother had always marked boxes clearly, so it was easy enough to find what she was looking for.</p><p>Genevieve laughed. \u201cWhat was your first clue? That great drawing of a turkey, maybe?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMike did that. Mike could always draw,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>\u201cOkay...what else?\u201d Gen asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you grab that box over there, past the pool table? I think it has seasonal serving trays and things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI envy you your basement,\u201d Gen said as she was getting the box in question. \u201cI wish I had one, but with the water table down in the Keys...no way.\u201d</p><p>Upstairs, as they set the boxes down, Christina looked at Genevieve and burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re covered in spiderwebs. I think I have to get down there and really sweep the place out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpiderwebs?\u201d Genevieve said, horrified.</p><p>\u201cNot so jealous of my basement now, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Gen laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t want a bunch of spider bites. I\u2019m going to run up and take a shower. I\u2019ll be back down in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll run over and get Ana, see if she wants to help decorate.\u201d</p><p>Christina cut across Tony\u2019s lawn to reach Ana\u2019s house. At the door, she rang the bell and waited. No one answered, and she started to walk away. Ana often worked weekends, so there was nothing strange about her being gone. But then she thought she heard movement within.</p><p>\u201cAna?\u201d she called.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>She walked around the house. Ana must be home, she thought, because she could hear the television; it was on somewhere in the back of the house.</p><p>\u201cAna?\u201d she shouted, walking toward the back, where she noticed Ana\u2019s car parked. Her friend was clearly home, so why wasn\u2019t she answering the door or responding to her name?</p><p>Christina\u2019s heart suddenly started to pound too swiftly, but she gave herself a mental shake.</p><p>There was no reason to be afraid for Ana. She had dark hair, not red. Other than being a woman, she didn\u2019t resemble any of the murder victims in the least.</p><p>Heart racing, temples pounding, Christina raced to the back door. It wasn\u2019t exactly wide open, but it was ajar.</p><p>She was tempted to go in, then realized that if someone was in there, she had no way to fight, no way to save her friend, who had to be alive. Had to. She needed to get back to her own house as quickly as possible and call the police.</p><p>She raced back across Tony\u2019s lawn to her own house, wondering if she was being watched by a killer. She looked around, searching for signs, then stopped stock still, too stunned to keep moving.</p><p>Dan\u2019s car was there. Not parked in front of Ana\u2019s, but down the street, partially hidden by a large oak tree.</p><p>She felt ill.</p><p>Horrified.</p><p>No. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>She turned to run back to her own house. To reach a phone.</p><p>But as she stood there, the front door of Ana\u2019s house opened and Dan stepped out. He had a piece of paper in his hand, but he didn\u2019t look at it. He just stood there, then crumpled the paper in his fist.</p><p>Even from a distance, she could see the veins stand out in his arm.</p><p>She waited, momentarily frozen, as a chilly October breeze gusted past, drawing her hair across her throat.</p><p>As if in warning.</p><p>She realized that she was partially shielded from Dan\u2019s sight by a large bush, but if she wasn\u2019t careful, he would see her.</p><p>She looked around desperately and tried to figure out where to run for safety.</p><p>Ana\u2019s house?</p><p>Tony\u2019s?</p><p>Her own?</p><p>She made up her mind and ran.</p><p>Adam Harrison didn\u2019t dangle a pendant in front of Katherine\u2019s face and tell her she was getting sleepy. Instead he had her sit in a comfortable chair and close her eyes. Then, in a soothing voice, he described a scene so calm and peaceful that Jed nearly fell asleep himself.</p><p>At last Adam told Katherine that she was a child again, living at home, and though her brother was a cop, with a place of his own, he still came to the house a lot. Sometimes he took her and her friends to a movie or one of the local water parks.</p><p>\u201cBeau is dating a girl named Grace Garcia, Katherine. Do you remember her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s from Ybor City. Her family are cigar makers. They came over from Cuba.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s voice had changed, Jed realized. She actually sounded as if she were thirteen, not the twenty-five he knew she was.</p><p>\u201cSo you knew Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did Beau say about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe liked her. But he was scared when he met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where he met her?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>Katherine smiled. \u201cI know. I know, because I was with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pub.\u201d</p><p>Jed felt his muscles go tense.</p><p>\u201cWhat pub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Reilly\u2019s pub. Lots of people went there. Beau said anybody who was really Irish always went there.\u201d</p><p>Anybody who was really Irish.</p><p>\u201cI can see Beau now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Jed went still. He could have sworn he saw the man himself. Standing by his sister\u2014staring straight at Jed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then the ghost began to speak, and Jed knew he must be losing his mind.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Beau said. \u201cIt all makes sense. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s. It\u2019s in the middle of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell,\u201d Jed said. The damn ghost had seen what they all should have seen.</p> <p>Still staring at Beau, Jed pulled out his phone and punched in Christina\u2019s number.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>He turned and, deserting the others without a thought, ran for the car.</p><p>\u201cJed!\u201d Thor called after him.</p><p>\u201cCall the police. Get Jerry Dwyer over to Christina\u2019s!\u201d Jed shouted over his shoulder.</p> <p>Then he was in his car and driving, a million thoughts filling his head.</p><p>O\u2019Reilly\u2019s.</p><p>The one place all the victims had in common. All the Irish went there. Redheads.</p><p>It was between two highways. Two of the highways where the victims had been found. But before they were murdered, they were abducted and taken to a place where they were held until the killer was ready to strangle them.</p><p>They were lured into the killer\u2019s car. Lured...how? Suddenly it hit him.</p><p>A woman would trust another woman.</p> <p>Christina had been close, so close. He remembered her mocking suggestion that Beau had come back to kill again and was using Katherine to lure his victims. It had been an intentionally ridiculous suggestion. Beau had never killed. And Katherine had never procured a victim.</p><p>The people had been the wrong part of the equation.</p><p>But the equation itself had been right on the money.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve so much more time than I can give you,\u201d her captor said.</p><p>Angie thought that she was going to vomit. She hadn\u2019t eaten, but the gag was choking her. Not to mention the terror that she was feeling.</p><p>She\u2019d lost track of time.</p><p>Was this it? The end?</p><p>\u201cPretty, pretty, pretty,\u201d he said. \u201cSo pretty.\u201d</p> <p>She could tell from the direction of his voice that he was standing above her, but he leaned down then, fingering her hair. She wanted to cry out. She wanted to protest.</p><p>He moved the blindfold, and finally she could see his face. Her stomach lurched. Not because he was so ugly.</p><p>Because he was so fucking ordinary. Who would ever suspect...?</p><p>And then...the woman! Who knew where she was now, but she was as bad as he was.</p><p>The light hurt her eyes, and she blinked. Everything hurt. She was lying on a cold linoleum floor after being tied to a chair.</p><p>And now...</p><p>Banging sounded from somewhere above, and he started suddenly. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d he asked aloud, looking in the direction of the noise. He turned back to her and said, \u201cNot a sound, you hear me? Not a sound.\u201d</p><p>Then he left her lying there and went to investigate.</p><p>Christina ducked onto the side porch. She knocked, but there was no answer, and she thought about calling out, hoping that Tony and Ilona were home and just hadn\u2019t heard the door, but she didn\u2019t want Dan to hear her.</p><p>She still couldn\u2019t believe she was sneaking around her neighbors\u2019 house, hiding from her own cousin. It was ridiculous; there had to be a logical explanation for what she\u2019d seen, but meanwhile, she wasn\u2019t taking any chances.</p><p>The door was locked, so she went over to a window. It was open, and she breathed a sigh of relief. She pushed the screen in and crawled into the house.</p><p>It was almost dark inside. Tony had kept most of his hurricane shutters up, and where there weren\u2019t shutters on the windows, there were drapes.</p><p>It took her eyes a minute to grow accustomed to the dimness. Dust motes seemed to ride the air.</p><p>She started looking for a phone. She seemed to be in the dining room. A quick look around and then into the living room didn\u2019t turn up a phone.</p><p>Maybe in the kitchen.</p><p>She started to turn away, but something on the coffee table caught her attention. A newspaper clipping from the front page of today\u2019s paper reporting on the murders. The article was accompanied by a picture of Beau Kidd and a smaller shot of Angie McDuff.</p><p>As she stared at it, wondering why her neighbors would have decided to save something so unpleasant, she heard Killer barking madly, followed by a loud knocking on the front door and then footsteps moving toward it. She wasn\u2019t sure why she panicked, but she hurried to hide herself behind the couch.</p><p>She saw Tony, wrapped in a bathrobe, stride toward the front door and open it impatiently.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see who was standing there, but then she heard his voice.</p><p>Dan\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tony, I\u2019m a little concerned. Have you seen my cousin? I went to her place, and her car\u2019s there, but she\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry. Haven\u2019t seen her. I worked late last night, and I was just getting some sleep.\u201d</p><p>To Christina\u2019s dismay, Dan stepped into the house.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar, Tony. Her dog is outside going insane. That dog knows where she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here, and I don\u2019t give a damn about a dog.\u201d</p><p>They were moving closer to her location.</p><p>\u201cTony...\u201d Dan began.</p><p>Christina almost screamed. Almost gave herself away. She could see them so clearly now. Could see her cousin produce a wicked-looking knife.</p><p>\u201cI want my cousin now, Tony,\u201d Dan snapped.</p><p>Christina\u2019s house had never seemed so far away, even though Jed was driving as fast as he could.</p><p>Fast enough, as old Seamus McDuff would have said, to run over small children, ducks and nuns. He\u2019d never really understood the point of that particular combination, Jed thought, but it was still a great old expression.</p><p>Where were the sirens? He should be hearing police sirens, dammit.</p><p>He tried Jerry\u2019s number. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d he demanded when Jerry picked up.</p><p>\u201cHell! I can\u2019t go busting into someone\u2019s house just on your say-so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just cause for a warrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m getting one! I\u2019ve got cops almost there, and more ready to bring the warrant, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jed hung up in frustration. The light in front of him was yellow. Then red.</p><p>He stepped on the gas.</p><p>Small children, ducks and nuns.</p><p>Christina turned, considering her options. There was a hall that led to the bedrooms, and there were stairs that led to the basement.</p><p>She heard Tony cry out hoarsely.</p><p>She stared at Dan\u2019s knife.</p><p>Then two men moved down the hall toward the bedrooms. She realized they had a clear line of sight toward the door, and the decision was made for her. She held dead still for a minute, then slipped from hiding and raced down to the basement. At the foot of the stairs, she was stunned to see a naked bulb swinging above a big service sink, illuminating a scene that made her blood run cold.</p><p>The basement was all one big room, the walls half hidden by piles of junk. Old boxes to the left. Golf bags. Racks that held old coats. Rain boots. The buildup of a lifetime. Everything more or less as it should have been. Except...</p><p>She clapped her hand over her mouth to keep from screaming. There was an old mattress in the middle of the floor, and a naked woman lying next to it, staring at her. She was gagged and hog-tied, a blindfold pulled down just below her eyes.</p><p>It was Angie McDuff.</p><p>Christina raced over to her and dropped to her knees. Angie was bound with scarves, not rope, but the bindings were tight and Christina\u2019s fingers were as numb as her mind. She kept looking fearfully toward the stairs. What the hell was going on?</p><p>Dan had pulled out a knife, but Angie was being held captive in Tony\u2019s house.</p><p>And where was Ilona?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t untie the knots, but she saw a pair of garden shears hanging from a hook on the wall and ran over to grab them. In seconds she was back. Angie\u2019s eyes had gone huge, but she kept still while Christina sawed at the knots binding her wrists and ankles, then cut the gag from behind.</p><p>Angie tried to croak out words.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Christina laid her fingers across the other woman\u2019s lips and shook her head wildly. She could hear someone on the stairs. They had to get out.</p><p>She stood and pulled Angie up. After being tied up, Angie couldn\u2019t stand and started to sag, so Christina practically dragged her over to the single window at the back of the basement, where the land outside sloped away.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get it open.</p><p>She grabbed a golf club and smashed the glass completely out of the frame, then heaved Angie up to it and shoved her halfway through. \u201cGet out,\u201d she commanded breathlessly. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Seemingly impervious to the shards of glass, Angie crawled through. Christina was pulling herself up to follow when she felt fingers grab her hair, and she was wrenched away from the window.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>She spun around. Tony was there. He was still in his robe, but it was open, and he was naked beneath it. \u201cBitch!\u201d he repeated as he drew his hand back. A second later his palm landed across her face with such force that she staggered back, seeing stars. She staggered and fell, landing on the mattress.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d she gasped as he walked over to stand looking down at her.</p><p>\u201cYou guys always thought you were so talented, but who\u2019s the best actor now, huh?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe it. He sounded cheerful, friendly.</p><p>\u201cTony, what did you do to Dan?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNot half of what I\u2019m going to do to you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot!\u201d she cried, fighting the wave of sheer terror sweeping over her. \u201cSomeone will be here any minute. Genevieve is going to get out of the shower and realize I\u2019m not there. She\u2019ll call the police, and they\u2019ll find you here.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, totally complacent.</p><p>\u201cSomeone always comes along, but I always win. Beau Kidd came along at just at the right time. I thought I was going to get caught dumping the body, but he got caught instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time you\u2019re dead, Dan\u2019s dead, and I\u2019m here to tell \u2019em how I tried to save you from your cousin.\u201d</p><p>Christina caught her breath. Someone coming up almost silently behind Tony. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ilona. Thank God.</p><p>\u201cIlona, help! Help me, please. He can\u2019t hurt both of us at the same time. Run away and get help!\u201d</p><p>Ilona just stood there.</p> <p>And Tony started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI gotta tell you, it really helps to have a babe when you\u2019re not an adorable seventeen-year-old with his arm in a sling anymore. And Ilona, well, she\u2019s my babe, right, gorgeous?\u201d he said, turning to Ilona.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the scarves,\u201d Ilona said.</p><p>Christina stared at them disbelievingly. This couldn\u2019t be happening. \u201cYou won\u2019t make it this time,\u201d she said harshly. \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe naked woman wandering around outside,\u201d Christina said.</p><p>There were cop cars in front of the house, and cops in the cop cars. But they weren\u2019t doing anything. They were just waiting, unable to go bursting into Tony Lowell\u2019s house without either probable cause or a warrant.</p><p>\u201cNo warrant yet?\u201d Jed demanded, hopping from his vehicle.</p><p>A uniformed officer climbed out of his car, shaking his head.</p><p>Killer was there, Jed realized. The little Jack Russell was at the front door, going insane and throwing himself against it again and again. \u201cKiller!\u201d he shouted, and the dog paused, hearing his voice. He ran forward and picked up the little animal. By that time Genevieve had run over to him, so he thrust the dog into her arms. \u201cTake him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet away from here,\u201d he told her.</p><p>There were tears in Genevieve\u2019s eyes. \u201cThey say they can\u2019t break in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a cop. And he didn\u2019t give a damn if anyone sued him from here to eternity. But before he could break in the door, he gasped.</p><p>A filthy naked woman was staggering around the side of the house toward him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your probable fucking cause!\u201d Jed shouted.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t waiting. The door was locked, so he rammed it with his shoulder, then swore. That was one solid door.</p><p>He rammed it again. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw one of the officers going to help Angie McDuff. At the moment he didn\u2019t give a fig how she happened to be where she was. Alive...He only cared about getting inside and finding Christina.</p> <p>He rammed the door one more time, and the wood finally shattered and gave. He burst into the house. The shadows within were almost smothering after the afternoon light outside. He moved forward, and nearly tripped over something lying on the floor.</p><p>He hunkered down.</p><p>A body.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He felt for a pulse. He found a face, a throat. An Adam\u2019s apple.</p><p>As his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, he began to see more clearly. It was Dan. With a knife sticking out of his rib cage.</p><p>The man could be dying, but Jed had to find out what he knew. Trying to watch out for a sudden attack, he leaned low and placed his ear against Dan\u2019s lips as Dan tried to speak.</p><p>\u201cTony...and...\u201d</p><p>There was a sudden, shrill cry of fury, and someone came racing at him, brandishing a butcher knife and shrieking like a banshee.</p><p>Jed turned just in time and ducked, letting her fly right over him. Then he straddled her, reaching for the knife. As he fought to subdue her, he was stunned to hear a woman\u2019s voice behind him.</p><p>Angie, with a policeman\u2019s jacket over her shoulders, was shouting, \u201cGet down to the basement! Tony has Christina down there.\u201d</p><p>Jed leapt up, and with another shriek, Ilona started to rise.</p><p>She didn\u2019t make it, because Angie kicked her. Hard.</p><p>Jed didn\u2019t wait to see more. He was already searching for the stairs to the basement.</p><p>Tony screamed in rage and leapt, landing on her with all his weight. She struggled to move, but she was pinned by his body, although at least the mattress had helped cushion her when he landed.</p><p>He immediately reached for her throat, but she was able to bring up a knee and slam him hard. When she rolled to escape, though, he twisted his fingers into her hair again and stopped her, so she sent a fist flying backward and caught him in the nose.</p><p>She hoped she\u2019d broken it.</p><p>But he was strong, and he knew how to use his weight to control her, all the while working to get his fingers around her neck. She desperately searched the mattress and as much of the floor as she could reach, seeking the garden shears she\u2019d used to free Angie.</p><p>She found them at last, curled her fingers around them and lifted them to strike.</p><p>But he sensed her intention. He let go of her neck and grabbed for her hand, trying to wrest the shears from her. In a moment he had them, and he raised them over his head...</p><p>She screamed, shrinking as far back against the mattress as she could.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t strike.</p><p>She saw something...someone...move in the shadows behind him.</p><p>Beau Kidd was behind him.</p><p>Before Tony had a chance to strike, Beau wrested the shears away. Tony let out a disbelieving roar of rage as they seemed to fly away from him on their own. If he had any sanity left, it wasn\u2019t apparent as he snarled like an enraged cougar and attacked her again, fingers stretched and grasping, intent on her throat.</p><p>This time he was stopped by a very real and visible force.</p><p>Jed had arrived.</p><p>His face looked like thunder, and he hefted Tony off her as if Tony weighed no more than a two-week-old kitten, then slammed him against the brick wall of the basement.</p><p>With Tony out of commission, Jed dropped to her side, smoothing back her hair, looking at her anxiously. She smiled, unable to speak, and he stood, reaching for her hands, ready to help her to her feet.</p><p>There was thunder on the stairs as a trio of cops came down, two uniforms and, behind them, Jerry Dwyer.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is Lowell?\u201d Jerry demanded.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Jed said, indicating the fallen man with a nod of his head.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Jerry breathed. \u201cHe\u2019d damn sure better not get off on some technicality.\u201d</p><p>Later, Christina was unable to remember exactly what happened next, certainly no more accurately than anyone else.</p><p>Tony Lowell started to laugh and staggered to his feet.</p><p>No one else moved, no one drew a weapon, but the garden shears just picked themselves up and flew right across the basement, embedding themselves in Tony Lowell\u2019s chest.</p><p>With a look of absolute shock, he fell back against the bricks, a massive bloodstain spreading across his chest.</p><p>19</p><p>Christina opened her eyes.</p><p>Everything was as it should be.</p><p>The small porcelain clock\u2014Gran\u2019s favorite, brought over from Ireland\u2014sat on the mantel, the seconds ticking away softly.</p><p>It was dark. True dark. She\u2019d actually forgotten to turn on the night-light before going to bed. Of course, she\u2019d been just a bit involved when day gave way to night, and she hadn\u2019t thought about a light. Quite frankly, she hadn\u2019t thought about anything at all, other than the fact that she was alive, and not just alive, but alive and in the arms of the man she\u2019d adored all her life, who seemed to feel the same way about her.</p><p>She frowned slightly when she realized she was alone in the bed. Where had he gone?</p><p>She sat up and saw that morning was coming. Already the darkness was growing diffuse, so she hugged her knees and watched the day arrive. And as the light filtered in, she saw the man she loved at last.</p><p>He was seated in the overstuffed chair, bare-chested but wearing jeans, and he was just watching her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said in greeting.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you...all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI...went out for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He rose and walked over to the bed. \u201cI was at the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cI went to make my peace with Beau Kidd,\u201d he told her.</p><p>It had been a week since the events next door had nearly cost her her life. It had been a mind-numbing experience for her, and she left it to better-trained minds than her own to make sense of everything that had happened. They\u2019d already pieced together some of the story.</p><p>Tony had started killing young, apparently luring his victims by pretending that he was hurt and needed help. They\u2019d discovered that he had done a lot of traveling after Beau Kidd had been killed for his crimes. The time he had spent in various places coincided with a number of unsolved murders with similar signatures.</p><p>Then he had found Ilona. Someone, according to Angie, who was sicker and even more excited by cruelty than he was himself. Ilona\u2014who at times seemed entirely rational and at others as insane as any Jill the Ripper\u2014had filled in some of the pieces they were missing. Tony had never been a cop or a criminologist. He\u2019d learned to wear gloves and how to hide his tracks because he\u2019d watched television.</p><p>He\u2019d looked like a normal guy, not a monster, Christina thought.</p><p>The guy next door.</p><p>Ilona had tried claiming to be battered, terrified, suffering from every syndrome out there, but Angie had quickly put the lie to that angle.</p><p>Mike had commented to Christina a few days after the horrors had come to an end, when they\u2019d all gathered at O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, that he had seen his ex-wife, and she\u2019d been like a different person, grateful to be alive and certain that only Christina had saved her.</p><p>Dan, who had refused to stay in the hospital more than a night, had actually blushed when he\u2019d explained to her why neither he nor Ana had opened the door. \u201cWe were...well, you know,\u201d he said, gulping his Guinness.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cOh, good God, are you all blind?\u201d Ana exclaimed. \u201cWe were doing it, okay? We\u2019ve had a thing for each other for years, and...\u201d</p><p>She trailed off, and everyone stared at her for a long moment, then burst into laughter.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the only surprise that night. Apparently emboldened by Dan and Ana\u2019s confession, Mike spoke up and said, \u201cI suppose that I ought to confess I have a date scheduled with a certain redhead,\u201d he told them.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Dan demanded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe,\u201d Katherine Kidd announced softly.</p><p>That led to more staring and more laughter, not to mention a lot of teasing, interrupted only by the arrival of their food.</p><p>Genevieve, Thor and Adam had left the next day. Christina had been sorry to see her friends go, but she was comforted by the knowledge that they\u2019d made a date to go diving together the weekend after Halloween.</p> <p>She doubted, however, that she would ever see Adam Harrison again, and she told him she was sorry about that when she slipped into his room to help him pack.</p><p>\u201cYou never know, Christina. You never know. Perhaps one day I\u2019ll call on you to help someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d she said as he smiled, and folded his last shirt. \u201cAt least your time here wasn\u2019t wasted. I really did have a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always had ghosts around you, Christie. You see them when you need to, and they find their way to you when they need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen Beau since...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince you were in Tony\u2019s basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see the papers, though? He was vindicated. That was what he needed. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that Katherine saw him, that she was able to say goodbye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>After that she and Jed had been alone in the big old house, and now there he was, standing beside her bed, watching her.</p> <p>\u201cYou went to Beau Kidd\u2019s grave?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He smiled and sat down next to her. \u201cI think he kept you alive until I got there, and I had to thank him.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and touched his face. \u201cDid you see him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI prayed for him,\u201d he said, and she didn\u2019t push it.</p><p>\u201cCoffee\u2019s on,\u201d he told her, apparently eager to move away from a topic he still had trouble with.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He left the room, and she showered, dressed and went downstairs to the kitchen, where she poured herself some coffee.</p><p>Suddenly she knew he was there, and she turned around. He was in his full dress uniform, looking very handsome. He felt so real when he took her into his arms, and so did the gentle kiss he planted on her forehead.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThank you. You saved my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. But now it\u2019s time for you and Jed to make your own lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to bet he does. You should go to him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t see you again, will I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s time for me to rest in peace, as they say.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and felt tears sting her eyes at the last touch of his hand. She fought them back and headed out to the porch, where she found Jed, his bare chest gleaming as he typed on his laptop beneath the rising sun. A large package lay on a glass-topped wrought-iron table next to him.</p><p>Definitely not an engagement ring, she thought, and smiled, arching her eyebrows in curiosity.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d he said. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>She did, discovering a blue checkered dress and something furry. \u201cWhat...?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged awkwardly. \u201cOkay, I copped out on the lion, I admit, but Dan said he\u2019d do it. You have to be Dorothy, though, because the only way Killer will stay in his basket is if you\u2019re the one carrying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to get together with friends, have fun...do normal things. Really live our lives. I thought we could start with Halloween.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cHow am I doing?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cMagnificently,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then there\u2019s one more thing.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a small box out of his pocket.</p><p>Opened it.</p><p>Held it out to her.</p><p>It was a diamond ring. Beautiful. Marquis cut, in an antique setting.</p><p>She stared at him, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he asked, his tone husky, a little unsure.</p><p>She nodded, offering him her left hand.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d say something,\u201d he murmured, dark eyes meeting hers.</p><p>She smiled, pushed the computer aside and sat on his lap, then found his lips.</p><p>At last, she broke away, breathless. \u201cHow am I doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMagnificently,\u201d he told her. </p> </body></html>"]
