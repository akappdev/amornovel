Goodwin III, Owner.</p> <p>Welcome to Hell would be a more appropriate sign, considering Dad just uprooted me from West Virginia and hauled me to Tennessee two days before senior year.</p><p>My father couldn\u2019t give up this opportunity to work as head groom at a fancy farm that trains horses for the Kentucky Derby and Breeders\u2019 Cup, and I didn\u2019t want to be the evil daughter who stamped her foot and refused to come.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t totally matter, because home is where my dad is. But it still sucks that I had to leave my part-time job exercising horses. It would\u2019ve become a full-time position when I graduated from high school, and now I have to start all over again.</p><p>I punch the code into the alarm box, the heavenly white gates swing open, and I steel myself for the half-mile trek to Hillcrest, the staff quarters. My claustrophobic new home. Hillcrest is attached to the gargantuan white manor house, where a smattering of comfy rocking chairs dot the wraparound porch, waiting for someone to sit down.</p><p>Back in West Virginia, it was just me and Dad and She Who Must Not Be Named living in our trailer. Now we\u2019re sharing quarters with six other staff members and their kids. To escape, I took a walk to downtown Franklin this morning, but I\u2019m cash poor at the moment so there wasn\u2019t much to do besides loiter, and the last thing I need before school starts is to gain a reputation as that weird girl who loiters.</p> <p>So here I am, back in hell, gathering my courage to go talk to the lead trainer about getting some work as an exercise rider so I can cease being cash poor. I used to exercise racehorses at the track and casino in Charles Town. But that was at a totally different level\u2014the horses I rode there were like driving a Ford and here they are like Ferraris. Hell, the Queen of England stables her horses thirty minutes away.</p><p>What if the trainer thinks I\u2019m unqualified? Or a hack? I\u2019ve been riding since I was four, but still. Just go talk to him, Savannah! The worst he can say is no...and then I can go back to loitering. I inhale then let out the deep breath I\u2019ve been holding and take in the scent of cornbread, fresh laundry, dirt, cedar trees, and of course, horseshit.</p><p>I can do this.</p><p>I charge down the driveway and suddenly a wailing, high-pitched alarm goes off. My first thought is: Tornado! But the skies are as blue as a robin\u2019s egg. Seconds later I see a brown and white blur streaking across the grass. A racer. Two guys on ponies are chasing it. He must have escaped!</p><p>I sprint toward the horse as he zigzags my way. The horse seems curious. But not curious enough to slow down. He zips past me as I yell \u201cStop!\u201d and take off after him. The horse circles back around. I hold a hand up. \u201cWhoa, there.\u201d</p><p>The horse slows to a jog, studying me, his expression both wary and nosy. Then he charges me. I reach out and snatch his bridle. With a firm grip, I thrust him away from me, showing him who\u2019s boss. That\u2019s when I discover he\u2019s wearing a saddle.</p> <p>\u201cDid you throw your rider?\u201d Suddenly he rears up and kicks his feet. When he returns to all fours, I get up in his face again. \u201cWhoa!\u201d He cowers, bowing his head.</p><p>One time a horseman told me I have a way with horses. Dad told me not to listen when men say things like that because they\u2019re just trying to get into my pants. But I do have a way with horses. Dad, however, does not have a way with words.</p><p>I confirm the horse is a boy then gently slap his neck, checking the engraving on his bridle. Tennessee Star is his name.</p><p>\u201cYou sure are fast,\u201d I tell the young horse, petting his nose. He\u2019s beautiful\u2014a light brown chestnut with white markings. A Ferrari. I never rode such a well-made colt in Charles Town.</p><p>Then, from the fields beyond the manor house, a guy comes riding up on a horse. I don\u2019t take my eyes off that rider, even when Tennessee Star tries to yank away.</p><p>I haven\u2019t met the owner\u2019s son yet, but I\u2019ve seen him riding around like he\u2019s king of the place. Which is technically his title, I guess. When we arrived two days ago, Mr. Goodwin\u2019s chief of staff told me the Goodwin family is fiercely private and that non-housekeeping staff aren\u2019t allowed inside the manor. We were instructed to keep our distance from the Goodwins. Since I don\u2019t want Dad to get fired on day three, I haven\u2019t spoken to the boy.</p><p>Still, he\u2019s beautiful. I should start a magazine called GQ Cowboy, and he could be the cover model every month. Wavy hair the color of straw curls out from under his cowboy hat. His snowy white button-down shirt is spotless and pressed, tucked into his jeans, the arms rolled up to his elbows. The three coonhounds that always seem to follow him around bound up and sniff my jeans.</p><p>Last night a giggling maid told me his name: Jack Goodwin. And he\u2019s seventeen, like me. He attends Hundred Oaks High, the school I\u2019m starting on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cStar!\u201d Jack says, dismounting fluidly. \u201cYou\u2019re too smart, you know that?\u201d he scolds the horse, then grabs the bridle as I let go. Two farmhands jog up on ponies and Jack wordlessly hands Star off to one of them, slapping the horse\u2019s flank before they lead him away.</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t love that horse so much, I\u2019d send him to drag a tourist carriage in New York City,\u201d Jack says in a deep Tennessee drawl. \u201cThat\u2019d teach him not to buck his rider and run off.\u201d</p><p>Once he confirms he has a good grasp on his stallion\u2019s reins, Jack turns to me. His blue eyes widen and a bright smile spreads across his face.</p><p>\u201cThanks for catching Star. That was insane how you cornered him with no corner. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what can I do you for?\u201d He tips his cowboy hat in an exaggerated manner and smiles again, revealing perfectly straight white teeth. Behind closed lips, I run my tongue over my slightly crooked front ones. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit late for the tour. They\u2019re at eight a.m. and it\u2019s nearly noon now.\u201d</p><p>He thinks I\u2019m here for the tour?</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I say, starting to explain, but then he unleashes his megawatt smile. It makes my throat close up and my heart pounds even harder. This guy is hot, but I don\u2019t like boys who get whatever they want without trying. I worked damned hard to get my part-time exercise rider job back in Charles Town. Just like I\u2019ll work damned hard to get a position here.</p><p>\u201cSoo...\u201d Jack says, stroking the stallion\u2019s mane. \u201cDo you want a private tour? You know, to say thanks for catching my horse?\u201d</p><p>A private tour? Like, me and Jack alone? Dad would kill me for breaking the Goodwins\u2019 privacy rules. Besides, hanging around people like Jack is not my thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here for a tour. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Mom was hosting guests this weekend,\u201d Jack says. \u201cI hope she\u2019s not having another fashion show for charity, because I barely survived the last one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t met.\u201d</p><p>He thrusts a hand out, grinning. \u201cI know. I\u2019d have remembered you. I\u2019m Jack Goodwin.\u201d</p><p>I shake his hand quickly. \u201cSavannah.\u201d What a player. \u201cI gotta get up to the house.\u201d</p><p>I stalk off and Jack hustles after me. \u201cWait! I\u2019ll escort you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019ll escort me? How primitive.</p><p>The horse makes clickety-clack sounds on the pavement. It\u2019s a young stallion\u2014probably no older than five\u2014and he\u2019s sprinkled with white and black, like Rocky Road. I can\u2019t resist touching his nose. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my bro, Wrigley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister tells me I\u2019m an idiot around girls.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the biggest bunch of bull I\u2019ve ever heard. I can sense the cocky confidence radiating off his tanned skin.</p><p>\u201cSo why did Star run away?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cTwo baby raccoons climbed a fence at the track. One of the hands managed to chase them away, but not before a bunch of the colts and fillies started screaming. I think that\u2019s why Star took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d Anything will scare horses when they\u2019re young. Especially if they\u2019re Thoroughbreds. Dad says they\u2019re crazy because of inbreeding. Thoroughbred bloodlines are worse than the royal families of Europe.</p><p>When we reach the top of the hill, the racetracks and barns come into full view.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Jack says, glancing over at me.</p><p>Exercise boys are riding around both practice tracks. A field of haystacks sits beyond the tracks, and a garden full of sunflowers and vegetables lies between the tracks and the manor house. The biggest of the six barns is larger than a Walmart. The barn Dad worked at in West Virginia is a shack by comparison.</p><p>Wrigley starts sniffing my hair and nuzzles his face against mine.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Jack says. \u201cWrigley doesn\u2019t like anybody but me. My father hasn\u2019t raced him yet \u2019cause he\u2019s too stubborn and mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just lazy and doesn\u2019t want to race.\u201d I kiss the horse\u2019s muzzle. \u201cAnd being stubborn is his way of getting out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad lets you keep Wrigley even if he can\u2019t race?\u201d Caring for a Thoroughbred for one year costs more than a new pickup truck.</p><p>Jack pats the horse\u2019s neck. \u201cI love him\u2014and I believe we can train him. You\u2019re really good with horses. Does your dad own a farm?\u201d</p><p>I laugh again. \u201cMe? Own a farm?\u201d Wrigley pushes against me and nickers. He\u2019s saying hello. \u201cHello,\u201d I say back.</p><p>\u201cWrigley,\u201d Jack says, securing the lead around his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to be so forward.\u201d</p><p>I kiss the horse again. \u201cYou\u2019re such a pretty boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jack says, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to the horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. My bro Wrigley is nothing compared to me. Right, bro?\u201d He slaps Wrigley\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cIs Jack always such an ass?\u201d I ask the horse. I can\u2019t believe I said that. I feel my face turning the color of strawberry ice cream, but Jack just laughs and keeps on beaming. I better watch my mouth before the Goodwins boot me right on out of here.</p><p>I reach into my back pocket to grab a sucker\u2014an orange one. You know how some people take antianxiety meds? Well, I eat candy. I rip off the crinkly wrapper and stick the sucker in my mouth. Instant relief.</p><p>I peek up at Jack\u2019s blue eyes. He\u2019s nicer than I figured he\u2019d be. And he has a sense of humor too.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jack asks with this shit-eating grin on his face. \u201cDid you come with Senator Ralston to meet with my father today? Are you related to him?\u201d</p><p>Me? Related to a senator? I look down at my holey jeans, boots, and tight black T-shirt. I\u2019m about to fess up that I\u2019ve just moved into the Hillcrest dungeons and therefore he and I can never speak because his family values their privacy when a man storms out of the house and up the hill to us.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d The man is dressed exactly like him\u2014pressed shirt, dark jeans, and cowboy boots. \u201cAbby Winchester has called the house eight times since breakfast looking for you and I\u2019m about to smash the phone against the wall.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eight times? Stalk-er, I sing in my head.</p><p>Jack keeps a firm hand on Wrigley\u2019s lead and lets out a long breath. \u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin goes on, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering your cell\u2014\u201d He stops. Takes one look at my red hair, freckled skin, and short, jockey-sized body, and then his eyes grow wide. \u201cAre you Danny Barrow\u2019s kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Savannah Barrow.\u201d</p> <p>Jack furrows his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re the new groom\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin drags a hand through his hair. \u201cCan I see you in my office, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Savannah, can I catch up with you later? Maybe we could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. Now,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says.</p><p>Jack ties Wrigley to a hitching post, his voice changing from casual to super serious. \u201cNice to meet you, Savannah. If you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d Then he disappears inside the house with his father and the three hounds at his ankles.</p> <p>I gently pat Wrigley\u2019s muzzle, as I stare up at the white manor house.</p><p>Now that Jack knows who I really am, the groom\u2019s daughter, he doesn\u2019t even give me a second glance.</p><p>Figures.</p><p>The Tryout</p><p>On my way to Hillcrest to retrieve my riding gear, I skirt the stone wall that doubles as a fence bordering the property. Mom once told me, \u201cThey call them slave walls.\u201d It had embarrassed me to hear Mom say something so un-PC, but when I confronted her, she said, \u201cWe can ignore history or we can learn from it. I choose to learn from it.\u201d</p><p>What I wouldn\u2019t give to hear her voice now.</p> <p>She died when I was eleven after having been diagnosed with breast cancer the year before. It was stage four by the time the doctors caught it, but Mom fought hard. We didn\u2019t have insurance, so we couldn\u2019t afford the medical bills that skyrocketed to over $200K. Then Mom was suddenly buried...and Dad was buried under a mountain of debt. And without her, my whole world fell apart.</p><p>Dad worked as a groom for a wealthy horseman who was more interested in gambling than the racehorses themselves. Mr. Cates didn\u2019t give a crap that his employees didn\u2019t have insurance, and he worked his horses into the ground, racing them when they were injured with stress fractures or worse.</p><p>Shortly after my mother died, Dad said he needed my help with a sad mare named Moonshadow, who had been lethargic ever since her first foal had been weaned. Mr. Cates didn\u2019t care that the horse was sad, but I did. I told my dad I would help her feel better again.</p><p>I rubbed the mare\u2019s nose and searched her eyes. \u201cI know how it feels to lose somebody too.\u201d</p><p>I started riding Moonshadow nearly every day, and she taught me just how great at riding I am. She made me feel proud of myself. As soon as I got to know her, I told her all my secrets.</p><p>The first one?</p><p>\u201cI love my dad, but I\u2019m never gonna end up working for minimum wage like him. I want more.\u201d</p><p>Back in Charles Town, Dad spent 99 percent of his time in the barns, and coming to Tennessee hasn\u2019t changed that habit one bit. So I figure he must be in Greenbriar, where the Goodwins\u2019 best horses live. It\u2019s the fanciest barn I\u2019ve ever seen; it has a digital contraption that keeps flies and mosquitoes at bay and classical music plays 24/7. I don\u2019t even have an iPod, for crying out loud.</p> <p>After grabbing my riding gear from Hillcrest, I tramp through mud on my way to Greenbriar, passing by two of the smaller barns. The Goodwins own about forty horses, but they have enough barn space to house over 1,200. Apparently they make a lot of their money renting stalls (studio apartments for horses) to Thoroughbred owners who use the Goodwin practice tracks to get ready for the real races on weekends. Mr. Goodwin keeps plenty of people on staff\u2014veterinarians, farriers (blacksmiths) to fix horseshoes, farmers to work the hay, tons of grooms and exercise riders, and stall managers.</p><p>I arrive in front of Greenbriar to find Dad and a bunch of guys sitting in lawn chairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat a bunch of lazy asses.\u201d</p><p>Dad jumps to his feet as the other guys laugh at me. \u201cIt\u2019s break time.\u201d He draws me into his arms for a hug. I bury my nose in his shirt, inhaling his earthy smell of grass and leather and hay. My dad\u2019s only thirty-six, and his height makes him look even younger.</p><p>When I pull away, I bounce on my tiptoes, scanning the group. \u201cIs Gael around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGael? What do you need him for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to him about riding\u2014\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when this douche of a jockey comes strutting out of Greenbriar. Bryant Townsend is 5\u20191\u201d\u2014an inch taller than me, but I could take him.</p><p>\u201cForget the horse, Barrow. Come ride a cowboy,\u201d he says, making rude gestures with his pelvis. What an ass. Dad looks like he might kill Bryant, but I hold him back\u2014I can handle myself.</p><p>\u201cTell me when you see a real cowboy and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooooooh,\u201d the guys say, laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all fired,\u201d Dad says. He waves an arm at the guys, and they go back to talking horses and trucks, ignoring my father.</p><p>\u201cWow, what a great help you are, Dad.\u201d He gives me a noogie, and I duck away. \u201cNot the hair!\u201d It takes forever to bind my red curls in a French braid.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t surprise me that Dad fits right in here. He\u2019s a good head groom\u2014he knows when to be strict, but most of the time he\u2019s relaxed, which keeps his staff relaxed, which ultimately keeps the horses calm. And he knows more about horses than anyone I know. I completely understand why Mr. Goodwin snatched him away from Charles Town.</p><p>\u201cSo how about some lunch?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me find Gael first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t waste his time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I can get a job here, Dad?\u201d</p><p>He inclines his head, smiling slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a try, I guess. But don\u2019t get your hopes up. They got some of the best exercise boys I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Exercise riders make $10 per horse per day giving super-fast horses their daily workouts. It\u2019s way above minimum wage. If I can make more money by riding horses, I can make a better life for myself than working in a motel or gas station after high school.</p><p>So watch out Cedar Hill\u2014here I come.</p><p>We find Gael in the Greenbriar pasture, inspecting a yearling\u2019s hoof. Dad told me he\u2019s a former jockey from Spain. He\u2019s tiny, but he could still beat the crap out of most guys on this farm.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, Barrow?\u201d Gael asks Dad, flashing a glance at me.</p><p>\u201cI want to be an exercise rider,\u201d I reply, pulling my gloves out of my back pocket. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying out today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d Gael asks.</p><p>\u201cSays me.\u201d</p><p>Dad shakes his head at the blue sky. \u201cGenerally you ask for a job interview, Shortcake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing an exercise rider is dangerous,\u201d Gael says. \u201cJust last month one died in Arizona after being thrown from a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always careful.\u201d I hold up my protective vest and helmet. \u201cAnd I have plenty of experience from working at the Charles Town Races in West Virginia.\u201d</p><p>Gael\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cGood for you, drama mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just call me drama mama?\u201d</p><p>Gael ignores me. \u201cCharles Town is a Grade 2 track. Those horses aren\u2019t the fastest, craziest horses in the world. That\u2019s what we got here. This is the big show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet riding a Goodwin horse is safer than the ones I used to ride. It\u2019s only truly dangerous to ride injured or weak horses, and you know the Goodwins have the best horses.\u201d</p><p>Gael gives my dad a grin. \u201cShe knows her shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she knows her shit. She\u2019s a Barrow.\u201d Dad squeezes my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMay I try out? Sir?\u201d</p><p>Dad gives me a nod, proud I remembered to ask for the job interview this time.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Gael says. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not my decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, please,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his call either,\u201d Gael says.</p><p>\u201cBut the lead trainer always makes decisions when it comes to training horses. So whose decision is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>I twirl around to find Jack Goodwin. He adjusts his cowboy hat and shoves his hands in his pockets, swaggering toward me with his hounds.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask Dad and Gael.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard?\u201d Jack uses his super serious voice, like when he discovered who I really am. \u201cI\u2019m running the farm this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re running the farm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of his father\u2019s tests to get him ready to run the farm one day,\u201d Gael mutters to me. \u201cHe made Jack learn to drive a truck when he was ten. And he started drawing up stud fee contracts when he was twelve.\u201d</p><p>Hell, I\u2019m happy I passed algebra II last year. And he has to run a farm?</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to school too?\u201d I ask Jack. \u201cSenior year isn\u2019t gonna be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it done.\u201d</p><p>Talk about a busy schedule. Can he go to school, run the farm, sleep, and be stalked by this Abby Winchester girl all at once?</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with me getting a tryout?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cJack wants me to clear all decisions with him,\u201d Gael says, not sounding at all perturbed he has to take orders from a seventeen-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s up to him if you get one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I try out? Sir?\u201d</p><p>A tiny smirk appears on Jack\u2019s face. \u201cWhat are your qualifications?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. I\u2019ve been riding since I was four years old. I was an exercise rider at Charles Town Races. And oh yeah, I caught Star on foot this morning. Remember that?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s smirk erupts into a full-blown grin.</p><p>\u201cYou caught Tennessee Star on foot?\u201d Dad exclaims.</p><p>Gael looks from me to Jack. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust \u2019cause she caught Star once doesn\u2019t mean she could handle him on the track,\u201d Jack says, staring me down. \u201cYou want a job as an exercise rider? Then I want to see you ride Star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dad says. \u201cHe bucks all his riders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, please? I\u2019ve been riding for thirteen years. You know I can do this!\u201d</p><p>Dad throws his head back. \u201cCould she at least ride another horse besides Star?\u201d</p><p>Jack thinks for a sec. \u201cLet\u2019s see her ride Mystic Minerva. But I reserve the right to see her ride Star before I make a decision.\u201d</p><p>Why is he so interested in me riding Star?</p><p>Dad snaps and points at a tall groom with a mess of floppy brown hair who\u2019s been eavesdropping. \u201cGet Minerva saddled up, Whitfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTownsend,\u201d Gael barks. \u201cGet on Lucky Strikes and take him around the track a few times. I want you to show Savannah how the tryout will work.\u201d Townsend goes with another groom to get Lucky Strikes out of his stall.</p><p>While waiting, Jack squats and scratches his dogs\u2019 ears, muttering to them, \u201cYou stinky dogs, you. You\u2019re handsome devils, and, Athena, you\u2019re a beautiful girl. Give me a kiss.\u201d The dog licks and slobbers on his face. He peeks up at me a few times, but I tighten my gloves and pretend not to notice him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Several minutes later, the groom named Whitfield reappears with Minerva. She\u2019s a chestnut, about sixteen hands high, and might be the most beautiful horse I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a great horse,\u201d Whitfield says. \u201cShe\u2019s raced in fifty-three races. She\u2019s won eleven, and placed or shown in thirty-five.\u201d</p><p>She bends down to scratch her nose on her knee.</p><p>\u201cCome on, pretty girl,\u201d I whisper to her. \u201cHelp me through this.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m standing in the clocker\u2019s tower with Gael, Dad, and Jack, watching Bryant Townsend breeze around the track atop Lucky Strikes, one of Mr. Goodwin\u2019s prized horses. The stallion won the Preakness three years ago.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s complete shit, Townsend! Complete shit! You can do better than that!\u201d Gael is five feet tall, but when he yells, he might as well be the Hulk.</p><p>Townsend finishes seven furlongs (nearly a mile) in 1:35. That\u2019s insanely fast. It\u2019s like he was riding a rocket, not a Thoroughbred.</p><p>And Gael thinks that\u2019s complete shit?</p><p>Townsend may never learn how to talk to a girl, but he knows what he\u2019s doing on the racetrack. I take a deep, rattled breath and tighten my gloves. I can do this.</p> <p>Gael turns to me and claps. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>I jog over to Minerva. The mare smells of sweat and liniment, and she seems relaxed, flicking her ears at me. I secure my helmet, goggles, and vest before getting a leg up from the groom to mount.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Whitfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Rory,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a girl\u2019s name,\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cAnd being an exercise boy is a man\u2019s job,\u201d Rory snaps back. We smile at each other.</p> <p>Weaving the reins between my pinky and ring fingers, I squeeze her flanks with both heels to get her moving. I follow the horse\u2019s movements, posting on her back, flowing with her body. Minerva knows racing is what she\u2019s all about\u2014her graceful gait is measured and sure-footed. Heck, Minerva could probably train exercise riders herself, she\u2019s such a professional.</p><p>If I get the job, I wouldn\u2019t be the first female exercise rider at Cedar Hill\u2014Dad told me two other women in their twenties work here every day, but I\u2019m still enough of a novelty that a lot of the staff have stopped working to watch.</p><p>I steer Minerva out onto the track and wait for Gael\u2019s signal. He raises a hand and I use my outside leg to urge Minerva into a canter, warming her up over the course of a lap. The sound of her hooves relaxes my muscles and the trip is so smooth I feel like I\u2019m riding a surfboard over gentle ocean waves.</p><p>When I pass the clocker\u2019s tower for the second time, I take off and we fly around the track. At the first turn, I urge the horse faster and into a breeze.</p><p>\u201cGood job, girl!\u201d I yell, as dirt splatters onto my goggles and face.</p><p>On the final turn, Minerva jerks her head to the side and I have to hold on to her reins as tight as I can, making sure she doesn\u2019t ride off the track and straight into the wild blue yonder. Getting her back under control makes us slow down and adds seconds onto my time. God. Do Jack and Gael think I\u2019m complete shit?</p><p>As I cross the finish line, I pump my fist and whoop, glad I\u2019ve shown what I can do. Even if I don\u2019t get the job, I tried my damned hardest. I pat Minerva\u2019s neck and brush her hair, whispering how beautiful she is as she whinnies and slows to a canter.</p><p>After cooling down, I dismount, wipe the dirt off my face, hand the horse off to Rory, and go face the music.</p> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the story?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say she\u2019s got what it takes to start working,\u201d Gael says, cleaning his sunglasses on his shirt. \u201cWhat do you say we get her started on Monday, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack says, and my heart plummets to the ground. \u201cShe\u2019s not starting on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>A sly grin sweeps across his face. \u201cNo. I want you to start tomorrow, at River Downs in Cincinnati.\u201d He turns to face Gael and my father. \u201cShe\u2019ll warm up Star before the race. Then I\u2019ll decide if she gets the job or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Dad starts, until Jack raises a hand.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll wear a helmet and vest, and I know she\u2019ll take every precaution to keep herself safe. She says she\u2019s been around horses her whole life\u2014let\u2019s see if she\u2019s ready for the next level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not ready to ride Star,\u201d Dad says. \u201cThat horse doesn\u2019t want anybody riding him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe handled him well today,\u201d Jack says. \u201cShe kept him calm, which none of the rest of us seem to know how to do. That\u2019s what he needs most before a race. And if the horse ends up liking her, then I want her taking care of him. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s not the kind of guy to take orders from teenage boys, but Jack moves and speaks with authority. Dad nods once.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say to them, bouncing on my toes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d Jack says. \u201cJust figure out how to keep Star calm. He needs a win bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhem.\u201d We all turn to find Mr. Goodwin standing there with an eyebrow raised. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was happy hour already.\u201d</p><p>Jack steps up to his father. \u201cI might hire Savannah as an exercise rider.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin stares me down. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had an excellent tryout, and like I told you earlier, she caught Star on foot. Maybe she can figure out how to handle him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavannah might be a good hand in the barns. It\u2019s probably best to assign her there,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says, and I shake my head quickly. I can\u2019t lose this opportunity! I can\u2019t get stuck working a crappy job after I graduate high school.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to shore up my investment with Star,\u201d Jack tells his father in a strong voice. \u201cIf your exercise boys can\u2019t control him, I\u2019ll find one who will.\u201d</p><p>A smile begins to form on Mr. Goodwin\u2019s face. \u201cAll right then,\u201d he says and claps Jack on the back. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk after Star\u2019s race tomorrow,\u201d Jack tells me.</p><p>I jump into my dad\u2019s arms and hug him hard. \u201cPlease let me do this. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>I pull away from Dad to find Jack smiling at me with no evidence of a smirk. Mr. Goodwin sees his son\u2019s smile too, and his expression grows darker. \u201cJack, shouldn\u2019t you be hitching the trailer so you can take Strawberry Fields to Kentucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you call Abby Winchester?\u201d</p><p>Jack rubs the back of his neck. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Jack walks off with his father, not looking back. Even though he\u2019s supposedly the acting owner, it seems that Jack isn\u2019t completely in charge of everything.</p><p>Does his father control his every move?</p><p>There\u2019s No Place Like Home...Sort Of</p><p>After my tryout, Dad opens the door to Hillcrest. It\u2019s the middle of the day on a Saturday, so many of the maids, cooks, gardeners, and horsemen are hard at work. Still, a few people are watching TV or reading the paper in the large common area, which is filled with comfy couches and squishy chairs. Two younger boys are huddled together over a comic book. Fifteen people live in Hillcrest, hence my sudden-onset claustrophobia.</p><p>The second I cross into the kitchen, She Who Must Not Be Named is all over me, Mom-style. Must be the hormones. Cindy hugs me long and hard, and I get a whiff of apple shampoo. Her new blue maid\u2019s uniform stretches over her rounded stomach; my little brother or sister is growing in there.</p><p>She\u2019s nearly five months pregnant. Dad was really apologetic and embarrassed this happened, considering it\u2019s just gonna make things harder on us. He stayed single until about a year and a half ago when he started seeing Cindy, who\u2019s twenty-eight. She\u2019s nice enough, I guess, but I don\u2019t think of her as my mom.</p><p>I\u2019m still pissed she got pregnant\u2014it\u2019s not like they\u2019re married...or that we have the money for this. In a way, it\u2019s a good thing we left West Virginia, because at least here we get free housing. Maybe now Dad will have more money to spend on baby clothes and insurance and stuff. I may not like the situation, but I sure want the kid to have a better life than I did growing up.</p><p>Cindy brings my hand to her stomach. \u201cHe\u2019s real active today.\u201d I can\u2019t help but smile when I feel the baby moving.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say. \u201cIf it\u2019s a boy, we should name him Hercules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not naming the baby Hercules,\u201d Cindy says.</p><p>\u201cHow about Zeus then?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a name Jack Goodwin would give one of his hounds,\u201d Cindy replies. \u201cI heard one of his dogs is named Athena and one is Thor. He also let his little sister name one of his dogs Jasper, after the Twilight character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should name the baby Yvonne,\u201d Yvonne says, sewing a man\u2019s shirt at the table. The Goodwins\u2019 Laundry Dictator wears her gray hair in a bun and her maid\u2019s uniform miraculously doesn\u2019t have a single wrinkle. She glances up, sees my clothes are splattered with dirt, and leaps to her feet as if she\u2019s twenty years old, not sixty.</p><p>\u201cGet those clothes off, girl. Gotta get them in the wash before a stain sets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I can do\u2014\u201d I start to say, but Yvonne gives me a death glare.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare go near my laundry room.\u201d I smile at the thought of Yvonne standing in front of a laundry room door, holding a battle axe, ready to fight off any intruders who want to do a load of whites.</p><p>\u201cI know how to wash my own clothes,\u201d I say.</p><p>Yvonne wags a finger in my face. \u201cOne time I found Mr. Goodwin in my laundry room teaching Master Jack how to wash colors, and after I got done yelling at those boys, they looked like I\u2019d caught one of them doing the nasty in the backseat of a car. They probably wished I\u2019d caught them doing that.\u201d She grumbles, \u201cMr. Goodwin claimed he was trying to teach Jack an \u2018essential life lesson.\u2019 Sheesh!\u201d</p><p>Dad cracks up. \u201cDoing the nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d I say. I never want to hear my dad say \u201cdoing the nasty\u201d again.</p><p>\u201cThe moral of the story is stay out of my laundry room,\u201d Yvonne goes on.</p><p>\u201cBut laundry is an essential life lesson,\u201d I say.</p><p>Dad laughs, biting his knuckle. \u201cDoing the nasty.\u201d</p><p>Yvonne wags her finger at me. \u201cYou let me handle the laundry and you go eat a ham sandwich.\u201d She points her finger at Dad. \u201cDanny, you see the bones on your girl? She looks like she\u2019s never eaten before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wants lunch?\u201d Cindy interrupts, as a grumbling Yvonne returns to sewing the shirt. It looks soft. Is it Jack\u2019s? I bet it would reach my knees if I slipped it on. God, I\u2019ve become a laundry stalker.</p><p>Cindy brings sandwiches, chicken salad, and cookies to the table. Cindy takes a dainty bite of sandwich, looking nauseous. Her pregnancy has been awful; it\u2019s hard for her to keep food down. \u201cWhat\u2019d you find in town, Shortcake?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wince then quickly force a smile. Like Dad, Mom always called me Strawberry Shortcake because of my hair color, and it annoys me every time Cindy calls me by my nickname. It belongs to my parents.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an arcade called the Fun Tunnel that has tons of skee ball lanes. I found lots of places to eat. I saw the school, Hundred Oaks. Looks pretty nice. But it\u2019s like five miles from here\u2014I\u2019ll have to take the bus to school. I wish I had a bike.\u201d</p><p>Dad and Cindy glance at each other. I can see the gears turning in their heads. We can\u2019t afford a bike, and we all know it.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Jack Goodwin earlier,\u201d I say. \u201cHe seems pretty down to earth.\u201d</p> <p>Dad and Cindy glance at each other again. I swear, did they develop ESP or something?</p><p>She taps her fork on her plate. \u201cShortcake, I don\u2019t think spending time with Jack is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know. The Goodwins place a high premium on their privacy.\u201d</p><p>Cindy shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that...he sneaks girls into his room. The other maids say they never see the same girl twice. You\u2019re too good for him.\u201d</p><p>I snort. What a silly thing to say. I\u2019m too good for a millionaire horse farm owner? Whatever. Besides, the first thing I discovered when I got here is that the household staff lives for gossip. They exaggerate everything.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Jack doesn\u2019t have a revolving door to his bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Yvonne tightens her thread and loops the needle through the cuff. \u201cI heard from the gardener that Master Jack gave Candy Roxanne, that harlot of a country music singer, a tour of Mrs. Goodwin\u2019s rose gardens. And apparently one thing led to another and he was picking thorns out of his\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYvonne,\u201d Dad says, his voice laced with warnings. He pats my hand. \u201cYou know Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin want us to keep our distance. I can\u2019t afford any problems with my new job. Not with a baby on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it, I got it.\u201d</p><p>Dad takes a bite of chicken salad. A piece gets stuck to his mouth, and Cindy leans across the table to sweep it away with her napkin. He gives her a quick kiss. Oh gag me.</p><p>Deep down I wish I had someone who would adore me like that. Back in West Virginia, I dated occasionally and fooled around with this guy Adam sometimes on weekends, but I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend-boyfriend. Maybe this\u2019ll be the year I finally get one.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help but think about how Jack treated me when he thought I was here with a senator. He flirted, he asked questions, he smiled at me. It felt effortless...but he wouldn\u2019t have flirted if he\u2019d known who I was.</p><p>After I finish my sandwich, I head to Greenbriar to find Star. I should get to know the horse before warming him up tomorrow morning.</p><p>I jog past the mud pile where the farmhands burn manure and make it into fertilizer. Dad told me Mr. Goodwin sells it to soup companies; they use the fertilizer to grow mushrooms. Remind me never to eat creamy mushroom soup again.</p><p>The large wooden doors are wide open as I charge through a flock of birds mooching grain, and the intoxicating smell of hay and horse and manure hits me in the face. Sunlight fills the cool barn, warming me like a good hug.</p><p>I find Rory Whitfield grooming Star. He rubs the colt\u2019s nose then uses a soft brush to smooth his face. Rory is cute, but not my type. He\u2019s taller and lankier than Jack and hasn\u2019t fully filled out his frame yet.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say.</p><p>He gives me a grin. \u201cHay is for horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I thought you might be cool. But with lines like that...\u201d Rory laughs at my expression. \u201cSo you\u2019re a groom here?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cPart-time. I\u2019m still in school. I\u2019m a senior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Starting Hundred Oaks on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I go,\u201d he says.</p><p>Rory steps away from Star to chat with me, and I find he\u2019s real easy to get along with, just like the guys in the barn I used to work at. Turns out that Whitfield Farms is right up the road from Cedar Hill. He has two parents, three brothers, and a barnyard full of animals. Like Cedar Hill, Whitfield Farms has been around since the Civil War, but instead of horses, they raise cows and breed dogs. In fact, Jack bought his three hounds from Rory\u2019s father a few years ago.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you work here if you got your own farm?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t meet my eyes. \u201cDemand for dairy has gone down, so my parents aren\u2019t really forthcoming with an allowance. I gotta work here if I want cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get you. That\u2019s why I want the exercise boy job.\u201d</p><p>Rory swivels to grab a different brush, breaking the cardinal rule of Horse 101: never turn your back on a horse. Star takes advantage of the situation and nudges Rory\u2019s shoulder, shoving him toward the stall door. Then the colt lies down on the floor and rolls back and forth across his straw bed like a puppy. What a prankster.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cGood one, Star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, boy,\u201d Rory says. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>The horse scrambles to his feet then trots around his stall. He\u2019s definitely a Thoroughbred: lots of energy with a dash of crazy. I love his goofy personality. Star walks over to me. He\u2019s long and sleek. Not an ounce of fat on him.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Rory says. \u201cHe\u2019s been biting.\u201d</p><p>Star rests his chin on my shoulder and I rub his neck. He smells super musky, which leads me to believe the grooms are having a hard time keeping him clean. He must act up during his baths. Rory grabs a shovel, scoops up Star\u2019s manure, then charges past me to dump it in a wheelbarrow.</p><p>\u201cYou are a handsome boy,\u201d I tell Star. He sniffs my hands and snorts and tries to bite my arm. I rip it away just in time. Thoroughbred racehorses aren\u2019t pets. They bite like sharks.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say.</p><p>Star looks me in the eye and I stare right back, daring him to defy me again. The staring contest goes on for over a minute. I wonder if he\u2019s looking into my soul, finding something I don\u2019t know about. Pain roars through me when I think of Moonshadow and how frightened I am to get close to another horse, considering what happened to her. Finally Star breaks eye contact, leans forward, and nips at my hair, nickering.</p><p>\u201cI win,\u201d I tell him, scratching his face. He likes that.</p><p>I help give him a bath and check his shoes, and find out he\u2019s a two-year-old colt. Rory confirms that Star is indeed a Ferrari of horses, a descendant of Nasrullah and Man o\u2019 War, super famous racehorses from way back in the day. Five years ago, his sire\u2014his father\u2014nearly won the Triple Crown. We never saw horses like Star in Charles Town, because those races didn\u2019t have big prize money. Those races attracted minivan-like horses; they got the job done okay, but they weren\u2019t flashy or special. The only truly special horse I knew was Moonshadow.</p><p>I sigh and follow Rory out of the stall.</p><p>\u201cHey, do you want to hang out tonight?\u201d he asks. \u201cThere\u2019s a party we can hit up. I\u2019ll introduce you to people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs friends or a date?\u201d I\u2019m not wild about hooking up with a guy I might be seeing on a daily basis around the farm. Could get awkward real fast.</p><p>\u201cJust friends. You\u2019re, like, over a foot shorter than me. I\u2019d break my neck trying to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>I decide I like Rory Whitfield.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Tonight sounds good.\u201d</p><p>Jack suddenly appears in the barn. \u201cWhitfield, could you excuse us please?\u201d</p><p>Rory nods then heads out without another word. Jack\u2019s eyes meet mine and we stand in relative silence. Those damned squawking birds won\u2019t shut up.</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize for my behavior this morning,\u201d Jack adds. \u201cDad always says a gentleman doesn\u2019t hit on his staff.\u201d</p><p>One point for me\u2014I was right. His dad must control the puppet strings.</p><p>Wait. He was hitting on me?</p><p>My heart rockets out of control. He\u2019s cute, but I could never trust him. I\u2019m sure all he cares about is his fortune, just like other rich people, like awful Mr. Cates back in Charles Town.</p><p>Jack goes on, \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d I say, copying his super professional voice.</p><p>He looks shocked momentarily then struts over to a stall. \u201cCan you help me get Strawberry ready to be loaded into her trailer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I move toward the mare\u2019s stall. \u201cWhere are you taking her?\u201d</p><p>Jack blushes. \u201cI\u2019m taking her to stud up at Lotus Farms.\u201d</p><p>I choke back a snort of laughter, picturing Jack having to stand there staring at his watch while two horses get it on. He grins at my reaction, but it melts away quickly. Apparently running a horse farm means you are never allowed to smile.</p><p>A yearling pokes his head out of his stall to see what we\u2019re up to. I open Strawberry\u2019s tack trunk, pull out her treats, and change the subject.</p><p>\u201cJack, is there anything I need to know about Star before tomorrow\u2019s race? Like, anything I should do during our warm-ups?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStar is scared of something, and none of us can figure out what it is. Not even your dad or Gael knows. And if they can\u2019t figure it out, I guess we\u2019ll never know,\u201d Jack says, attaching a lead to Strawberry\u2019s halter.</p><p>Lots of horses are scared of silly things. I once knew a powerful stallion that was terrified of dandelions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Star\u2019s record this year?\u201d I ask. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him mentioned in the Daily Racing Form.\u201d</p><p>Lines zip across his forehead. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t placed or shown yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of how many races?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p><p>With Star\u2019s breeding, he should have at least shown by now. I cringe as I feed Strawberry a treat.</p><p>Jack nods at my reaction. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get some wins before the Dixiana Derby in October.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the purse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s is $75,000. The Dixiana is guaranteed $500,000.\u201d</p><p>I whistle. \u201cHow much was the stud fee for Star?\u201d</p><p>Jack adjusts his hat, averting his eyes. \u201cOver half a mil.\u201d</p><p>I whistle again but louder this time, making him laugh nervously. Paying for Star to be born was like ordering the most expensive thing on the menu. Most midrange Thoroughbred stud fees are around $250,000\u2013300,000. I imagine that\u2019s what the Goodwins charge when other owners want to breed their mares with Cedar Hill stallions.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of Dad\u2019s tests. He gave me a budget and wants to see what I\u2019ll do with it.\u201d Jack shakes his head. \u201cI hope Star can at least place tomorrow. Otherwise I\u2019ve wasted a shitload of my dad\u2019s money...and I\u2019ll have failed his test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you won\u2019t get a sticker, huh?\u201d I joke. Must be nice to have money to play with.</p><p>\u201cI want my father to know I can handle running the farm. I don\u2019t want to let him down.\u201d He gives me a sad smile, sounding sincere about wanting to work hard, and I feel a hard pang in my chest for him.</p><p>A successful horse turns a profit. And Star hasn\u2019t even made back the money the Goodwins spend on his grain and horseshoes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you made the right call on the stud fee. Breeding usually works out. Star ran so fast this morning, he probably would\u2019ve made it to Cincinnati before tomorrow if he\u2019d just kept on going.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack laughs quietly, and before I know what I\u2019m doing, I reach out and touch his wrist, to show I support him. He coughs. Then I jerk my hand away. Shit.</p><p>I nervously lick my lips, hoping my being forward doesn\u2019t influence whether he gives me the job or not.</p><p>He takes off his hat to reveal disheveled blond hair that curls around his shirt collar. We\u2019re standing so close, I can see a red tint mixed in with the blond.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re easy to talk to,\u201d he says, turning his cowboy hat over in his tanned hands. They\u2019re strong and calloused, like they\u2019ve hauled plenty of wheelbarrows. His big blue eyes peek up at me.</p> <p>\u201cJack!\u201d a girl yells. He shoves his hat back on as a younger girl who looks to be in middle school comes running up.</p><p>She latches on to his elbow like a barnacle. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you to Kentucky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t come, sweetheart,\u201d Jack replies, wrapping an arm around her. \u201cHave you met Savannah yet? This is my sister, Shelby.\u201d</p><p>Shelby says hello but goes right back to pestering her big brother. \u201cI want to be with Strawberry.\u201d</p><p>Jack looks at me. \u201cShelby thinks that Strawberry Fields belongs to her, but Dad would say otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been with Strawberry ever since she was a foal!\u201d Shelby says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not abandoning her today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t something you should see,\u201d Jack says with a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cCome on! I\u2019ve seen cows do it over at Whitfield Farms.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s face hardens. \u201cThe Whitfields let you watch that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, well, Trey and I watched one day. His parents didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be having a talk with Trey,\u201d Jack says, setting his hands on his hips.</p> <p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d Shelby whines. \u201cMy life would be over!\u201d</p><p>Trey must be one of Rory\u2019s brothers. Jack whispers to me, \u201cShelby has a crush on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not.\u201d She pounds Jack on the chest with her fist.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to get violent,\u201d Jack says. \u201cWe all have crushes from time to time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your crush on Abby Winchester?\u201d Shelby teases.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a crush on Abby, okay? Shut up about that.\u201d Jack avoids my stare.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sooo pretty,\u201d Shelby says to me. \u201cShe told me that last year she won Fairest of the Fair in her county.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she did,\u201d I mutter.</p> <p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t go with you and Strawberry, will you take me to the movies tonight, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could, sweetheart, but I already have plans.\u201d He suddenly focuses on his watch. \u201cI need to get going if I\u2019m gonna make it back in time. See you tomorrow, Savannah.\u201d</p><p>He walks away without another word, leading Strawberry and his sister to the trailer. But then he glances back at me, smiles, and waves. I return the wave.</p><p>Who does he have plans with tonight? Does he have a date? And more importantly, why do I care?</p><p>The Goodwin kids are not what I expected...I figured they\u2019d spent all their time taking tea and laughing hoity-toitily or something.</p><p>I open the door to Star\u2019s stall and slowly approach the horse, to continue getting to know him. \u201cSo, it\u2019s just me and you...want to tell me why you buck your riders?\u201d He lets out a little snort and nudges my hand then tries to chow down on it.</p><p>\u201cHey, now!\u201d I shove his face away from me. Sure, he\u2019s being snotty, but I\u2019d take horses over humans any day of the week. Horses never give a damn if I have labels on my clothes.</p><p>Herds are sort of like high school\u2014they definitely have their own social dynamic. There\u2019s always a stallion or gelding who thinks he\u2019s in charge. Out in the pasture, horses bully each other around food and water; lead horses get their fill before others get a bite or a sip, and if a horse that\u2019s low in the pecking order tries to butt in, he\u2019ll get bitten or kicked. And there\u2019s always a troublemaker or two, wallowing in the mud and teasing the fillies.</p><p>Once Star has calmed down and he\u2019s treating me with respect, I pet his ears and let him eat a treat out of my palm. I want him to feel safe with me so he\u2019ll let me ride him. \u201cGood boy. Now, let\u2019s see, what are you scared of? Raccoons, obviously. Are you scared of fillies? What about mud puddles?\u201d</p><p>I rub his head until his breathing slows and he falls asleep.</p><p>The Colors Were So Real</p><p>Later on Saturday evening, Rory is driving me down the streets of Franklin, giving me the grand tour.</p><p>\u201cWe have three Shell gas stations, but each has a different nickname. There\u2019s the Social Shell, where almost everybody goes to get gas. I always see somebody I know there. Then there\u2019s the Secret Shell, which no one notices, because it\u2019s not on one of the main highways. And the last is called the Soviet Shell, because it\u2019s usually out of gas and the snack shelves inside are always empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cFranklin was named after the Benjamin Franklin,\u201d Rory says.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He also discovered electricity and invented the carriage odometer and he\u2019s on the hundred dollar bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet Benjamin Franklin never had to take the bitch seat in a carriage.\u201d Rory brought his Irish setter, Ava, along tonight and apparently she always gets the passenger seat so she can hang her head out the window. \u201cI mean, isn\u2019t it ironic that I\u2019m sitting in the bitch seat while the dog gets the best spot?\u201d I say, making Rory laugh. \u201cMy mom would\u2019ve liked your tour. She was real big into history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died,\u201d I say quietly, and Rory gives me a sad look. I tell him about the cancer and how much I miss everything from her macaroni lasagna to the way she braided my hair to how she said I love you every night.</p><p>\u201cThat macaroni lasagna sounds amazing,\u201d he says, grinning.</p><p>\u201cOh, my mom kicked Martha Stewart\u2019s ass for sure.\u201d I tune the radio from rap to the hard rock station. \u201cRor, who is Abby Winchester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d He smacks my hand away from the tuner and flips it back to the rap station.</p><p>I pick at a piece of duct tape holding the truck\u2019s upholstery together. \u201cMr. Goodwin sure seemed serious about Jack returning Abby\u2019s phone calls today. She\u2019s practically stalking him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Mr. Goodwin\u2019s doing some special business with her or something? I don\u2019t know her. She doesn\u2019t go to our school, unless she\u2019s a freshman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>I tell Rory everything: how Jack didn\u2019t know who I was and how he offered me a private tour.</p><p>Rory gives me a worried look. \u201cJack\u2019s a good boss...but you shouldn\u2019t get your hopes up about him\u2014he never has serious relationships. Well, except for this one girl\u2014Senator Lukens\u2019s daughter. They dated last year. It didn\u2019t end well apparently.\u201d Rory pauses to drum his hands on the steering wheel. \u201cSo he wanted to take you on a private tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I bet he wouldn\u2019t make me take the bitch seat either,\u201d I taunt.</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d</p><p>I scratch Ava\u2019s ears. \u201cSo my dating prospects are pretty bad so far. I mean, you\u2019re out because you might break your neck trying to kiss me. And Bryant Townsend is a real dick\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you date just about anybody besides Douchey McDoucherson.\u201d</p><p>I howl laughing at Bryant\u2019s nickname. \u201cEven, like, that guy who rules North Korea who wears pajamas all the time? You\u2019d be okay with me dating him?\u201d</p><p>Rory stops at a traffic light. \u201cThat sounds like a great idea for my next script.\u201d He pulls a scrap of paper from his pocket and the pen from behind his ear. He rips the cap off with his teeth and starts jotting down notes: Hot teen girl kidnapped by ruthless commie bastard/she falls for him/he brainwashes her by impressing her with his knife collection!!!</p><p>During the rest of my driving tour of Franklin, Rory tells me about how he wants to be a famous screenwriter one day. But I can\u2019t figure out what genre Rory writes. What movies have eight million explosions, twice as many deaths, and loads of gratuitous sex scenes?</p><p>We pull into the lot of a place called Tennessee Ballers and park next to a Mercedes convertible. Two pretty girls, a guy, and Jack are climbing out of the car as we speak.</p><p>Crap. Of course Jack would be here, haunting me. I swivel to face Rory. \u201cHow can we afford this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cheap, I promise,\u201d Rory says.</p><p>Walking up to the wooden doors, I realize Tennessee Ballers is an old flour mill. A drugstore across the street is now an empty storefront.</p><p>Inside Tennessee Ballers, I gaze around at the odd d\u00e9cor. The tables, chairs, and carpet are tasteful and clearly brand new, but different kinds of dead fish (bass? sturgeon?) mounted on plaques and pictures of famous football players cover the walls. A picture of the Hundred Oaks\u2019 football team from four years ago hangs right beside the cash register. The caption says the photo is from the Tennessee State Championship game. They had a girl quarterback? God, that\u2019s so badass.</p><p>Rory and I get in line behind one of the girls who came here with Jack. She\u2019s super tall with long blond hair. \u201cFish tacos at a place called Tennessee Ballers? Who came up with that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She turns, and a smile spreads across her face. \u201cI know, the name is awful. I have to listen to guys make perverted comments every time I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Rory pats his stomach. \u201cMan, do I love me some fish tacos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d the girl says, rolling her eyes.</p><p>The guy she\u2019s with grins evilly. \u201cYou love it when guys talk like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you. So much,\u201d the girl says to him before striding to the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou love me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d I whisper to Rory.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Vanessa Green and Colton Bradford. Colton\u2019s dad is the mayor of Franklin. And Vanessa\u2019s really cool. Her brother used to go to Hundred Oaks but now he\u2019s in the NFL. First person ever from our school to make it.\u201d</p><p>Crazy. How is it I\u2019ve only been here a few days and I keep meeting people who are way out of my league?</p><p>Vanessa studies the menu, but Rory is studying Vanessa like she\u2019s what\u2019s for supper. I nudge him with my elbow. \u201cIs she why we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re here for tacos.\u201d Rory points his chin at the menu. Liar.</p><p>Jack slips an arm around the other pretty girl\u2019s waist as they check out the menu.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s she?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cKelsey Painter. She\u2019s a cheerleader.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so confused. Wasn\u2019t he calling Abby Winchester earlier today? What if his bedroom really does have a revolving door?</p><p>I daydream of Jack touching me like that. Gently dragging his fingers across my hip, zapping me with lightning. Wait a minute. He was flirting with me earlier today when he knew he had plans with this girl tonight? What an ass. And I\u2019m an ass for even thinking about him.</p><p>I focus on the food. The menu is full of tacos, nachos, tortilla chips, rice, and beans. This place is dirt cheap. I can buy a taco and rice for like $3. Nice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s when Jack looks over his shoulder and sees me there. Our eyes meet and the side of his mouth quirks into a smirky grin.</p><p>\u201cSavannah, hey. This is my friend Kelsey,\u201d he says, and I shake hands with the girl. \u201cSavannah\u2019s living at my farm now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get chips and salsa?\u201d she asks, turning away from me.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Jack seems startled that Kelsey just snubbed me, but I\u2019m not. She clearly wants to jump him. Or already jumps him. Or something.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to sit with us, Savannah?\u201d Jack asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we do,\u201d Rory rushes to reply. His eyes flick over to Vanessa.</p><p>After I get my order, I join Jack, Kelsey, Vanessa, and Colton at a circular booth in the corner. Curious, I watch them out of the corner of my eye. Kelsey taps on her cell phone as her friends dig in. Between texts, she feeds chips to Jack, giggling like crazy. He eats the chips she feed him because his stomach is clearly doing the thinking\u2014just like with 99 percent of all guys. But he glances at me as he chews.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, this rice is so good,\u201d Vanessa says, shoveling it into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s \u2019cause they cooked it in straight-up butter,\u201d Jack says, practically inhaling his rice.</p> <p>\u201cI wish they served this stuff at Starbucks,\u201d Vanessa says.</p><p>\u201cYou only love three things in this world.\u201d Colton ticks them off on his fingers. \u201cStarbucks, clothes, and meeting guys at Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so not true,\u201d she replies, throwing a tortilla chip at Colton\u2019s face. The chip sticks to his black T-shirt. He plucks it off and eats it.</p><p>Rory slides into my booth with his tray. \u201cYou guys are so rude. I can\u2019t believe you started eating before I was seated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for being a perv, Whitfield,\u201d Vanessa says, sucking her drink through her straw. She shakes her cup. \u201cI\u2019m already out of iced tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you didn\u2019t drink like a horse,\u201d Rory says.</p> <p>Vanessa rattles her cup again, trying to get more tea out.</p><p>\u201cLet me get you more to drink. I won\u2019t be able to eat in peace if I don\u2019t,\u201d Rory says, leaping to his feet and snatching the cup out of her hand. He jogs over to the beverage station to get a refill. He comes back and passes Vanessa her tea. She takes one sip and nearly gags.</p><p>\u201cThis is warm. Where\u2019s the ice?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cOh, well I don\u2019t like ice, so I didn\u2019t get you any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s iced tea!\u201d she says. \u201cIt tastes crappy when it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Rory looks down at the cup. \u201cMaybe you should put some ice in it then.\u201d</p><p>I silently laugh and Vanessa throws a tortilla chip at him, looking furious, but then it turns into a subtle smile.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jack says to me. \u201cTell me about yourself. What else do you like besides riding\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m about to start talking when Kelsey starts bragging about the college party she went to last night. \u201cIt was an underwear party and everybody danced around in foam and we sprayed silly string everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Jack bites into his taco, looking perturbed at Kelsey.</p><p>Rory mouths \u201csilly string,\u201d and his eyes light up. He digs the scrap of paper out of his pocket again and jots down underwear and silly string.</p><p>\u201cTell me about that girl from last night on your Instagram pictures,\u201d Colton says to Kelsey. \u201cThe one from the sorority you want to rush next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019s going to study abroad this spring,\u201d Kelsey says.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Long-distance relationships are hard,\u201d Colton replies. \u201cI couldn\u2019t handle dating that girl Ellen I met in Murfreesboro.\u201d</p><p>Jack rolls his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s only thirty minutes from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Colton purses his lips and shakes his head. \u201cShe was just too far away. I can watch a whole episode of I Didn\u2019t Know I was Pregnant in that amount of time.\u201d</p><p>Because they\u2019ve both been drinking like horses, Rory and Vanessa stand to go refill their cups at the same time. Rory purposely pushes a lever on the Coke machine, making orange soda spray on her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou ass!\u201d She pushes on the ice button, grabs a cube of ice, and drops it inside his T-shirt. He jumps and wiggles around like an eel.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never get her into bed now,\u201d Colton muses, laughing.</p><p>Considering she\u2019s popular and wealthy, I don\u2019t think Rory will ever get her into bed even if he does behave like a perfect gentleman.</p><p>After dinner at the perverted taco place, we drive out to a huge field where a large bonfire is already blazing. Tiki torches are everywhere. I feel like I\u2019m on that show Survivor, only instead of surviving on a deserted island, I have to survive a couple of hours with people I\u2019ve never met before.</p><p>Trucks and four-wheelers are parked on the muddy grass. My heart speeds up as I scan the large group of kids, drinking, dancing, laughing, jumping around.</p><p>The second I hop down from Rory\u2019s truck, people from my new school are already staring at me. With a firm grasp on Ava\u2019s leash, Rory glides through the crowd, laughing and grinning at everybody. He seems like the All-American Guy, one of those people everyone wants to be friends with. When I get separated from him in the crowd, Rory reaches back through a cluster of people and grabs my arm, pulling me closer to him.</p><p>That gets the attention of the girls. And unlike the guys smiling and pointing me out to their friends, the girls are giving me Ultimate Stink Eye.</p><p>\u201cBe careful tonight,\u201d Rory says quietly. He scans my tank top and skinny jeans.</p><p>We go get beers from the keg. Vanessa is silently drinking from a plastic cup. Some girl speeds over to Rory and jumps into his arms, squealing and hugging him.</p><p>I want to say something to Vanessa, but the second I open my mouth, I lose my nerve and take a sip of beer. I\u2019ve never been all that good at making girlfriends, considering I grew up around horses and boys and more horses. Vanessa catches me gawking at her and moves closer.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWest Virginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t missing much. The only difference near as I can tell is that people here refer to all soft drinks as \u2018Coke.\u2019 Even if it\u2019s Sprite, you call it Coke. We refer to it as soda up north.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, looking around. \u201cYou aren\u2019t missing much here either. This party\u2019s pretty lame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d your friends Colton and Kelsey go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColton went home already \u2019cause he was tired. He loves sleeping. And Kelsey\u2019s over there.\u201d Vanessa nods toward the edge of the circle where Kelsey is sitting on a log next to Jack, talking animatedly with her hands. He\u2019s roasting a marshmallow.</p><p>\u201cAre they together?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNot yet...but I think she wants to try the whole relationship thing with him, even though he rarely dates seriously. He\u2019s too into his work. They\u2019ve been friends a long time but they\u2019ve never been single at the same time before...so it might work out. I dunno.\u201d</p><p>Is Jack about to be taken? That\u2019s not surprising. Still, a weird feeling of disappointment settles inside my chest. I ignore it.</p><p>That\u2019s when a beefy guy wearing a wrestling T-shirt comes over. \u201cI\u2019m Brent,\u201d he slurs in my ear.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d His hot beer breath on my skin makes me shiver\u2014and not in the good way.</p><p>The guy cups my elbow. \u201cWant to get out of here, new girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re hot.\u201d He spills beer on my boot. I give Vanessa a look that says \u201cis this guy smoking something?\u201d and she rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet lost, Brent,\u201d she says, sipping from her cup.</p><p>\u201cYou got a boyfriend?\u201d Brent clamps his hand on my arm.</p><p>I want a boyfriend\u2014I really do, but I want somebody who likes me for me, not because I\u2019m the new girl. I can\u2019t think of a good word to describe how this Brent guy makes me feel. Resentful? Flattered and angry? Flangry.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d I say, yanking my arm away from this drunk King Kong.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem here?\u201d a low, rough voice says. Jack gently pulls me away from Brent, loosely wrapping an arm around me. \u201cWe\u2019re good here,\u201d Jack says pointedly, and Brent skedaddles toward the trucks. So much for Mr. Macho Wrestling T-shirt.</p><p>Jack touches my wrist, and the sensation of his skin on mine sends shivers up my arm. In the good way. Our eyes meet.</p><p>I pull a purple sucker out of my pocket and pop it in my mouth. I\u2019m pissed at myself for being attracted to a rich boy. I turn to focus on anything else but him.</p><p>Great. Now everyone at this party is looking at me. Way to make a good impression before school starts, Savannah.</p><p>\u201cYou okay now?\u201d Jack asks me quietly. When I nod, he pats my shoulder and rejoins Kelsey over on their log. She grabs his hand and threads her fingers between his, but he keeps staring at me. His gaze makes me nervous.</p><p>What if Jack had gotten into a fight with that stupid Brent kid and Brent punched him out? What if Mr. Goodwin had blamed me? What if Mr. Goodwin fires my dad before we even unpack our winter clothes?</p><p>With a new baby on the way, we can\u2019t afford to lose the free housing. Plus, this job is the biggest thing that\u2019s ever happened to my father. He\u2019s proud of it, and I want to help him succeed at Cedar Hill.</p><p>I resolve not to cause Jack Goodwin any problems from now on.</p><p>Rory reappears, drops a hand on my shoulder, and smiles at Vanessa. \u201cLadies, I have a surprise. Come with me.\u201d He ushers us down to the pond at the end of the big field. Ava barks happily and runs in circles.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the surprise?\u201d I ask, bouncing on my toes.</p><p>Rory grins then pulls up his shirt, revealing a muscular back and torso.</p><p>\u201cThe surprise is you\u2019re doing a striptease?\u201d I ask. Vanessa glances at Rory\u2019s body. Then she does a double take before taking another sip of beer.</p><p>Two boxes are sticking out of his jeans. Sparklers! I squeal and run toward him. Smiling, he gives me a sparkler and pulls a lighter from his pocket. He lights it and I twirl in a circle, sucking on my purple sucker, watching my sparkler spit out green and red sparkly goodness, relishing the smell of summer on the air.</p><p>\u201cCan I have one?\u201d Vanessa asks. Rory stares at her for a sec before whipping a sparkler out of the box and lighting it for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a witch!\u201d she yells, laughing, pretending her sparkler is a wand.</p><p>\u201cWitches are sexy,\u201d Rory mumbles to me, not taking his eyes off Vanessa.</p><p>While we play with our sparklers, Rory starts launching bottle rockets. I love fireworks. You never know what\u2019s going to happen when they explode in the dark sky. Will it be a giant burst of light or just a dud? Will sparks rain down like glitter?</p><p>Jack touching me just now was like fireworks exploding right in my face. It was so, so dangerous.</p><p>But the colors were so real.</p><p>At the Races</p><p>Today I find out if I got the exercise boy job.</p><p>But first I have to ride a horse that doesn\u2019t like being ridden. A horse that bucks all his riders. Sure, I had luck with him when he escaped yesterday, but can I strike the jackpot twice? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019re at the barns at River Downs in Cincinnati, and the races start in a couple hours. Dad is standing off to the side, looking worried. I ignore him and concentrate on steadying my heartbeat. I tighten my gloves and pull a deep breath as Rory leads Star toward me. All I have to do is take Star through two warm-up laps and one at a full breeze. I can do this.</p><p>I suck in long breaths, working to rid my body of tension. If Star thinks I\u2019m nervous, he\u2019s gonna be scared, and I\u2019ve gotta show him that I\u2019m in charge.</p><p>Rory stops about ten feet from me and attempts to hold Star still, but he\u2019s prancing and acting skittish. I charge toward Star with confidence and purpose. I rub his face and he whinnies for a sec, and then he sighs and lips my hair. I straighten his front leg so he will be easier to mount.</p><p>\u201cYou got this?\u201d Rory asks, mimicking my dad\u2019s expression.</p> <p>\u201cI got this,\u201d I say, moving to the near side to mount. Rory hands me the reins, I get a leg up from him, grab the horse\u2019s mane, throw my other leg over his back, and slip my feet into the stirrups. Star prances in a circle and jerks away from Rory, and I might go flying.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d I say, and Star snorts. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>I cluck my tongue and trot onto the practice track. Out of the corner of my eye, I watch as Dad joins Jack, Mr. Goodwin, and Gael in the clocker\u2019s tower. Jack waves and whistles, and suddenly I\u2019m not so nervous. We circle the track twice at an easy speed and then it\u2019s time for the real show. I push the horse to a full gallop. Wind rushes against my face. We must be going forty-five miles an hour. That\u2019s well past the speed limit on the four-lane back in Franklin.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d I shout to Star, gripping the reins tight. We fly around the track. I\u2019m standing hunched over as I make the far turn, urging the horse faster. My guess is that Star starts slow but makes up his speed later, and now\u2019s when it counts. \u201cGo, Star! You got this!\u201d Ten seconds later we cross the finish line, and I bring the colt to a jog, patting his neck and smiling my brains out.</p><p>Jack is clapping and beaming.</p> <p>\u201cTime?\u201d I call out to Gael.</p><p>Gael rubs his chin. \u201c1:40. It\u2019s not completely terrible.\u201d</p><p>I pump my fist. To hear him say it wasn\u2019t complete shit must mean the horse did pretty well. I steer Star over to the hot-walkers ring, dismount, and hand him off to Dad.</p><p>\u201cIf he runs like this later today, he\u2019ll win for sure,\u201d Dad says, stroking the colt\u2019s mane, trying to get him to calm down. Star\u2019s ears twitch and point forward.</p><p>I get up on tiptoes to kiss my father\u2019s cheek, making him smile. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll get the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wait until after the race to bring it up to Jack. He seems nervous out of his mind right now. But yeah, I\u2019d say you\u2019ve got the job if you want it.\u201d</p> <p>I kiss Dad\u2019s cheek again then make my way toward the barns, my red braid bouncing against my back.</p><p>I\u2019m super excited about Star\u2019s prospects for today but tired as hell. I shouldn\u2019t have stayed out past midnight when I had to get up at 5:00 a.m. for the four-hour drive. I spend the next couple of hours helping Dad and Rory in the barns, feeding the six horses and lead ponies we brought with us, keeping them calm. Exercise riders typically don\u2019t help in the barns, but I don\u2019t mind. I love being around horses.</p><p>When it\u2019s time for Minerva\u2019s race, I go with Rory to the paddock to help put her saddle on. When she\u2019s ready, Rory goes back to the barn and I start walking Minerva in a circle. Not only does this calm her down, it\u2019s a chance for spectators watching the race to check out the horses. They get to see which horses are looking good, which ones are moody, which ones have too many bandages on their front legs, and which ones are clearly injured.</p><p>Horses die every week at racetracks all over the country, and when I hear about it, I want to punch something. That\u2019s the one thing about this sport that really pisses me off\u2014seeing abused racehorses. Some owners drug horses to make them stronger, which is totally illegal. I\u2019ve heard of people who try to drug the horses\u2019 water, but they won\u2019t drink it. So to make them thirsty, they gave horses a salt lick, so that they have no choice but to drink the drugged water. It\u2019s so sad.</p><p>I keep moving Minerva around in circles. I use a rag to clean out the mare\u2019s mouth. \u201cGood girl,\u201d I say with a yawn, not bothering to cover my mouth.</p><p>That\u2019s when Jack enters the paddock, wearing that sleek gray suit, a cowboy hat, and black cowboy boots. My heart starts pounding and my mouth goes dry as he adjusts his cufflinks. I glance down at my frayed T-shirt. It has a hole in it. And is that a mustard stain?</p><p>\u201cYou did well this morning.\u201d Jack pats Minerva\u2019s side and walks beside me, but doesn\u2019t say if I got the job or not.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Star is super, super fast. I don\u2019t see how he could lose today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, that means a lot. How\u2019s Minerva looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d a girl yells.</p><p>I look up into the grandstands to see a brunette waving a large hat at him. How ridiculous. Women hardly ever wear hats unless it\u2019s the Derby or one of the other big races.</p><p>Jack ducks out of the girl\u2019s line of sight. \u201cOh shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I say. \u201cThat hat is huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do girls think giant hats look good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d the girl yells again.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Jack looks physically sick. \u201cAbby Winchester. I gotta escape!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Abby Winchester?\u201d I ask, squinting. \u201cWhy is she wearing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d Jack says, removing his hat and dragging a hand through his mop of hair.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I bet you could yell \u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your giant hat\u2019 and climb up to her.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughs at my joke then groans when Abby yells his name again.</p><p>\u201cYour girlfriend\u2019s gonna freak out the horses.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a look. \u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is she?\u201d And why does he want to escape her so bad? \u201cDoes she know you were with Kelsey last night?\u201d</p><p>Jack stares at me for a long moment. Fear rushes through me. Why the hell did I ask that? Who am I to question my boss? We might attend the same parties, but he\u2019s the owner\u2019s son and I\u2019m cleaning out his horse\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p><p>Jack keeps looking at me. \u201cKelsey and I just hang out sometimes...it\u2019s nothing serious. I\u2019m going to check on Star.\u201d He disappears from the paddock in the direction of the barns.</p><p>Minerva nudges my face with her nose, whinnying like she\u2019s worried about me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I tell her, exhaling deeply. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>The announcer announces that it\u2019s ten minutes to post time. Bryant Townsend mounts Minerva, and I head over to the fence so I can collect her after she finishes the race.</p><p>Rory joins me at the edge of the track to watch. \u201c$100,000 guaranteed purse on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I reply, grasping the white fence, white-knuckled.</p><p>If Minerva wins today, Mr. Goodwin will be $100,000 richer, and Rory says he tends to give good bonuses to the grooms, exercise boys, and trainers who work with his horses. Mr. Cates never did things like that. One point for Mr. Goodwin.</p><p>\u201cI could sure use the money for college applications,\u201d Rory says. \u201cThey\u2019re expensive. Like, some of them are thirty-five bucks apiece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. I didn\u2019t know that. Do you know where you\u2019re applying yet?\u201d</p><p>Rory lifts a shoulder, staring out at the track. \u201cI\u2019m thinking UTK. They have a good theater program. But I doubt I\u2019ll get any big scholarships like my brother Will did.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t totally relate, considering I\u2019m not going to college, but I hurt for my friend.</p><p>Last night during the grand tour of Franklin, Rory confessed that most of the Whitfields\u2019 money goes toward taking care of his autistic nine-year-old brother. Special schooling doesn\u2019t come cheap, especially when farms are declining all over the country. Rory\u2019s older brother gave up attending a fancy college so they could afford special schooling.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if you can\u2019t afford college?\u201d I ask. \u201cAre you just gonna keep working on your screenplays or take over Whitfield Farms like Jack is gonna take over Cedar Hill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d Rory says quietly.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t end up like my parents. You know, struggling with our farm. We haven\u2019t broken even in two years. I don\u2019t ever want to go through this when I\u2019m older and have kids or whatever...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who\u2019s gonna run the farm? Your brother, Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly I don\u2019t care who runs it. It\u2019s a black hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the farm\u2019s been in your family since the Civil War!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but I\u2019ve gotta do what\u2019s best for me. Some things aren\u2019t meant to last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your family\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you drop it?\u201d he hisses. He clutches the fence and I suck in a deep breath, staring at the scoreboard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rory says after a moment, giving me a quick, sad smile. \u201cJust ignore your dick friend over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say quietly, resting a hand on his arm. \u201cI understand.\u201d But I don\u2019t. So his family has had a few bad seasons. So what? I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll pick up. Family\u2019s too important to give up on them. Even if I\u2019m annoyed that Dad got his girlfriend pregnant, I can\u2019t imagine leaving them high and dry.</p><p>Minerva wins her race against other fillies and mares, which means that Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin, Jack, Shelby, Bryant, and Gael go to the winner\u2019s circle and have their picture made with the horse.</p><p>When Bryant dismounts, Jack hands Minerva off to Rory so he can hot-walk her and lead her back to her stall. \u201cI want you to watch Star\u2019s race with me,\u201d Jack says. \u201cFor good luck.\u201d</p><p>I nod. Mrs. Goodwin and Shelby disappear back to their box, but Mr. Goodwin stays put against the fence, thumbing through the race program. He says, \u201cThank God, they\u2019re gone. I need a hot dog.\u201d</p><p>Jack whispers to me, \u201cMom won\u2019t let him eat hot dogs, so he has to sneak them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want one?\u201d Mr. Goodwin asks Jack.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest question I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Jack adjusts his suit jacket. \u201cOf course I want a hot dog.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin gently taps Jack\u2019s cheek. \u201cHow about you, Savannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d I reach into my back pocket to give him cash, but Mr. Goodwin waves me off. \u201cWait here so I can find you,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says, then goes over to the concession stand.</p><p>\u201cDad refuses to get a cell phone,\u201d Jack says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to stand here so he can find us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he have a cell phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he insists on living in the prehistoric era. I read this story about how apes in zoos use iPads and I showed the article to Dad, hoping it would make him want to start using a computer or a cell, but you know what he said?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not an ape.\u2019\u201d We laugh together as Jack folds his arms on top of the white fence. \u201cI don\u2019t see how he lives without a cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one,\u201d I mumble. \u201cAnd I get along okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering how often mine beeps, I\u2019m tempted to get rid of it myself.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t buy that for one second.</p><p>\u201cIf Star wins,\u201d Jack says, \u201cI want you in the winner\u2019s picture, okay?\u201d</p><p>I duck my head, grinning. \u201cOkay,\u201d I reply. \u201cSo where\u2019s your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s face goes hard. \u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d I tease.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, normally I hate giant hats on girls\u2014I think whoever invented them should be rounded up and quartered\u2014but today I love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, because every time I see Abby\u2019s hat bobbing through the crowd, I can just turn and run off in the other direction.\u201d</p><p>I laugh quietly, wishing he\u2019d elaborate on this whole Abby Winchester situation. Clearly something is going on between them, and whatever it is, it pisses me off because I like him\u2014</p><p>I pinch my arm. Why can\u2019t I stop thinking about him?</p><p>Mr. Goodwin comes back balancing three hot dogs and his notebook in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell my wife,\u201d he tells me, as if I would ever impose upon Mrs. Goodwin\u2019s privacy. We yank the aluminum foil back and chow down. I tap my boot nonstop, hardly believing I\u2019m standing with Jack Goodwin at a race.</p><p>We finish, wad up our aluminum foil, and Jack checks his watch. \u201cWhitfield should have Star in the paddock by now. Let\u2019s go check on him.\u201d</p><p>Dad is helping Rory to put Star\u2019s saddle on when we enter the paddock. Star prances and tries to rip away from Rory, and he attempts to bite Dad\u2019s arm. Dad raises an eyebrow when he sees me with Jack. I quickly shake my head, trying to show Dad that hanging out with Jack wasn\u2019t my idea. He asked me to stand with him during the race.</p><p>\u201cDanny,\u201d Jack says, tipping his hat at him. \u201cHow\u2019s Star doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFed and somewhat more relaxed than usual,\u201d Dad replies. \u201cI think his workout this morning really helped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jack steps up to Star\u2019s nose and whispers to him. It\u2019s really cute.</p><p>After Bryant mounts, I pat Star\u2019s neck. \u201cYou can do this, understand?\u201d I tell the horse. Star lets out a snort and his tail flips in circles as he looks every which way, and I pat him again to try to soothe him. His breathing steadies as he looks me in the eye.</p><p>But the second Bryant steers Star toward the starting gate, the horse whips his head around again. What\u2019s it gonna take to keep him calm?</p> <p>I move to walk with Jack.</p><p>\u201cShortcake, where are you going?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>\u201cJack wants me to stand with him during the race. For luck.\u201d</p><p>A grin slides across Jack\u2019s face and he mouths, \u201cShortcake?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to flip him off, but one doesn\u2019t generally flip off the boss.</p><p>Dad does not look pleased. \u201cI need you back in the barn right after, understand?\u201d</p><p>I nod quickly and join Jack at the finish line. The scoreboard shows 9\u20132 odds for Star to win. Not bad. That means people are betting on him to win based on his pedigree and how he looked in warm-ups this morning and the paddock just now.</p><p>It makes me proud I played a role in those odds.</p><p>I\u2019m leaning against the fence watching the horses and lead ponies trot around the track, doing a final warm-up before post time, when Jack starts tapping his hands on the fence like he\u2019s pounding a bongo drum.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says to Jack.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Jack says.</p><p>My palms go sweaty and I cross my fingers and my toes as the horses enter the starting gate. Star is in the seventh position. I glue my eyes to the green-and-black Goodwin family silks worn by Bryant and the horse.</p><p>The gates fly open.</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re off!\u201d the announcer says, as the crowd goes silent. Hooves thunder across the dirt. It\u2019s a sight that\u2019s mesmerized me since I was a little girl, almost like seeing floats in a parade. The excitement of seeing horses fly out of the gate leaving a wake of dust is electric.</p><p>But Star broke late and now he\u2019s trailing the pack. Ten other horses are leaving him in the dust. A colt named Hard Money has the lead, followed by Desert Waves. The Name\u2019s Timmy is in third. \u201cGo, Star,\u201d I say, not tearing my eyes off the green and black silks.</p><p>He starts to pick up speed at the 5/8 pole, and I jump up and down. This is Star\u2019s seventh race. Seventh time\u2019s a charm.</p><p>The pack reaches the straightaway and hurtles toward the finish line. Star is still in last place but he\u2019s making ground\u2014he passes four horses in a late break, but it\u2019s not enough.</p><p>Jack slams his hand against the fence when Desert Waves crosses the line first.</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says, looking equal parts pissed and pitying.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I whisper, not wanting to meet Jack\u2019s face. He brought me along today to keep his horse calm! To help him win the race! How will I get the job now?</p><p>\u201cHe should\u2019ve won,\u201d Jack says, rubbing his eyes. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin lays a hand on his shoulder. \u201cSon, lower your voice, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be losing. Not with his breeding! That\u2019s all horse racing is. Breeding!\u201d Under his breath, I hear Jack mutter, \u201cAnd I can\u2019t even fucking do that right.\u201d</p><p>I look at the crowd around us. People are staring at Jack. Here\u2019s the thing: regular horse races aren\u2019t like the Derby. They aren\u2019t like an NFL game. It\u2019s about gambling. People watch the races then they go inside and cash in their winning tickets, and then they bet again. They usually don\u2019t make a big scene.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Jack says, turning to face his father, letting out a string of curses. \u201cFive lengths! He might as well have not run,\u201d Jack hisses.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d says Mr. Goodwin.</p><p>I feel bad for Jack, but I\u2019m also scared I won\u2019t get the job now. I\u2019ll have to try out for another owner, maybe even work at another farm away from my dad. I need an opportunity to do something big with my life\u2014I won\u2019t get stuck making minimum wage.</p><p>I turn to watch Bryant handing Star off to Rory to cool the horse down. Dad pats the horse\u2019s neck then walks over to us. \u201cSavannah, I need you back in the barn now.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Jack looks at me as if he just remembered I\u2019m here. Blood races to my head. I really thought I could help with Jack\u2019s horse. Bile works its way from my stomach to my throat.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say to Jack and Mr. Goodwin, then follow Dad back to the barn. I yank a sucker out of my pocket. Now\u2019s not a good time to ask if I got the job.</p><p>Star did great in his warm-ups. So what went wrong? What\u2019s he so scared of?</p><p>I glance back just in time to see Abby Winchester hurling herself into Jack\u2019s arms. He looks over her shoulder, staring at me. Why in the world is he hugging her?</p><p>I pop the sucker in my mouth, shove the wrapper in my pocket, and get ready for the long drive home.</p><p>Why Can\u2019t Things Stay Simple?</p><p>After the races, at twilight, I\u2019m hanging out by the Greenbriar pasture, watching Star graze. He\u2019s chomping on grass, not a care in the world. I unlock the fence and head into the pasture.</p><p>Star sees me, trots over, and invades my space, pushing against me.</p><p>\u201cNuh uh.\u201d I get right back in his face, showing him who\u2019s boss. I push him away, making him move several feet from me. Dad always says that horses have short memories and that I should never worry about hurting their feelings. They\u2019ll always come back, because they want to feel safe, they want to feel taken care of.</p><p>So why doesn\u2019t Star feel safe? What\u2019s he scared of? With his bloodline, he should be an expert racer already. Instead he panicked and got a shitty start out of the gate.</p><p>I cluck my tongue and snap. \u201cStar, c\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>He looks up and walks over, keeping a bit of distance from me this time. I reach into my pocket and pull out a treat, rewarding him for showing me respect. As he eats from my hand, his breathing slows and a stillness settles over his body.</p><p>I start examining him, looking for injuries. Monitor his breathing. I rest my head against the withers and listen for his heartbeat.</p><p>Sometimes, it\u2019s almost like I can hear a horse\u2019s voice. This one time, I could tell a mare was sick because she kept rubbing her head against mine and whinnying. Turns out she had an infection that could\u2019ve made her go blind. And I caught it just in time.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so skittish?\u201d</p><p>I stand there with Star while he grazes and stare up at the sky, praying to Mom. Is she up there listening to me? I pray that even though Star did bad in his race today, I get the job.</p><p>All of a sudden, Star\u2019s tail starts whipping around and his ears lay back. He\u2019s nervous or angry.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jack calls out, waving from outside the fence, his hounds running circles around him. Jack looks comfortable in a T-shirt, track pants, and a baseball cap turned around backward. A good outfit to curl up in on a Sunday night.</p><p>Star pins his ears. Does the horse not like Jack, or is it the three rambunctious dogs at his side? I\u2019d hate to tell Jack that his horse doesn\u2019t like him.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d Jack asks.</p><p>Nodding, I pat Star\u2019s neck and exit the pasture.</p><p>\u201cYou did really well today.\u201d The fresh smells of Jack\u2019s cotton T-shirt and soap waft up to my nose, luring me into a trance. His eyes are bright sapphires under the moon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry he didn\u2019t win. I can\u2019t believe it, honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither. He did better in your warm-up than he did in the damned race.\u201d Jack purses his lips and looks at the next pasture over, where mares are grazing with their young. \u201cWe should probably get the horses inside.\u201d</p><p>Jack and I mount Appaloosa ponies and herd the horses toward the barns. A rush of happiness fills me when he gently coaxes a yearling into his stall. I love how he respects and takes care of his animals, and his fluid riding skills show he\u2019s a true horseman. The stars glitter against the deep purple sky. It feels like it\u2019s just me and Jack for miles and miles.</p><p>Much too soon, the horses are safe and cozy in their stalls, and I have no excuse to spend more time with him.</p><p>\u201cLock that gate,\u201d he calls.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d I finish the chore and meet back up with Jack.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the boss?\u201d I tease.</p><p>He scratches the back of his neck, looking pained all of a sudden. \u201cI\u2019m probably gonna score a big fat F on this test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that? Everyone respects you.\u201d Gael told me a story about when Jack was fifteen and his father was out of town and couldn\u2019t be reached, Gael was wrestling with whether to euthanize a prized gelding that broke his femur on the track. Jack made the call to put the suffering horse down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019d buy a horse I breed considering how bad Star\u2019s turned out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fast horse,\u201d I reply. \u201cHe just has some growing up to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be better than this. He\u2019s bred from the Man o\u2019 War and Nasrullah lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just got a bad start out of the gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStar\u2019s been gate-trained a couple times already.\u201d We\u2019re standing so close, I can count the freckles on his nose. See the flecks of gray in his blue eyes. \u201cI love Star, but my father thinks I should sell him to recoup some of the cost. Cut my losses.\u201d</p> <p>A memory of Moonshadow roars into my thoughts. Moonshadow bucking and squealing, trying to get away from strange men she didn\u2019t know, trying to get back to me. I swallow hard and try to focus on the present.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t sell Star,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cCrotchety as he is, I like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m the boss right now \u2019cause I can\u2019t sell him. I can\u2019t fail on my first big stud fee deal. Nobody will respect me as an owner...Maybe your workouts with Star will get him in shape for the race at Keeneland next weekend.\u201d</p><p>I move closer to Jack, getting in his space just like pushy Star. \u201cDoes this mean I got the exercise rider job?\u201d</p><p>He steps closer, invading my space this time. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious you\u2019ve got the job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYay!\u201d I squeal and jump into his arms, wrapping my arms around his neck. My heart swells at the trust Jack is putting in me. He clears his throat and I immediately let go, mortified. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He gently pats my shoulder. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me sir.\u201d He laughs softly and gazes into my eyes, and it feels like everything stops. The wind stops rustling the grass. We both stop breathing. The only thing that keeps on are the twinkling stars.</p><p>Heat floods my body as he takes a step closer and gently pushes me against the white fence. \u201cHey,\u201d he says. His fingertips graze my cheek. He stares at my lips, setting me on fire. Holy shit, what is happening!</p><p>I grab his shoulders to hold myself up, breathing hard, inhaling a mix of honeysuckle and soap. The fence scrapes against my back. What would Jack say if someone caught us here?</p> <p>I push him away before anything happens.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he murmurs, as if in a daze, locking his hands around my waist.</p><p>\u201cJack, no.\u201d</p><p>At the word no he jerks his hands away and holds them up. \u201cWow, you really don\u2019t want to kiss me, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my boss.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flutter open wide and he takes a step back. \u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>Of course he wasn\u2019t thinking. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about what other people would say. \u201cWhy is the rich, gorgeous Jack Goodwin kissing a girl like her? He must be using her because she works at Cedar Hill. She\u2019s convenient.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have to worry about his father getting fired if he\u2019s caught kissing me. On top of that, after he badmouthed Abby Winchester today, he let her hug him! So how can I trust anything he says? Just like all rich people.</p><p>Jack nervously scratches his nose. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Can we pretend this never happened? My dad\u2019ll be pissed at me.\u201d</p> <p>Without a word, I abandon Jack by the pasture, haul ass back to Hillcrest, and rush into my shoebox of a room, slamming the door shut behind me, rattling the picture of my mother hanging by the door. I reach my bed in two steps and collapse.</p><p>Jack Goodwin just tried to kiss me!</p><p>It\u2019s not that I\u2019m nervous about the prospect of hooking up. I\u2019ve fooled around before\u2014I even had a regular thing going with this guy Adam. We almost slept together once, but not even the cheap wine coolers we drank before made it feel right. I want my first time to be with someone I love and respect.</p><p>I cradle my stuffed bear. If I\u2019d stayed out by the pasture, if I hadn\u2019t pushed Jack away, he would\u2019ve kissed me.</p><p>And I\u2019m not sure what I think about that.</p><p>I have five days to get Star in shape for his next race.</p><p>If he doesn\u2019t win this time, there\u2019s a good chance Mr. Goodwin will convince Jack to sell him, and I can\u2019t let that happen. Not again.</p><p>So, on Monday morning before school, I meet Gael for my first day of work as an exercise rider at Cedar Hill.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations on the job, drama mama.\u201d</p><p>I give him my death glare as he gives me my schedule. I\u2019m to take Minerva, Star, and Echoes of Summer out for exercise. I will ride each horse for about twenty minutes before handing the horse off to a hot-walker to cool down before it gets a bath and food.</p><p>First I take Minerva out onto the track, warm her up, then turn the other direction and race around the turf to avoid a traffic jam with other riders warming up.</p><p>When I\u2019m just getting finished with Minerva, Jack appears on the edge of the track, riding Wrigley. He pulls his cowboy hat off, waves it at the staff, and puts it back on. Most guys my age would still be sleeping at 5:30 a.m., but Jack\u2019s up early to see what\u2019s happening on the track and in the barns.</p><p>When I trot past, riding Minerva, I discover that Mr. Serious is back. He avoids my eyes and tips his hat. \u201cGood morning, Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sir.\u201d</p><p>Thank the heavens he didn\u2019t bring up last night\u2019s almost kiss.</p><p>I drop Minerva off with a hot-walker then retrieve Star from Greenbriar. He flicks his ears forward and approaches me but doesn\u2019t get too close. He\u2019s starting to respect my space.</p><p>\u201cGood boy.\u201d I take his lead and direct him out onto the track. He seems happy and carefree today. We trot around the track two times and then head over to the clocker\u2019s tower.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d I tell Gael so he can time me, and Star and I take off. I feel like I\u2019m riding a ballistic missile. \u201cWoooo!\u201d I maintain perfect control, so it\u2019s a great run. When I\u2019m finished, Gael and Jack are clapping, and Mr. Goodwin has joined them. He whistles and claps too.</p><p>\u201cTime?\u201d I call out to Gael.</p><p>\u201c1:41,\u201d he replies. \u201cIt\u2019s not complete shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was brilliant!\u201d Jack shouts. Mr. Goodwin gives his son a weird look.</p><p>I wave to Jack, dismount, and whisper to Star that he did a wonderful job. But the second I pass Star off to a hot-walker, the horse starts whinnying and slapping his tail around. Instead of going to get Echoes of Summer, I rush back over to Star, relieve the hot-walker, and cool the horse down myself. Star nickers and nips at my face as we walk in circles over and over.</p><p>I only have five days to get this horse ready to race.</p><p>What\u2019s wrong with him? Why does he only respond to me?</p><p>After work on Monday morning, Rory drives me to my new school, and on the way, I dig into his new screenplay.</p><p>\u201cBut this doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d I say, waving the script. \u201cYour character just met the girl two minutes ago. Why would she sleep with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue love. She saw him and just had to have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls don\u2019t sleep with guys two minutes after meeting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s like, every guy\u2019s dream!\u201d Keeping one hand on the wheel, Rory taps his other hand on the paper. \u201cThat\u2019s why this script will sell. Men will love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t pay for a movie ticket to this. You need to edit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad I met you. Nobody else wants to read my screenplays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry no one wants to read your porn,\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cHey, now. It\u2019s high-brow porn.\u201d</p><p>My heart starts thumping hard the moment we pull into the parking lot, where Rory says the seniors park in the back corner. I peer out the truck window at a sunken area of concrete filled with water, weeds, and mud.</p><p>\u201cWhy is there a lake in the middle of the parking lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the school spends all its money on the football team.\u201d</p><p>Rory adds that everyone calls this area of the parking lot The Swamp, and for some unknown reason it\u2019s cool to park there.</p><p>I hop down out of the truck, and Rory links my arm in his as we walk past a group of smokers and then the skaters. He helps me check in at the office and points out the cafeteria and the bathroom, but then abandons me at my homeroom because he absolutely has to meet up with the drama teacher. He swears this will be the year the teacher finally agrees to produce his original play, Call Me When Your Mom Is Back in Town.</p><p>After homeroom, in which I talk to absolutely nobody, I navigate through the crowded hallway. My first class of the day is Crucial Life Lessons, a required course for seniors, where we\u2019ll learn, you guessed it, \u201cCrucial Life Lessons.\u201d Is that stuff like how to balance our bank accounts, warnings not to sign up for credit cards, and the difference between 87 and 93 octane gas?</p><p>I enter the classroom and grab a seat toward the back. The name Coach Lynn is scrawled across the whiteboard. Vanessa Green comes in, takes the seat right in front of me, and turns around.</p><p>\u201cI had fun Saturday night,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I have a sparkler addiction now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had fun too\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack Goodwin appears in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>He sees me and swaggers past girls trying to speak to him and lazily drops into the desk next to mine, props his foot on his thigh, and shakes his cowboy boot. I guess he isn\u2019t allowed to wear a cowboy hat in school; his hair curls around his collar.</p><p>\u201cYou did fantastic this morning,\u201d Jack says, leaning toward me and smiling that lopsided smile. \u201cI know Star\u2019ll do well this weekend at Keeneland. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smile, bowing my head a little.</p><p>\u201cSo you and Whitfield, huh?\u201d He drapes his arms across the desks in front of and behind him. Vanessa swivels slightly, listening in.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cI saw you walking in the parking lot with him,\u201d Jack replies.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m wondering if you guys got a thing going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw. He\u2019s too tall. He\u2019d break his neck trying to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa laughs.</p><p>Jack gazes into my eyes and my pulse thumps harder and harder. Is he gonna bring up the almost kiss?</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s just a friend?\u201d Jack asks.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Rory enters the classroom and grabs the seat right in front of Jack.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ror,\u201d I say. \u201cJack thought that we\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>Rory screws up his face. \u201cThe other night after the party? S fell asleep on the drive home. Her snoring is terrible. She\u2019s like a troll or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cA troll, huh?\u201d Jack whispers to me. \u201cI thought you were a Shortcake.\u201d</p><p>I feel my face flaming pinker than Strawberry Shortcake her damned self. I swivel around and concentrate on Vanessa\u2019s straight blond hair.</p><p>As Coach Lynn begins to take roll, Jack leans across the aisle toward me.</p><p>\u201cI wish this class taught us real life lessons,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I open my notebook and uncap my pen, pretending to get ready to take notes, which is ridiculous because I hate taking notes. \u201cWhat kind of lessons?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike how to woo women.

It would be an easy A, you know?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, but can\u2019t help but smile.</p> <p>Coach Lynn announces that we have to write a two-page paper about where we see ourselves in five years, and everybody starts groaning.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you be in five years? Still in college? Grad school? In the military? Married? Kids? Working at the car factory?\u201d The teacher looks at me and says, \u201cWill you be working on a farm? Each of you will be required to write a two-page paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo pages?\u201d Rory whines.</p><p>\u201cOh, just write that you want to be a gynecologist,\u201d Vanessa mutters.</p><p>Rory bursts out laughing at that, and Vanessa smiles back at him. He holds Vanessa\u2019s gaze for a second longer then faces the whiteboard.</p> <p>Jack slips his pen behind his ear and leans across the aisle toward me again. \u201cI hope this class has a lesson on how to decide if you want a tattoo or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d I laugh, blushing.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a tattoo?\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>\u201cMaybe...If you tell my dad, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>He holds his hands up. \u201cYour secret is safe...as long as you tell me what this tattoo is and where it\u2019s located.\u201d His eyes move from my chest to my butt to my stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting colder,\u201d I whisper when he starts eyeing my ankles.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it? A butterfly or a heart or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting even colder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a dragon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrr. You\u2019re really cold.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cDammit, tell me where your tattoo is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rory blurts, turning around, looking me up and down. \u201cYou have a tattoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhhhhhhh!\u201d says some brownnoser kid.</p><p>Coach Lynn sighs. \u201cFace the front of the room please, Jack and Rory.\u201d</p> <p>Rory swirls around. Jack stretches his legs out to either side of the desk in front of him and smirks, continuing to eye me. Dad would kill me, so I pray Jack and Rory don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>I honestly can\u2019t believe I told Jack about the horseshoe tattoo on my hip. Maybe a little part of me wanted to tell him\u2014to show him I\u2019m not some little girl that can be pushed around.</p><p>Truly though? Maybe I want him to think of me as sexy.</p><p>If Pie Cured Confusion</p><p>Between periods, I\u2019m disappointed to discover that Rory and I aren\u2019t in the same lunch because his drama course is interfering, and of course he\u2019d rather do that than eat with me. Ugh, nothing\u2019s worse than eating alone.</p><p>When I head into the cafeteria, I find Jack slipping quarters into the Coke machine, holding a tray loaded up with a burger and fries. I skirt the edge of the cafeteria and make a break for the picnic tables in the courtyard. Outside I grab a seat in the corner, unsnap my Velcro lunch bag, and pull out a sandwich, carrots, a cookie, a juice carton, and one of those soups you can drink.</p><p>I open one of Mom\u2019s history books\u2014A Compendium of Poetry. I don\u2019t like poetry all that much, but reading her books makes me feel closer to her and lets me pretend she\u2019s right here beside me. I set my bookmark on the table and start reading the section where I left off. It\u2019s about Robert Frost. It says one of his most famous poems is \u201cThe Road Not Taken.\u201d I don\u2019t completely understand some of the lines in the poem, but the last section makes me sit up and pay attention:</p><p>I shall be telling this with a sigh</p><p>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</p><p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014</p><p>I took the one less traveled by,</p><p>And that has made all the difference.</p><p>Mom highlighted that one section in yellow. Did she feel like she lived life to the fullest? Did she take the right path for her? I bite into my sandwich and chew, thinking.</p><p>That\u2019s when I hear him. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>I turn to find Jack salivating over my sandwich. \u201cRoast beef.\u201d</p><p>He straddles the picnic table bench and sits. \u201cSplit it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I take a big bite, smacking obnoxiously.</p><p>He laughs. At school he\u2019s so different from how he is on the farm where he\u2019s the boss. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get the lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYvonne,\u201d I say through a mouthful.</p><p>\u201cYvonne made you lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never made me a lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because you\u2019ve never asked her to, brainiac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be speaking with her as soon as I get home.\u201d He sits up straight and pops open his Coke. \u201cI want a roast beef sandwich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d I mutter. When I move to open my thermos, Jack snatches my roast beef sandwich off the table. He takes a huge bite, grinning, before I can stop him.</p><p>\u201cGive me that!\u201d I say, grabbing it back. A piece of roast beef slips out onto the bench. In retaliation, I grab a handful of his fries and stuff them in my mouth.</p><p>That\u2019s when Brent, that bonehead from the party the other night, walks by, staring at me. Girls at the next table over see I\u2019m sitting with Jack and give me dirty looks.</p><p>\u201cThis sucks,\u201d I say to myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat does?\u201d Jack asks, scooping up ketchup with a fry.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m a science experiment gone wrong. They don\u2019t even bother to say hi. They figure they know everything they need to know based on what I look like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are assholes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYourself included?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty as charged.\u201d He holds his hands up, laughing. \u201cYou are really pretty...\u201d He drags a hand through his blond hair. \u201cBut you\u2019re kind of like a great book...you know, you pick up a book at the bookstore because it has a beautiful cover...but it\u2019s what\u2019s inside that pulls you in.\u201d</p><p>That might be the nicest thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me. I give him a small grin and his eyes meet mine.</p><p>That\u2019s when Vanessa, Kelsey, and Colton enter the courtyard. Kelsey stops dead when she sees me sitting with Jack.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she mouths at Jack. He stiffens as his friends saunter over. Colton and Vanessa are bickering.</p><p>\u201cAny idiot can be on The Price is Right,\u201d Colton says. \u201cJeopardy! shows that you\u2019re smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you get to spin the big wheel on Price is Right,\u201d Vanessa says.</p><p>\u201cI wish they could incorporate that wheel into Jeopardy! \u201d Colton muses, biting into his burger.</p><p>\u201cYou guys remember Savannah, right?\u201d Jack asks. \u201cShe works on my farm. We were just going over some business.\u201d</p><p>Once Kelsey hears that, she stops glaring at me and turns her attention to her cell phone, glancing up at Jack a couple times. Vanessa smiles but can\u2019t get a word in, because Colton launches into a speech about how, if he were to go on Jeopardy!, he\u2019d bet it all and make it a true Daily Double.</p><p>\u201cListen, I wanted to talk to you about Star,\u201d Jack says to me. \u201cDo you have any idea what\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I lie, remembering how Star got upset when Jack came around. I don\u2019t want to say anything until I\u2019m sure I\u2019m right.</p><p>Jack pops another fry in his mouth. \u201cTomorrow before school, before you exercise Star, can we try gate training him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The words are out of my mouth before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cSmart ass,\u201d Jack says with a grin. \u201cStop calling me sir. For real.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey glances up from her phone, looking at me as if I said I love doing homework. \u201cYou call him sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I snap, and she turns her focus back to her phone. Jack covers a grin by sneaking another bite of my sandwich. I yank it away. \u201cGive me that!\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip, excited about the prospect of hanging out with him tomorrow morning. I tell myself it\u2019s only business. But if it\u2019s only business, then why are all these girls giving me dirty looks because I\u2019m sitting with Jack?</p><p>My heart can flutter all it wants\u2014that\u2019s not gonna change the fact that Jack is not in my league. How could we ever have a good working relationship if I were to let him have his way with me, and then things go back to the same ole same ole?</p><p>I steal one more of his fries, just to show him who\u2019s boss.</p><p>Dad and Cindy want to take me out to dinner tonight to celebrate my first day of senior year. Neither of my parents got a high school degree, so this is a big deal for me. Of course, Dad\u2019s idea of \u201cgoing out to dinner to celebrate\u201d is not the same as mine.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask, as we park in the dumpy parking lot of a dive diner called Foothills.</p><p>\u201cI said the same thing, Shortcake,\u201d Cindy says, making me wince. \u201cI told him we should go to the Cracker Barrel, but your dad never listens to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo boys ever listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cindy replies.</p><p>Dad tries to hide his grin as we climb out of his ancient truck. \u201cMr. Goodwin told me Foothills is the best place in town.\u201d</p><p>The F and the T of the neon sign are burned out, so it looks like we\u2019re going to OO HILLS diner. The bell jingles as we open the door. We order coffee and breakfast for dinner, and after we finish eating eggs and bacon that are surprisingly amazing, we pick songs out on our private little jukebox until Dad clears his throat.</p><p>He reaches across the table and takes Cindy\u2019s hand in his before he speaks. I feel my eyes grow wide at the sight of them holding hands. Holy hell, what\u2019s coming?</p><p>\u201cSavannah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sick?\u201d I ask quickly, wanting to rip the bandage off.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dad says. \u201cWhy\u2019d you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I choke out, as my heart races out of control. When my parents told me Mom had cancer, we went to McDonald\u2019s as a special treat.</p><p>Dad puts an arm around my shoulder and pulls me closer. \u201cI\u2019m not sick,\u201d he says quietly, glancing over at Cindy. \u201cIt\u2019s the exact opposite. We went to the doctor this afternoon for a gender ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s order pie and have a toast with our forks,\u201d I say, raising a hand to wave down a waitress.</p><p>\u201cShortcake, don\u2019t you want to know if it\u2019s a boy or a girl?\u201d Cindy asks.</p><p>Part of me wants to know, and part of me doesn\u2019t. \u201cWhatever it is, we\u2019re still getting pie.\u201d I wave my arm at the waitress. She\u2019s standing behind the counter yapping on her cell phone.</p><p>Cindy\u2019s face falls and Dad gently curls a hand around the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cSavannah...\u201d Dad\u2019s tone brings my attention back to him instead of pie procurement.</p><p>\u201cI guess Cindy\u2019s gonna need a double order of pie,\u201d I say, trying to delay the conversation. If things were different for my family, I wouldn\u2019t mind so much that they\u2019re having a baby. \u201cSo what is it?\u201d</p><p>Cindy grins shyly. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Talk to me,\u201d Dad says, kissing the side of my head.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about tomorrow,\u201d I lie, not wanting to discuss the baby. I lightly run my fingers over spilled salt on the sticky table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s tomorrow?\u201d Cindy asks.</p><p>\u201cI ate lunch with Jack Goodwin today, and he asked me to work with Star personally on starting gate training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>\u201cI said okay. I told Jack I\u2019d meet him first thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShortcake, there are other boys out there,\u201d Cindy says slowly, shaking her head. Does she have to call me that?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to work with his horse, but I don\u2019t want you around him,\u201d Dad says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to upset Mr. Goodwin.\u201d</p><p>What if they knew he nearly kissed me last night?</p><p>Cindy nervously taps her knife on a plate. \u201cHave you been spending time with Jack? At breakfast this morning, I overheard him telling his little sister how much you impress him and that you\u2019re a good role model.\u201d</p><p>A role model ? Talk about the last thing you want a guy to say about you. \u201cHe was talking about me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Jack?\u201d Dad asks in a rush.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say, my face flashing hot.</p><p>\u201cShortcake, you know we don\u2019t need any drama right now. Not with a baby on the way.\u201d How unfair. He\u2019s the one who got his girlfriend pregnant.</p><p>My mind is all screwed up because I loved eating lunch with Jack, and I like working with him and Star, working toward something together, and I can\u2019t sort it out in mind, and I\u2019m gonna have a sister who\u2019ll go through the same shit that I\u2019ve been through\u2014growing up eating the free lunch, not having much for dinner, and wearing yard-sale clothes\u2014and I can\u2019t even flirt with Jack without feeling guilty, because Dad and Cindy are having a baby they didn\u2019t plan for.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just helping with Star,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to work with Star on the gate,\u201d Dad says, sipping his coffee. His hand shakes as he sets the cup back on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Jack in the morning and take over Star\u2019s training personally if he\u2019s that worried about the colt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s okay. I can handle it...Can we get some pie over here?\u201d I call out.</p><p>The waitress finally hangs up her phone, and soon we\u2019re toasting my new sister over rhubarb pie.</p><p>If pie only cured confusion.</p><p>The next morning I meet Jack at Greenbriar barn at 5:00 a.m. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, and the grass is still damp with dew.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he says, tipping his hat, giving me a grin that makes my palms go sweaty.</p><p>Along with Star, we bring Mr. Goodwin\u2019s stallion Lucky Strikes with us to the gate. This horse won the Preakness and the Breeders\u2019 Cup a few years back. People who don\u2019t know horseracing think the Kentucky Derby is the most important race in the world, but the Breeders\u2019 Cup in California attracts the best horses of all. It had a $5 million purse last year.</p><p>\u201cTie Lucky Strikes to that hitching post,\u201d I say.</p><p>I hand Jack two bags full of baby carrots and sliced apples; then I mount Star and steer him to the starting gate. He whinnies, his ears go flat, and he backs up. I rub his neck and comb his hair, murmuring nonsense to him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s just a gate. It\u2019s not scary. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>I pat his neck again. \u201cJack, come in here quietly, shut the gate behind you, and climb up next to me.\u201d</p><p>Soon he\u2019s standing on the side of the gate, resting a hand on Star\u2019s head. Star is going crazy, whipping his head around every which way, banging against the stall.</p><p>\u201cFeed him an apple slice,\u201d I call out, and Jack follows my orders. Star munches on his apple. \u201cFeed him another,\u201d I say again, holding the reins steady.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re a taskmaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeed him another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cramped in here,\u201d Jack says loudly, wiping sweat off his face.</p><p>\u201cRemind me never to work on a submarine,\u201d I say, both overwhelmed and intoxicated by the smells. This early in the morning before baths, Jack and Star both have their own muskiness going on.</p><p>Star won\u2019t stop snorting, so I decide to take an extreme course of action. \u201cStar!\u201d I transfer the reins to one hand and grab Jack\u2019s hand with the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Jack gazes down at our linked hands and glances around, as if making sure we\u2019re alone.</p><p>\u201cSee, Star? Jack\u2019s my friend. Be nice.\u201d</p><p>We stay inside the gate, holding hands, until Star\u2019s breathing calms down and he\u2019s still. I think I\u2019ve bored the hell out of the horse.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably enough,\u201d I say. \u201cLet us out of the gate, and now we\u2019ll do the same thing with Lucky Strikes while Star watches.\u201d</p><p>Back outside the gate, I call for an exercise rider to mount Lucky Strikes and ride him into the gate. I stand with Star, feeding him apples and carrots, while Lucky Strikes moves in and out of the gate, over and over. Then I feed both Star and Lucky Strikes apples out of my palm, loving how their lips tickle my hand.</p><p>\u201cDid you get your training style from your dad?\u201d Jack asks.</p><p>I nod. \u201cDad always says that horses learn by watching other horses. And all guys love food, right?\u201d I hold up the bag of carrots and apples.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>I wipe sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand. \u201cI need to exercise Star before school.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiles and nods. \u201cThanks again.\u201d</p><p>I take Star out on the racetrack and ease him into a jog, thinking of how patient and kind Jack was this morning. At Gael\u2019s signal, I bring the colt to a full gallop and race him around the track, waiting for the speed to make my brain go numb.</p><p>After the workout, I pull my gloves and helmet off and look up to find Jack standing beside the clocker\u2019s tower with a mug of coffee. \u201cTwo sugars and cream?\u201d</p><p>I set my helmet and gloves on the ground, take the cup, wrap both hands around it, and sip slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI thought Cindy was lying to me. She didn\u2019t seem happy when I asked her how you take your coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t lie to you,\u201d I say, sipping again.</p><p>\u201cI figured you might like it black or something. Black for a badass girl.\u201d</p><p>I give him a look. \u201cWell, thanks, I think.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s hounds circle around us as we walk back to the house arguing about black coffee versus coffee with delicious sugars and creams until he reaches for my elbow. \u201cListen,\u201d he says quietly, turning me to face him as we reach Hillcrest. He places a hand above my shoulder against the house. My heart bangs against my chest. \u201cI want to say thank you for helping me. It means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>I should tell him that he has a huge staff of people willing to do anything for him, because the Goodwins pay them, but somehow I know he considers what we did this morning more personal than regular ole work. He smiles, and I find myself staring at his lips.</p><p>Then Yvonne waddles up with a laundry basket under her arm and Jack tries to take it off her hands, but she swats at him. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d She wags her finger at him, and then motions for him to lean down so she can kiss his cheek. Then she kisses my cheek and heads inside where I can hear her getting on to Cindy for not drinking some special prenatal green tea she concocted. Jack and I laugh at Yvonne together.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Jack says. \u201cI have to finish balancing the accounts before school.\u201d</p><p>He takes off for the manor house, and I sip my coffee. Mmm. Perfect.</p><p>I shower and dress for school, and while I\u2019m sitting at the table trying to finish my stupid geometry homework, the maid bell starts ringing. Cedar Hill has several bells that date back to the Civil War. Each bell indicates if one of the Goodwins needs something. The chef bell, for food or coffee; the maids\u2019, for laundry, bedding, or cleaning issues; the gardener, for gardening issues.</p><p>You know, in case there\u2019s an emergency gardening issue.</p><p>The maid bell ringing doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2014none of the maids are down here right now. They\u2019re making beds and serving breakfast and doing other things maids do. Then the phone rings. \u201cSavannah,\u201d Cindy says in a weak voice.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong with the baby?\u201d I rush to ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling my best...I\u2019m so tired,\u201d she replies. \u201cI need you to send Paula up to work breakfast instead of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, I just remembered it\u2019s her day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can come up before school\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Cindy says. \u201cMrs. Goodwin doesn\u2019t like it when the help track mud in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already changed clothes.\u201d I peek down at the pink Converse Dad gave me for Christmas last year. \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>I jog up to the manor house and barrel into the kitchen. Cindy\u2019s sitting at the island, wiping sweat off her face. Jodi, the Goodwins\u2019 chef, is frying an omelet and writing down notes at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t serve breakfast,\u201d Cindy says, on the verge of tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m gonna make it another four months. I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should take some time off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the money,\u201d Cindy whispers, shaking her head. \u201cYou know I need a root canal and I won\u2019t be able to afford it for a long time and I want to buy your little sister clothes and start a savings account and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d I say soothingly. She Who Must Not Be Named should be able to take time off if she needs to. But with Dad still paying off Mom\u2019s medical bills, having enough money to take time off seems like a fantasy. What the hell are we gonna do after she gives birth?</p><p>\u201cJodi? What do I do?\u201d I ask in a harsh tone.</p><p>\u201cRefill their coffee. Mr. Goodwin drinks his black. So does Jack. Mrs. Goodwin drinks tea. Shelby likes hot cocoa with lots of whipped cream, so make sure she has enough.\u201d</p><p>I quickly wash my hands in the sink and take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cCome back to grab Shelby\u2019s omelet,\u201d Jodi says.</p><p>I tie on an apron and grab the coffeepot before striding into the dining room. A chandelier hangs above the table made of a deep cherry wood. Sunlight illuminates the room through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Shelby is doing the word search in today\u2019s paper. Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin look up at me.</p><p>\u201cShort-staffed today,\u201d I say, holding up the coffeepot.</p><p>Mr. Goodwin sets his paperwork down. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy\u2019s a little under the weather. She\u2019s really tired. And Paula has the day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says, returning to his papers. He\u2019s reading printouts of the Daily Racing Form. Dad and I read it every day so we can stay up-to-date on the best horses and jockeys and their news.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the team,\u201d Mrs. Goodwin says, toasting me with her teacup.</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d I say. I saw her at the races on Sunday, but this is the first time she\u2019s spoken to me. I can see where Jack and Shelby get their good looks from\u2014Mrs. Goodwin is exquisite.</p><p>Jack chooses that moment to enter the dining room, looking fresh in a pair of dark jeans, cowboy boots, and an Oxford button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows, of course. His hair is still wet from the shower. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sees me standing there and stops moving.

He kisses his mother\u2019s cheek before taking a seat and placing a napkin on his lap.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sweetie,\u201d Mrs. Goodwin says to him, smiling as she sips from her teacup. Then she goes back to sorting through the pile of mail in front of her. It\u2019s probably invitations to charity balls, political fundraisers for her brother who\u2019s the governor of Alabama, and cocktail parties, or it\u2019s about her cookbook.</p><p>Apparently every year she develops recipes for a special cookbook\u2014Entertaining with the Goodwins: Prizewinning Recipes from Prizewinning Cedar Hill Farms. She sells them for charity. We have a copy on the Hillcrest common room coffee table.</p><p>I move to pour hot coffee into Jack\u2019s cup. Dear God, don\u2019t let me spill.</p> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he says under his breath. \u201cJust because I brought you coffee doesn\u2019t mean you had to bring some to me.\u201d</p><p>I freeze as Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin exchange glances with each other. I move to pour coffee in Mr. Goodwin\u2019s cup, but he puts a hand over it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d</p><p>Jack selects a muffin from the breadbasket. \u201cDad, I\u2019m selling the Big Society yearling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBushy Branch Farms in Georgia. Got Paulsen up to $320,000.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says with a smile, making Jack practically glow with pride.</p><p>Jack sorts through the mail at his place setting. He opens an envelope and pulls out a card. The embossed initials on the paper read AW.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d Jack mutters, dropping the card on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, dear?\u201d his mother asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a card from Abby Winchester. I saw the AW on the front and thought it was about A&amp;W Root Beer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou goof,\u201d Shelby says.</p><p>\u201cI love root beer,\u201d he replies, sounding sad and overly emotional about root beer. Boys.</p><p>Mr. Goodwin opens his mouth, presumably to talk about AW of the Abby Winchester variety, not the root beer, so I go back into the kitchen. Jodi hands me a tray loaded up with the omelet, little bowls of something I don\u2019t recognize, and another basket of scones and muffins. I reenter the dining room to another interesting conversation.</p><p>\u201cI want pink streaks in my hair,\u201d Shelby says as she licks hot cocoa off her upper lip.</p><p>Mrs. Goodwin sets her letter opener down. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon! I want pink hair for my birthday! Carla got blue streaks and Whitney has purple streaks and I think I would look good with pink!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her parents say simultaneously. Mr. Goodwin never looks up from the Daily Racing Form.</p><p>I put a bowl at each spot. It looks like some sort of wonderful egg casserole bacon mash-up? I bet it totally rocks the socks off the Fruit Loops I had for breakfast.</p> <p>\u201cDear,\u201d Mrs. Goodwin says to Jack, \u201cwhat do you think of the cheese grits br\u00fbl\u00e9e?\u201d</p><p>He shovels it into his mouth, talking with his mouth full. \u201cDelicious.\u201d</p><p>She claps. \u201cYou\u2019re not just saying that?\u201d</p><p>Jack looks like a goddamned bulldozer scooping it up. I\u2019d say he likes it.</p><p>\u201cTrust us. It\u2019s wonderful,\u201d his father says, glancing up from his paperwork to smile.</p><p>\u201cMaybe try adding some sour cream to the grits,\u201d Jack says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Jodi,\u201d Mrs. Goodwin replies, nodding as she writes a note about sour cream. \u201cCan you look over the draft cookbook again after school?\u201d she asks Jack.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope you added the surf \u2019n\u2019 turf option like I suggested.\u201d</p><p>He helps with the cookbook? Who knew? I thought his activities consisted of:</p><p>1. Womanizing</p><p>2. Thinking about horses</p><p>3. Torturing me</p><p>Now that they\u2019ve been served, I hover between the kitchen and the dining room, waiting on everybody to finish. Mrs. Goodwin goes with Shelby to help her get ready for school, leaving Jack alone with his dad. I\u2019m about to leave to go finish my math homework when I hear my name. I feel guilty for eavesdropping, but I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing with Savannah Barrow this morning?\u201d Mr. Goodwin asks.</p><p>\u201cTrying to get Star used to the starting gate,\u201d Jack replies.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you were doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I swear.\u201d</p><p>I peek around the corner to see Jack taking a gigantic bite of muffin, so big it looks like he might choke. I lean up against the wall, making sure to keep out of sight.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good when a businessman dates his staff. Or uses them for any other activities.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cSavannah had some ideas for training Star, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Same stuff we usually do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it work this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe horse seemed calmer than usual. He\u2019s been clocking excellent times during his workouts. Savannah just knows how to control him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up that Savannah can make a difference with the horse. I haven\u2019t decided if she\u2019s talented. I still think you should sell Star.\u201d</p><p>I breathe in and out, suddenly panting. Please don\u2019t sell Star. Please don\u2019t sell Star. He might end up with a cruel owner. Just like Moonshadow. Please don\u2019t sell Star. I can\u2019t bear to lose one more thing.</p><p>Mr. Goodwin says, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we have that dinner tonight. I\u2019ll have Yvonne get a suit ready for you.\u201d</p><p>I peek around the corner one more time to find Jack rubbing his eyes. He sighs, picks up the Daily Racing Form papers, and stands as he chugs the rest of his coffee.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t stand up for me when his father questioned my talent. I guess it\u2019s not surprising. I just started working as an exercise rider here. I haven\u2019t proven myself.</p><p>I slowly take off my apron.</p><p>Out the kitchen window I watch as Jack\u2019s big shiny red Ford truck coasts down the driveway toward the main gate. I pull a deep breath and walk back into the dining room where Mr. Goodwin is poring over The Tennessean.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>His head pops up and he smiles. \u201cYes, Savannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I have a quick word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He folds the newspaper, places it next to his empty bowl, and looks up at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Cindy wasn\u2019t here to serve breakfast this morning. She\u2019s normally not a flake\u2014it\u2019s just she wasn\u2019t feeling well and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t happen again. I know we haven\u2019t made a good impression our first week here. I hope you won\u2019t take it out of her paycheck since I worked\u2014\u201d</p><p>He waves a hand. \u201cNo big deal. I understand you\u2019ve got a new little brother or sister on the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sister, yes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you liking living here? Is your bedroom okay? Everyone treating you nice down in Hillcrest?\u201d</p><p>The paint is peeling off my bedroom walls, but Dad said we can wait until we\u2019ve been here awhile to fix that. \u201cEverything\u2019s great, sir. I mean, except for that Yvonne won\u2019t let me wash my own clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the club.\u201d He smiles. \u201cAnything else? You probably need to be getting on to school.\u201d</p><p>I toe the fancy Persian rug with my pink Converse. \u201cSir, I was wondering. My dad and Cindy have a whole lot going on. Lots of bills and debts and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says slowly, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering...since Cindy will need to take more time off for the baby, can you please keep my paychecks instead of docking it from hers? At least until the baby is born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want. But I wish you\u2019d save it for yourself instead.\u201d Mr. Goodwin studies my face. \u201cLet your father handle his debts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to do this.\u201d I won\u2019t let my little sister grow up like I did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d A sly grin forms on Mr. Goodwin\u2019s face. \u201cTell me something, Savannah. Do you know what\u2019s wrong with Tennessee Star?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a possible idea, yes, sir.\u201d</p><p>It surprises me when Mr. Goodwin doesn\u2019t quiz me further. Instead, he winks. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see if you\u2019re right at the race this Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Blinded by Inspirational Posters</p><p>The evil Coach Lynn is making us run laps around the track in gym class. It\u2019s eighty gazillion degrees outside and my arms and legs feel like Silly Putty by lap three.</p><p>Vanessa Green slows way down so she can run beside me. \u201cWow, you\u2019re in dead last,\u201d she says. \u201cI guess your horse-riding skills don\u2019t translate to running.\u201d</p><p>I swipe sweat from my upper lip. \u201cYeah, totally different muscle groups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate gym,\u201d Vanessa says, wiping sweat off her brow.</p><p>\u201cReally? Isn\u2019t your brother like the best athlete ever? Like Superman or something?\u201d He\u2019s in the NFL.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him hear you call him Superman. Ty\u2019s head\u2019s already big enough since he started dating Gabriella Marsden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe supermodel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she has nothing interesting to talk about though. It\u2019s like he went to a supermodel factory and said \u2018I\u2019ll take that one please. The one with the extra-long legs and the big boobs and the hair that falls past her butt.\u2019\u201d</p><p>We laugh together, and at that moment, Jack and Colton sprint by. Jack turns, bows, and says, \u201cLadies,\u201d before streaking off again, his long hair flopping in the wind. He\u2019s so hot, my breath catches in my throat and I cough.</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s cute?\u201d Vanessa asks.</p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s hot, but he\u2019s not my type. He\u2019s too pretty.\u201d</p><p>I laugh at the irony. The most beautiful girl at school doesn\u2019t want the beautiful boy.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Vanessa starts. \u201cDo you know if Rory Whitfield is dating anybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...I wondered if you and him...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wondering...\u201d She gazes across the track. Rory and Jack are now racing each other, trying to be King of Gym Class. \u201cHe\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re like, you, and he\u2019s Rory\u2014he\u2019s my friend, and you could date whoever you want and I don\u2019t want him to get hurt and you\u2019re super popular,\u201d I say, flustered as hell.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWould that supermodel be dating your brother if he weren\u2019t an NFL quarterback?\u201d</p><p>Her nose crinkles. \u201cWho knows? Who am I to decide something like that? If you like somebody, you just like them, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really like Rory?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I mean, I\u2019ve known him forever, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve thought about getting to know him better and kissing him or whatever...until lately, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s thought about it,\u201d I say, and Vanessa flashes me an excited grin.</p><p>\u201cReally? What\u2019d he say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laugh. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said anything to me. It\u2019s just the way he looks at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know. Thanks,\u201d she says, and we finish running our laps together. On the last lap, Colleen and Jaime, these snotty girls, run by and give me strange looks.</p><p>\u201cBitches,\u201d Vanessa says.</p><p>\u201cBitches,\u201d I agree.</p> <p>We bump fists and head into the locker room to change clothes. I\u2019ve never been all that great at making girlfriends, but I like Vanessa. I smile over at her as I pull my gym bag from my locker.</p><p>Crazy that she\u2019s interested in Rory, considering they come from very different lives. What will the other kids say when they hear about this? Will they wonder why Vanessa would date a farmhand?</p><p>That\u2019s when it hits me: even if other people had a problem with it, Vanessa wouldn\u2019t give a damn. I wish I could get away with not giving a damn.</p><p>After study hall in the library, I drag my fingers across locker doors on my way to the art room.</p><p>I discover Colton fast asleep on the sofa outside the guidance counselor\u2019s office. Vanessa wasn\u2019t kidding that he likes to sleep. When I look at the wall above the couch, I\u2019m blinded by inspirational posters: CONFIDENCE, WINNING, COURAGE, TEAMWORK, DESTINY, CHARACTER.</p> <p>Oh, my eyes. Why can\u2019t there be an inspirational poster for BADASS?</p><p>Thinking about Rory and his dreams of going to college, I open a pamphlet about the ACT. I scan the information, reading about upcoming test dates and facilities and\u2014</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Just taking the test costs $50.05! Why is nothing free? Or at least cheap! How are poor people supposed to plan for the damned future if everything costs so damned much? How can Rory afford the testing costs plus the application fees?</p><p>And what the hell is the five extra cents for?</p><p>I slip the pamphlet back in its slot and turn away, and run smack into Jack. He\u2019s drinking a Capri Sun and carrying a blue camping cooler.</p> <p>\u201cYvonne packed you an entire cooler?\u201d I ask, giving my Velcro bag a dirty look.</p><p>He grins. \u201cSure did. She gave me string cheese. And a juice pouch!\u201d He toasts me with the Capri Sun.</p><p>I shove his chest. \u201cShe gave you string cheese!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have one left,\u201d he says with a wink.</p><p>\u201cI want it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t share your roast beef with me yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you ate half of it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d Jack asks, nodding at the wall of brochures. \u201cDeciding when to take the ACT?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, um, no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you already take it? I\u2019ve taken it twice but I\u2019m gonna take it again because Dad thinks I can do better,\u201d Jack says, sipping his juice pouch.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t taken it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can borrow my study guides if you want. I\u2019ve got a whole box of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking the test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking the SAT then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I\u2019m not applying anywhere, so there\u2019s no reason to take the tests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about college?\u201d Jack asks.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I go to college? I can work as an exercise rider and make plenty of money. You have to, like, pay for college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you want more?\u201d Jack asks, furrowing his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI do. That\u2019s why I applied to be an exercise rider. Plus, a high school degree is worth a lot.\u201d</p><p>Jack stares at me for a long time, sucking on his Capri Sun.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to college?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks shocked at my question. \u201cYeah. Probably nearby, so I can keep an eye on the farm. Maybe Vanderbilt. I\u2019m gonna major in business and get my MBA, like my dad did.\u201d</p><p>At my old school in Charles Town, only about half the graduates ended up going to college. The rest went on to work at the casino or a hotel, or got married.</p><p>Jack continues, \u201cI have no idea why you wouldn\u2019t go to college.\u201d</p><p>I suck in air through my nose, dumbfounded that he doesn\u2019t understand how little money I have. Is he clueless?</p><p>\u201cMy family could never afford it.\u201d Hell, Cindy can\u2019t afford to take one morning off work. Not to mention the root canal she needs.</p><p>He sips from his Capri Sun again. \u201cDon\u2019t your parents want more for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s really proud I\u2019ve made it this far. I mean, he doesn\u2019t have a high school degree or anything...neither he or Cindy went to college, and no one in their families have ever been...My mom died, you know?\u201d</p><p>A sad smile crosses his face. \u201cYeah, my father told me. We were really sorry to hear about that...What was she like?\u201d</p><p>I swallow the lump in my throat and blink tears away. \u201cWell, she sang when she vacuumed. She was a real bad singer. Like, worse than the horrible singers on American Idol.\u201d Jack laughs with me. \u201cAnd she made Mickey Mouse pancakes every Sunday morning. She loved history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get to meet her,\u201d Jack says softly, gazing down at me.</p><p>The bell for fifth period rings. Jack reaches into his cooler and whips out the last string cheese and hands it to me before taking off down the hall.</p><p>I peel the plastic off the cheese, put it between my teeth, and yank it away, chewing.</p><p>After school, I spend a good hour grooming Star and feeding him, and then I decide to walk to the very edge of Cedar Hill and skirt the lake over to Whitfield Farms. I climb the fence and walk past cows and pigs and ducks and other animals up to Rory\u2019s farmhouse. I ring the doorbell, he lets me in, and we go to his room. His dog Ava is lounging on the rug, panting with her tongue hanging out.</p><p>Old movie posters cover his walls. It seems all posters in his room must feature one or all of the following:</p><p>1. An explosion</p><p>2. A woman\u2019s cleavage</p><p>3. George Clooney</p><p>Rory flops down on the floor and resumes playing some crazy racecar game called Ho Down in Hoochieville, where he drives around and picks up hookers.</p><p>Pig.</p><p>I drop onto Rory\u2019s bed and sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta ditch the Star Wars bedding if you ever expect to get laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right girl will accept me, Darth Vader and all,\u201d Rory says, thumbing his controller.</p><p>Trying to block out images of Sunday night\u2019s almost kiss and trying to forget how Jack said I could go to college\u2014which further proves he and I will never work out\u2014I cuddle with Rory\u2019s Chewbacca stuffed animal and watch him play his video game that is effectively setting women\u2019s rights back a hundred years.</p><p>\u201cI heard you ate lunch with Jack yesterday,\u201d Rory says.</p><p>\u201cIt was more like he wanted to steal my roast beef sandwich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bet $20 that you\u2019ll hook up with him within a month.\u201d</p><p>I fall backward onto Rory\u2019s pillow, thinking about the past few days. Jack could be a first-class womanizer who\u2019s way out of my league...but he has a soft side. He calls his sister sweetheart and helps his mom with her cookbook. He brought me coffee just the way I like it. But I won\u2019t be one of the supposed one-night stands the maids talk about. Hell, he could\u2019ve hooked up with both Kelsey and Abby last weekend, and that was after flirting with me! But he\u2019s so nice...and he wasn\u2019t paying all that much attention to Kelsey at lunch...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on. That\u2019ll be an easy $20. I\u2019m not gonna hook up with him,\u201d I say.</p><p>Rory pauses his game. \u201cJust be careful. He won\u2019t give you the kind of relationship you deserve.\u201d</p><p>My friend is telling the truth, but embarrassment washes over me nevertheless.</p><p>\u201cWell, just for that, I\u2019m not gonna tell you the great gossip I\u2019ve got on you, Ror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He starts playing his game again. \u201cDid someone tell you how I acted out a scene from Call Me When Your Mom Is Back in Town\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I say. \u201cSomebody likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I wish we could send that girl to Antarctica or something. I can\u2019t stand how Evelyn Treanor stalks me between classes and tries to pinch my butt. Who does that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Evelyn.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s pimp character picks up a hooker in a monster truck. \u201cWho is it then?\u201d he asks, sideswiping a pimpmobile.</p><p>\u201cVanessa Green.\u201d</p><p>He drops his controller and whips around, his mouth falling open. On the screen, his monster truck runs into a 7-11, flinging a bunch of bystanders into the air and causing a massive explosion.</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Should I talk to her or anything?\u201d</p><p>Rory pulls his bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m interested, but you don\u2019t have to say anything. I\u2019ll handle it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Rory replies with a shrug. He pushes his bangs off his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>But doesn\u2019t he want to be in control of something like this? Doesn\u2019t he want to put himself out there?</p><p>\u201cWould you take her to dinner or something?\u201d I ask. \u201cA girl like that\u2014you gotta take her somewhere fancy in Nashville, not Tennessee Ballers. Where are you gonna get the money for a date like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d find the money.\u201d</p><p>He abandons the hooker game to stand and pace around the room, pausing to check his floppy brown hair in the mirror. I love that Rory says he\u2019d find the money. It\u2019s black and white for him: if he wants to take a girl on a fancy date, he\u2019ll find a way to make it happen.</p><p>Would Jack ever take a risk for me?</p><p>An Honorable Man</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Jodi, the Goodwins\u2019 chef, is pacing back and forth across the Hillcrest common room. Cindy still isn\u2019t feeling well. She\u2019s lying on the couch while Dad massages her feet and makes her drink water. He thinks she\u2019s dehydrated. The other bad news is that we\u2019re short-staffed for Mr. Goodwin\u2019s fancy dinner party tonight.</p><p>If Cindy calls out of work sick tonight, it sure won\u2019t make our family look good. It would truly suck if Dad lost his new job.</p><p>\u201cMom, let me help,\u201d Ethan, Jodi\u2019s thirteen-year-old son, says. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you owned a tux maybe you could serve,\u201d Jodi replies.</p><p>\u201cLet me take Cindy\u2019s place,\u201d I interrupt, standing up.</p><p>Everyone stares at me. Working in the kitchens during a fancy Goodwin dinner is the last thing I want to do, but I can\u2019t let Cindy get fired.</p><p>\u201cYou can be a server,\u201d Jodi says, nodding at me. \u201cJust follow Paula\u2019s lead and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Cindy says to me, clutching her stomach. Dad gives me a kind smile, looking grateful as he places his hand over Cindy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d I say, but it is. I can\u2019t imagine serving Jack twice in one day.</p><p>Cindy loans me one of her maid uniforms, because unlike at breakfast, I have to put my Goodwin game face on. The blue dress hangs below my knees and if I look straight down, I can see my bra.</p><p>Super embarrassing. God, why did Dad have to get Cindy pregnant?</p><p>Up at the manor house, Ethan is helping his mom plate the salads while Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin greet their guests in the parlor. Paula is filling carafes with wine. Jack is hiding out in the kitchen, sneaking bites of everything Jodi is cooking. He pops a shrimp in his mouth and she smacks his hand. \u201cFor the third time, get out of my kitchen!\u201d Ethan and I crack up when Jack steals a piece of cornbread behind Jodi\u2019s back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jodi hands me a water pitcher and tells me to go fill the glasses in the dining room. I pour water into a glass and I\u2019m moving on to the next place setting when a handsome guy I\u2019ve never seen before stumbles through the doorway. He appears to be twenty or so. His black suit, blazing red tie, and shiny shoes just scream power.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the goddamned bathroom?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cDown the hall to your left,\u201d I reply quietly, taken aback by his behavior. I start toward the kitchen to see what else Jodi needs me to do but he takes me by the elbow and turns me around. I smell alcohol on his breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Marcus Winchester.\u201d He puffs his chest out like he\u2019s more important than Prince William then scans my body. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the Goodwins keep you hidden away.\u201d</p> <p>You have got to be kidding me.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say, cradling the water pitcher against my chest, and try to head toward the kitchen, but he doesn\u2019t let go of my arm.</p><p>He looks down at my uniform, well, more specifically, down my dress, because it\u2019s way too big.</p><p>I have a sudden urge to throw this water on Marcus\u2014but if I do that, my dad and Cindy might get fired and we would have to leave before the baby is born and we might not find more work and where would we live and oh holy God\u2014help.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m needed in the kitchen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re needed here.\u201d Marcus laughs softly, squeezing my arm harder. \u201cDon\u2019t you want a kiss? I\u2019ll give you another chance, even though a bad girl like you doesn\u2019t deserve my forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>Who the hell does he think he is?</p><p>Marcus leans in and I\u2019m debating whether or not to toss the water on him when Jack appears in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d I blurt.</p><p>Marcus releases my arm and I step away, panting, my tongue heavy and dry. I shake my head at Jack, trying to show him that Marcus is the last thing I want.</p><p>\u201cMarcus, meet Savannah. She\u2019s one of my good friends,\u201d Jack says with the hint of a threat in his voice.</p> <p>I step away, my hands shaking as I continue pouring water into glasses. I breathe in and out. It\u2019s only a couple hours. I can handle a couple of hours. My hands go from shaky to earthquaky in a matter of seconds and I can\u2019t imagine how pissed Mrs. Goodwin will be if I drop this glass pitcher on her hardwood floor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re friends with your servants?\u201d Marcus asks, raising his eyebrows. His eyes are red and hazy. \u201cMy servants clean my toilet.\u201d</p><p>Jack grabs Marcus\u2019s elbow. \u201cC\u2019mon, we\u2019ve got a great bourbon collection you should see.\u201d</p><p>A minute later, Jack reappears by my side and takes the water pitcher from my hands.</p><p>\u201cDid Marcus hurt you?\u201d he murmurs, placing the pitcher on a sideboard.</p><p>I hate that Marcus questioned whether Jack could be friends with a servant like me. And all I can think about is how Jack looked at me today when he found out I\u2019m not going to college. Like I\u2019m this pathetic little bee, swarming around, with no thoughts and dreams of my own. Marcus Winchester and his I\u2019m-a-rich-person-so-I-can-do-whatever-I-want attitude reminds me of horrible Mr. Cates.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you invite such a Neanderthal to dinner?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s working on a business deal with his father.\u201d Jack pulls a handkerchief out of his suit pocket and dabs it on my face, and I cover his hand with mine, searching his eyes. It feels nice being comforted by him, and I wish I could stay in this moment, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m pissed.</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s okay if Marcus humiliates me because your dad does business with his father? That sucks.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s face drops and he furrows his eyebrows. He takes his hand off my face then walks around the table and finishes pouring water into each glass. Him taking over my chore is a nice concession, but can that really make up for what happened?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jack replies. \u201cBut Dad\u2019s always harping on me about how I should learn to do stuff for myself before college starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why he tried to teach you how to do laundry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard about that, huh?\u201d He leans around the flower arrangement to grin at me.</p><p>\u201cI hear everything,\u201d I say, sniffling into his handkerchief. It smells like him. \u201cThe maids gossip about you all the time in Hillcrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about the walk through the rose garden with the country singer and you picking thorns out of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you, son.\u201d Mr. Goodwin appears in the dining room wearing a gray suit like Jack\u2019s. \u201cI want you to talk to George about business school\u2014\u201d He gazes from me to the water pitcher in Jack\u2019s hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>I hold my breath and bite down on the handkerchief.</p><p>Jack lays a hand on his father\u2019s shoulder and speaks quietly to him. I hear the words \u201cMarcus\u201d and \u201cdickhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Mr. Goodwin asks me.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d I nod quickly.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to be relieved? I\u2019m sure we can find someone else to serve us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Cindy needs the money.</p><p>\u201cGood. Why don\u2019t you head back into the kitchen to see if Jodi needs anything.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not like I expected Mr. Goodwin to throw Marcus out of the house, not with a big business deal with Marcus\u2019s father on the line, but I can\u2019t help feeling a tiny bit betrayed anyway. But this is how our world works\u2014rich people like Marcus and Jack can do as they want, while people like me serve them coffee and hope they will treat us nicely.</p><p>I leave the dining room and hide in the same cranny I did this morning to calm down, but also to hear what else they say in case they mention selling Star again.</p><p>\u201cI see the way you look at Savannah,\u201d I hear Mr. Goodwin saying quietly.</p><p>What?! How does Jack look at me?</p><p>Mr. Goodwin goes on, \u201cYou better not do that tonight during dinner. You know how much I want this deal with Winchester...and I\u2019d rather you not piss off his daughter by being more interested in Savannah than her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Dad...Savannah and I...we\u2019ve just been working on a school project together.\u201d</p><p>Lies.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this project?\u201d</p><p>A long pause. \u201cWe have to tell the school where we want to be in five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where do you want to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting my MBA and working for you. I hope I\u2019ll have a winning horse by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d Mr. Goodwin asks.</p><p>Jack pauses for several seconds. \u201cWhen you were my age, where did you want to be in five years?\u201d</p><p>I peek around the corner to see Mr. Goodwin checking his tie in the window reflection. \u201cIn a woman\u2019s bed, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s where I want to be in five years too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare you to write that on your project.\u201d Mr. Goodwin straightens Jack\u2019s blue tie and dusts his shoulders off. \u201cPlease be on your best behavior tonight. Don\u2019t eat all the bread before anyone else gets any, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel man, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just really like Jodi\u2019s bread.\u201d</p><p>I rush to the kitchen, breathing in and out. I set the water pitcher down and bury his handkerchief in my apron pocket. Forget about him, Savannah.</p><p>I\u2019m cradling a wine carafe as everyone files into the dining room.</p><p>Mrs. Goodwin and Mrs. Winchester are wearing chic suits, and Abby Winchester and Shelby look straight out of a movie with their sparkly cocktail dresses. My awful blue maid\u2019s uniform makes me want to jump out the window. A man with stark white hair, Mr. Winchester seems like one of those guys whose ego fills an entire room. Jack steps forward to shake his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t get a chance to speak in Cincinnati the other day.\u201d The man searches Jack\u2019s face and fiercely squeezes his hand. Looks painful.</p><p>\u201cI was busy with my horse,\u201d Jack says.</p><p>Mr. Winchester sips his drink. Looks like he\u2019s been checking out the famous bourbon collection. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he lost. He should\u2019ve won, considering his pedigree. Sometimes the breeding doesn\u2019t work out like we hope it will.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment stains Jack\u2019s face redder than the wine I\u2019m holding. Mr. Winchester drops his hand and Jack moves to pull out Abby\u2019s seat and helps her to sit down. She smiles at him over her shoulder as he scoots her chair in. She really is pretty, and elegant, but she looks breakable, like one of Cindy\u2019s angel figurines.</p><p>I fill wine glasses while Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Winchester start talking business. Marcus makes eyes at me from the other side of the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to your sister\u2019s birthday party this weekend,\u201d Abby says quietly to Jack. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have a chance to explore your farm? Alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if we should do that,\u201d Jack says slowly. \u201cNot alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, um.\u201d He pauses to cough. \u201cIt\u2019s haunted.\u201d</p><p>I purse my lips so I won\u2019t burst out laughing. Cedar Hill is not haunted.</p><p>\u201cWhose ghost is it?\u201d Abby asks.</p><p>\u201cUm, there are three ghosts?\u201d Jack says.</p><p>\u201cThree. Hmm.\u201d She playfully narrows her eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s a woman in a white dress. Um, her name is Moaning Myrtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stole that from Harry Potter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>She glances over at Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Winchester, who are busy arguing about who makes better trucks: Ford or Chevy. \u201cYou could protect me from the ghosts,\u201d she says, and leans toward Jack. His face suddenly goes stark white. I was wrong. Maybe we do have ghosts at Cedar Hill.</p><p>Is she touching him under the table? Jesus Lord.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you owned Paradise Park?\u201d Jack rushes to ask Mr. Winchester. His voice sounds squeaky.</p><p>Mr. Winchester stirs his cocktail. \u201cThe racetrack has been in my family since 1877.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that it hasn\u2019t been sold and resold over and over again,\u201d Jack says.</p><p>Mr. Winchester seems impressed by the observation. \u201cMany tracks do change ownership, yes, but my racetrack is an important part of my heritage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you want to sell it?\u201d Jack asks Mr. Winchester.</p><p>He wants to sell Paradise Park! How can he just give up a track that\u2019s been in his family for more than century? That\u2019s crazy. If Mr. Goodwin suddenly decided to give up Cedar Hill, I\u2019d cart him straight to a psychiatrist.</p><p>I pause and stare. Mrs. Goodwin clears her throat and nods her head, indicating I should get back to work. I set the wine bottle on a sideboard and begin helping Paula pass out salads.</p><p>Mr. Winchester smiles at Jack. \u201cNone of my kids want to take over the business and I want to retire. I want to play golf and spend time with my kids and my grandkids.\u201d He reaches out and touches Abby\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve spent too much of my life away from my family. There\u2019s nothing more important.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Jack tells Mr. Winchester, and Abby swoons so hard I\u2019m surprised she doesn\u2019t melt into a puddle.</p><p>I go back into the kitchen to get another bottle of wine and a breadbasket. When I reenter the dining room, Mr. Winchester is speaking again.</p><p>\u201cI want my track to go to a family that has integrity,\u201d Mr. Winchester goes on. \u201cI want somebody who will treat it as his own and take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Jack says, sneaking a glance at his father. Mr. Goodwin\u2019s face is stoic, unmoving.</p> <p>\u201cHonor is important, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d Mr. Winchester asks as he shakes his glass, rattling the ice. I can\u2019t believe a man like Winchester has honor if he allows his son to treat girls like shit.</p><p>Jack looks up at my face before saying, \u201cI agree, sir.\u201d Abby sees him looking at me and scrunches her eyebrows together.</p><p>\u201cI remember when I met your father,\u201d Mr. Winchester says to Jack. \u201cIt was at my track, and he was a teenager. Your father kept saying how much he loved Churchill Downs and how he wanted to own his own racetrack. I liked that. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m willing to entertain your family\u2019s offer for Paradise Park.\u201d</p><p>I suck down a gasp. Mr. Goodwin and Jack sit there with impassive looks on their faces, quintessential businessmen.</p><p>So the business deal is that Mr. Goodwin wants to buy a commercial racetrack. Wow. I can\u2019t even imagine owning my own horse and they want to buy an entire track? Is this why Jack has to suck up to Abby Winchester all the time?</p> <p>What if Mr. Winchester wants Abby to marry Jack, so they can keep Paradise Park in the family, so to speak?</p><p>That\u2019s when Mr. Winchester snaps his fingers and points at his wine glass. After I\u2019ve refilled his glass, he doesn\u2019t thank me. Marcus gives me a lewd glance, licking his lower lip. Perv.</p><p>The Winchesters are the epitome of rich people.</p><p>How do the maids serve people like these assholes all the time?</p><p>Later that night back in my room, I carefully dig my memory box out from my top dresser drawer, open the lid, and pull out a weathered envelope that\u2019s spotted yellow with age. Before she died, my mother wrote me a letter and asked Dad to give it to me on my sixteenth birthday.</p><p>She told me how smart and beautiful I am, and that I can do anything I want if I work hard enough, that I can go down in history.</p> <p>I needed to hear those words after everything that happened today.</p><p>All I can think about are Marcus\u2019s eyes staring down my dress. Mr. Goodwin basically telling Jack I\u2019m not good enough for him. Why is it, when something bad happens to you, you can never forget about it no matter how much you want to?</p><p>When Mr. Cates announced he was selling Moonshadow, I cried and begged Dad to find a way to buy her so she could stay with me. I rode her every day before school and groomed her after. Moonshadow took care of me after Mom died and I helped her move on after her foal got sold. I was her home, and she was mine. Even though Mr. Cates said Moonshadow wasn\u2019t worth the cost of grain to feed her, Dad still couldn\u2019t afford to buy her.</p><p>And then she was gone and later I heard what happened to her...</p><p>I shake my head quickly, squeezing my eyes shut.</p><p>These terrible memories are branded in me, and every time they pop up in my mind, my body goes cold and clammy and I wish I could yell at somebody.</p><p>I wish I could go back in time and demand that Mr. Cates keep Moonshadow, tell him I\u2019ll work for free for as long as it takes to save her.</p><p>Before I know what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m running out of Hillcrest in the direction of Greenbriar, ripping through the cool night air. At the barn, I light a lantern and move to the fourth stall on the right. A pair of brilliant brown eyes meet mine. Star keeps his distance until I cluck my tongue, and then he\u2019s right there beside me, nuzzling his nose against my neck, zapping the bad memories away.</p> <p>The Race and a Change of Pace</p><p>\u201cYou can do better than that! That was complete shit, Barrow. Complete shit!\u201d</p><p>Gael shouts at me as I pass the clocker\u2019s tower, and I\u2019m grinning like crazy. I steer Star over to them, his hooves crunching the dirt.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Gael. You know that was perfect.\u201d Dad shakes his head at my behavior, but Gael laughs. \u201cWhat was my time?\u201d</p><p>\u201c1:43,\u201d Dad says, giving me a smile. \u201cStar did really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hear that, buddy?\u201d I say, rubbing the colt\u2019s sweaty neck. Star pins his ears and snorts when Dad reaches out to rub his nose.</p><p>My father laughs and shoves the colt\u2019s face away from him. \u201cI know why you and Star get along so well. You were a brat just like him when you were a toddler.\u201d</p><p>I smile as Star jerks his head around. He swishes his tail back and forth.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you some food,\u201d I tell the horse, clucking my tongue to urge him into a canter, passing the grandstands and the giant green Rolex clock. On the way to the barns, I see Jack standing with his father. His dad writes in a notebook while Jack yawns and checks his watch. Neither of them cheers for me and Star, and that\u2019s okay\u2014everyone\u2019s getting used to the rapport I have with the horse. We\u2019re last week\u2019s news.</p><p>This week\u2019s news is whether Star can get his first win today here at Keeneland. He\u2019s running in The Dogwood, a race for horses that haven\u2019t won more than two. I\u2019d say he\u2019s got a good shot, considering his breeding and all our hard work. The purse is $85,000. This should be easy peasy, considering how well he\u2019s run in the past week.</p><p>An outrider on an Appaloosa pony comes trotting up to me. She smiles and pats Star\u2019s neck as the pony and Star sniff each other.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a beautiful horse,\u201d the woman says, letting Star smell the back of her hand. The colt nips at her fingers, acting silly. He nickers and nuzzles her thigh. \u201cA flirt too, huh?\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrow. \u201cNot usually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck today,\u201d the outrider says to Star, and I squeeze the horse\u2019s girth with both heels to move us toward the barn.</p><p>I meet Dad and Rory there, cool Star down, and help groom the horses before their races. I have a good feeling about today. Keeneland is a beautiful track\u2014it\u2019s near the Maker\u2019s Mark distillery, and it\u2019s nestled in the most beautiful rolling green hills you\u2019ve ever seen. Scotland can kiss Lexington\u2019s ass, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>In his job as acting owner of Cedar Hill, Jack entered Lucky Strikes in a race called The Fort Harrod, which has a purse of half a mil. Every time I\u2019ve seen Jack this week, he\u2019s been talking about it, and it\u2019s clear he wants to impress his father by taking risks and getting some big wins.</p><p>About half an hour before Star\u2019s race, Bryant Townsend comes into the stall to see how we\u2019re doing. As soon as he steps inside, the horse charges him.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d I yank Star back by the bridle. \u201cNo.\u201d I pull him over to the window where he can look at the trees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to take this personally,\u201d Bryant says to Star, tightening his gloves.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I think I know what\u2019s wrong with him.\u201d And considering I\u2019ve seen horses scared of lawnmowers, bicycles, and dandelions, what I\u2019m about to tell Bryant isn\u2019t much of a stretch.</p><p>Dad and Rory poke their heads in the stall. \u201cYou know why he\u2019s skittish?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>\u201cMen freak him out.\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s eyebrows shoot straight up. \u201cHmm...Whitfield, Townsend, get out of here and let Savannah get the horse ready herself. We\u2019ll meet you at the paddock.\u201d</p><p>I feed Star some grain and let him have a bit of water before I throw his saddle and silks over my shoulder and we trek out to the paddock. When I get there, I find Dad talking quietly to Jack.</p><p>\u201cShortcake, tell Jack what you think\u2019s wrong with his horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s scared of boys...\u201d</p><p>A confused but intrigued look crosses Jack\u2019s face. He narrows his eyes at Star.</p><p>\u201cDad, help me get him saddled up,\u201d I say, but Jack shakes his head at him, pulls his phone from his pocket, and walks away as he talks. Wow, I never figured Jack would turn away from a problem. Dad keeps his distance as I begin tacking the horse up. I tie his lead to a post and move to his near side to start saddling him. I put his saddle pads on, but Star is becoming increasingly difficult to control without help from a second groom. He starts prancing and acting silly again.</p><p>That\u2019s when Jack reenters the paddock with Shelby, who\u2019s wearing a skirt and leather boots. He beckons me with two fingers. I leave Star tied to the post and go see what they want.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Shelby turned thirteen today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I reply. \u201cHappy Birthday!\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks blush pink. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now that she\u2019s thirteen, it\u2019s time she started working,\u201d Jack says, hugging her from behind.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not working on my birthday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m boss of the farm this year,\u201d Jack says.</p><p>\u201cIf you make me work, I\u2019ll tell everyone you still sleep with your little Raggedy Andy doll under your pillow.\u201d</p><p>The horsemen stop talking. The horses stop moving. Everyone looks at Jack. I burst out laughing along with everybody else.</p><p>\u201cRaggedy Andy?\u201d I say.</p><p>His cheeks puff like a chipmunk\u2019s. \u201cCan you help Savannah, please?\u201d he asks his sister, exasperated. \u201cWe really need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Shelby asks.</p><p>\u201cI think Star hates boys,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I need help tacking him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, why didn\u2019t you just say so, Jack? I figured you wanted me to muck out a stall or something.\u201d Shelby sashays over to Star in her skirt.</p><p>Other horsemen in the paddock seem amused that a horse owner\u2019s daughter is taking charge. Star behaves like a polite gentleman while Shelby and I finish getting him saddled up. And before I know it, it\u2019s post time.</p><p>Bryant Townsend mounts the horse, and sure enough, Star starts acting like a brat as they trot up to the starting gate.</p><p>Jack beckons for me to walk with him up to the finish line. Our fathers and Gael trail behind us, and Shelby returns to the grandstands to sit with her mother.</p><p>\u201cStand with me,\u201d Jack says. Then he drops a hand onto my shoulder and squeezes, not taking his eyes off the starting gate.</p><p>The gates crash open and the horses erupt into the race. Star comes out clean and charges ahead with the other horses. \u201cYeah!\u201d Jack screams. The pack makes the first turn together, leaving a wake of brown dust. The field spreads out on the backstretch. Star stays with the lead group as they navigate the far turn.</p><p>\u201cYou got it, boy!\u201d I yell.</p><p>Red Delight streaks to the front of the pack. Getting the Dream falls back into third. Star moves forward into the seventh position. On the straightaway, as they\u2019re charging for the finish line, I\u2019m gripping Jack\u2019s arm and bouncing up and down.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d I scream, and I swear, Star looks over at me and kicks it into high gear. He manages to pass Raising the Flag and Mixed Appeal but ends up in fifth place overall. Dammit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I crouch to the ground, covering my eyes. How could he lose? I kept him calm all the way up until the race. He was happy, he was fed, he was raring to go.</p><p>\u201c1:47,\u201d I hear Gael saying.</p><p>Damn. He added four seconds onto his time. I dig the heels of my hands into my eyes and pray that Mr. Goodwin doesn\u2019t make Jack sell Star. Pray, pray, pray.</p><p>I feel gentle hands cupping my elbows and pulling me up from the ground. Jack lifts my chin and looks in my eyes. \u201cHow much do you weigh?\u201d</p> <p>My eyebrows pop up. \u201cWhat? Wh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me\u2014what do you weigh?\u201d</p><p>Why is he asking me this? I know exactly what I weigh (102 pounds), but I won\u2019t let on that I care. \u201cI dunno, a hundred pounds or so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a jockey\u2019s license?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p> <p>\u201cGet her an apprentice license,\u201d Jack tells Gael. \u201cStart the paperwork tonight.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d Dad starts.</p><p>\u201cI want to see what she\u2019s got during a real race,\u201d Jack interrupts.</p><p>\u201cSon, Savannah has no experience\u2014\u201d Mr. Goodwin says.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s better than most men,\u201d Jack replies. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d allow Gael to put just any exercise boy on my horse? Clearly it\u2019s been working out during practice, and that\u2019s why Gael and Danny are gonna start training her for real tomorrow morning. I want her trained up and ready to go before Kentucky Downs, understand?\u201d</p> <p>Kentucky Downs is next week. Oh God.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s a girl,\u201d Dad says.</p><p>\u201cGirls have been jockeys before,\u201d Jack says. \u201cA woman won the Santa Anita Handicap two years ago. And Rosie Napravnik has over a hundred wins.\u201d</p><p>My heart slams into my chest.</p><p>Dad shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous and I want more for her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis would be more for her,\u201d Jack says, standing up tall. \u201cIf she\u2019s able to get her license and win a race, she\u2019d get a percentage of the purse.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never heard Jack speak so authoritatively. Mr. Goodwin rubs his chin, looking from his son to me.</p><p>\u201cAre you just going to stand there?\u201d Dad says to Mr. Goodwin.</p> <p>\u201cStar is my son\u2019s investment and he\u2019s in charge. I gave my opinion, but he makes the calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my daughter,\u201d Dad growls.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting her license\u2014\u201d Jack says.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I yell, and the men turn to face me. Boys. They can\u2019t even be bothered to ask what I want. \u201cDad, I\u2019d love to get my license. Riding is what I want to do\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dad slaps a scowl on his face. \u201cSavannah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with getting a license? I could start training and see if I\u2019m good enough. I want to see Star win.\u201d</p><p>Gael nods. \u201cI\u2019ll do the paperwork today. Since she\u2019s over sixteen years old and I\u2019ll sponsor her, it won\u2019t be a problem to get an apprentice license in a hurry. She can start training first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Dad says to Jack, \u201cSavannah has no experience and you want her to race a priceless horse\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t priceless,\u201d Jack says. He\u2019s several inches taller than Dad, but my father is smart, quick, and strong, so he doesn\u2019t even flinch at Jack\u2019s display of Alpha maleness. \u201cI paid a lot for him to be born and I want to see him win some races. I want Savannah trained as a jockey. Go big or go home.\u201d</p><p>He nods at me, and I bounce on my toes. Racing horses is even better than being a full-time exercise rider. I could fly!</p><p>Not to mention I could make a percentage of the purse! I could help Dad pay off debt from Mom\u2019s medical bills. I could help give my little sister a better life. I clasp my hands together, excited at the prospect of racing horses for a living. Why have I never thought about this before?</p><p>To get a full-blown jockey\u2019s license, I think I\u2019ll have to race in something like forty races as an apprentice under instruction of a trainer.</p><p>\u201cI want you back in the barns right now,\u201d Dad says to me in a low voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this in private.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen him so pissed. I turn right around and hightail it toward the barns.</p><p>\u201cSavannah!\u201d Jack calls out. \u201cTomorrow! Five a.m.\u201d</p><p>Whether Dad likes it or not, I\u2019ll be there.</p><p>Back in the barn, I pace back and forth across Star\u2019s stall, waiting for Rory to get done hot-walking him.</p><p>Dad appears and leads me away from the horses before he rips into me.</p><p>\u201cThis is way too dangerous to even think about. Isn\u2019t being an exercise rider enough for you?\u201d Dad asks, grasping my shoulder.</p><p>A few weeks ago, yeah\u2014it was enough. But I never imagined I\u2019d stand by the racetrack and dig into a hot dog beside horse owners. I never imagined Jack would question why I\u2019m not going to college. I never imagined a guy like him might try to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cIt seems like I should try,\u201d I say. \u201cYou just said a few minutes ago that you want more for me. Well, this would be.\u201d</p><p>Dad kisses the top of my head and embraces me tight. \u201cRemember the Derby last year? Seven jockeys got thrown from their horses. Seven! Jockeys die every year. And Aaron Riddle was paralyzed not long ago. He\u2019ll be on a respirator the rest of his life. Max Jackson fell off a horse and broke his collarbone, his legs, his arm, and had a brain bleed! Do you know what that would do to me if I saw you like that? I\u2019ve already seen your mother die\u2014\u201d Dad chokes on his words.</p><p>\u201cI get what you\u2019re saying. I really do. And I\u2019d hate to hurt you. This sport has never been safe or easy. But when you already have nothing, shouldn\u2019t you take a risk to try to find something better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut people get hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose jockeys weren\u2019t riding a Goodwin horse,\u201d I say, working to keep my voice steady. Cedar Hill Farms isn\u2019t located in Tennessee just because. The Franklin area is full of limestone, and it runs into the water supply, and it gives the horses stronger bones. That\u2019s why the best horses in the world live in Tennessee and Kentucky.</p><p>I go on, \u201cYou know Mr. Goodwin would never put an injured horse on the track. That reduces my risk right there. And I\u2019d never get on an injured horse. That\u2019s why so many jockeys get hurt\u2014they ride a horse that shouldn\u2019t be on the track in the first place. You know that, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He throws his head back, thinking. He knows I have a point. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if anything happens to you.\u201d</p><p>I can tell he\u2019s thinking of how we lost my mother. But we have to keep moving. I mumble, \u201cThis could be good for us. For our future.\u201d</p><p>His eyes meet mine and he goes very still. \u201cBefore we agree to your being trained, I\u2019m gonna talk to Mr. Goodwin about insurance options.\u201d</p><p>I hug him as hard as I can.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re stopping at Arby\u2019s on the way home,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cUgh, you know I hate Arby\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Rory appears with Star and asks, \u201cDid somebody say Arby\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>I spend the next hour helping to bathe and brush the horses before we set out for home. My whole goddamned life has changed in a day. And I kind of like the high.</p><p>The Dance, Truth or Dare, and Beef Jerky</p><p>It\u2019s Saturday evening and I could be out at a perverted taco restaurant, but I\u2019m hiding behind Shelby\u2019s birthday tent. Just call me Super Loser.</p><p>When I got home from Keeneland earlier today, a large white tent was set up in the clearing between the racetrack and the manor house. Decorators and servers were busy arranging dishes and flowers and lights.</p><p>One section of the tent is decked out like a nightclub, complete with a large neon sign that blinks SHELBY over and over like the window of a liquor store. The tablecloths are black and blue. Middle schoolers are dancing and sliding across the dance floor in their socked feet. A DJ is teaching them to dance.</p><p>I salivate when I see the chocolate fountain.</p><p>The other half of the tent\u2014the side for adults\u2014is elegant, with silk gold tablecloths, succulent flower arrangements, and a champagne fountain.</p><p>Good God, how many food fountains do these people have? Is there a ranch dressing fountain? Where\u2019s the Diet Coke fountain?</p><p>If I went to college, would I be the kind of person who gets an invite to a Goodwin party?</p><p>Jack is standing on the adult side of the tent, holding a cocktail glass filled with amber-colored liquor. His blond hair is slicked back with gel and it\u2019s like he was born to wear that tux. He\u2019s talking to an older man, giving him his full attention. I\u2019ve seen him in the newspaper. I think it\u2019s the Tennessee governor.</p><p>When Jack finishes speaking with the governor, he looks across the tent. I follow his line of sight to Abby Winchester, who\u2019s sitting at a table and staring at Jack. Obviously.</p><p>He sets the cocktail glass on a server\u2019s tray, rubs his palms together, and heads for Abby. The Fairest of the Fair.</p><p>The band begins playing a slow song. Jack leads her out onto the dance floor and pulls her up against his chest. They move fluidly, and unlike me, she clearly knows how to do fancy dances like the waltz. He laughs at whatever she\u2019s saying, probably making her feel like she\u2019s the only girl at the party. Like how I feel when I\u2019m around him.</p><p>My heart pounds so hard it hurts. He said nothing was going on with Abby, but he\u2019s dancing so close to her they could share skin. Is a business deal worth that much to him?</p><p>I trudge back to the Hillcrest common room and sit down at the computer we all share. I start messaging with Vanessa Green, chatting about Keeneland today, telling her how I\u2019m getting an apprentice jockey\u2019s license.</p><p>At the same time, I scroll through my Facebook wall. Looks like a few juniors I met this week are going to the Back to School dance tonight in the gym.</p><p>Savannah Barrow: are you going to this dance?</p><p>Vanessa Green: NOOOO. seniors don\u2019t go to the back to school dance. we only go to homecoming, winter wonderland, and prom. homecoming is in October. it\u2019s a big deal. Guys ask girls in fancy ways\u2014like last year this super hot senior asked kelsey by hiring an airplane to fly a banner over the school that said, Kelsey, will you go to Homecoming with me?</p><p>Savannah Barrow: did she say yes?</p><p>Vanessa Green: obvs. who wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>Savannah Barrow: I wish I could go to the Back to School dance.</p><p>Vanessa Green: LOL. No you don\u2019t.</p><p>Savannah Barrow: But I do. Come with me!</p><p>Vanessa Green: NO. Are you crazy?</p><p>Savannah Barrow: I can get Rory to come...</p><p>Vanessa Green: ...............I\u2019m in.</p><p>Even though Rory\u2019s working on a new screenplay, it only takes me about five seconds to convince him to come with us. Two weeks ago, I never could\u2019ve imagined I\u2019d hang out with a girl like Vanessa Green. I never even considered a girl like her might like my friend.</p><p>My life is changing so fast, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to wake up tomorrow to find the sun rising in the west.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old for this shit,\u201d Colton says, as we all take off our boots and shoes. It\u2019s against the rules to wear them on the gym floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Vanessa told Colton she was coming to the dance with me and Rory, he insisted on coming because his father the Franklin mayor is having a reelection event at their house and Colton hates glad-handing.</p><p>Rory mutters to me, \u201cThis better be worth it. I was making good progress on my new screenplay, Tattoos of the Clinically Depressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate dances,\u201d Colton says, lifting his nose in the air like he just smelled a pile of manure.</p><p>Vanessa rolls her eyes at Colton. \u201cGo take a nap over there, then,\u201d she replies, pointing at the bleachers.</p> <p>His eyes light up. \u201cGreat idea.\u201d He hustles over to the bleachers, sits down, leans his head back, crosses his feet and arms, and places his ball cap over his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen we first met,\u201d Vanessa says, \u201cI asked Colton what his hobbies were, and he replied, \u2018Sleeping and TV.\u2019\u201d</p><p>We laugh together as I take in the scene. \u201cWe are definitely the oldest people here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be wearing Depends undergarments before you know it.\u201d</p><p>I laugh with her. Rory looks over at us, and when he sees her smiling, he smiles too.</p> <p>\u201cWe could do what my brother and his friends used to do,\u201d Vanessa says.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee how fast we can get kicked out of the dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems pretty easy. All you\u2019d have to do is whip out a flask or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that\u2019s boring.\u201d She crooks her finger, beckoning Rory. He raises an eyebrow. \u201cLet\u2019s dance,\u201d she mouths.</p><p>She and Rory meet in the center of the gym and start dancing like I\u2019ve never seen dancing before. Popping and locking, doing the robot, grinding against each other. Kids crowd around them, laughing hysterically.</p> <p>\u201cThese young minds are gonna be scarred for life.\u201d</p><p>I whip around to find Jack standing there in a white T-shirt and faded jeans, barefoot. His hair is still slicked back with gel. I swallow, wishing I could touch his biceps and run my hands across his shirt. He looks yummier than a ranch dressing fountain.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask, folding my arms across my stomach. \u201cWhat about your sister\u2019s party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColton texted and said you guys were coming to the dance and I\u2019d rather do anything than watch a bunch of middle school kids try to act sexy.\u201d He looks around the gym. \u201cBut I sure as hell don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cBecause I like dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? I\u2019m a great dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd humble too.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a look.</p> <p>\u201cI know you\u2019re a good dancer,\u201d I say with a strong voice. \u201cI saw you with Abby Winchester tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were spying on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stalking me?\u201d he asks with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou lied. You said nothing was going on with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is going on with her.\u201d Jack finds my eyes. \u201cMy dad wants to buy Paradise Park from Abby\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He goes on, \u201cMy father thinks that if I piss Abby off, her dad will call off the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of sick. And what kind of businessman would base a decision on his daughter\u2019s feelings?\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugs. \u201cI know...but my dad wants this deal so bad. Winchester is so big on honor and family and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonor can\u2019t mean all that much to him considering Marcus\u2019s behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavannah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I trust that you aren\u2019t treating me great to my face so I\u2019ll take care of your horse? What if you hate me behind my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never hate you.\u201d He raises his hand to my cheek, but he drops it before making contact with my skin. \u201cThe stuff with Abby is embarrassing, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad expects too much of you.\u201d I poke him in the chest. \u201cWhen is this deal gonna be over, anyway? How long do you have to keep the Winchesters happy?\u201d</p><p>Jack drags a hand through his long hair. \u201cDad says Winchester\u2019ll be making his decision in the next couple of weeks. We should know soon if he accepts Dad\u2019s offer. It can\u2019t come soon enough, you know?\u201d He looks over at Rory and Vanessa. \u201cSo what\u2019s going on there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re gonna hook up tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh reallllly.\u201d He cups his mouth and yells, \u201cWay to go, Whitfield!\u201d</p><p>Rory flips Jack off.</p><p>\u201cDance with me,\u201d Jack says, striding to center court before I can give him an answer.</p><p>Kids quickly move out of his way as Jack stalks toward the middle of the gym. He parts people like the goddamned Red Sea. Girls stare at him like they\u2019d kidnap baby zoo animals in exchange for a dance.</p><p>Jack beckons me. I shake my head, smiling slightly. When that doesn\u2019t work, he waves his hand around like he\u2019s using a lasso. He pretends to capture me and tugs the imaginary rope, pretending to pull me out onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he mouths back, beaming.</p><p>I join Jack, Vanessa, and Rory, and we all start doing the worst dances anyone\u2019s ever seen. A lot of the junior guys glance my way, checking out my skinny jeans and the sparkly tank top I borrowed from Vanessa.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop laughing when Jack does \u201cthe robber.\u201d It\u2019s a dance where he mimes stealing things off shelves and shoving them in a make-believe bag.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get our picture made!\u201d Vanessa says, pointing at the \u00fcber cheesy setup next to the girls\u2019 locker room. Couples pay $10 to have their pictures taken together, because everybody wants to forever remember the Back-to-School dance in the high school gym. I groan as Vanessa grabs my arm and gestures for Rory and Jack to follow. Colton is still snoring away over on the bleachers.</p><p>The photo background is about the weirdest setup I\u2019ve ever seen. It has a strobe light, a disco ball, and a giant, inflatable drum set.</p><p>\u201cWow. Fancy and seizure-inducing,\u201d I say.</p><p>We do this ridiculous pose where Vanessa and I pretend we\u2019re a couple. She puts her hands on my waist and I stand with my back against her. The guys stand to either side of us, gaping, with eyes wide as supper plates.</p><p>Jack gives Rory a fist bump. \u201cThis is my dream come true.\u201d</p><p>As we\u2019re having the picture taken, Vanessa pinches my butt. I squeal and rip away, crashing spread-eagle into the inflatable drum set.</p><p>\u201cBadoom-chh,\u201d Rory says, as Vanessa and Jack die laughing.</p><p>The photographer rolls his eyes and checks his watch.</p><p>Jack helps me to my feet and leads us back out onto the dance floor. Vanessa starts grinding against me, well, trying to, but it\u2019s kind of impossible because we\u2019re doubled over laughing. Which of course gives Jack the opening he needs to do some really inappropriate dance moves. He pretends to do a strip tease, unbuttoning the top three buttons of his shirt.</p><p>Dr. Salter, the principal, comes up and taps Jack on the shoulder.</p><p>Jack says, \u201cOh shit!\u201d</p><p>Jack, Rory, and Vanessa take off running, so I dart after them, unable to keep the smile off my face. We\u2019re all laughing hysterically. We grab our shoes and boots, sprint out of the gym, and we\u2019re jogging toward the parking lot when Vanessa says, \u201cI forgot Colton! He probably slept through all of that.\u201d</p><p>She skips back inside, her blond hair swinging back and forth.</p><p>Jack is wiping his eyes, he\u2019s laughing so hard. \u201cDid you see the look on the principal\u2019s face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow he\u2019s going to associate me with you!\u201d I say, laughing. \u201cHe\u2019ll think I\u2019m some sort of stripper or something thanks to your dance moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a stripper.\u201d Jack loops his thumbs through his belt loops, giving me a wicked smile. \u201cMe, however...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times have I told you you\u2019re not a stripper?\u201d Colton says, walking up with an arm around Vanessa. He yawns.</p><p>\u201cIn my heart, I\u2019m an exotic dancer,\u201d Jack replies.</p><p>\u201cWhat. A. Dumbass,\u201d Vanessa says.</p><p>\u201cWe should go down to Miller\u2019s Hollow,\u201d Rory says, taking Vanessa\u2019s hand. I want to jump up and down I\u2019m so happy for him. \u201cI\u2019ll go pick up some food,\u201d Rory adds.</p><p>Colton yawns again and checks the time on his phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRide with me,\u201d Jack says to me, jingling his keys.</p><p>\u201cI should probably ride with Ror\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRide with Jack,\u201d Vanessa whispers to me. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Rory looks so enamored with her, he\u2019d probably go skydiving naked if she asked him to.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say to Jack, and we\u2019re off.</p><p>He opens the passenger-side door and helps me step up into his Ford truck. The excitement of being in his truck makes me tap my feet. It\u2019s huge, with all-leather beige interior. It\u2019s nothing like Rory\u2019s beat-up hand-me-down truck, with injured seats patched with duct tape. But Jack\u2019s truck has some character of its own. Like, loose change is everywhere\u2014in the cup holders, in the ashtray, on the floorboards. How can he just throw money around like this? A horse figurine hangs from the rearview mirror. His key chain holds a picture of his three hounds.</p><p>The truck smells like him, like cologne, and the seats are warm and cozy. We ride down the dark highways into the country, and he keeps the radio off and rolls down the windows, so we drive with only the sounds of trees rustling and cows mooing to entertain us.</p><p>Miller\u2019s Hollow is a wooded area way out past the baseball fields. It overlooks a dark pond. The cool night air is fresh and a little bit fishy, and the smell of pine makes me feel like Christmas.</p><p>When Rory and Vanessa arrive after getting snacks, he pulls out a paper bag full of beef jerky, chips, candy, and Cokes. Rory turns his truck radio up loud, blasting music, and we start dancing again. We all come from such different places, but we\u2019ve all ended up at Miller\u2019s Hollow tonight. And it never would have happened if I hadn\u2019t taken a risk, if I\u2019d stuck to the status quo, deciding to like people only based on where they come from, not who they are.</p><p>Vanessa dances in a circle, pouring Skittles into her mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s play Truth or Dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jack says, chowing down on beef jerky. \u201cTruth or Dare, Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever held hands with a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Rory replies. \u201cTruth or Dare, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever farted in class and blamed it on somebody else?\u201d</p><p>Rory and Jack start snickering like little boys and Vanessa and I roll our eyes at each other.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are ridiculous,\u201d Vanessa says. \u201cI want to play for real!\u201d</p><p>Jack grins. \u201cFine. Savannah, truth or dare?\u201d</p><p>The last thing I need is for Jack to ask me questions. \u201cDare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare you to kiss Vanessa on the lips,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaim as Vanessa shakes her head, looking disgusted.</p><p>\u201cYou are my hero.\u201d Rory gives Jack a fist bump then fishes his notepaper and pen out and starts jotting down notes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGreat, now we\u2019re gonna end up in a pervy movie script, Vanessa,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Jack smirks. \u201cIf you won\u2019t kiss Vanessa, then make out with Rory.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s head pops up. He looks sick.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019d be weird.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake out with Rory,\u201d Jack says, \u201cOr you\u2019ve gotta take a truth.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms.

He whispers in my ear, \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to practice my stage kissing for drama class!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell.\u201d</p><p>Rory twirls me around in a grand sweeping movement, but right as he\u2019s about to kiss me, he slides his hand between our mouths and makes all these overly dramatic movements, whipping his head around like an angry horse. From an outsider\u2019s perspective, it might look like kissing...or Rory devouring me whole.</p> <p>\u201cOw owwww!\u201d Vanessa squeals.</p><p>I start giggling against Rory\u2019s hand, and when he pulls away from me, Jack and Vanessa are clapping.</p><p>\u201cBravo!\u201d Vanessa says, laughing her ass off. \u201cRory.\u201d Her eyes pierce into his. \u201cTruth or dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare you to dance with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBo-ring,\u201d Jack says.</p> <p>Vanessa pulls Rory against her chest, and laughing, he leads her down closer to the water, where she wraps her arms around his neck and he kisses her deeply. That\u2019s no stage kiss. I look away, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI guess they\u2019re out of the game indefinitely,\u201d Jack says. Vanessa and Rory are full-fledged making out now.</p><p>\u201cGame\u2019s over, I guess,\u201d I say, and walk over to the clearing, where I can better see the stars.</p><p>Jack appears beside me, sticks his hands in his pockets, and gazes at the moon. \u201cTruth or dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare you to admit if you wanted to kiss me last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s against the rules!\u201d</p><p>My heart explodes, pounding like a train engine. Did he really just ask that? Is he under the influence of beef jerky or something?</p> <p>It\u2019s like, whenever we\u2019re not at Cedar Hill, we\u2019re normal. Normal people, normal friends, flirting like crazy. Playing waitress at his dinner party the other night seems a million miles away. He\u2019s not my boss out here under the stars.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your answer?\u201d Jack asks.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m on a bridge, about to bungee jump, wondering if the cord is strong enough to hold me. Jack\u2019s blue eyes find mine.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Without a word he leads me down by the banks of the pond, where we sit. My body\u2019s doing all the thinking as I curl my legs up beneath me, touching my knees against his warm thigh.</p><p>He touches my collarbone and gently sweeps his fingertips over my necklace. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>I suck in a deep breath and carefully remove the horseshoe necklace from his grasp. It\u2019s a cheap thing, really. It came from Claire\u2019s and probably didn\u2019t cost more than a few dollars. But it\u2019s worth everything. \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing my mom ever gave me.\u201d</p><p>Jack traces the necklace with a finger. Then he unclasps his watch, turns it over, and rubs his thumb across the engraved initials. JCG.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my grandfather\u2019s,\u201d Jack says.</p><p>\u201cHistory is important to you,\u201d I say quietly, touching the watch.</p><p>\u201cMy family, Cedar Hill\u2014they\u2019re my whole life.\u201d</p><p>I lean closer, snuggling under his arm, and rest a hand on his strong chest. Our breathing races out of control. He brushes my hair behind my ears and kisses my neck until I\u2019m shaking all over.</p><p>\u201cTruth or dare?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cDare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare you to kiss m\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth captures mine and teases me into a long kiss. He weaves his hands in my hair and pulls me closer as I run one hand over his knee and cup his neck with the other. His pulse slams against my palm. His strong hands sweep over my shoulders and thighs, leaving me tingly and warm and feeling beautiful. I wish this had been my first kiss. It\u2019s perfect.</p><p>At some point, Rory comes over and says that he and Vanessa are leaving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her home,\u201d Jack says, barely coming up for air.</p><p>Cindy warned me about Jack and his supposed one-night stands, but we never come close to that, even though I wouldn\u2019t mind him going up my shirt or climbing on top of me because I want to feel. His fingers don\u2019t wander under the hem of my T-shirt or below my waistband, and when he drives us home, he walks me to the door of Hillcrest, and after quickly gazing around to make sure we\u2019re alone, he slides his hands around my waist and kisses me goodnight.</p><p>I like him a lot.</p><p>If I had a genie in a bottle and wished for the perfect night, it couldn\u2019t be any better than this.</p><p>You Can\u2019t Help Who You Love</p><p>On Sunday morning after training, I walk over to Whitfield Farms so I can talk to Rory about what happened last night and get a guy\u2019s advice on what happens next. Should I tell Jack I really like him? Or should I be realistic and never bring it up again? Was last night a one-time thing because of our beef jerky-infused haze?</p><p>I ring the doorbell to the farmhouse and an older version of Rory answers the door. Same mess of floppy dark brown hair. Same tall muscular frame.</p><p>\u201cAre you Will?\u201d I ask, and he nods. I wasn\u2019t expecting to find him here since Rory said he\u2019s going to law school in Atlanta.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Savannah, the girl who\u2019s beating the hell out of the other exercise boys on the track, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>A small boy appears beside Will\u2019s leg. \u201cHey, bud, can you run find Rory and tell him he\u2019s got a visitor? He\u2019s out in the barn.\u201d The boy jets toward the back of the house and Will motions for me to follow him.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re getting a jockey\u2019s license,\u201d Will says. I grin and walk into the kitchen, where he\u2019s making a sandwich. \u201cWant one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDessert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re talking.\u201d</p><p>He rummages in a cabinet and slides a package of Chips Ahoy across the island to me.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing here?\u201d I ask. \u201cRory said you\u2019re in law school in Atlanta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wedding\u2019s next week. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s at her final wedding dress fitting with my mom and her mom. And I was forced to act as chauffeur.\u201d</p><p>I smile and clap my hands together. \u201cWhat does her dress look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it. That\u2019s bad luck, Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you hope it looks like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just as bad as the moms,\u201d Will says, continuing to grin. He adds tomato and lettuce to his ham sandwich, and slices it down the middle, creating triangles.</p><p>They\u2019re getting married next weekend at Whitfield Farms\u2014the same day of the races at Kentucky Downs, and according to Rory, Mrs. Goodwin has been going nuts discussing wedding decor with Mrs. Whitfield. The bride\u2019s family doesn\u2019t have much money and the Whitfields have had several bad seasons so they haven\u2019t taken many of Mrs. Goodwin\u2019s suggestions, but I\u2019m sure it will be a beautiful wedding.</p><p>I feel something pawing at my leg. I discover a red puppy at my feet. \u201cAww.\u201d I lift the puppy into my arms, but he starts barking like crazy and going nuts, so Will reaches across the table to take him from me. The dog immediately calms down, licks Will\u2019s face, and gives a big yawn.</p><p>\u201cThe dog hates me,\u201d I say, laughing softly.</p><p>Will takes another bite of his sandwich and talks through a mouthful. \u201cIt happens.\u201d He jiggles the puppy up and down on his knee.</p><p>\u201cThis reminds me of Star,\u201d I say. \u201cThe horse doesn\u2019t like boys. What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>Will laughs. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with him. He can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s just like with people. Sometimes we like certain people more than others and it\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d</p><p>I like Jack. A lot. And I wish I could stop liking him but my heart doesn\u2019t want that.</p><p>\u201cSo do you really think the Goodwins are gonna let you be their jockey at Kentucky Downs next week?\u201d Will asks.</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Will bites into his sandwich, smiling. \u201cIf that weren\u2019t the day of my wedding, I\u2019d love to see you race. I\u2019ve never seen a girl jockey.\u201d</p><p>I pause to eat a chocolate chip cookie. \u201cWhat made you decide to go to law school?\u201d</p><p>He feeds the puppy a small piece of ham. \u201cWell, I mean, teachers had been telling me since sixth grade that I was going to college. Because of my grades, you know?\u201d</p><p>No teachers have ever been like that with me. I guess my grades are okay, but nobody\u2019s going out of their way to tell me what to do with my life. Wait. I take that back. Adam, the guy I fooled around with in West Virginia, worked in the kitchens at the Best Value Inn next door to the casino, and he often said I could use him as a reference if I wanted to apply for a clerk position at the front desk.</p><p>\u201c...and I\u2019m going to law school \u2019cause I want to fight the big corporations that are buying up farmland and putting us small farms out of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever wish you had stayed here to work on the farm?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cGoing to law school will be better for my family in the long run.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. In a way, he\u2019s making an investment for the future, kind of like how I\u2019m becoming a jockey.</p><p>That\u2019s when Rory comes crashing through the back door with the small boy at his heels. \u201cCheerio is\u2014\u201d He stops to catch his breath. \u201cCheerio is about to drop her calf. Can you come help me and Bo?\u201d Rory asks Will. \u201cDad is still down at the co-op.\u201d</p><p>Will nods, stuffing the rest of his sandwich into his mouth. Still chewing, he hands the squirming puppy to me. It barks like crazy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come to the wedding, right? With Rory?\u201d Will asks, pointing at me. \u201cWe could use some girls to even the party out. We don\u2019t have a single girl cousin but we have about eight thousand guy cousins!\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>Rory puffs his chest out. \u201cI\u2019m Best Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet ten bucks he loses the rings,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNo bet,\u201d Will replies.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Rory says, grinning. \u201cBy the way, I called it. I knew you\u2019d hook up with Jack Goodwin.\u201d He rubs his fingers together, asking for the twenty bucks I owe him. I groan, and Rory tells me he\u2019ll come find me later, after he\u2019s done helping to birth the calf.</p><p>Instead of taking the road back to Cedar Hill, I decide to walk through Whitfield Farms and along the lake where I come upon a flock of geese. I love them. When they mate, they stay together for life. It\u2019s so sweet how they can barely stand being two feet apart. One time Dad and I saw a group of seven geese swimming together: four boys and three girls. I asked Dad where the fourth girl was, and he said she\u2019d probably died or got lost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What I wouldn\u2019t give to feel that sort of all-encompassing love. But is it safe? The boy goose will have to spend the rest of his life with a broken heart. Was the short time he had with the girl goose worth it?</p><p>I hope so. I wouldn\u2019t trade the time I shared with my mother. Or with Moonshadow.</p><p>I walk alongside the lake and soon I\u2019m on Goodwin land again. Jack\u2019s three hounds bound up to me, barking playfully. I glance around, expecting to find Jack because he\u2019s always with his dogs, and spot him sitting on a picnic table next to a pile of rocks. One by one, he hurls the rocks into the lake, watching them splash.</p><p>A grin spreads across my face. Remembering last night\u2019s kisses makes me shiver all over again. I take a deep breath, waiting for him to see I\u2019m here. But it looks like he\u2019s in a dream world. His eyes are hazy and withdrawn.</p> <p>I pull a deep breath through my nose and make my way over to the picnic table. The hounds flop down in the dirt and roll around like roly-polies.</p><p>Jack keeps staring at the lake, but he smiles when I sit down next to him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful out here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThor, Athena, and Jasper like the water.\u201d He gestures at the hounds. \u201cWe come here a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seem like good friends to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. Although Jasper isn\u2019t so much a friend as a frenemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just say frenemy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis past summer? I decided to take a swim in the lake. I took off all my clothes except my underwear, and then Jasper stole my shorts and T-shirt. I had to walk in the house wearing wet boxers.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, and Jack laughs too as Jasper looks up at us and cocks his head, probably wondering why we humans said his name. \u201cAnd then Yvonne started yelling at Jasper, telling the dog that only she\u2019s allowed to handle the family\u2019s laundry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed that. You know, the part about Yvonne yelling\u2014not you in your boxers...oh, um.\u201d My skin heats up and I shake the sexy images out of my head. \u201cWould you stop trying to distract me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking about my underwear distracts you? If only I\u2019d known that sooner.\u201d Jack grins fiendishly as he leans toward me, grabbing my wrist and rubbing it with the pad of his thumb.</p><p>I dip my head and move toward his mouth, wetting my lips. But he suddenly pulls away and focuses on the lake. I hold my breath.</p><p>\u201cSo, you and me...last night.\u201d He exhales deeply.</p><p>\u201cI liked it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did too...but I don\u2019t know how this is gonna work out. I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t, but I don\u2019t know how it will...\u201d</p><p>I yank away from him and stuff my hands between my knees again. Why did I lean in? Why was I so presumptuous to think he\u2019d want to kiss me again?</p><p>\u201cMy father called me to his office a little while ago,\u201d Jack says, nervously rapping his knuckles on the picnic tabletop. \u201cHe said that Mr. Winchester called to say thanks for dinner. Mr. Winchester said that I impressed him. And my dad was proud of me for that...and proud that I\u2019m becoming a responsible farm owner...a good man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I ask quietly. A slimy feeling washes over me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to disappoint my dad...you know? I wasn\u2019t a gentleman last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad and Cindy would kill me anyway,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cThe maids say you have one-night stands all the time.\u201d</p><p>Jack pauses for a long moment, looking me head-on. \u201cI don\u2019t have one-night stands all the time, no matter what the maids say. I\u2019ve only slept with one person. And I cared about her.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s one more person than I\u2019ve slept with. But I\u2019m glad to hear he\u2019s not the total man whore the maids made him out to be. He must\u2019ve slept with Senator Lukens\u2019s daughter, the girl Rory said he dated last year. Or was it the country singer? Never mind, I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t mess up this Paradise Park deal for my dad,\u201d Jack says. \u201cIt\u2019s his dream to own a big racetrack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you...a lot...\u201d He pauses to rub his lower lip with his thumb. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure we can have anything\u2014I\u2019m not sure what I can give you...besides last night, I mean. I do like you so much but dating somebody who works for me wouldn\u2019t look right\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thank God we didn\u2019t go further than kissing. Why did he woo me with kisses that taste better than lollipops when he knew it could never work out? How dare he treat me like a poor loser? This is why I don\u2019t trust rich jerks!</p><p>\u201c\u2014and my parents would be disappointed.\u201d Jack sighs and rubs his eyes. He looks upset.</p><p>I love my family too. It could be nice to have a connection with my baby sister when she\u2019s born. Thinking of her, and thinking of Jack\u2019s love for his family, brings me back to reality. Ensuring my dad keeps his new job is what\u2019s most important right now. Not being with Jack. This is why I was trying to keep my distance in the first place.</p><p>But it hurts. Bad.</p><p>I want to scream at him for kissing me, for leading me on, but I don\u2019t want to be a mean, vindictive girl. That\u2019s not who I am. I don\u2019t need a guy to validate me. And on top of that, I don\u2019t want to ruin what we do have: a great working relationship.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like either of us can handle a relationship right now...\u201d My voice cracks with emotion. I like him so much. \u201cSo let\u2019s just keep hanging out, keep being friends, keep working together. I\u2019ve really liked getting to know you better, and I don\u2019t want to lose you,\u201d I say in a wobbly tone.</p><p>His eyes find mine. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s just go back to where we were, okay?\u201d</p><p>I stand and charge toward the manor house, and seconds later Jack bounds up to walk beside me. The three hounds circle us, barking and playing, oblivious.</p><p>I slap a fake smile on my face, sniffling. I pull a cherry sucker out of my pocket, rip off the wrapper, and stick it into my mouth, but it doesn\u2019t bring the relief I need so badly.</p><p>Hold on Tight</p><p>At daybreak on Tuesday, day two of my jockey training, I begin exercising the horses. Now that it\u2019s September and the humidity is fading into fall, my skin isn\u2019t slick with sweat like dew coating the grass, but I\u2019m still hot as hell.</p><p>I steer Echoes of Summer out onto the track and click my tongue, urging her into a trot. An exercise rider who works for another horse owner calls out, \u201cWomen don\u2019t belong on the racetrack! Go make me breakfast!\u201d The rider smiles goofily and the guys around him start chuckling. I ignore them and ride on by. Assholes.</p><p>At the 3/8 pole, Bryant Townsend rides up beside me and gives me a look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say over the sound of hooves slamming the dirt. \u201cYou come to tell me girls shouldn\u2019t be jockeys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to tell you don\u2019t even think about stealing any more of my business. Yeah, Star hasn\u2019t won yet, but now I won\u2019t get any money off him.\u201d</p><p>I look straight ahead, continuing to trot. What Bryant says makes me feel somewhat guilty\u2014jockeys only make money when the horses they ride win, and when Jack asked me to become Star\u2019s jockey, that meant Bryant would lose business if Star were to win.</p><p>\u201cI need this chance,\u201d I tell Bryant.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t agree to race any other horses. I have a car payment and bills to deal with.\u201d Bryant speeds up, leaving me to think about how lucky I am to have a place to live.</p><p>After I finish exercising Echoes of Summer, second up on my schedule is Star. Sweat drips down my face as we trot around the track, warming up.</p><p>Three other exercise riders are right beside me when a baby raccoon appears on the top of a fence post. A colt screams and jerks his head. Then two of the fillies do the same thing. Which of course means that Star goes ballistic at forty miles per hour.</p><p>I hold on tight as Star rears onto his hind legs. Oh shit. \u201cStar,\u201d I say in a soothing voice. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d But I\u2019m terrified. Star returns to all fours, sidesteps, and jerks his head again, whinnying, and I kick his sides and try to urge him forward, but he won\u2019t budge.</p><p>The next time he jerks, he uses such force I can\u2019t hold on. He pitches me sideways off his back. I free my feet and leap, making an emergency exit. Avoid Star\u2019s hooves. Attempt a shoulder roll. Land on the track, right on my butt, kicking up dust. Star takes off, the stirrups banging against his sides. The wailing alarm sounds. Other horses dash past me. I\u2019m sitting on the interstate without a car. Outriders begin to chase after Star as I bring myself to a sitting position, and right then a speeding colt clips my shin with his hoof and I scream in pain.</p><p>I fall to the dirt, clutching my leg.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Jack sprints up to me and slides onto the track like a baseball player into second base. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t respond. I hold a gloved hand out toward him. It\u2019s shaking.</p><p>Jack squeezes my hand and shuts his eyes, panting. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that to me again,\u201d he says under his breath. Is he talking to me or to the horse gods?</p><p>\u201cGo get Star,\u201d I mutter, clutching my leg.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack says.</p><p>Dad and Gael follow behind Jack, and seeing the horrified look on Dad\u2019s face makes my eyes water. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve fallen off a horse. My leg feels like I got wacked with a crowbar. Damn.</p><p>It takes a few minutes for my heart to stop racing and my body to stop shaking, but I think my leg and butt are okay.</p><p>Mr. Goodwin jogs up. \u201cDo you need to go to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say through clenched teeth. \u201cI just had the wind knocked out of me.\u201d There is no way I\u2019m giving up my chance to race this Saturday! \u201cWhat you need is a damned raccoon exterminator already!\u201d I tell Mr. Goodwin, making him and Jack chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right on that,\u201d Jack says.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go to the doctor,\u201d Dad says, but I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hit my head or anything, and nothing hurts except for my leg and my butt,\u201d I whisper, embarrassed. Horsemen around the track are staring at me. People fall off horses all the time\u2014Dad is just being a drama queen. I don\u2019t want him to have to pay for an emergency room visit just because my butt is sore. I\u2019d know if I broke something. My leg is gonna have a nasty bruise tomorrow, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you off the track,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says, looking over at the gates. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about twenty riders waiting.\u201d</p><p>Cedar Hill is a business, after all. I lurch to my feet, and Dad tells everyone that he\u2019s keeping me home from school to make sure I don\u2019t have a head injury.</p><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t. That\u2019ll make me look like a complete pansy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s staying home from school, I\u2019ll bring over some film for her to watch,\u201d Gael says, winking at me. He knows Dad is overreacting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry her back,\u201d Jack says, slipping an arm under my knees and the other under my shoulder blades, lifting me off the track. Mr. Goodwin gives his son a look, but Jack doesn\u2019t pay attention.</p><p>\u201cPut me down,\u201d I tell Jack through clenched teeth. \u201cNobody\u2019s gonna take me seriously if you\u2019re carrying me all over the place.\u201d He immediately drops me back to my feet and a pang of pain engulfs my shin. I hiss and hop on one foot.</p><p>My dad starts rubbing his eyes and wiping sweat off his face, glancing between Mr. Goodwin and Jack. I can see Dad\u2019s pulse racing beneath the skin of his neck.</p><p>\u201cSon, get her off the track,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says, and Jack grabs my arm and pulls me toward Hillcrest.</p> <p>\u201cCan I still race on Saturday?\u201d I ask, hobbling.</p><p>Jack avoids my question. \u201cLet\u2019s go check out that leg.\u201d</p><p>He leads me back to Hillcrest and escorts me to my bedroom. There, he looks around my super tiny room. It\u2019s only big enough for a twin bed and a small dresser that doubles as a nightstand. A framed picture of my mother hangs beside the door. Yellow paint is peeling off the walls and the only sunlight filters through a tiny rectangular window near the ceiling. The twin bed has the same bedding I\u2019ve had since I was eight\u2014Strawberry Shortcake.</p><p>Jack chuckles at my bedspread as we plop down. \u201cI knew you were a Shortcake.\u201d</p><p>I want to dive under the covers and die from embarrassment. I need a new comforter immediately.</p> <p>After helping me remove my gloves and vest, Jack pulls my boots and socks off, lifts my legs onto his lap, peels my pant leg back, and examines my shin. He whistles at the big purple welt forming. \u201cYou should ice it, but it doesn\u2019t look serious\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says, appearing in my doorway with my father. Both men stare down at my legs in Jack\u2019s lap. \u201cYou need to get back on the track and let the horsemen know why we have a twenty-minute delay this morning. You need to do your job, understand ?\u201d</p><p>The emotion disappears from Jack\u2019s face, he removes my feet from his lap, and he suddenly stands. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you feel better, Savannah,\u201d Jack says seriously before leaving, clicking the door shut.</p><p>Dad watches Jack disappear then sits down on my bed. \u201cWhat happened out there? How did you lose control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStar\u2019s strong and he was scared.\u201d</p> <p>My father shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you riding that horse anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason the Goodwins are training me as a jockey is to ride Star\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think they\u2019ll let you now after you lost control of the horse and fell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat happens to everybody! And raccoons were involved! This happened to a rider on the third day we were here, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>Dad clenches the Strawberry Shortcake comforter in his fist and shuts his eyes.</p><p>I can\u2019t give up the chance to make a better name, a better future for myself. The fact I\u2019m still using the same kid bedding just proves I need better opportunities. Sometimes you\u2019ve gotta take risks to get something better.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything. Please let me keep working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta get back to work,\u201d he says. \u201cStay in that bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d I call out, but he leaves without another word.</p><p>God, is it all over after less than a week? I bury my face in my pillow. What happened this morning scared me...but not having a future in horseracing scares me just as much, if not more.</p><p>Midafternoon when I\u2019m icing my shin for the fourth time, Gael brings film for me to watch and I move to the common room because I don\u2019t have a TV. It brings a smile to my face that Gael isn\u2019t gonna let me quit just because I fell.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a jockey,\u201d Gael says, \u201cI fell at least once a month. And I didn\u2019t even have raccoons to blame.\u201d</p><p>Later in the day, Dad sits on my bed with me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you this morning,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you need to get your body in better shape so you can ride at high speeds if you want to keep your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can keep it?\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>Dad runs a hand through his hair. \u201cWhat happened this morning wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was those goddamned raccoons.\u201d</p><p>Dad pats my knee. \u201cHey, watch your mouth, Shortcake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I race this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see...but you need to start doing more workouts with Gael. And don\u2019t think I won\u2019t hesitate to stop your training if I don\u2019t think you can handle it, understand?\u201d</p><p>I hug his neck, promising myself I\u2019ll be extra vigilant from now on. He\u2019s right\u2014this job can be the difference between life and death.</p><p>Dad hands me a packet of papers. \u201cJack came by. He brought your schoolwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGroan,\u201d I say. \u201cHe must not know me very well if he thinks I actually want to do my homework.\u201d</p><p>On top of the papers is a thick beige note card embossed with Jack\u2019s name in gold ink. John Conrad Goodwin IV. What guy has his own stationery? It even smells like his cologne. Jesus Lord.</p><p>The note reads,</p><p>Star says he's sorry. For his punishment, I'm withholding carrots and he isn't allowed to play in the pasture with the fillies for a week. That'll teach him a lesson. I'd go crazy if someone took away my favorite food and access to girls. Feel better soon -JG</p><p>I laugh silently at the note. But couldn\u2019t he have told me this in person?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on between you and him?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>I bring the note card to my mouth, to chew on the corner. \u201cWe\u2019re working with Star. That\u2019s all,\u201d I lie, wishing I could erase last weekend\u2019s make-out session from my mind.</p><p>\u201cMake sure that\u2019s all it is,\u201d Dad says, giving me a stern glare. \u201cI had a hard time keeping him out of here this afternoon. I told him he couldn\u2019t see you \u2019cause I didn\u2019t want you stressed out in case you got a concussion this morning.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s why he sent a note.</p><p>\u201cJack only wants to get in your pants,\u201d Dad says.</p><p>My hands fly to cover my eyes. \u201cGod, Dad! Shut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Goodwin would never allow his son to date you.\u201d</p><p>It hurts hearing Dad say that. Because I know it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve heard it from Mr. Goodwin\u2019s own mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou know the maids\u2019 stories about all the girls Jack messes around with in his room. And like Cindy told you, you\u2019re too good for him.\u201d</p><p>I might have thought that a week ago. But a week ago, he wouldn\u2019t have sent me a card and collected my homework. I smell the card again, enjoying his cologne, thinking of his funny words. I really like who he is as a person.</p><p>Regardless of what anybody says, I\u2019d give him another chance if he wants to try to make us work. But still, which Jack is the real Jack? The farm owner at home or the sweet goofball who emerges when we\u2019re alone?</p><p>My First Race</p><p>Even though I majorly crashed and burned Tuesday morning on the track, Jack still wants me to race Saturday at Kentucky Downs. Other than him, it\u2019s all I can think about during the day. Gael has me riding for hours a day now, and my arms and legs feel like noodles thanks to his weight training.</p><p>But late at night, when I\u2019m alone with my thoughts, while Dad and Cindy are cuddling together on the couch and Rory is immersed in his writing or spending time with Vanessa, I think of Jack. I should\u2019ve known better than to make out with him, but everything felt right, and I\u2019ve always heard you should live in the moment. When she was my age, I doubt my mother thought she\u2019d lose her life at thirty.</p><p>On Thursday night after everyone has gone to sleep, I climb out of bed in my pajamas and go to the common room. I flick on the lights and sit down at the computer.</p><p>I type colleges in Tennessee into Google. A school called Belmont pops up as the first choice. I tap the link and a picture of a brick building surrounded by lush green trees fills the screen. I click on the admissions homepage and scroll through the requirements. Looks like they suggest a minimum GPA of 3.5. Mine is 3.2. School has never been my forte. I\u2019d rather shovel manure than do algebra.</p><p>Holy shit\u2014the Belmont application fee alone is $50. Is it that pricey at every school? Didn\u2019t Rory say some cost $35? Applying to five schools like this one would cost $250. Other than people like Jack, who can afford that?</p><p>Still. The pictures of the dorm rooms, the quad, and students having fun at basketball games make my heart speed up a little.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you out of bed?\u201d</p><p>I quickly exit out of the browser and swivel to face Dad, who\u2019s standing there holding a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy was thirsty. What were you looking at on the computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, nothing really.\u201d</p><p>Dad sits on the couch armrest. \u201cIt looked like you were on a college website.\u201d</p><p>I slowly lift a shoulder, cracking my knuckles. \u201cJust messing around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were interested in college. I thought you were gonna work as an exercise boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I say quickly. There\u2019s a long still silence, as Dad\u2019s eyes leave mine and focus on the glass of water.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed a lot in the few weeks we\u2019ve been here, Shortcake...I barely recognize you anymore since we moved. I never imagined you\u2019d be interested in jockeying or college.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and push the button to turn off the computer monitor.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I\u2019m proud of you, but I don\u2019t know anything about college,\u201d Dad goes on. \u201cI guess we could ask Mr. Goodwin what he knows but I don\u2019t know how we\u2019d pay for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to Mr. Goodwin.\u201d I can\u2019t handle the idea of being more in debt than we already are. What I need to do is keep making money. That wouldn\u2019t happen if I went to college.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d I ask. \u201cAre you going to marry Cindy?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a sad smile and cradles the glass in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask her when I have enough money to buy her a ring.\u201d</p><p>The memory of Mr. Winchester snapping his fingers at me to refill his wine glass pops into my mind. He was wearing a large ruby ring encircled with diamonds. He didn\u2019t even say please and thank you. Probably doesn\u2019t care who he hurts, just like Mr. Cates. He didn\u2019t care that he sold Moonshadow to a bad man who whipped her and made her race, even though she wasn\u2019t in shape. I bite down on the inside of my cheek so I won\u2019t cry, so the pain won\u2019t swallow me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get to bed, Shortcake. You\u2019ve got training in the morning.\u201d</p><p>I climb back in bed and mentally run through my game plan for Saturday\u2019s race, but as I begin to nod off, lush images from the Belmont website fill my head, flooding my dreams with color.</p><p>Friday afternoon after I\u2019ve visited Star in the pasture, I meet Gael in his office in the manor house to watch racing film. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve never been to the second floor of the manor house before, but I know from Cindy that Mr. Goodwin\u2019s office is up here. She vacuums and dusts it every day.</p><p>I swallow as I pass large, closed, double wooden doors. I peek inside the stall manager\u2019s and the estate manager\u2019s offices, finding them hard at work on their computers. A glass chandelier that looks like it\u2019s from France or something blinds me with its bling. Mr. Goodwin\u2019s personal assistant is typing on the computer and talking on the phone. She points me down the hall. While looking for Gael, I discover that Jack has his own office too.</p><p>What seventeen-year-old has his own office?</p><p>I peek inside to find him talking on the phone about a stud fee deal and flipping through a large book at the same time. His office is very...clean. And tasteful. Jack has a flat-screen TV that\u2019s muted and tuned to the horse-racing network. Pictures of his family and friends cover the walls, along with famous horses and horsemen, including an autographed photo of Ron Turcotte, the jockey who rode Secretariat and had over three thousand wins...until he got hurt in a race. He\u2019s in a wheelchair now.</p> <p>I leave Jack to his work and knock on the door to Gael\u2019s office. His office is very...much the opposite of Jack\u2019s. It\u2019s like a giant snow globe exploded in here. Paper is everywhere. Red Bull and Diet Coke cans litter every available surface.</p><p>Gael leaps to his feet like he\u2019s on a pogo stick. \u201cBarrow! Sit right here.\u201d He clears a spot for me on his sofa and plops down next to me with a remote control in his hand.</p><p>Gael rubs his cheek, looking over at me. \u201cYou ready for tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>I clutch my knees. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re great on a horse and great during practice, but racing in a race is a whole new ballgame. You gotta respect it. If you\u2019re not careful and you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing on the track, you could die.\u201d</p> <p>My stomach jumps into my throat when I think of what could\u2019ve happened the other day. What if the horse\u2019s hoof had struck my head and not my shin? Riding a 1,200-pound animal at forty-five miles per hour is a rush. A dangerous rush.</p><p>\u201cThis footage will help you learn what to expect and know how to deal with any contingencies that might come your way,\u201d Gael says.</p><p>He pushes play and I spend the next two hours watching races. Elite races, smaller races, really fun races, really horrific races. I want to cover my eyes when riders fall and get hurt, but that would show weakness, so I stare straight ahead, trying to keep my eye on the goal.</p><p>That\u2019s hard after watching the Preakness Stakes where Barbaro pulled up, broke his hind right leg, and had to be euthanized.</p><p>Saturday morning, as usual, I\u2019m up before dawn.</p><p>But today is different. Today is the annual Kentucky Downs Handicap. Normally people train for years before their first race, but Jack fast-tracked me. I hope I do okay today...I kind of feel like a poser.</p> <p>Gael told me to sleep in and get my rest because I\u2019m racing later in the day\u2014at noon sharp. But I couldn\u2019t stay asleep thanks to prerace jitters. I\u2019m so jumpy, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve already had my coffee even though I haven\u2019t drunk a drop. Kentucky Downs is about thirty miles north of Cedar Hill. In the past week, Kentucky Downs has held eight races. Over $1 million in purse winnings have already been given out, but today\u2019s three races are the biggies.</p><p>Star is competing in the Juvenile Downs, a race for two-year-olds. The purse is $75,000, and the winner will make 70 percent of that, with the rest going to the runners-up. That means if Star wins, I\u2019ll get 5 percent of $52,500. $2,625. That\u2019s more money than I\u2019ve seen in my entire life.</p><p>Jack is also entering Lucky Strikes in the Kentucky Turf Cup, which has a purse of $200,000. In the Goodwin world, these races are small potatoes, but Star needs a win. And I\u2019m hoping I can help him with that. I don\u2019t have any illusions I will win my very first race, but I pray we won\u2019t come in dead last. I need to prove that I\u2019ve got what it takes, that I\u2019ve got something special.</p><p>While the Ladies Marathon race is going on, I sit on a stool in the barn, breathing in and out, talking softly to Star, who\u2019s busy eating grain.</p><p>Then all of a sudden the Marathon must be over, because Jack appears at the stall, rubbing his hands together as he keeps his distance from Star. He\u2019s wearing a sleek gray suit, white shirt, no tie, and cowboy boots. The no-tie look makes me tingle all over. I want to kiss the triangle of tanned skin exposed at his neck. Jesus Lord, all this anxiety over the race is making me a perv.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Jack takes off his hat to muss his hair, looking everywhere but at me. \u201cYou feeling good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good. A little tired. I\u2019ve never been in the sweatbox before.\u201d The morning of a race, most jockeys go in this super hot room called a sweatbox and sweat all the extra fluid out so they\u2019ll weigh less for the race. \u201cIt was so relaxing I felt like I was on a beach somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughs softly. When he finally meets my gaze, his blue eyes pierce into mine, and I wish we could have a repeat of last weekend\u2019s kissing session. That would help me relax. A glance at his lips makes it hard to tell where my stress from the race ends and the sexual tension begins.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve read all the notes Gael gave you? You know all about the other horses, their jockeys, and their trainers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I straighten my posture, trying to look impressive, which is hard when Jack stands a full foot taller than me. \u201cI\u2019m all set.\u201d</p><p>Jack blows air out and rubs his hands together again. \u201cThanks for doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting me do it,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cYou look good in the Goodwin colors,\u201d he says, scanning my black and green riding silks.</p><p>\u201cI look like a damned Slytherin.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, looks around, and takes a step closer, wetting his lips. He gently pecks my cheek, sending a jolt up my legs and down my arms and between my thighs.</p><p>\u201cI got you something for good luck,\u201d he whispers in my ear. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a purple swirl lollipop.</p><p>\u201cYaaaaaay.\u201d I take the sucker, and before I know what I\u2019m doing, I slip my arms around his waist. He sucks in a breath. Clenches up.</p><p>Crap. He doesn\u2019t want this. I take a step back, pissed at myself. I can\u2019t believe I gave in to instinct.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d My cheeks are burning.</p><p>He looks away. \u201cI need to tell you something. There\u2019s gonna be press here today. Press specifically for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I blurt.</p><p>\u201cYes, you.\u201d His mouth slides into a small smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a big deal. This race is nothing compared to some of the big Kentucky races, but still. You don\u2019t see girl jockeys all that often at races in general. Especially ones so young.\u201d</p><p>I was already nervous enough. I drag a hand down my red braid and bring it to my mouth to chew on it. I pull a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThanks for telling me,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019d hoped you were gonna tell me something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say, shaking my head quickly.</p><p>He gently pulls the braid from my mouth, grasping my hand for a sec. The heat from his skin soothes my nerves and makes me want to dive right back into his arms. Jesus. When did I become such a horn dog?</p><p>That\u2019s when Rory brings Echoes of Summer back from her race and Jack disappears. Rory looks from me to where Jack vanished and starts beat-boxing, making music like you\u2019d hear on his video game, Ho Down in Hoochieville. \u201cBowchicawowow.\u201d</p><p>I flip him off.</p><p>I pause and breathe deeply as I unwrap the sucker and stick it in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d she do?\u201d I ask as Rory pushes Echoes of Summer into a stall.</p><p>\u201cThird place,\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cNot bad for an old lady.\u201d</p><p>I pat her muzzle. \u201cShe\u2019s only seven. I\u2019d hate to hear what you call me when I\u2019m not around.\u201d</p><p>Rory yanks a wrinkled booklet from his back pocket. \u201cHey, I got the race program. Your name\u2019s in it!\u201d</p><p>I dash over to him, stick the sucker Jack gave me in my mouth, and thumb through the program. There I am.</p><p>HORSE</p><p>Tennessee Star</p><p>JOCKEY</p><p>S. Barrow*</p><p>TRAINER</p><p>G. Solana</p><p>OWNER</p><p>J. Goodwin/Cedar Hill Farms</p><p>Denotes Apprentice Jockey</p><p>I close the program and cradle it against my chest.</p><p>And before I know it, before I can get my heartbeat under control, Rory has Star\u2019s tack thrown over his shoulder and we\u2019re heading up to the paddock, passing by other barns and the drug-testing pavilion. I finish the lollipop during our walk and throw the stick away.</p><p>Dad, Gael, Jack, and Mr. Goodwin meet us there as we\u2019re securing the colt\u2019s saddle.</p><p>Dad squeezes my shoulder. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to do this, right? We can always send Townsend out instead.\u201d</p><p>I tighten my gloves, glancing around at the other jockeys. They all look relaxed, chatting and joking with their trainers and owners. I blow air out through my mouth and bounce on my toes.</p><p>\u201cI got this,\u201d I tell Dad. Jack and Rory exchange a smile at my words.</p><p>I mount Star and we make our way out onto the track. Kentucky Downs is old and the grandstands are small like the bleachers at the Hundred Oaks softball field; most spectators are hanging around the fence and on the infield. Or they\u2019re inside at the casino.</p><p>The cheering starts the minute Star begins to trot across the grass. A bunch of reporters are taking pictures of me. The flashes make me see spots. I hope Star isn\u2019t scared of cameras. I groan, praying my picture won\u2019t accompany a front-page article on how I blew it at Kentucky Downs.</p><p>Dad appears to my right, riding an Appaloosa pony. Star sniffs the pony and rams his head into Dad\u2019s side, acting bratty.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to pull up if anything goes wrong,\u201d Dad says, and I nod, chewing on my braid. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I reply.</p><p>When it\u2019s post time, I meet two hands at the starting gate and they push Star inside the fourth position, locking the gate behind us. Dad disappears off the track.</p><p>Seven furlongs. Just under a mile. I can do this. I breathe in and out. In and out. In and out. The crowd cheers. It sounds like pressing a seashell to my ear and listening to the dull roar of an ocean.</p><p>The bell rings and the gates crash open.</p><p>Star blasts off. It\u2019s a clean break out of the gate. We shoot to the front along with two other horses.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d I shout, holding on tighter than ever before. The nine sets of hooves slamming the grass sound like a train speeding away with my heart.</p><p>I glance to my right and left. Sergeant Major, a speed horse, is right next to me. He\u2019ll lose his energy soon\u2014I can already hear the colt huffing and puffing. On my left is Lazy Monday, who has good endurance. I\u2019ve gotta make sure Star doesn\u2019t get too tired, too fast, so I ease up a little on the first turn.</p><p>On the backstretch, I move up on the outside. For a moment, we take the lead. Then in a blink of an eye we\u2019re back in the third position. But as I\u2019m entering the final turn, a colt named Winning Waves sneaks up on the inside. He bolts past me. Dirt from a mud hole splatters on my face and chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I urge Star. He gradually increases his speed, but he\u2019s losing his breath. We begin to pass Winning Waves. The horses are neck and neck.</p><p>On the home stretch, we\u2019re fighting against Winning Waves. Two other horses are in front of us. The crowd is going wild. Cheering. Clapping. I\u2019m loving the rush. \u201cGo, Star! Hurry up!\u201d</p><p>I cross over the finish line right before Winning Waves. A horse named Gina\u2019s George is announced as the winner.</p><p>We lost by two lengths! Damn.</p> <p>But we came in third place. Star has never done that before.</p><p>I hug his neck. \u201cGood boy, Star. Good boy.\u201d He nickers and sighs.</p><p>I make my way over to the scoreboard to check our time. Reporters snap photos of me and I grin as I push my goggles up on top of my helmet. Third isn\u2019t bad for my first race. Then I see my official time on the scoreboard. My practice this morning was faster by three seconds. I rub my eye and take a deep breath, working to swallow the disappointment. Third is good, I remind myself. But will Jack be angry?</p><p>Over at the paddock, Rory is smiling as he reaches out to take the reins and control of the horse, and the next thing I know, Jack is pulling me down and wrapping me in a tight hug as more photographers take my picture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>I bury my face against his chest, laughing, getting dirt all over his suit. We spin around in a circle and I\u2019ve never felt so close to another person, not even when we were kissing.</p><p>I love that we worked together to make this happen. I\u2019ve never felt so strong, like I could lift a boulder. Like I could do magic.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be my jockey in the Dixiana Derby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, for real?\u201d I exclaim. That\u2019s only like three weeks away. It\u2019s a huge race at Paradise Park with a half a million dollar purse!</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Jack says. I leap into his arms and we jump around like kids during recess.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says loudly. \u201cWe all want to talk to Savannah.\u201d</p> <p>Jack releases me and grins. Out of the corner of my eye, I see that our fathers are actually smiling. Wait. We were just hugging like crazy, and they aren\u2019t freaking out?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see your mother, son.\u201d Mr. Goodwin leads Jack toward the bleachers. He and I look back at each other, beaming.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, Shortcake,\u201d Dad says, squeezing me close to him. \u201cI wish your mom could\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>I wrap an arm around Dad\u2019s waist, get up on tiptoes, and kiss his cheek.</p><p>I came in third friggin\u2019 place.</p><p>Hell. Yeah.</p><p>Taking the Road Less Traveled</p><p>Church bells ring at Westwood Chapel for Will Whitfield\u2019s wedding.</p> <p>Rory, his younger brother Trey, and two other guys I don\u2019t recognize dressed in tuxedos are serving as ushers, seating the female guests.</p><p>\u201cWow, you look great,\u201d Rory says, sticking an elbow out. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got all that mud off your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to say ass in church, S.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I take his arm and let him escort me to a pew. I\u2019m still giddy from the race a few hours ago. I\u2019m on such a high, I feel like I could slam dunk a basketball. Jack wants me to be his jockey in the Dixiana Derby!</p><p>Along with an ace bandage to mask the hideous bruise on my shin, I wore a green silk dress that belonged to my mother. It\u2019s really beautiful and not mom-style at all.</p><p>The Goodwins sit a few rows in front of me. Jack sits between his mother and Shelby with his arms stretched around them across the pew.</p><p>I run my fingers over the beige wedding program laced with blue ribbon. It reads:</p><p>Parker Anne Shelton + William Connor Whitfield</p><p>Vanessa walks into the church and looks around, clutching her wedding program. I wave at her then pat the seat next to me. One of the ushers\u2014a guy with loose curly blond hair that reaches his shoulders\u2014sees Vanessa and gives her a big hug before escorting her to my row.</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting me sit with you,\u201d she whispers, rolling and unrolling her wedding program. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I should come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, Rory invited me, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been going out all that long. I haven\u2019t met his parents yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2014his family will love you. Besides, I just met Rory, like, a month ago, and they invited me. Who was that guy who you hugged? The super hot one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Vanessa says with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s Sam Henry. He played football with my brother in high school\u2014but don\u2019t even think about going after him. He was single for like a year, but he\u2019s very much taken again now.\u201d</p><p>Will steps out in front of the crowd. A few guys whoop at him, and he pumps his fist, making a lot of the little old ladies in the congregation gasp in horror.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Will is so hot,\u201d Vanessa mutters to me. \u201cMaybe when the minister asks if anyone objects to this union, I\u2019ll jump up and down and holler a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet Will\u2019s fianc\u00e9 would tackle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory would probably tackle you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d She fans herself with the wedding program.</p><p>Rory joins Will at the altar; he keeps patting his breast pocket every three seconds\u2014I guess he\u2019s terrified he\u2019ll lose the rings, and if I were Will, I\u2019d be a bit worried about that too.</p><p>Instead of organ music, a guitarist begins playing and a beautiful girl with long black hair starts down the aisle, being escorted by a man. They both stop on Parker\u2019s side of the aisle, and the guy doesn\u2019t sit down or move to Will\u2019s side. I open my wedding program. A girl named Kate Kelly is Maid of Honor. And for some reason a guy named Drew Bates is a bridesmaid...? I giggle, loving that she has a guy bridesmaid dressed in a tux.</p><p>\u201cRory looks nice,\u201d I tell Vanessa.</p><p>\u201cAgreed. He should wear tuxes all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven on the farm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven on the farm.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly everybody stands and we turn to watch Parker walk down the aisle, carrying a handful of wildflowers. Her creamy dress is very simple and made of lace. It has short, capped sleeves and hangs above her knees. When I get married, I don\u2019t want anything extravagant\u2014I want a dress just like that. She\u2019s not wearing a veil and her long messy brown hair reaches her waist and is all over the place. Will beams and looks like he might cry.</p><p>The ceremony is short, but hilarious. Rory, of course, misplaces the rings and spends over a minute searching his pockets. Parker and Will don\u2019t seem to care, as he cups her face, laughing. They never stop smiling, even when the minister accidentally calls Will \u201cBill.\u201d</p><p>And then it\u2019s suddenly over with a \u201cYou may now kiss the bride\u201d and for some God awful reason, Rory yells \u201cGet \u2019er done,\u201d which makes Vanessa bury her face in her palms. The guys in the congregation leap to their feet and cheer and basically act like a pack of hooligan monkeys.</p><p>Rory and I ride in Vanessa\u2019s Mercedes to the reception in the Whitfields\u2019 backyard. Glittering lights hang inside a big white tent and tea lights dot the tables. They serve fried chicken and mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese and lots of other yummy foods on the buffet. An awesome band plays rock music as people alternate between eating and dancing. If I ever get married, I want a wedding just like this.</p><p>There really are, like, eight thousand male Whitfield cousins here. With all the floppy brown hair, it\u2019s like a boy band convention, and a bunch of them want to meet me, the \u201cgirl horse jockey.\u201d</p><p>Rory sneaks two entire bottles of champagne over to us and smuggles the evidence under the table. He and Vanessa start drinking the champagne, giggling like crazy as they feed each other bits of food. I accept a tiny bit of champagne\u2014I don\u2019t want to mess up my training tomorrow morning with a hangover.</p><p>Rory and Vanessa keep stealing kisses and somehow end up snuggling under the table with their contraband champagne\u2014and with the options being 1) sit alone at our table, 2) sneak under the table with them (awkward!), or 3) get the hell out of Dodge, I find myself outside, circling the dinner tent, looking back and forth between the dancing and the stars.</p><p>The beautiful Maid of Honor is dancing closely with a guy who dared to wear flip flops. A ginormous engagement ring glimmers on her hand. I wish my life could be that perfect. Will and Parker are swaying right next to the couple, laughing and talking to them. The hot usher, Sam Henry, is dancing nearby with an extremely tall blond girl. She looks very much absorbed with the hot usher. For good reason.</p><p>Jack is dancing with his mother, twirling her around. I gaze over to Mr. Goodwin\u2019s table to discover him sneaking a hot dog while his wife is busy. It\u2019s like Jack knows I\u2019m thinking of him, because he looks over his mom\u2019s shoulder, gazing at me. Scanning me up and down, studying my forest-green silk dress. He slowly starts to smile and holds up his pointer finger, telling me to wait.</p><p>What\u2019s that supposed to mean? What am I supposed to wait for?</p><p>That\u2019s when Will Whitfield jogs up and I hug him and tell him congrats.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Rory?\u201d he asks, scanning the tent. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly time for the toasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you might check under that table over there. He\u2019s drinking champagne with Vanessa Green.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s mouth forms an O. \u201cMaybe we won\u2019t have a toast from him then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good idea. It\u2019d probably just be a repeat of \u2018Get \u2019er done!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom is gonna kill him for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that couple who was dancing with you and Parker? The beautiful maid of honor girl.\u201d</p><p>Will looks over his shoulder at them. \u201cParker\u2019s best friend, Kate, and her fianc\u00e9. We\u2019ve been friends with them for years. Since right after high school, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny. I nearly went to prom with Kate, but I liked Parker more. I can\u2019t imagine what life would be like if I\u2019d made a different choice. It would\u2019ve been so easy...but so wrong, you know?\u201d</p><p>I nod, feeling my eyes burn. It\u2019s like that Robert Frost poem I read in Mom\u2019s Compendium of Poetry book. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood...The narrator had to choose which path to take\u2014just like we all do.</p><p>An older guy, one of the eight thousand Whitfield cousins, approaches, smiling.</p><p>\u201cThis is my cousin, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the guy says, shaking my hand. \u201cI\u2019m about to take Meemaw home,\u201d he tells Will and gives him a guy hug. \u201cCongrats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d Will says to me, \u201cthere\u2019s a new litter of Springer spaniel puppies in Tanglewood barn. They were born just this morning to my dog, Ash. Maybe one of them will like you,\u201d he says with a chuckle before heading back over to his new wife. His cousin Alex smiles at me. A genuine, sweet smile.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could stay for a dance with you, but Meemaw is getting tired. I\u2019m her ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say\u2014grandmas before girls.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We laugh together and he glances at his watch.</p><p>\u201cI really do want to stay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d I reply, and he\u2019s gone before I could even flirt with him. As he walks away, he glances back over his shoulder at me.</p><p>I must have the worst luck of all time. Dancing with that guy would\u2019ve been awesome. Because damn. Right when I decide to go check out the cupcakes at the dessert table, Jack appears outside the tent.</p> <p>\u201cWho was that guy?\u201d he asks, furrowing his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cOne of the eight thousand Whitfield cousins.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughs and drags a hand through his hair. \u201cSo...want to dance?\u201d</p><p>My heart stops. \u201cWith me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cWe need to celebrate your work with Star today.\u201d</p> <p>Is that what Mr. Serious told his parents or something?</p><p>I shrug and let him pull me into his arms. On the outskirts of the dance floor, he and I sway together with an ocean of space between us. This is the most. Chaste. Dance. Ever. He\u2019s not looking at me directly, but I can still feel his hands shaking on my waist. His labored breathing gives away how nervous and excited he is. Even if he\u2019s pretending to not be interested in me, I can tell he is.</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty tonight,\u201d he says quietly, moving a tiny bit closer to me. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about last Saturday, you know, at Miller\u2019s Hollow?\u201d</p><p>I suck in a deep breath. This feels like a trap. A trap I kind of want to get caught in. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood...</p><p>Earlier today, our fathers didn\u2019t freak out when we were hugging after the race. Maybe us being together would just take some getting used to. But maybe it\u2019s not completely off the table...? I mean, nobody seems interested in the fact that we\u2019re dancing together now. Except for the eight thousand Whitfield cousins who want to talk to the girl horse jockey.</p><p>As I\u2019m swaying in Jack\u2019s arms, there\u2019s only one road I want to take. The road with him standing at the end. And it\u2019s not the easy road. I decide to be bold, to take the curvy, pothole-filled path. \u201cI heard the Whitfields have a new litter of puppies in Tanglewood barn. Want to go look?\u201d</p> <p>A smile leaps across his face. \u201cGet a head start. I\u2019ll meet you there in a few.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, I hustle over to the Whitfields\u2019 barn, my heels getting stuck in muddy divots. I follow the sounds of crying and barking, which I can barely hear over the band\u2019s music ringing across the countryside.</p><p>I find the dogs in a nest behind a toolbox, and when I see them nursing from the mama dog, I let out a low squeal. \u201cOh my gosh, you\u2019re so cute.\u201d</p><p>Not even a minute later, Jack appears in the barn doorway. He stops to light a lantern and carries it toward me. I instinctively take a step back then stop.</p><p>I swallow. \u201cYou actually came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you had to say was puppies,\u201d he replies with a soft smile, kneeling to the ground.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t even twenty-four hours old yet,\u201d I say, squatting next to Ash\u2019s little nest she dug out. A puppy chirps, and the mama dog moves to lick it. Seeing how much she loves her babies makes my chest hurt. Love is so simple, but so complicated sometimes.</p><p>I pet the brown and white dog\u2019s ears. \u201cYou did such a good job, Ash.\u201d The exhausted dog looks up into my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cShe did, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Jack says. \u201cWhat are there? Twelve babies there?\u201d</p><p>The nursing puppies are all tangled together, wriggling and whining. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>A slow rock song blares from the wedding tent. I must have a wistful look on my face when I gaze in the direction of the band, because Jack takes my elbow and gently lifts me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cDance with me.\u201d He pulls me up against his chest, close enough that I can hear the rapid beat of his heart through his cotton button-down shirt. This dance is decidedly not chaste. Burying his face in my neck, he runs fingertips up and down my arms, melting my skin, making my toes curl.</p><p>\u201cThe wedding was beautiful,\u201d I say. \u201cI liked dancing in the tent with all the candles and sparkling lights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Jack murmurs, swaying slowly. \u201cI prefer this. It\u2019s quiet and private. Not to mention puppies are present.\u201d</p><p>He lifts my chin with two fingers and softly presses a kiss to my lips, and it feels so right it\u2019s wrong, so wrong it\u2019s right. I pull back, touching my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat if someone\u2019s watching?\u201d I say, my eyes darting around.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s gonna see us?\u201d He looks around the barn. \u201cCharlie the mule? George Washington the duck? Ash the dog? I doubt Ash will notice us. She\u2019s got twelve babies to deal with. And ducks and mules are generally stupid. But you\u2019re right, James the pig will probably say something.\u201d</p><p>That makes me laugh.</p><p>\u201cI want to show you a secret,\u201d he murmurs, slipping a hand onto my lower back. The heat from his skin burns through my dress.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d I demand, and he grabs my hand and pulls me out of the barn toward Cedar Hill. We jog together under the moonlight, laughing. Well, it\u2019s not so much jogging as it is him pulling me across the grass. I stop for a sec to take my strappy heels off.</p><p>We end up about a hundred yards from the manor house where Jack approaches an ancient oak tree and shows me the trap door beside it. \u201cWait till you see where it goes.\u201d</p><p>He lifts opens the door, we descend a ladder, and soon I find myself in a long tunnel. Thank God Jack lights a lantern, because otherwise I\u2019d be spooked the hell out.</p><p>\u201cMy ancestors used this as part of the Underground Railroad.\u201d The pride in his voice is sure.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re using it to sneak a girl into the house and into your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that\u2019s where I\u2019m taking you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you aren\u2019t, I\u2019ll be really pissed.\u201d My voice comes out squeaky and excited. It\u2019s dark in the tunnel, but there\u2019s enough light that I can see Jack\u2019s lips part slightly. He sets a hand on my waist and yanks me to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to make you angry,\u201d he says quietly, giving me another kiss. And then another.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d</p><p>He slowly kisses my neck, teasing a gasp from my lips. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me out of this tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d I can hear the grin in his voice.</p><p>We walk briskly and end up in a cellar with a door that leads to another cellar, which is full of rotting wooden crates. Jack takes my elbow and leads me to a narrow staircase. The paint is peeling off the walls and the stairs need polishing.</p><p>When we reach the third floor, a floor I\u2019ve never been to, Jack pushes a door open and I find myself in his bedroom. Jack\u2019s three hounds hop to their feet when they see him, their claws scraping the hardwood floor, but when he snaps and points at their doggie beds along the far wall, they lie back down.</p><p>The bay window is wide open, letting fresh September air and moonlight into the spacious room. Jesus Lord, it\u2019s so big, you could probably fit, like, a bowling alley in here. His queen-sized bed is made\u2014the plaid duvet is perfectly pressed. Little horse figurines sit on his shelves and his backpack is slung over the desk chair. A pair of dirty socks is strewn across the hardwood floor, but otherwise the room is spotless. Unlike any other boy\u2019s room ever. The maids do their jobs.</p><p>\u201cDoes Yvonne know you have dirty laundry on the floor?\u201d I tease, gesturing at his socks.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he says, placing a finger over my lips. \u201cShe\u2019ll hear you and want to clean up. And I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want to be disturbed right now.\u201d</p><p>A world map covered in red thumbtacks hangs on the wall. Most of the tacks are concentrated in Italy, Switzerland, and Germany. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>His eyes light up when he looks at the map. \u201cJust places I want to visit one day, you know, when I have time.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never thought much about traveling\u2014he and I have such different dreams, but seeing the little red thumbtacks makes me want to travel someplace romantic with him.</p><p>A pair of glasses, a bottle of Tylenol, and a picture of him and his dad with a horse sit on his nightstand. I suddenly feel really close to him, seeing his personal things.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks quietly, as he takes off his watch and sets it on his dresser.</p><p>From his shelf I pick up a little black horse figurine. I run my forefinger over its mane, thinking of Moonshadow. \u201cJack, you\u2019re not gonna sell Star, right?\u201d</p><p>He drops his chin onto my shoulder and wraps his arms around my stomach. \u201cNot right now, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do sell horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time. It\u2019s part of the business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you check out who you sell them to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Jack turns me around and stares into my eyes intently. \u201cWe do background checks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter my mom died, I started taking care of this mare. Her name was Moonshadow.\u201d I sniffle, remembering how she used to prance when I entered her stall. \u201cWe took care of each other.\u201d</p><p>He listens as I tell him what awful Mr. Cates did, how he sold Moonshadow to a man who forced her to race, even though her racing days were long gone. At her second race, she stumbled on her way out the gate and broke two legs. They shot her behind the track and left her body, not caring a lick what happened to it. Dad helped me bury her in the woods behind our trailer park.</p><p>That\u2019s why I hated rich people so bad. All they cared about was making more money. At least that\u2019s what I thought. Until I met Jack, who cares about family and honor and history.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Moonshadow,\u201d Jack says, hugging me. \u201cSounds like you were a good friend to her. I\u2019m glad Star has you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was torturing the poor fellow, making him spend time with boys when he hates them. I should\u2019ve known he\u2019s into girls. Just like his owner.\u201d</p><p>I give Jack a playful punch on the shoulder, and he hugs me again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for helping me with Star. On the way home from Kentucky this afternoon, my father told me how proud he is that I stuck to my guns. Maybe I\u2019ll pass this test after all, thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a pretty good team, huh?\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cYeah we are,\u201d he says in a thick voice, and kisses me deeply, pushing me against the wall. We slowly make out and it hits me how right this feels, how there\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be.</p><p>And suddenly things speed up in a very good way. He cups my face with both hands, watching me unbutton his shirt. He twirls me around and unzips my dress, letting it drop to the floor, leaving me in just a bra and panties. Thank God I wore my matching set today. He brushes my curls out of the way so he can kiss my neck from behind, and I wrap an arm around the back of his head, weaving my fingers in his long hair. His chest presses against my back, his heart pounding hard and wild. His hands are everywhere, softly stroking my stomach, my hips, my breasts.</p><p>He yanks his boots off, hopping on one foot to do so, then he\u2019s kissing me again. I pull him to the bed. He falls on top of me. Our lips find each other hungrily. He holds both of my hands above my head as we kiss, trapping me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow am I supposed to unbutton your pants if you won\u2019t let my hands go?\u201d I ask with a tiny voice, shaking all over.</p><p>\u201cNot until I\u2019m finished with you.\u201d He kisses a trail from my neck down to my stomach. \u201cSo that\u2019s where it is,\u201d he says, kissing the horseshoe tattoo on my hip before smiling up at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you wearing a belt buckle that says cocky?\u201d I peer down at his waistband.</p><p>\u201cOh, um...\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes, smiling like crazy. \u201cWould you get back to kissing me already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he says, diving back in. I kiss the sensitive hollow of his neck. His pulse races beneath my lips. I bite his ear and his neck, as we squirm under the covers, our legs twisting together.</p><p>\u201cNot too hard.\u201d He pauses to smile at me. \u201cMy parents will kill me if I show up at breakfast with a hickey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d My face flames devil red.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you one instead,\u201d he says, nipping at my neck. I laugh and try to pull away, but he snuggles me closer beneath the blankets.</p> <p>We make out for ages, as he presses against me and rocks his hips, slowly at first, then faster and faster, and then he finally pushes past the elastic of my panties, to touch me for real. I love it, and can\u2019t stop murmuring his name over and over. I reach between us and unbutton his pants and tug his boxers down, exploring where he\u2019s hard and silky.</p><p>\u201cI think you like me,\u201d he says, grinning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cJust okay?\u201d he murmurs, tickling me, making me squirm and laugh. \u201cJust okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I touch his cheek and return his gaze, feeling so many feelings. \u201cI like you so much,\u201d I say quietly, and he reaches over to his nightstand, opens the top drawer, and pulls out a condom.</p><p>I\u2019m out of breath, panting\u2014about to tell him I don\u2019t want to do this yet, as he begins to slip my underwear down, when I hear a noise.</p> <p>This house is so old you can hear every creak and groan, especially from the hardwood floors. The boards squeak\u2014someone is coming up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHide!\u201d Jack whispers, throwing the bedcovers back, jumping off me, and fastening his pants. He rushes to his dresser and fishes out a T-shirt.</p><p>I grab my dress and shoes and catapult myself into the closet. It\u2019s bigger than my goddamned bedroom. I hide behind one of Jack\u2019s suits and try to listen to what\u2019s happening out in the room. Nothing yet. I take the arm of Jack\u2019s suit jacket and bring it to my nose, loving its guy smell. God, I\u2019ve become a complete psycho.</p><p>I clench up when the knock sounds on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Jack says.</p><p>\u201cJust came to say good night,\u201d his mother says. \u201cYou left the wedding early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d Mr. Goodwin asks.</p><p>A heartbeat. \u201cYeah, just tired. Gotta get up early.\u201d</p> <p>After a long, heart attack-inducing silence, Mr. Goodwin says, \u201cAll right. Sleep well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Mrs. Goodwin adds.</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d Jack says, and a second later I hear the door click shut. I hide beside Jack\u2019s cowboy boot collection for several minutes, until the closet door finally swings open.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he whispers, reaching a hand out. I grab it and pull him to the floor. He laughs as he crawls up between my legs. From his pocket he whips out a red lollipop\u2014one of the fancy ones you can only get at the Cracker Barrel. I hold it against my chest. I\u2019ll save it for a special occasion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get down to Hillcrest,\u201d he says quietly, helping me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He doesn\u2019t return my stare. He\u2019s too busy running a thumb along the underside of my bra.</p><p>\u201cAll I want is to get back in bed with you.\u201d</p><p>He pushes me against the closet wall and our mouths meet again for another passionate kiss. \u201cI\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d he starts. \u201cYou and me\u2014I\u2019ve never felt like\u2014\u201d He doesn\u2019t finish his thought. He slams his lips against mine. When he pulls away, I feel his absence, like when I eat toast without butter.</p><p>\u201cJack? You\u2019re not dating anybody, right? Not Abby or Kelsey or some famous person\u2019s daughter, right?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cNaw. I had a girlfriend...Jenna Lukens...we broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cMy mom introduced us. And I liked her a lot at first...But Jenna went to this private school up on Monteagle Mountain and we didn\u2019t do the long-distance thing so well, and she ended up cheating on me.\u201d His face turns a rosy pink. \u201cAnd she was all sorts of drama. Always wanted me to buy her gifts and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want somebody low-key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Jack nudges my nose with his. \u201cListen, if my dad catches you here, he\u2019ll roast me like a shish kabob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, I love shish kabob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grill for you sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if you know how to use a grill. You\u2019re a kept guy.\u201d</p><p>He grins mischievously. \u201cI\u2019ll prove you wrong.\u201d</p><p>He picks my dress up off the floor, dusts it off, and holds it out so I can put it back on. I pull my hair to the side, and he kisses my back as he zips my dress.</p><p>He turns me around and we kiss again until he murmurs breathlessly, \u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how bad I needed to hear that until he said it. He already had me in his bed wearing only my underwear. He didn\u2019t have to say I\u2019m beautiful.</p><p>But he did.</p><p>The Walk of Shame</p><p>\u201cI knew I was in trouble when I woke up and Luke Skywalker was staring back at me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sitting with Vanessa at Foothills Diner, sharing a slice of rhubarb pie with her. She said she desperately needed to talk to me, so here I am.</p><p>I pound a fist on the table. \u201cI told Rory to get rid of those sheets! I knew something like this might happen...So you saw the sheets? Does that mean...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that I accidentally fell asleep in his bed last night and his parents found us this morning and they called my papa and my brother! It was mortifying!\u201d</p><p>I sit back and cover my mouth. \u201cAnd, uh, what happened...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wasn\u2019t, um, clothed.\u201d Her hand shakes as she sips her coffee. \u201cRemind me never to drink champagne again, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh man, I\u2019m sorry. Did you get in trouble with your grandfather and brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy wanted to fly home from Arizona to \u2018kill Rory\u2019 but then Papa reminded him he had a game today and it wouldn\u2019t be a good thing if the backup quarterback disappeared just to go kill somebody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere Mr. and Mrs. Whitfield pissed?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa taps her fork on her plate. \u201cHis dad made jokes, but like, his mom? She seemed really disappointed in me. I overheard her telling Rory that girls like me aren\u2019t \u2018girlfriend material.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean? Girlfriend material?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only had one serious boyfriend my entire life. But Mrs. Whitfield seemed to be under the impression I sleep around all the time. I\u2019ve only slept with one guy!\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cWell, now you\u2019ve slept with two, right?\u201d</p><p>Her face goes red. She shovels another bite of pie in her mouth and yells for the waitress. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need more pie over here. ASAP! So...what happened to you last night?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou ran off pretty quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, umm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpill.\u201d Vanessa lifts her coffee mug to her mouth, giving me a look that says, I just told you I woke up in a boy\u2019s bed and Star Wars sheets were involved.</p><p>\u201cJack and I fooled around,\u201d I say softly, making Vanessa squeal. Other Foothills patrons glare at us, including a couple of trucker guys. But after they get a good look at Vanessa and her Amazon bod, they smile and sit up straighter.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt was great,\u201d I whisper back. \u201cBut Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin stopped by and I had to hide in the closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and Jack has tons of cowboy boots. And then we made out some more in the closet.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth drops open and then she smiles. \u201cSo, are you guys, like, gonna hook up again...or get together...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what Jack wants yet. His dad would be pissed. My dad would be horrified.\u201d</p><p>She pops another bite of pie into her mouth. \u201cDo you want something with him?\u201d</p><p>I find myself slowly nodding. I want, I want, I want.</p><p>\u201cBe careful...Jack rarely has serious girlfriends,\u201d Vanessa says slowly, cradling her cup. \u201cAlthough you did make out with him two weekends in a row. That\u2019s a record for Jack.\u201d</p><p>I change the subject. \u201cWhat about you and Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed,\u201d Vanessa says quietly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Mrs. Whitfield\u2019s never gonna let me come back over to her house. You know what she said to me? \u2018I wish Rory\u2019s younger brothers hadn\u2019t seen you here. What kind of example does that set?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Rory get the same lecture?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, his Dad just sent him outside to clean something called a manure collector before church.\u201d</p><p>I cringe and take a drink of coffee. \u201cI\u2019m sure Mrs. Whitfield was just shocked,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, all moms are protective, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>Not that Vanessa or I would know anything about that. Several years ago her parents were in a car crash: her father died on the scene and her mom died a while later from her injuries.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2019cause I look like this,\u201d she mumbles. \u201cIt\u2019s like, nobody ever bothers to get to know me. It\u2019s all about my looks. They think I must be evil because I\u2019m pretty. Or they think I have the perfect life\u2014when really I just miss my parents...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to tell her that no one thinks that her life is perfect, but hell, I\u2019ve thought it myself. We don\u2019t know what other people are thinking. We never will unless we ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your friend,\u201d I tell her. \u201cAnd if Mrs. Whitfield doesn\u2019t see how great you are, then screw her.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa looks up and gives me a small smile. \u201cI just hope Rory doesn\u2019t want to end stuff...you know? I haven\u2019t heard from him since this morning...I thought he would\u2019ve found a way to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He really likes you...\u201d</p><p>She grins, looking into her coffee cup. \u201cSo how\u2019d you end up in bed with Jack Goodwin last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you end up in bed with Rory and Darth Vader?\u201d I fire back.</p><p>\u201cAnd Chewbacca.\u201d</p><p>I groan, laughing.</p><p>We finish off two more pieces of rhubarb pie and dish up all our gossip, and the pie tastes a little sweeter than usual.</p><p>Vanessa has this prehistoric plaid couch the color of Halloween.</p><p>Orange, red, gold, and more orange.</p><p>She invited me over to her house after we gorged ourselves on pie, and now here I am, gazing around at a tiny house with brown shag carpet and frayed curtains. Family pictures cover the walls and end tables. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is cozy.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa sprawls out on the Halloween couch. \u201cMy brother, Ty, keeps trying to buy Papa this house that looks like a castle, but we like it here. But Papa did agree to that TV.\u201d She points at a flat screen. \u201cTy always thinks we should have the best, no matter if it\u2019s practical or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you miss Ty?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa nods slowly. \u201cHe wanted me to move out to Arizona with him, but I didn\u2019t want to change schools senior year. And I can\u2019t leave Papa. I\u2019d miss him too much...he\u2019s like, my best friend.\u201d She glances away, embarrassed. I\u2019ve never heard somebody call a grandparent a best friend. Awesome.</p> <p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t your grandfather go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves it here. He likes his job at the pajama factory. And besides, I\u2019m going to college at Middle Tennessee state.\u201d</p><p>The house smells a little musty because it\u2019s old, but it\u2019s full of warmth, and it amazes me that a guy who came from this life went on to play for the Arizona Cardinals. He took his talents and ran. And now Vanessa is seeing the benefits and doesn\u2019t have to worry about money anymore. I don\u2019t want to worry about money anymore. But the NFL is on an entirely different echelon than horse jockeying.</p><p>College could give me new opportunities like Ty had. Maybe I should consider going to talk to the guidance counselor.</p><p>Vanessa and I sit down to watch a movie and she tells me how glad she is I moved here and that it\u2019s easy to talk for real with me. She admits that she and Kelsey have more of a surface-level friendship because Kelsey never lets people get close, which sort of shocks me. That girl is such a mystery.</p> <p>Vanessa and I are still talking when the doorbell rings. She stands to answer the door, revealing Rory. They look at each other for a long moment before he launches himself into her arms, kissing her cheeks and lips and holding her tight. She wraps her arms around his neck and presses her forehead to his.</p><p>Jesus, it\u2019s like they\u2019re already in love.</p><p>\u201cAre you in big trouble with your mom?\u201d Vanessa asks. \u201cDoes she hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she does, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Rory says. \u201cI want you. Like, I want to date only you and I just...\u201d He pauses to take a deep breath, looking into her eyes. \u201cI like you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry I fell asleep last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I let us drink so much champagne,\u201d Rory says with a nervous laugh.</p> <p>\u201cNever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m getting a warm feeling watching them. He doesn\u2019t care whether his parents like Vanessa or not. They want each other, so they\u2019re going to be together. I love that.</p><p>What would happen if I told Dad and Cindy that I want to be with Jack? Would Jack make sure his father doesn\u2019t fire my family? Would Jack tell his father about us?</p><p>I love Jack\u2019s confidence, his smirk, his sense of humor, the way he cares for his little sister, the way he loves his animals, he edits his mom\u2019s cookbook, he helped me pour water at dinner that night. I just like him.</p><p>I want Jack, and I shouldn\u2019t let anybody\u2014not even myself\u2014get in the way of it.</p><p>When I get home, I find Dad and Cindy sitting on the couch, looking at a baby name book she borrowed from Mrs. Goodwin.</p><p>\u201cShortcake, what do you think of Arya?\u201d Cindy asks.</p> <p>\u201cI like it, but it sounds too medieval,\u201d I say, squeezing onto the couch on the other side of Dad. I lean against his arm, rest my chin on his shoulder, and look down at the book with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about something modern?\u201d I ask. \u201cHow about Marriott?\u201d</p><p>Cindy laughs. \u201cWe are not naming the baby after a hotel chain.\u201d</p><p>We flip through the book for a while longer, checking out names like Crimson (love it!), Katherine (Cindy\u2019s choice), and Nina (Dad thinks it\u2019s sweet).</p><p>I sigh, snuggling closer to Dad, resting my head on his shoulder. \u201cCan I talk to you about something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cindy says, snapping the book shut.</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise you won\u2019t get mad or jump to conclusions or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe promise,\u201d Dad says, taking my hand. \u201cBut you\u2019d better not be pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Lord, Dad! You need to get a filter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Cindy gently taps his arm. \u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I look around to make sure nobody else is nearby listening in. \u201cUm...here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with Jack...and I want to try dating him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dad says, shaking his head fast.</p><p>\u201cBut I really like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to start anything with him.\u201d</p><p>How do you tell your dad it\u2019s too late? It\u2019s not like I\u2019d tell him Jack and I have already been to third base together.</p><p>\u201cHow could you disobey me?\u201d His voice is angry and full of hurt. \u201cYou know the Goodwins don\u2019t want us interfering with their lives. They don\u2019t even want us in their house!\u201d</p><p>Cindy pats his knee. \u201cShhh.\u201d She gives me a disappointed-mom face, even though she\u2019s not my stepmother yet. \u201cAfter what happened with Moonshadow, I don\u2019t want to see you hurt again. Being with Jack might seem good today, but that could change.\u201d</p><p>Memories of kissing Jack one night and then having him back off the next day fill my mind. He played Abby Winchester. He probably wrote Kelsey Painter off too. But I could be different, right?</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s my decision,\u201d I say. Breakups are always a possibility, but without him, life will feel like riding a super slow mule. \u201cI want this.\u201d</p><p>Dad and Cindy exchange a long look. Finally he lets out a long sigh. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford for you to a make a decision that\u2019ll mess up our jobs right now, understand?\u201d He sets his jaw. \u201cEver since we moved here, every decision you\u2019ve made has been selfish or dangerous\u2014with your jockeying and exercise riding and looking at colleges on the computer or dating my boss\u2019s son. You know I can\u2019t afford to send you to college\u2014\u201d Dad\u2019s voice breaks. \u201cRory Whitfield is a nice guy. Why don\u2019t you date him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never gonna like Rory like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur lives,\u201d Dad starts, blowing into his cupped hands. \u201cWe\u2019re never gonna have lives like the Goodwins. I don\u2019t know what ideas this place is putting into your head but it needs to stop before you get hurt and Cindy and your little sister get hurt too, got it?\u201d His tone is fiercely mean and serious.</p><p>My hands and lips are trembling. I feel queasy. A stabbing pain rushes up my arm and into my chest. I start shaking all over.</p><p>Dad has never spoken to me like this. Ever.</p><p>Growing up, Dad told me stories about how his father, my papa, never could keep a steady job as a groom and they bought all their groceries with food stamps. Didn\u2019t Dad start working at Cedar Hill because he wanted a better life? What\u2019s so wrong with me going after something better?</p><p>\u201cCan I still be a jockey?\u201d I ask through clenched teeth, curling my hands into fists.</p><p>\u201cI said you could until something else bad happens, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Dad runs a hand through his hair, grasping it tightly.</p><p>Cindy says, \u201cWe just worry about you, Shortcake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me Shortcake!\u201d I burst. \u201cOnly Mom and Dad are allowed to call me that!\u201d</p><p>Cindy looks down at her stomach and starts crying. Dad\u2019s face immediately softens and he tells her he loves her and the baby.</p><p>Yvonne appears in the doorway with wide eyes, holding her needlework, looking at the three of us. She gives me a wink and a nod before disappearing back toward her room.</p><p>I stand up on shaky knees. \u201cI\u2019m going for a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from Jack Goodwin,\u201d Dad calls out.</p><p>I jet out the door, ignoring Dad, pulling a sucker from my pocket and jabbing it into my mouth.</p><p>I make it all the way to Greenbriar pasture before I start sobbing.</p><p>It\u2019s late on Sunday afternoon, and everyone\u2019s enjoying post-church supper with their families so the racetracks are deserted. Only a few farmhands are around, monitoring the grazing horses. I open the gate, and Star immediately jogs over to me, whinnying softly. He doesn\u2019t stop to show me respect; he buries his nose in my neck and sighs.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I whisper into his mane.</p><p>How could Dad yell at me like that? Doesn\u2019t he care what I feel for Jack? It\u2019s not like I ever yelled at him when he got Cindy pregnant when there\u2019s no way in hell he could afford another kid. And I haven\u2019t been selfish at all. Of course, Dad doesn\u2019t know I asked Mr. Goodwin to supplement Cindy\u2019s paychecks with my own...</p><p>Jack\u2019s three dogs bound up, panting and slobbering all over the place, chasing each other around the cedar trees. I turn to find Jack looking over his shoulder toward the manor house.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping I\u2019d find you here,\u201d he says, the corner of his mouth lifting into a subtle grin. \u201cThis is becoming our spot.\u201d He gestures at the pasture.</p><p>I nod, giving him a little smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I shake my head, not ready to talk yet.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk,\u201d he says. I follow him out the gate and toward the lake. Star snorts, upset that I\u2019m leaving him behind.</p><p>Jack leads me down to the lake with his hounds in tow. There, he wipes the tears out from under my eyes and I curl up against his chest. That gives him the opening he needs, I guess, because soon we\u2019re kissing and his hands are in my hair and I\u2019m running my hands under his T-shirt, dragging my fingertips over his abs. It\u2019s a warm September evening and the stars are just beginning to peek out. Twilight.</p><p>\u201cIf I take your clothes off, Jasper will steal them,\u201d Jack murmurs between kisses, as he unsnaps my bra, leaving my shirt on.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want that,\u201d I say softly, laughing.</p><p>We lie down together in the grass, him straddling my hips, reenacting what we did last night. He unbuttons my jeans and slides them down until they\u2019re hooked around one of my ankles, and he kisses and touches me until I\u2019m tingling all over. But we go a step further, doing something I\u2019ve never done.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he whispers, threading his fingers through my hair, and I nod. I take him in my hand and go down on him\u2014because I want to. It\u2019s awkward and I\u2019m scared I\u2019m doing something wrong, but I love feeling close to him. He seems to like what I\u2019m doing...</p><p>When we\u2019re both finished, he presses his cheek to mine and whispers, \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><p>I nod, snuggling against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we got interrupted last night,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI\u2019ll have to take you up to our weekend cabin in Kentucky sometime soon, so we can have privacy...\u201d</p><p>I love the idea of being his houseguest at their cabin. I\u2019ve never been there, but I heard Jodi telling Cindy about it. Jodi said it was about the prettiest place she\u2019d ever seen, covered in ivy like straight out of a fairy tale.</p><p>I smile into Jack\u2019s shoulder, close my eyes, and enjoy the sounds of water lapping gently against the banks. \u201cJack?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmm?\u201d he mumbles, playing with my hair.</p><p>\u201cIf I were to, like, go see the guidance counselor tomorrow at school...would you, um, come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to talk to her about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking at some colleges online but I don\u2019t know if any of them will work for me...because Dad can\u2019t pay for any of it.\u201d I suck in a deep breath, embarrassed out of my mind. \u201cAnd if the guidance counselor says something I don\u2019t understand I thought maybe you could help me?\u201d</p> <p>Jack kisses my head. \u201cSure. I can do that. But don\u2019t you think you should bring your dad, not me?\u201d</p><p>I grasp his T-shirt and twist it, holding on tight. \u201cI talked to him and Cindy a little while ago, and my dad brought up college when I was telling them about me and you and how we might be together and I don\u2019t think he wants me to apply\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told your dad and Cindy about us?\u201d He sits up straight, knocking me off his chest. I bring myself to a sitting position and start to resnap my bra. Why\u2019s he acting so skittish? \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like talking to my dad,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou told him what we did last night?\u201d he exclaims.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I say, waving my hands. I swallow hard, feeling tears burn my eyes again. \u201cI just told Dad and Cindy that I like you and I\u2019m not gonna stay away from you like they want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you would\u2019ve talked to me before just announcing we\u2019re, like, a couple or whatever,\u201d Jack says, dragging a hand through his hair. He looks seriously pissed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him that!\u201d I nervously pick blades of grass. \u201cI told them I like you...and wanted to be with you, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Jack lets out a long breath. \u201cLook, I\u2019m glad you feel that way, but we can\u2019t have a real relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou know we can\u2019t. I thought you wanted to be together...like, in secret. As friends with benefits.\u201d</p> <p>Did he really just say friends with benefits?</p><p>\u201cLike, we\u2019d hook up, but we\u2019d never go out on dates and stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019d be together on the down low.\u201d</p><p>Did he really just say down low?</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just try it for real? See what people say?\u201d</p><p>Jack won\u2019t stop clutching his hair. \u201cIs your father gonna tell my dad? You can\u2019t let him tell my father! I have to show him I\u2019m a good owner who respects his staff.\u201d</p><p>Tears have already begun to drip down my cheeks. I wipe them away as quickly as I can. If he didn\u2019t hold all the power before, he does now. I gave it to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure my dad doesn\u2019t say anything,\u201d I say quietly.</p> <p>\u201cGood, because my dad hasn\u2019t finished the Paradise Park deal yet. If the Winchesters think I\u2019m dating somebody else, it\u2019ll ruin everything for Dad.\u201d Jack shakes his head. He looks pissed.</p><p>This is one of those bad memories that\u2019s going to play on repeat over and over in my head. Like the memories of Moonshadow. I can\u2019t believe I shared her story with Jack. Maybe I was right before. Rich people are all alike. Only care about their goddamned money. Only care about what\u2019s best for them.</p><p>I dig my fingernails into my palm, trying to decide the best thing to say. Something I won\u2019t regret when I look back on this moment.</p><p>It\u2019s weird. I\u2019ve never felt so many things at once. Anger. Shame. Sadness.</p><p>More humiliation than I\u2019ve ever experienced.</p><p>But mostly pride for what I\u2019m about to do.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do this in secret,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that a business deal is dependent on you playing Abby Winchester. I hate that a deal is more important than my feelings. Do you have any idea how shitty it\u2019s gonna feel to tell Dad and Cindy that they were right about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d he mumbles, his nostrils flaring.</p><p>I laugh harshly. \u201cThey said you lose interest in girls after a couple days and that I wasn\u2019t anything special. They\u2019re right. If I were special, you wouldn\u2019t want to keep me a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, Sava\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d I reply, crossing my arms across my stomach. I feel sick. I can\u2019t believe what I just did with him...and then this happens. \u201cYou may not respect me, but I respect myself enough to not do this with you. I hope your dad gets his racetrack and I hope it\u2019s worth what it\u2019s costing you: me.\u201d</p><p>Dead Last</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to kick his ass?\u201d</p><p>I try to focus on my geometry homework through my anger.</p><p>\u201cBecause I can kick his ass,\u201d Rory goes on.</p><p>Vanessa nods. \u201cAnd if you won\u2019t let Rory kick his ass, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys, I can kick his ass myself,\u201d I say, sniffling and wiping my nose.</p><p>During study hall, I\u2019ve just finished telling my friends about what happened with Jack. I left out the part about how I went down on him. Can you say Big Mistake? Vanessa and Rory warned me about Jack. I feel ashamed that they know I\u2019m nothing special to him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t join me for lunch or study hall today, instead choosing to sit with Kelsey Painter and Colton Bradford. She\u2019s chattering to Jack nonstop and Colton\u2019s resting his head on the table. On the one hand, I\u2019m glad Jack didn\u2019t sit with me, because I don\u2019t want to smell his cologne and risk burying my face in his neck. At the same time, the hurt and embarrassment are pumping through my veins.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say quietly, chewing my eraser. \u201cI mean, I could still be with him if I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d have to keep him a secret,\u201d Vanessa says. \u201cThat is such a dick move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never ask a girl to be secret friends with benefits or whatever,\u201d Rory says, stretching an arm around Vanessa.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not. You have a girlfriend now, remember?\u201d she says.</p><p>They grin at each other lovingly and my insides curl up and die.</p><p>\u201cMy cousin, Alex, texted me yesterday.\u201d Rory gives me a sly smile. \u201cHe asked about you. Who you are and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask. I haven\u2019t even thought about Alex since Saturday night.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s single now. We should all do something together soon,\u201d Rory says, and Vanessa nods. I don\u2019t need a guy to feel happy, but I like the idea of meeting more Tennessee people.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that might be good,\u201d I say softly, sneaking a peek at Jack. Even though lunch ended an hour ago and we\u2019re in the library, he\u2019s digging around in the cooler Yvonne packed for him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at him!\u201d Vanessa blurts.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d I say. I hate that I feel weak.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Vanessa says, throwing her pencil down. \u201cNext weekend, you and I are going to the Infinity club in Nashville. The one that lets people under eighteen in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fun,\u201d Rory says.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not invited. It\u2019s girls only,\u201d Vanessa says.</p><p>\u201cBut I have some new dance moves to share.\u201d Rory pouts.</p><p>\u201cYou can show me in private,\u201d Vanessa says, and I nearly barf.</p><p>I stuff my worksheet into my math book and stand. Vanessa and Rory are already too busy kissing to notice me taking off, but Jack follows me with his eyes as I leave the library. He seems sad\u2014he doesn\u2019t even notice that Kelsey is stealing a Capri Sun from his cooler. When she sees him staring at me, she taps his hand.</p><p>He quickly shakes his head and turns his focus to her, listening to whatever she\u2019s saying.</p><p>And that\u2019s just fine.</p><p>When Rory drops me off at Cedar Hill after school, I go to Hillcrest to ditch my backpack before my training session with Gael.</p><p>Dad and Cindy look up when I enter the common room, but Dad doesn\u2019t meet my eyes. \u201cSavannah,\u201d he starts. \u201cI need to take Cindy to the doctor this afternoon. She\u2019s tired and couldn\u2019t hold any food down this weekend. I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just see the doctor a couple of weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking chances,\u201d Dad says, touching her stomach.</p><p>I suddenly feel choked up. Not only because I\u2019m worried about the baby, but because yesterday\u2019s argument with Dad is still hanging in the air. If Mom were here, would she know what to say to make me feel better?</p><p>\u201cSavannah,\u201d Cindy says, rubbing her eyes. I go kneel in front of her chair. \u201cCan you help me again? I\u2019m so sorry to ask but I haven\u2019t finished something for Mrs. Goodwin and she\u2019s having a charity meeting in the morning\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Cindy pauses for a sec. \u201cI had started to wax the parlor floor but the smell was making me feel sick\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d I charge to my room to change into grungy clothes.</p><p>\u201cSavannah,\u201d Dad calls, but I shut my bedroom door before I can hear what he wants. He doesn\u2019t care what I want anyway. Why should I bother with him? Especially after I\u2019ve been trying to help our family.</p><p>When I come back out into the common room, it\u2019s empty. Dad and Cindy have left for the doctor without saying good-bye. Whatever.</p><p>Up at the manor house, Paula shows me where to find the wax for the floor and gives me a quick tutorial. I dip an old T-shirt in the wax and wring it out so the shirt won\u2019t absorb too much wax and kneel, massaging the wax into the wood floor. Paula said that when the wax begins to look cloudy, I should use a clean towel to buff the wood. Damn, being a maid is harder than riding a horse. Waxing is killing both my arms.</p><p>I hear laughter and footsteps coming through the foyer toward the steps. I look up to find Kelsey and Jack standing in the doorway to the parlor.</p><p>Hell. Could my life become any more embarrassing? Before you know it, I\u2019ll be cleaning toilets like Marcus Winchester\u2019s servants.</p><p>Kelsey focuses on me for a sec, looking confused, then goes back to typing on her cell and begins to climb the stairs. \u201cCome on, Jack.\u201d Is she going to his room? Are they going to hook up?</p><p>He ignores her and steps into the room, his nose crinkling. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cWaxing the floor. Why isn\u2019t Paula or Cindy doing it? Or even Yvonne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s Cindy\u2019s job and she had to go to the doctor. And we can\u2019t afford to lose her hours. Somebody has to work.\u201d I bend back over and wax harder.</p><p>\u201cWhat a good idea,\u201d a voice says. I glance up to find Gael standing there. Can this day get any goddamned worse? \u201cI should have all my jockeys and exercise boys wax floors. It\u2019s great for upper body strength. Savannah, can you wax my truck before our training session?\u201d</p><p>I glare at both of them.</p><p>\u201cGael, can you give us a minute, please?\u201d Jack says in a soft voice.</p><p>Gael raises his eyebrows and vamooses quicker than you can say on your mark.</p><p>Jack squats next to me, picks up the old T-shirt, and sniffs it, getting a grossed out look on his face. I snatch it out of his hand and rub the floor, trying to ignore the fresh smell of his laundered clothes and cologne. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>I nod toward the staircase. \u201cWhat about Kelsey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going on with her.

I want to find a way for you and me to be together...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to be waxing the damned floor, but we don\u2019t always get what we wish for.\u201d</p><p>Jack stands and takes a step back, glaring down at me. \u201cFine.\u201d He marches out of the room, his boots crashing down on the floor.</p><p>I wipe the sweat off my forehead and get back to work.</p><p>Later that evening, someone raps on my door while I\u2019m reading the Daily Racing Form. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p> <p>Rory opens the door and sits down on my bed with me, pulling me into a hug. \u201cI want to kill that bastard for making you feel so bad.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly, clutching his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep with him, did you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI thought you like it when girls sleep with guys after two minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d he says. \u201cNot you. I think Jack\u2019s a dumbass. He obviously wants you...\u201d</p><p>I know.</p> <p>\u201cCome eat dinner with me,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can go to Tennessee Ballers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you run over my lines with me later? I\u2019m auditioning for the school play.\u201d</p><p>I love that he\u2019s trying to distract me. \u201cAre they doing the play you wrote? Call Me When Your Mom Is Back in Town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rory says, sighing deeply. \u201cMrs. Towne said my play was too risqu\u00e9 for high school. We\u2019re doing Peter Pan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I hope you get the role of Peter! You\u2019ll get to fly around the stage hanging from those cord thingies.\u201d</p><p>He winks. \u201cYou just want to see me in green tights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d I laugh, and then Rory goes to find dinner, because when you\u2019re a seventeen-year-old boy, food outweighs all else.</p> <p>An hour later, Cindy shows up carrying a tray with a piece of chicken, some cooked carrots, and a small glass of milk. She brings it to my bed and sits down beside me, patting my leg. Just like Dad this afternoon, she can\u2019t seem to meet my gaze, and her face is red.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the baby?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor says she\u2019s fine,\u201d Cindy replies, sniffling. She pinches her nose. \u201cI guess some women have more difficult pregnancies than others. He said I shouldn\u2019t be doing so much physical labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell the Goodwins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the morning,\u201d she replies, wringing her fingers. \u201cI\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll let me go...I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to move away from you and your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that.\u201d I give her a hug. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Dad appears in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want to talk to you right now,\u201d I say, making him wince.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to say thanks for helping with the floors today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you. I did it for my little sister.\u201d</p><p>Dad comes in and shuts the door. There\u2019s hardly room for him to stand in here.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about what happened yesterday,\u201d Dad says. \u201cYou need to underst\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working hard on the track!\u201d I interrupt. \u201cI\u2019ve been giving Mr. Goodwin money I make so that Cindy can take time off. So you\u2019ll have more money to spend on the baby. And then you yell at me and call me selfish and say I\u2019m doing reckless things. And Jack has been so nice to me\u2014I thought he wanted me\u2014\u201d</p><p>It all comes pouring out. Who is this weak girl speaking with my mouth?</p><p>My hands are shaking and my heart is thumping against my chest. A cool, slimy feeling flows through my body, as if somebody\u2019s dipping me in a vat of ice water.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to help with our bills,\u201d Dad says quietly. He moves toward me, as if he\u2019s going to hug me, but I hold up a hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I cry, putting my face in my hands. \u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShortcake,\u201d Dad says, but I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cPlease go away.\u201d</p><p>He sniffles and rubs his eyes, and Cindy\u2019s tearing up. I can\u2019t bear to hear them say I told you so. I just can\u2019t. Not after he yelled at me and wouldn\u2019t listen yesterday. I can\u2019t bear to tell them they were right about Jack.</p><p>I clutch my pillow and stare out the tiny rectangular window near the ceiling. Life is so damned unfair. When I looked out Jack\u2019s large bay window, I could see a million stars. My window is so small, I can only see a handful. If I had been born to a richer family, I\u2019d have so many more stars to wish upon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I got upset,\u201d Dad says softly. His eyes glisten. \u201cI\u2019m so, so proud of you. For getting a jockey position at a top farm. For even thinking about college.\u201d</p><p>I nod and let him hug me and rub my back. Cindy holds my hand and combs my hair with her fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re the strongest girl I know,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI wish I were more like you.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her through my tears, and she takes my hand and places it on her stomach, so I can feel a kick. I suddenly can\u2019t wait to meet my baby sister.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to yell,\u201d Dad says. \u201cIt\u2019s just, you\u2019re growing up, and I can\u2019t protect you from everything.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t cried like this since the day I found Moonshadow\u2019s body. I let them hug me, wishing I could forget how I hooked up with Jack and shared a part of myself with him. I gave him something I\u2019ve never given anyone else.</p><p>The honest to God truth is that I\u2019m mad at myself. I should\u2019ve known better.</p><p>It\u2019s Thursday evening, and Vanessa, Rory, and I are meeting his cousin Alex at the county fair. A double date. I\u2019m pretty excited about it, but I\u2019m trying not to get my hopes up.</p><p>I love fairs. Something about the idea of walking around holding hands with a guy under the night sky makes me feel like I\u2019ll find my one true love here. The fair is full of hope.</p><p>We hop out of Rory\u2019s truck into muddy divots and begin making our way up to the ticket booth covered with flashing lights. The night is crisp and cool and smells of popcorn and cow poop. I wipe my sweaty palms on my jeans and anxiously scan the crowd for Alex.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d Rory says with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cQuiet, you,\u201d Vanessa says to Rory. She flashes me an excited glance.</p><p>A couple minutes later, I see Alex coming our way. I fight the urge to bounce on my tiptoes. He\u2019s dressed very comfortably\u2014jeans and flip-flops, and his T-shirt and over shirt are untucked and a bit wrinkled. I love how Jack always looks so put-together, but I like Alex\u2019s look too. And of course I adore his floppy Whitfield hair.</p><p>He gives Rory a pat on the back then hugs Vanessa, and finally turns his focus to me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says.</p><p>I stick out my hand to shake his and he takes it, smiling into my eyes. His fingers are warm, and I\u2019m excited about what might happen tonight. I hope whatever happens makes me forget how much I miss Jack. I force his face and smile out of my thoughts.</p><p>We each get $5 worth of tickets\u2014enough to ride the Ferris wheel, slam each other in bumper cars, and get queasy on the Tilt-a-Whirl. The smell of funnel cakes and fries wafts under my nose, mesmerizing me just as much as the flashing lights and bells dinging when kids win prizes.</p><p>Our first stop is the Tilt-a-Whirl, where Vanessa and I scream our heads off and get sufficiently nauseous, while Rory and Alex have a grand ole time. Then Rory and Vanessa want to ride the Ferris wheel, so we head that way. Alex and I watch them climb into a bucket seat and grab the handlebar as it settles in their laps.</p><p>\u201cRiding the Ferris wheel must be code for making out,\u201d Alex says, as Vanessa and Rory start pawing at each other.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to?\u201d he asks, pointing at the ride.</p><p>\u201cMake out?\u201d I tease.</p><p>He pauses for a sec, looking freaked out. \u201cI meant ride the Ferris wheel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was joking.\u201d My face feels a million degrees.</p><p>Alex walks up to the ticket taker guy and when I try to pass over tickets of my own, he waves my hand away. \u201cI got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBut wait. Are you tall enough to ride the ride?\u201d Alex asks, pointing to the ruler.</p><p>I give him a faux evil look and go grab a seat. We grasp the bar, looking straight ahead as the wheel moves backward in a lurch, lifting us up into the black sky. From way up here, you can see all of downtown. The Franklin Theater marquee burns red and gold. A blue light flashes on top of the water tower.</p><p>Alex looks at me sideways. \u201cIn full disclosure, I haven\u2019t been on a first date in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have mercy on you,\u201d I say with a laugh. He doesn\u2019t date often? That\u2019s hard to believe. Wind rushes against my face as the Ferris wheel reaches for the stars again.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a horse jockey?\u201d he asks, lifting an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty sexy.\u201d</p><p>I give him a friendly shove and launch into telling him about last week\u2019s race and my hopes for this weekend at Keeneland and the upcoming Dixiana Derby. Alex watches my face and asks questions about jockeying and soon I\u2019m quizzing him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a biology major at Middle Tennessee State,\u201d he says. It turns out he likes rock climbing and spends most weekends in the woods.</p><p>When we get off the Ferris wheel, Vanessa and Rory say they want to ride it again\u2014which is code for wanting to make out some more, so Alex buys us a funnel cake and we walk around, chatting and licking powdered sugar off our fingers.</p><p>I see lots of people from school. Colton Bradford and Kelsey Painter are hanging out with the cheerleading squad and guys from the football team. They\u2019re taking turns going down the Megaslide, squealing and banging against each other as they land on the cushioned bottom. Colton and Kelsey wave at me, and it doesn\u2019t escape my notice when they check out Alex.</p><p>Colton mouths at me, \u201cHe\u2019s hot!\u201d and makes inappropriate gestures with his hips, and I grin back at him. What a perv. It surprises me that Jack isn\u2019t with them tonight. And it surprises me even more that Kelsey waved at me.</p><p>\u201cHow about the Fun House?\u201d Alex asks, and we spend a few minutes giggling into a mirror that makes us look about a thousand pounds apiece.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go on a diet,\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cOn second thought, you\u2019re not my type.\u201d Alex chuckles as I shake my hips, making my thousand-pound self dance in the mirror.</p><p>His phone rings, he fishes it out of his pocket, and stares at the screen. \u201cI need to take this. C\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>We leave the Fun House, and while he chats on the phone, I go over to the dime toss game where I pay three tickets to throw five dimes into little glass bowls filled with water. I miss all five times.</p><p>That\u2019s when I see them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack and Shelby Goodwin. He has one hand protectively curled over her shoulder as they\u2019re coming out of the art pavilion.</p><p>Of course Alex is still pacing and talking on the phone. Did he forget he was on a date with me? Embarrassing.</p><p>I pay another three tickets and focus on the game. I miss all five times again.</p><p>\u201cWow, you are awful at this.\u201d</p> <p>I turn to face Jack.</p><p>Shelby elbows her brother\u2019s ribs. \u201cWith that mouth it\u2019s no wonder you can\u2019t keep a girlfriend. Hi, Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, and pass three more tickets over to play again.</p><p>\u201cYou here alone?\u201d Jack asks, glancing around.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m on a date.\u201d I point at Alex, who has a finger stuffed in his ear so he can better hear the person on the other end of the line. This had better be important because he\u2019s been on the phone at least five minutes now.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jack replies, furrowing his brow.</p><p>\u201cWin me something,\u201d Shelby demands to Jack, so he pays three tickets to play the dime game. He tosses four times before nailing a shot and winning Shelby a brown stuffed horse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll play again,\u201d Jack says, passing over tickets. As Shelby starts talking to a friend, gossiping about some boy in the eighth grade, Jack nails a shot on the second try, winning another stuffed animal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that one,\u201d he says. He points toward a small pink unicorn. The worker plucks it off the prize wall and Jack hands it to me. \u201cFor your room. It\u2019ll match your Strawberry Shortcake bedspread.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at him then take the stuffed animal, slipping it under my arm. \u201cI\u2019m naming him Seabiscuit.\u201d</p><p>Jack gives me a withering look. \u201cReally? Seabiscuit? You know the best horses at our farm come from Nasrullah and Secretariat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll name him War Horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Lord.\u201d Jack laughs and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m predictable, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in my mind, no,\u201d he says quietly, rubbing the back of his neck. He glances over at Alex. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite part of the fair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mule races.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? Mine\u2019s going to the dog show.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, and we look into each other\u2019s eyes. He\u2019s quiet for a long, still moment. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to Saturday. I think you and Star can win this one.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re racing at Keeneland in Kentucky this weekend. Jack entered Star in a handicap with a $150,000 purse.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m excited for Saturday too,\u201d I say, not able to keep the excitement out of my voice. \u201cI know we\u2019ll win this one.\u201d</p><p>Jack grins. Then shakes his head and focuses on the Ferris wheel. It loops around twice as we stand in silence. When I was a little girl and watched older girls walk around with their boyfriends at the fair, I couldn\u2019t wait for the day I\u2019d do it myself. And now here I am: practically alone since my date ditched me for a phone call. Alone, when I have the guy I truly want right next to me.</p><p>\u201cSavannah,\u201d Jack says, glancing at his sister, who\u2019s still preoccupied with her friend. \u201cI know I haven\u2019t been good to you, but I want to find a way\u2014\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Alex walks back over and drops a hand on my shoulder. \u201cSorry about that. A friend was having trouble sorting something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jack.\u201d He stretches a hand out to shake Alex\u2019s. Alex introduces himself then asks if I want to ride the teacups. I nod.</p><p>\u201cBye, Jack,\u201d I say, and a panicked look rushes onto his face as I turn away with Alex. But I leave him behind.</p><p>\u201cWho was that guy?\u201d Alex asks.</p><p>\u201cMy boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. He\u2019s kinda young.\u201d</p><p>I glance back to see Jack putting an arm around his little sister\u2019s shoulders and guiding her toward the Ferris wheel.</p><p>Alex and I board the teacups and he cozies up next to me\u2014it\u2019s getting cold out here. The rest of the night goes smoothly\u2014no more Goodwins show up, and Alex doesn\u2019t get any more phone calls, and when we\u2019re leaving the fair, he gives me a quick peck on the cheek and asks if he can call me Saturday, so maybe we can grab a bite to eat or something that evening.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019d be great.\u201d I smile. The night wasn\u2019t a complete win, but I had a nice time and I\u2019d like to see him again. He\u2019s nice and he kissed my cheek and he treated me well. What more can I ask for?</p><p>But later that night, against my better judgment, I curl up with the pink unicorn and stare out my little rectangular window at the stars, imagining Jack\u2019s arms around me.</p><p>Thanks to a bad rain on Friday, the track at Keeneland is a big mud pit. The horses have to work double time just to make it around during practice. It\u2019s like when humans try to run on the beach. During practice, I take Star out for a warm-up, and on the backstretch, Star pulls up hard and I fall. I shoulder roll into a big puddle. The mud cushions the fall, but I\u2019m covered in muck.</p><p>Star doesn\u2019t take off like he normally does when he bucks his riders. He pushes my head with his nose, as if he\u2019s telling me to get up. He snorts and digs a hoof into the mud.</p><p>As I\u2019m standing up, wiping the mud off my gloves on my pants, Jack, Gael, Dad, and Mr. Goodwin come slopping through the mud toward me. Gael grabs Star\u2019s bridle.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, keeping my voice steady. My butt doesn\u2019t even hurt.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you off the track,\u201d Gael says, leading us back to the stalls. Rory comes to give Star a bath and get him fed.</p><p>\u201cSon,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says to Jack, \u201cI think you should either pull Star from the race or put Townsend on as jockey instead of Savannah. She just doesn\u2019t have the experience racing in muddy conditions. I don\u2019t want her to fall during the real thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I start.</p><p>\u201cMr. Goodwin\u2019s right,\u201d Dad says, scanning my filthy clothes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d I say. \u201cSo I fell one time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve fallen during practice too,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gotta get experience sometime,\u201d Gael says, and I flash him a smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a Cedar Hill rider falling in a race,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t look good for me and my farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really gonna let this happen?\u201d I ask Jack.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t meet my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought you made the decisions,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re supposedly acting owner of the farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust not when it\u2019s important, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Jack opens his mouth to speak then shuts it again. His forehead crinkles and he looks down before glancing up at his dad again.</p><p>\u201cUse Townsend as your jockey,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says. \u201cThis is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jack says quietly. \u201cDad\u2019s right\u2014I don\u2019t want you to get hurt. I\u2019m racing Townsend.\u201d He jets out of the stall, leaving me leaning over onto my knees, gasping for breath.</p><p>They know Star doesn\u2019t like boys. It pisses me off that they\u2019re willing to risk Star being uncomfortable. Besides, I came in third last time! That\u2019s a gazillion times better than Townsend ever managed on Star. I yank my gloves off, throw them on the floor, stomp out of the stall, and slam the door shut. Minerva sticks her head out of her stall, looking me in the eye, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I say, charging out of the barn. Rory sees me and chases after me, trying to talk.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Rory asks, grabbing my elbow.</p><p>\u201cJust leave me alone!\u201d I yell, storming toward the grandstands.</p><p>I find a place far away from the paddock to stand and watch Star\u2019s race. Jack already told me he can\u2019t date me because of who I am. And now he\u2019s taking this away from me? Asshole.</p><p>Before the race starts, Jack comes to join me in the grandstands. He brings me a hot cocoa from the concession stand because it\u2019s so chilly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d Jack says, passing me the Styrofoam cup. I don\u2019t want to accept his peace offering, but only an idiot would turn down a free hot chocolate on a day like this. Stupid rainstorm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d I say. \u201cAre you gonna take orders from your dad for the rest of your life? When are you gonna actually stand up and act like an owner? Or is that just a title for you?\u201d</p><p>Jack furrows his eyebrows, looking hurt and pissed, and I know I\u2019ve dealt a low blow, but I need to put shields up around myself.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it only because Dad told me to,\u201d Jack says. He musses his wet hair, and rain drips down his face.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you do it?\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cBecause I care about you!\u201d he roars. People in the grandstands stare at us. \u201cI care about you so much and I don\u2019t want to see you get hurt.\u201d He drags a hand through his hair again. Everything goes so quiet I can hear my heart pounding inside my chest. \u201cDrink your cocoa. It\u2019s cold and I don\u2019t want you to get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to take care of me, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to take ca\u2014\u201d He hesitates and breathes deeply.</p><p>I sip the cocoa, shaking my head at the racetrack. \u201cI\u2019m really pissed at you right now. First you got my hopes up about being a jockey and being able to do something different with my life. And then you got me excited about us. That maybe we could be something special, because I really feel something when I\u2019m with you. And I mean really feel...\u201d I grind my teeth together.</p><p>Jack is staring at his boots now. \u201cI told you I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you that I won\u2019t settle for being your secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will settle for that guy you were with the other night. Rory Whitfield\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not settling! It was a real date!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please. A real date with no chemistry. Of course you were settling.\u201d He steps closer, getting in my face space. \u201cBe with me. Please don\u2019t date him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019ll stoop to date me now that I could be interested in another guy? That sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care about you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen prove it.\u201d</p><p>I face the racetrack, not meeting his gaze again. After several seconds of stewing in silence, Jack finally leaves me standing there alone. I take my hot cocoa and find a dry place to sit.</p><p>During the race, Townsend rides the rail and never gets Star out in front of the pack. The horse whips his head from side to side at one point, and I think Townsend will lose control, but he hangs on somehow.</p><p>They come in fourth place.</p><p>If Circumstances Were Different</p><p>Jack is giving Star a weekend off from racing because the Dixiana Derby is next Saturday.</p><p>Out in Greenbriar, I\u2019m all alone as I give Star a bath. After I brush his teeth, he reaches out as if he\u2019s gonna bite my hand, but then he slowly nuzzles it. I look into his eyes and he nickers.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I reply. \u201cAre you glad you have a day off?\u201d</p><p>Star snuggles against my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you haven\u2019t been winning races,\u201d I whisper. \u201cYou\u2019ve become a big ole pansy. Racehorses are supposed to be aggressive.\u201d I pump my fist and try to show him I mean business, but he goes back to eating his grain. What a pig. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hang out with Star the rest of the day, cleaning up his manure and letting him graze in the pasture. Last Saturday night, I went to dinner with Alex at the Cracker Barrel, and we had a good time, but nothing much happened between us. When he drove me home, he gave me a quick peck on the lips. Later tonight we\u2019re going to a movie and I hope this\u2019ll be the night we kiss for real. I don\u2019t mind that we\u2019re taking it slow, but I\u2019m kind of aching for some passion.</p><p>Leaning over the fence, I watch Star chase a filly, teasing her, and then he gets ornery and squeals when a yearling colt tries to play with him. I laugh, and Star rewards me by nuzzling my face and hands.</p><p>Watching the horses run into the orangey-pink sunset, I totally lose track of time\u2014I need to take a shower soon to get ready for my date, and that\u2019s when I hear footsteps behind me. I look over my shoulder to find Jack dressed in his comfy clothes\u2014sweatpants and a long-sleeved tee.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late. We should put Star and the others back in their stalls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm I gonna get to ride Star in the Dixiana Derby next week?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Jack sniffles, watching Star roll around in the grass grunting. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what conditions are like that day.\u201d</p><p>What he means is he has to see what his father says. How ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you home?\u201d My eyes trail over his sweats. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>He folds his hands together on top of the fence and studies the horses. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody I want to go out with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot even Colton or Vanessa or Kelsey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel like it.\u201d He looks at me sideways, giving me a sad smile.</p><p>That\u2019s when Star jogs back over to me. He makes a deep snorting sound and pauses a few feet away. I cluck my tongue. The horse turns his focus from me to Jack then slowly walks forward, squeezing between us. Star nuzzles against Jack\u2019s cheek and nips at his hair.</p><p>Jack scratches the colt\u2019s face. \u201cAw, thanks, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Bright stars poke through the lovely pink-orange sunset as Jack and I stand together, petting the horse. I wish he could show the same courage that Star just did. Will Jack ever shove aside the things that scare him?</p><p>After we lead Star to his stall, passing farmhands along the way, Jack walks me back to Hillcrest.</p> <p>\u201cCan we talk later?\u201d he asks quietly. \u201cWe could meet out by the lake?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I won\u2019t. I won\u2019t get into another situation where we might hook up, no matter how much I want it.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he asks softly. \u201cJust as friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d I say in a tiny voice. \u201cDon\u2019t...I told you, I can\u2019t. I have plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about something...I need you, as a friend, you know?\u201d</p><p>How could this end well?</p><p>\u201cI got you something.\u201d He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a weathered, tiny box, and hands it to me. I don\u2019t want gifts. I want to race his horse, I want him to support me in front of his father, I want him to man up.</p><p>He nods at the white box. With shaky hands, I carefully open it to discover a silver chain with two charms: a horse and a horseshoe. The chain is kind of rusted, but it\u2019s delicate and pretty. No guy has ever given me jewelry before. I look up into his eyes, searching.</p> <p>\u201cIt belonged to my great-grandmother,\u201d Jack says quietly. \u201cShe had red hair and loved horses. Just like you.\u201d</p><p>My lips tremble as I stare at the bracelet. \u201cI can\u2019t take this.\u201d</p><p>Jack frees it from the box and loops it around my wrist, fastening it. \u201cBut it\u2019s perfect for you...and it matches the necklace your mom gave you. Please keep it.\u201d</p><p>Mom told me to study history so I could learn from it. Well, everything in my history says that Jack is a player, that he only wants me in secret, that he never actually dates girls, but now he goes and gives me something that belonged to his great-grandmother? It\u2019s like he\u2019s linking our histories together.</p><p>I could see a guy giving an expensive, new piece of jewelry to a girl he wants to entice into bed, but not a family heirloom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how important family is to me, right?\u201d he asks. I nod, wiping my nose. \u201cThen you understand what this bracelet means to me.\u201d</p><p>I brush a tear out of my eye, not knowing what to say.</p><p>He peeks up at me under his eyelashes. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too,\u201d I admit, touching the bracelet. \u201cBut I need more...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>On Sunday evening, Rory asks me to dinner at Tennessee Ballers.</p><p>As soon as we sit down at our table, he pushes his new scene under my nose. This screenplay is about CIA agents\u2014a guy and girl\u2014who are partners fighting for the same promotion, but they\u2019re also secretly in love with each other.</p><p>\u201cWill you read my query letter again too?\u201d Rory asks, shuffling through his papers. He\u2019s looking for an agent to sell his screenplays to Hollywood. \u201cI want to send it out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, after I finish reading this scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I take it you like it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s full of gratuitous sex,\u201d I say. \u201cI hate it but I can\u2019t look away.\u201d</p><p>Rory laughs softly and pushes the rice around on his plate. Strange. He usually inhales his food.</p><p>\u201cHow was the date with my cousin last night?\u201d Rory asks.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say, smiling. We ended up parking after the movie and we made out for a little while. He\u2019s a good kisser. \u201cI like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Rory says. \u201cI\u2019m not as close with him as my brother is, but Will said it\u2019s a good thing he\u2019s getting out. He had a bad breakup a couple months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really? He didn\u2019t mention it...\u201d I worry on my lip. Last night was great. He paid for the tickets and we shared popcorn and laughed at the same parts in the movie. But it\u2019s not like we\u2019re close yet. I haven\u2019t told Alex about any of my hopes and fears or how scared I am for my family now that a little sister is on the way.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if you never sell a screenplay?\u201d I ask Rory, thinking of my future as a horse jockey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep trying. I hope I will anyway.\u201d</p><p>He wraps straw paper around his finger, peeking up at me. It\u2019s easy to tell when something\u2019s nagging him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cUm, my father has to declare bankruptcy.\u201d</p><p>I cover my mouth with my hand. The farm\u2019s financial problems are that shitty?</p><p>Rory rips the straw paper in two. \u201cAnd we have to move. I guess Dad is gonna try to sell our animals. He hopes the Goodwins will buy our land.\u201d Rory swipes at his eyes and pinches his nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your dad gonna do?\u201d I ask with a wobbly voice.</p><p>\u201cMom can get a job as a teacher, we hope, and Dad is gonna try to get on down at the co-op. He knows people there. But it\u2019s like, most of the jobs don\u2019t pay well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Will went to college instead of staying home to take over the farm,\u201d I whisper, and Rory nods.</p><p>\u201cThis is all the more reason for me to go,\u201d Rory says. \u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t have a degree, so he doesn\u2019t have many job opportunities, not like my mom does. I mean, Mr. Goodwin would probably hire my dad but it would embarrass him bad...\u201d</p><p>I grasp his hand. \u201cI\u2019m here for you. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>He nods with a sad smile.</p><p>\u201cNow let me see that query letter.\u201d</p><p>Later that night, I\u2019m still thinking about what would happen if someone else in my family got sick and I had no money to help them to get better. Before Mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, we didn\u2019t have health insurance.</p><p>I\u2019ve been basing everything on working as an exercise rider or a jockey. I thought this was the ticket to finding a better life. But what if the opportunity to be one dries up? I fell off Star after he got spooked by those raccoons, even though I was being safe as can be. The Goodwins wouldn\u2019t let me race at Keeneland. I love riding horses, but even horsemen don\u2019t bet all their money on one race.</p><p>I find that out firsthand when I eavesdrop on Cindy telling Dad, Paula, and Yvonne what she overheard while serving dinner to the Goodwins.</p><p>\u201cMr. Goodwin told the family that Mr. Winchester didn\u2019t accept his initial bid on Paradise Park, and if he wants to stay in the running, he\u2019s gonna have to come up with another million dollars.\u201d</p><p>A million dollars!</p><p>\u201cWas it because of Master Jack not liking George Winchester\u2019s daughter?\u201d Yvonne asks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cindy replies. \u201cSomeone else bid more money apparently.\u201d</p><p>Then why did Mr. Winchester blabber on and on about honor and family? It all came down to money?</p><p>I wrap my arms around myself, hating that Jack gave up what we had to help his father. Hearing that the Paradise Park deal is all about cold, hard cash makes me feel cold and hard all over. Mr. Whitfield thought he didn\u2019t have to go to college because his farm had existed for over a hundred years. What if, in forty years, I\u2019m dirt poor and living in a shack because I put all my chips in horseracing?</p><p>Monday morning, Jack isn\u2019t in first period Life Lessons\u2014he must\u2019ve decided to skip, but I see him in the hallway after. He\u2019s standing with Kelsey Painter, talking quietly to her. She\u2019s rubbing his elbow and he seems upset. When he glances up and sees me, he turns and goes the other way. Kelsey gives me a questioning look, as if she\u2019s trying to figure me out. That\u2019s when she walks up.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d I ask, staring past her.</p><p>She clutches her books against her chest. \u201cYou really care about him, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d I still do, but I\u2019m not gonna admit that to her.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t sound bitchy or anything; she sounds sad. Is she in Rory\u2019s drama class or something? Because she\u2019s a good actress.</p><p>\u201cHe really likes you,\u201d Kelsey says.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...he\u2019s my friend...I can just tell. You should give him another chance.\u201d She looks down the hallway toward where Jack just disappeared. \u201cIf I could go back in time, I\u2019d fight harder to keep someone who was important to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>She suddenly turns and walks down the hall, meeting up with Colton and Vanessa before heading into English class. What was that all about? Am I supposed to feel sorry for the most popular girl at school? It\u2019s crazy that she feels insecure at her level.</p><p>I decide to skip second period and go to the guidance counselor\u2019s office. I swallow as I push open the door, walk up to the assistant, and ask to see Miss Brady about college options. I take a seat and doodle pictures of horses and horseshoes in my notebook as I wait.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, she invites me into her office. Along with the inspirational posters, she has loads of pictures of cats wearing clothes...?</p><p>I shudder, not sure what freaks me out more: CONFIDENCE or a kitten wearing a plaid beret and matching vest.</p><p>\u201cSavannah Barrow?\u201d she says, opening a file folder as she sits down behind her desk. I take the seat in front of her and grasp my knees. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you interested in college?\u201d she asks, chewing on a pen.</p><p>For a lot of reasons, I think. To have lots of paths to choose from. To have the ability to back out of something if it\u2019s not quite what I want. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood...and I want to take the one less traveled by.</p><p>But what I tell her is: \u201cIt\u2019s something I have to do.\u201d</p><p>She looks at my file, twisting a lock of her hair. \u201cYour grades aren\u2019t bad, but I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ll have much of an opportunity for scholarships...maybe we could look into some grants and federal aid. And you need to take the SAT or the ACT.\u201d</p> <p>Miss Brady passes me a pamphlet and I open it.</p><p>\u201cThese tests cost money,\u201d I say slowly.</p><p>\u201cEverything costs money.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat, thumbing through the pamphlet.</p><p>\u201cDepending on your family\u2019s income, we could apply for a fee waiver so you could take the ACT for free.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I reply quietly, and we go silent for several moments.</p><p>\u201cI encourage all kids to go to college, but if you wanted to take a year off or go to community college, you could do that too. Although one time, I read a statistic that said 80 percent of people who don\u2019t go to college right after high school never go. They never find the time.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at the Coca Cola T-shirt I bought at a yard sale. Think about my background. All of it is part of me that has led me to now, to this point. Miss Brady is right. If I don\u2019t go now, I\u2019ll never go.</p><p>I pull a deep breath. \u201cI want to try,\u201d I say, making the guidance counselor smile.</p><p>\u201cGreat! What do you want to study?\u201d</p><p>The creeptastic motivational posters intimidate me. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s totally okay.\u201d</p><p>She spends ten minutes loading me up with more pamphlets and handouts so I can learn about the different state and community colleges in Tennessee.</p><p>\u201cCome back and see me next week,\u201d Miss Brady says.</p><p>If I want anything in life, I need to take it one step at a time. And if I want to pay for these college application fees or tuition, then I need to do something for me. It might hurt what I can give my baby sister in the near term, but it could help us all in the future.</p><p>I walk out into the hallway where I find Jack sipping from the water fountain. He wipes the water from his lips and faces me. Looks down at the papers in my hand. A smile begins to stretch across his face. I return the smile and walk toward the gym.</p><p>Before PE, I meet up with Vanessa at her locker, and right then, Rory approaches us.</p><p>\u201cVanessa,\u201d he says breathlessly. \u201cI have an important question for you.\u201d</p><p>But before she can react, music rings out in the hallway and random kids start dancing to Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cTelephone.\u201d It\u2019s all choreographed. Wait. Are these kids from Rory\u2019s drama class? Is this a flash mob?</p> <p>Vanessa and I burst out giggling as the students keep dancing and then Rory joins in, holding up a sign asking Vanessa if she wants to go to Homecoming.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she says, and they start kissing, and the flash mob keeps grinding away around us. Colton whistles and Kelsey cheers, looking happy. Jack gazes over at me and grins, and I can\u2019t help but smile back.</p><p>\u201cWoooo!\u201d I yell, cupping my mouth, my voice ringing out through the corridor.</p><p>After school, Vanessa gives me a lift home from school, and we totally take over the Hillcrest common room to eat candy, read magazines, and gossip. Ethan\u2014Jodi\u2019s son\u2014has a friend over, and they keep peeking around the corner at us. Preteen pervs.</p><p>Vanessa bites into a Twizzler and turns the page in her magazine. \u201cI was thinking a dress like this one.\u201d She points at a short blue wispy thing.</p><p>\u201cI love that! For Homecoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She flips the page and points at a white dress. \u201cYou should get something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going with Alex? Did you invite him yet?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI might...there\u2019s a big race that day in New Orleans at Fair Grounds. Gael has been saying that Jack might enter Star...but I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ll get to ride him.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa pats my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t give up, okay? You know you can ride\u2014it was just muddy before that race and Jack wanted to keep you safe. He told me so himself.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly, feeling heat spread across my cheeks. I\u2019m kind of embarrassed how bratty I acted that day. I must\u2019ve been channeling Star.</p><p>\u201cIf you decide to go to Homecoming, you and Alex should ride with me and Rory,\u201d Vanessa says, and we dive into a discussion about the guys, talking about how far we\u2019ve gone with them. \u201cI only slept with Rory that one time after his brother\u2019s wedding. We want to take things slower, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you done anything with Alex yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve kissed...\u201d The big difference between our situations is that I can tell how much she loves Rory already, and I haven\u2019t felt that way about Alex yet. Maybe it just takes time?</p><p>Vanessa talks about how she and Rory were fooling around in his truck in the Whitfields\u2019 garage, and his father caught them and made Rory go clean the manure collector again. \u201cI think Rory thought it was worth it though.\u201d She laughs, and Ethan and his friend gasp from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, you little perverts!\u201d I yell, throwing a couch pillow at the boys. Vanessa and I collapse onto the floor in a fit of giggles.</p><p>\u201cYou silly girls.\u201d We peek up to find Cindy smiling down at us, one hand on her stomach. \u201cSavannah, do you want to come out to eat with me and your dad? He got a bonus for some races and wants to treat us.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Vanessa. \u201cWe\u2019re hanging out right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa can come too if she wants.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa nods, and I shrug okay. We\u2019ve never had the money to invite a friend of mine out to eat. I\u2019m really proud of my father\u2014for taking a risk and moving us to Cedar Hill and trying to do something good for his family.</p><p>The next thing I know, we\u2019re at the Roadhouse, one of the best restaurants in Franklin. Old street signs and highway markers cover the wooden walls and rock music blares. People love coming here because you get to eat peanuts and throw shells on the floor. And don\u2019t even get me started on how good those breadbaskets smell.</p><p>We\u2019re seated at a table, and a girl from school is our server. I\u2019ve never talked to Annie Winters before, but she seems nice and smiles as she takes our drink order. Vanessa leans over and whispers that she and Kelsey used to hang out with Annie freshman year, but after Annie started dating this guy, they grew apart and Kelsey is still upset about it. Still, Vanessa is friendly enough with her. Annie brings us a free appetizer of cheese fries and an extra breadbasket.</p><p>\u201cShortcake, if you don\u2019t stop eating that bread, you\u2019re gonna gain too much weight to be a jockey,\u201d Dad says with a grin, and I smile through a mouthful, glad he still thinks I\u2019ve got what it takes to race.</p><p>Vanessa keeps asking Cindy a bazillion questions about the baby. \u201cLike, do you know what the baby is thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know when she\u2019s mad\u2014she kicks up a storm. She\u2019s doing it right now.\u201d</p><p>I reach over and touch her stomach. The baby\u2019s feet feel like drumbeats. \u201cPorsche is gonna be a drummer.\u201d</p><p>Cindy gives me a wry smile. \u201cWe are not naming the baby after a car.\u201d</p><p>When Rory drops me off at Cedar Hill after school the next day, I find a Facebook message from Alex asking me to call him. Sometimes it really sucks not having a cell.</p><p>I use the house cordless to call him and he picks up on the second ring. \u201cHey, you,\u201d I say, unable to keep the smile off my face.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I can hear his grin through the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I lie down on the couch and point my toes toward the ceiling, excited that I\u2019m talking to a cute boy on the phone. The gardener, Mr. Wallace, looks up from his newspaper and shakes his head at me.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you about something...We\u2019ve been having fun the past few weeks, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I hear him take a deep breath. I slowly lower my legs to the couch.</p><p>\u201cMy ex and I...well, we dated since high school up until a couple of months ago, and I wanted to let you know that we still talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I say, suddenly out of breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying she and I are serious again or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m so confused. It\u2019s not like Alex and I are exclusive, but we did make out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to you if I\u2019m starting to talk to my ex again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not...\u201d I say with a wobbly voice. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always love her...but just because you love somebody doesn\u2019t mean you should be with them. It\u2019s harder than that.\u201d</p><p>It sure is.</p><p>\u201cI want to keep spending time with you,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that we can keep seeing each other, but you might work things out with your ex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, kinda,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cGod, that makes me sound like a complete asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, kinda.\u201d Believe it or not, hearing that he loves someone brings a small smile to my face. I don\u2019t want to lose him, because I\u2019ve enjoyed kissing him and hanging out, but I want to be with a guy who\u2019s 100 percent there. I want a guy who\u2019s all mine. And considering how often I think of Jack, I never would have been 100 percent there for Alex. And that\u2019s just not right.</p><p>\u201cIt might be good if you focus on her, all right?\u201d</p><p>Our conversation doesn\u2019t last much longer\u2014it\u2019s just Alex apologizing over and over, and I tell him it\u2019s okay, even though I don\u2019t really feel okay.</p><p>We hang up and I set the cordless back in the docking station. Well. That sucks. I stick my thumbs in my eyes to keep the tears at bay. I want someone I can laugh, cuddle, and talk with anytime I want, someone who truly wants me. Loves me.</p><p>At least I\u2019ve got other things to do this afternoon. After blowing my nose, I go to my room, put on my nicest outfit\u2014black pants and a white shirt that belonged to Mom\u2014and charge up to the manor house. I know I\u2019m not allowed inside unless I\u2019m working, but I\u2019m not gonna sit around waiting for Mr. Goodwin to cross my path.</p><p>I sneak in the back kitchen door and head through the dining room to the main staircase that leads up to the suite of offices. I spot Paula spraying Windex on a mirror. I sneak down a different hallway and go up another set of stairs.</p><p>When I reach Mr. Goodwin\u2019s assistant\u2019s desk, she sets down her letter opener and the envelope she\u2019s holding. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to make an appointment,\u201d I say, holding my chin high.</p><p>Jack appears in the doorway of his office. \u201cAre you here to see me?\u201d he asks, looking hopeful.</p><p>I summon my strongest voice. \u201cNo. I need to discuss something with your father.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan I help you with it instead?\u201d Jack asks, sticking his thumbs in his belt loops. \u201cDad\u2019s a busy guy.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cOnly your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanet, tell my father Savannah needs to see him.\u201d</p><p>The assistant presses the intercom button and speaks into it. Then Jack goes and opens the double doors to Mr. Goodwin\u2019s office, jerking his head, indicating I should walk on in.</p> <p>I bite the inside of my cheek as I pass by Jack. The door clicks shut behind me and I find myself in a room lit with floor-to-ceiling windows and softened with sheer, wispy curtains. The sofas and chairs are covered with a creamy fabric and fancy rugs cover the hardwood floor. Unlike Jack\u2019s office, there are no TVs or computers. Am I in an Elven palace from The Lord of the Rings or something?</p><p>Mr. Goodwin glances up with a brief smile. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t invite me to sit, so I stand in front of his desk where he\u2019s sorting through yellow message slips and writing in a leather-bound journal.</p><p>\u201cSir, I know I asked you to keep the money I make exercising your horses and racing in case Cindy and my dad need it, but I\u2019d like to change that arrangement.\u201d</p><p>That gets his attention. He sets his pen down, crosses his hands, and looks up at me. \u201cOh? How do you wish to change it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to keep the money I make from now on for myself.\u201d</p><p>A tiny smile flits across his face. \u201cWhat are your plans for the money? If you don\u2019t mind me asking.\u201d</p><p>I look out the window, at the rows of huge barns and the racetrack and all the workers, amazed that one person owns all this. Mr. Goodwin didn\u2019t build it, but his family did.</p><p>And now I want to start building something for me. For my family. For the future.</p><p>\u201cI want to use it for college applications,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd to take the ACT.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin nods and smiles. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll make sure you start getting regular paychecks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, sir. Hope you have a nice day.\u201d I turn to leave but Mr. Goodwin calls my name. I swivel around to face him.</p><p>\u201cSavannah, I didn\u2019t take any of the money you\u2019ve made so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cI saved it all.\u201d He pushes an intercom button and asks his assistant to send Mr. Blakely in. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard for that money and you need to spend it on you. A man should settle his own debts.\u201d</p><p>A minute later, a tall man dressed in a suit appears in the office.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mr. Blakely, one of my stall managers,\u201d he says. \u201cMichael, how much money has Savannah made so far? Including the race where she placed third?\u201d</p><p>The man opens a black portfolio and shuffles through the papers, dragging his finger down a ledger. \u201cAbout $1,750.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the couch, unable to stand. I cover my face. I\u2019ve never seen that much money in my whole life.</p> <p>\u201cBefore you send out your college applications,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says, \u201cmake sure you have my assistant and Jack look over them, understand?\u201d</p><p>I taste salty tears at the back of my throat. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlakely,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says. \u201cGive us a minute.\u201d After the man leaves, Mr. Goodwin raps his pen on his desk. \u201cSavannah, your father came to see me the other day. He wasn\u2019t aware you\u2019d asked to help with Cindy\u2019s paychecks.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cYour father wanted to make sure I hadn\u2019t done what you asked...and he asked me for help with college advice.\u201d</p><p>My head pops up. \u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ordered him some books and catalogs on student loans and scholarships to look at. We were going to meet about it next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d I exclaim. Dad didn\u2019t tell me anything. Maybe he didn\u2019t want me to get my hopes up? \u201cBut why?\u201d Mr. Cates\u2019s uncaring expression flashes in my mind. \u201cWhy do you care if I go to college? Wouldn\u2019t it be better for you if I just stay here and exercise horses and wax the floors or whatever?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin smiles and slips his pen behind his ear. \u201cWhen I was about your age, my father taught me something. He said that my staff is everything.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do any of the important work like training a yearling. Keeping a mare calm as she delivers a foal. Making sure the horses are clean. I don\u2019t even feed my own kids. Jodi cooks them healthy meals. My staff takes care of me and my family.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always tried to take good care of my staff. I\u2019m going to make sure Cindy has some time off before and after the baby comes. I won\u2019t let anything happen to your family, understand? You all have been good to us. My staff is too important.\u201d</p><p>I wipe the corner of my eye, smiling as I nod.</p><p>The intercom buzzes. \u201cMr. Goodwin, your four p.m. appointment is here,\u201d the assistant says.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d I say. He gives me a friendly nod and goes back to studying his notebook.</p><p>I open the heavy wooden doors to let myself out. \u201cOh, and, sir?\u201d I say loud enough for both Jack and his father to hear me. \u201cI want to race Star in the Dixiana Derby at Paradise Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I reply in a low voice, stepping out of his office and shutting the doors behind me. I\u2019m proud of myself for trying at least.</p><p>Jack gives me a quizzical look when I march past him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just getting something I want,\u201d I say with a smile, and race down the stairs, feeling Jack\u2019s eyes on my back.</p><p>I head for the stables\u2014I want to take Star out for a while. And hopefully Dad is in Greenbriar and can help me saddle him up.</p><p>Show Time</p><p>The Winchesters\u2019 racetrack, Paradise Park, is located between Lexington and Louisville on the greenest patch of land you\u2019ve ever seen. Any time now, I\u2019m expecting the Lucky Charms leprechaun to pop up and tell me I\u2019m in Ireland or something. It\u2019s times like this when I don\u2019t believe karma is real; it\u2019s unfair that douches like the Winchesters get to own such beautiful land.</p><p>As Dad pulls the truck into the parking lot beside the barns, I feel a slight pang of guilt for Mr. Goodwin because he\u2019ll never own this beautiful place if he doesn\u2019t pony up at least another million bucks. At the same time, I\u2019m pissed because Jack hasn\u2019t said a thing about me riding Star in today\u2019s race, even though I brought my silks to wear. Is he waiting to make sure we have good weather before getting my hopes up?</p><p>Dad works with Minerva, Echoes of Summer, and Lucky Strikes while Rory and I are having a hell of a time with Star. He won\u2019t stop rolling on the floor, scattering his hay bed, and snorting. He hops to his feet and jogs around his stall, making grunting noises. He is one unhappy horse.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here,\u201d I finally tell Rory, and my friend eagerly leaves the stall, latching it behind him. Mr. Goodwin and Jack need to hire more girls, I swear.</p><p>I take a deep breath through my nose and step forward, getting in Star\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cStop it, boy,\u201d I say in a strong voice. \u201cYou\u2019re such a big baby. You just want attention, right?\u201d The horse stops snorting and moving around like he\u2019s on drugs. His ears twitch and he stomps the ground with his front right hoof.</p><p>I stroke his face, inhaling his muskiness. \u201cRor?\u201d I call out. \u201cWould you bring Echoes of Summer in here?\u201d</p><p>A minute later, Echoes of Summer has joined me and Star, and the mare calms him down even more. I stay with the horses, feeding them grain and brushing their hair, singing to Star to keep him calm.</p><p>Before the race, Jack and his father appear, along with Gael. Jack is wearing an elegant suit and tie, and his hair is slicked with gel.</p><p>\u201cGet him ready to go, Whitfield,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says. Did he forget Star hates boys or something? The minute Rory comes in the stall, Star gets agitated again. He slaps his head from side to side.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d I say to Rory, putting up a hand. \u201cI\u2019ll get him ready. He\u2019s comfortable with me,\u201d I say to Mr. Goodwin. I want to do right by the horse. \u201cI\u2019ll walk him to the paddock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Jack says, standing up straight. He\u2019s nearly taller than his father. \u201cI want Savannah to ride him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s best if you race Townsend,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says. \u201cHe\u2019s got more experience on this track and the purse is half a mil. You need to make the money back for the stud fee and I don\u2019t want to see your reputation go to hell. I don\u2019t think you can afford to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I can\u2019t,\u201d Jack says. \u201cThat\u2019s why Savannah\u2019s gonna race Star. I\u2019ll go tell the officials myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Gael says.</p><p>Mr. Goodwin grabs Jack by the shoulder and stares him down. \u201cSon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want your support on this, Dad,\u201d Jack interrupts. \u201cI\u2019ve supported you in everything. I used Townsend as a jockey in the last race. I came on to Abby Winchester when I didn\u2019t have any feelings for her. And because of you, I lost something important to me.\u201d He finds my eyes.</p><p>Mr. Goodwin slaps his notebook against his palm and glances around the park, looking partially pissed but mostly wistful. He blows out air, sighing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the owner of Cedar Hill and it\u2019s my decision,\u201d Jack says, and a chill shoots through me. \u201cGo big or go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better go get dressed,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says to me. \u201cNobody\u2019s riding a Cedar Hill horse unless they\u2019re wearing the family silks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d I say, grinning.</p><p>I haul ass to the truck to change clothes, to get ready for the biggest race of my life. I reach into the cab for my backpack that contains the silks I\u2019ll wear during the race. Glancing around at the other trailers, I make sure I\u2019m alone and shielded by the truck door before pulling my T-shirt off over my head. I\u2019m about to slip my Slytherin Cedar Hill shirt over my bra when a voice behind me says, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I cover my breasts and duck behind the door.</p><p>Marcus Winchester slowly walks up, and even though he can clearly see I\u2019m changing, he doesn\u2019t vamoose. He stares at me like he did that night in the Goodwins\u2019 dining room. What. A. Perv.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I say, trying to cover my breasts with the shirt. \u201cI\u2019m changing.\u201d</p><p>He reeks of alcohol and it\u2019s not even noon. \u201cYou work for the Goodwins, right?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a shame if my dad raised the cost of our track even more? You know, because of you? Because you haven\u2019t been respectful of me?\u201d</p><p>I pause for several heartbeats. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Servants want to sleep with me.\u201d</p><p>Does he have a sick desire to dominate people or something?</p><p>\u201cGet lost,\u201d I say when he grabs my arm. My teeth are chattering as I scramble toward the next trailer. He latches on like a leech and I\u2019m dragging him behind me.</p><p>\u201cI tried to give you something special. You should be grateful,\u201d Marcus blurts. I shove him in the gut and rush toward the barns. Seconds later, Marcus overtakes me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure the Goodwins can never buy our track and it\u2019ll be your fault,\u201d Marcus says, grabbing me from behind. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you lose your job and can\u2019t get hired anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin still wants to buy this place, but I believed him when he said he\u2019ll take care of my family. Of me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything I don\u2019t want to do, you crazy asshole,\u201d I say, stomping on his foot. Marcus groans and hops up and down.</p><p>Right then, Jack comes barreling up. He slams his right fist into Marcus\u2019s jaw, smashing him to the ground. Marcus trips Jack, and Jack takes a punch to the chin. Then Jack leaps onto Marcus and smashes his knuckles into his nose three times. Jack pins him to the dirt.</p> <p>\u201cJack, I already got him!\u201d I say, like we\u2019re hunting and Jack stole my kill.</p><p>Marcus wipes blood off his nose. \u201cFuck you, Goodwin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, Savannah,\u201d Jack says, holding him down. \u201cDo your worst.\u201d</p><p>I kind of want to kick him where it counts, but I don\u2019t care enough to waste any more time on this dickwad. I thrust out a hand and pull Jack up from the ground then hug him. He rubs his hands up and down my back.</p><p>Yeah, I stomped on Marcus\u2019s foot and gave him a piece of my mind, but I can\u2019t stop shuddering and gasping for breath.</p> <p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Jack whispers, gently rubbing the back of my neck. He takes the green shirt from my hand and helps me slip it over my head. I touch the bruise forming on his chin.</p><p>Marcus fumbles his way to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell my father.\u201d</p><p>Just because he\u2019s rich and powerful doesn\u2019t mean he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling the police to report you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d believe your story over mine?\u201d Marcus snorts.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Jack says calmly.</p> <p>\u201cI hope you enjoy telling your family you lost Paradise Park for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho gives a shit?\u201d Jack says. \u201cYou tried to assault my jockey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Marcus replies.</p><p>\u201cSo Savannah\u2019s gonna call the cops, and I\u2019ll make sure your mom and sister don\u2019t get invited to the Governor\u2019s Christmas Ball this year. You don\u2019t want to disappoint your mother, do you?\u201d</p><p>Marcus\u2019s eyes balloon and he actually looks freaked out. I stare up at Jack through misty eyes and wrap my arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cHell, if you ever come near my girlfriend again, I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Jack adds, making my shoulders tense up. Wait. Did he say girlfriend?</p><p>\u201cNow get the hell out of here,\u201d Jack says, and as Marcus scrambles away, Jack turns to me and lifts my wrist to touch the bracelet he gave me.</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend?\u201d I whisper. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty presumptuous of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you still dating Alex? Whitfield\u2019s cousin?\u201d I slowly shake my head and he gently kisses my wrist. \u201cDid Marcus hurt you?\u201d</p><p>I know my place, but I stood up for myself anyway and didn\u2019t think about anything except for what\u2019s right. And even though we come from completely different stock, Jack did the right thing too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine...actually, I\u2019m great.\u201d</p><p>Jack holds my hand the entire way back to the barn, and when we see our dads, I expect him to drop it. But he keeps holding on tight.</p><p>\u201cIs this for real?\u201d I mumble. \u201cWhat you said about me being your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he whispers, holding our hands up where anyone can see them. \u201cI\u2019ve never cared about anyone else like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re exclusive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cBut what about Paradise Park? Mr. Winchester\u2019ll never sell it to your father now.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his thumb across the back of my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Dad there are other racetracks. And besides, Paradise Park has crappy plumbing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrappy plumbing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>I grin and he grins back. As we walk up, Mr. Goodwin looks from his son to our hands and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cSavannah and I are going out now,\u201d Jack announces to our fathers and Rory.</p><p>Rory drops the brush he is holding and his mouth falls open. He digs in his pocket, yanks out his cell, and starts texting. Such a gossip that boy is.</p><p>Dad rubs his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d Mr. Goodwin asks Jack.</p><p>\u201cMarcus Winchester looks a lot worse, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin looks freaked out for a second, but then he grins. \u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what happened in private,\u201d Jack says to his father, pulling me up next to him. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get Star and Savannah ready for the race.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin says, \u201cYour mother will be angry with me for allowing you to date one of our staff. It won\u2019t look right, and there could be issues if you don\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sneak hot dogs behind Mom\u2019s back all the time! I\u2019m responsible for the farm, and I can make my own decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man stands by his decisions,\u201d Mr. Goodwin says.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, he does,\u201d Jack replies.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk more about this later, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Jack replies in a strong voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree with this any more than Jack\u2019s father does,\u201d Dad says to me slowly. \u201cBut I want you to be happy, whatever that means for you. I know how much you care about your family and want to do the right thing by us. And I want to do the right thing by you.\u201d Dad wraps me in his arms, hugging me hard.</p><p>Jack faces our fathers. \u201cAfter the race, can Savannah stay the night at our house in Kentucky with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d I say, and I catch Mr. Goodwin and Dad exchanging a freaked-out look.</p><p>\u201cI want to cook you dinner,\u201d Jack says to me, ignoring our gaping fathers. Dad wipes sweat off his forehead. \u201cShe thinks I can\u2019t grill, but I can.\u201d He squeezes my hand. \u201cWait...I\u2019ll be back in a few. I\u2019ve gotta do something. Whitfield\u2014come help me.\u201d</p><p>He sprints out of the barn with Rory at his ankles. Jesus Lord, where\u2019s he going now?</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Mr. Goodwin calls, following his son.</p><p>The other men clear out of the barn, leaving me to collect Star\u2019s tack and get him in the zone for the race. I pat his nose and look him in the eye. We have a staring contest that goes on for at least a minute, but then a mare passing by our stall distracts him.</p><p>\u201cI win!\u201d I hug his neck. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He nips at my hair, saying he loves me too.</p><p>Jack meets up with me at the paddock after Shelby helped me get Star saddled up and ready to go.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing?\u201d Jack whispers in my ear.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t want to jinx myself by saying that I\u2019ve never been on such a high, that I have a feeling Star and I are in good shape for today. \u201cThank you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jack replies, smiling at me before turning his focus back to his horse. He walks around Star one last time, inspecting him, before wishing me luck and pecking my cheek.</p><p>Dad mounts a pony and leads us out onto the track. He leans over and pats Star\u2019s head as we begin to warm up. Star barely pays attention to the pony. He must know this race is important.</p><p>When we get to the starting gate, I take a deep breath and Dad pats my back. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, and your mom would be too.\u201d</p><p>I smile as Star enters the gate and the gates close behind me. I\u2019m in the fourth position, the best place to be. For the first time ever, the horse doesn\u2019t go crazy when we\u2019re inside the gate.</p><p>\u201cYou got this, Star,\u201d I say, breathing calmly.</p><p>The bell rings loud and clear. The gates bang open.</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re off!\u201d the announcer says, and everything goes silent except for the sound of hooves slamming the ground.</p><p>Star breaks well. I settle behind Dancing Delight and That\u2019s My Boy. Everybody eases up around the first turn. I grab a good position on the rail. Dancing Delight leads the way to the backstretch. I\u2019m two off the lead when the pack moves together on the far turn.</p><p>I own the rail and we pick up speed as we make our way past That\u2019s My Boy.</p><p>I yell, \u201cMove your ass, Star!\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s My Boy challenges us, making me settle back into third. At the home stretch, I\u2019m two lengths off the lead. On the final furlong, I use the whip and yell Star\u2019s name. I make up the distance. Overtake Dancing Delight on the final furlong. But he grabs it back.</p><p>My heart pounds and I\u2019m biting down hard on my lip as we cross the finish line.</p><p>We lose by a length!</p><p>Second place. Damn.</p><p>As Star begins to relax, I pull my goggles off and set them on top of my helmet with a sigh. Is he ever gonna win one? I lean down and hug Star long and hard. We circle back around, and the only person I want to see must be swallowed up in that sea of reporters, because I can\u2019t find him anywhere.</p><p>I ride up to the paddock. Reporters are all over me. Cameras are flashing. People are hollering. Second place with a half a mil purse is nothing to cry home about. Star just won $125K for Cedar Hill.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d I peer through the crowd to find him wedging his way between people. He breaks free and darts up to slap Star\u2019s side and rub his ears.</p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Jack says, rubbing the horse\u2019s muzzle and smiling up at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say with a sob.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll win next time. I know it.\u201d He holds my gaze, grinning, and I squeeze his hand. \u201cCome down here,\u201d Jack says, and I let him pull me off the horse. Gael grabs the reins. And when a photographer gets in my face to snap a picture, Jack pulls me into a long kiss, wrapping his arms around me, cocooning me like he\u2019ll never let go. And I kinda hope he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI swear,\u201d I hear Mr. Goodwin say. \u201cDo you have to kiss her in front of everybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jack replies, then dives right back in, kissing me again.</p><p>\u201cI thought Jack had a girlfriend\u2014that Winchester girl,\u201d Mrs. Goodwin says, sounding confused and pissed. \u201cJohn, why is our son kissing Danny\u2019s daughter? John, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d Shelby sighs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d Dad says.</p><p>\u201cThis would be a great climactic scene,\u201d Rory adds, and out of the corner of my eye, I catch him jotting down notes.</p><p>Star sniffs my hair and nuzzles his neck between our heads. Jack and I break apart.</p><p>\u201cIs my horse trying to cock block me?\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p><p>\u201cAppears so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t done so well, I\u2019d send him to New York to drag a tourist carriage. For real this time.\u201d</p><p>Jack and I smile, continuing to kiss, and even though we\u2019re not in the winner\u2019s circle, I feel like I won.</p><p>Laughter and hooting and hollering distract me, and when I pull away from his lips, he turns me to face the scoreboard. It reads:</p><p>Sav\u2014Will you go to homecoming with me?\u2014Jack</p><p>I laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s so much better than a skywriter!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After the press has melted away and while Jack is attempting to smooth things over with his mother, who is super agitated that her son was making out in front of a crowd, Mr. Goodwin walks up to me and Dad with a gentleman I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cDanny and Savannah, meet Thomas Alexander. He runs the Kentucky Thoroughbred Village in Lexington.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Alexander shakes Dad\u2019s hand first and then mine. \u201cYou\u2019re quite talented, Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>He hands me his card. \u201cWe have a jockey-training program at the Village you might be interested in. We offer college credit that\u2019s accepted at the University of Kentucky. You\u2019d have to spend several hours a week exercising the horses, and you\u2019d work as a sort of apprentice instructor, teaching younger kids how to be a jockey. If you\u2019re interested, I can have my assistant get in touch with you to discuss the details.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin smiles down at me. I peek up at Dad, who\u2019s picking at the inside of his eye with his thumb, trying to act manly by pretending he\u2019s not tearing up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very interested, thank you.\u201d I bounce on my toes.</p><p>I give Mr. Alexander my phone number and email address, and after he\u2019s gone, Mr. Goodwin pats my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThank you for doing that for me,\u201d I tell Mr. Goodwin, cradling the man\u2019s card in my hands.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. Jack asked me to make the introduction. It was all his idea.\u201d</p><p>I lounge in a cushy chair on the patio, watching Jack work the grill. Wearing an apron, he whistles as he flips the burgers. The smell of cooking meat wafts over along with the sound of the radio. He likes listening to college football games. I never knew that about him until tonight. What else don\u2019t I know?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling at?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWondering if you have any secrets.\u201d</p><p>The edge of his mouth lifts into a smirk. \u201cI won\u2019t keep any secrets from you...except...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept what?\u201d</p> <p>His grin is full of mischief as he abandons the grill to come give me a kiss. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what I want to do to you later in private. It\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>Stomach butterflies flutter up into my chest and heart, leaving me breathless. Smiling, he returns to his position at the grill, and I pull my knees to my chest, incredibly content. It\u2019s a chilly autumn night, and I\u2019m cozy in one of Jack\u2019s extra large sweatshirts. He gave me a guest bedroom with a queen-size bed, with a fluffy white duvet and pillows made of lace. When I sleep there tonight, I\u2019ll feel like a princess...who\u2019s also a horse jockey. Bad. Ass.</p><p>\u201cI told you I could grill,\u201d he murmurs, smiling as he serves me a cheeseburger.</p><p>After dinner, and after a crazy make-out session in the hot tub where he let me in on the secret things he wanted to do to me, we curl up in the hammock together. His parents won\u2019t be home from some fancy dinner for a while, and his sister and the housekeeper are inside, so it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re in our own little world. Except for Jack\u2019s hounds resting on the ground below us. Thor is a big snorer.</p><p>\u201cThis is my favorite place,\u201d Jack says, wrapping his hands behind his head, staring at the stars.</p><p>\u201cIt could easily become mine too.\u201d I love the soft sounds of the crisp night. Crickets. A stream babbling in the distance. My boyfriend\u2019s steady breathing.</p><p>\u201cThank you for supporting me today,\u201d I say, curling up against his chest.</p><p>He kisses the top of my head. \u201cThank you for believing in me.\u201d</p> <p>Future Plans</p><p>The little bell on the door jingles as we walk into Tennessee Ballers.</p><p>Jack and Rory head straight for the counter but Vanessa grabs my elbow. She loops her arm through mine.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Jack took me on a day date to Fall Creek Falls today, where we went horseback riding around the waterfalls and did some hiking that involved lunch in a deserted meadow. And lunch led to dessert which led to more. Red and gold leaves fell around us as we stretched out on the picnic blanket, taking our time.</p><p>\u201cWe did it,\u201d I whisper back, and Vanessa squeals.</p><p>\u201cDetails!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was great...well, until Jasper\u2014Jack\u2019s dog\u2014stole my shirt,\u201d I say, laughing. \u201cBut I do have some questions...\u201d</p><p>She pats my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s talk more later.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t regret giving myself to him, not one bit, but there\u2019s stuff I need to know, and I\u2019d rather sing a solo in the school musical than ask Rory stuff about sex. Like, what in the world are you supposed to do with your hands? And am I supposed to help him put the condom on?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d Jack asks me.</p><p>\u201cCheese quesadillas and tortilla chips.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cStake out a seat for us.\u201d</p><p>I weave around the tables, saying hi to kids from school, then grab the corner booth. While Jack collects our food and brings it to the table, Rory pushes Vanessa up against the counter and kisses her so passionately I have to look away.</p><p>\u201cWhitfield! I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a health-code violation. Stop!\u201d</p><p>My head pops up to find a humongous guy pointing at Rory, who keeps on kissing Vanessa like he can\u2019t hear a thing.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d I ask Jack.</p><p>\u201cJoe Carter. He used to play football for Hundred Oaks and now he owns Tennessee Ballers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick you out of here, I swear, Whitfield, and you\u2019ll never eat my tacos again,\u201d Joe Carter says. \u201cNo tacos for you!\u201d</p><p>Rory grins as he kisses Vanessa.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Joe says, clearly exasperated. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop right now, I\u2019m calling Vanessa\u2019s brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Rory roars, ripping away from Vanessa. He picks up their tray and yells over his shoulder, \u201cYou\u2019re evil, Carter.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa and Rory slide into the booth with us. \u201cIf he calls your brother, I\u2019m dead,\u201d Rory says.</p><p>\u201cIf my brother kills you, can I have your Star Wars sheets?\u201d Vanessa asks, smiling at him sideways as she bites into a chip.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want your truck,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad my friends care about my welfare,\u201d Rory says.</p><p>\u201cCan I have your dog, Ava?\u201d Jack asks, wiping his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI hate you all,\u201d Rory replies.</p><p>Across the room, now Joe Carter is raising his voice to Sam Henry, the hot usher from the wedding, and his blond girlfriend. \u201cGet out if you don\u2019t like it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Sam Henry says, looking disgusted. \u201cI\u2019ve had better tacos at Taco Bell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you did not,\u201d Joe Carter replies.</p><p>\u201cDid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d Joe roars, pointing at the door, but Sam Henry just waves a hand at him and goes right back to shoveling chips into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cJordan, you really gotta try these,\u201d Sam says to the blond girl, talking through a mouthful of chips.</p><p>Joe steals the chip basket away from Sam and speeds into the kitchen as if he\u2019s carrying a football. Sam leaps to his feet and chases after Joe, and then I hear raucous yelling and the sound of silverware and pans crashing to the floor.</p><p>\u201cMorons.\u201d Jordan shakes her head and starts playing with the salt and pepper shakers. She stacks the pepper on the top of the salt and yanks the salt out from under the pepper.</p><p>I smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Jack murmurs in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI hope that we\u2019re all still friends when we grow up.\u201d</p><p>He softly kisses the skin under my earlobe. \u201cMy mom told me that Jordan Woods got a job at the school. She\u2019s gonna help coach football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask. \u201cA girl coaching football?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Vanessa says. \u201cShe told my brother that she\u2019s starting in the spring.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Colton comes jogging up to our table. He squeezes in beside Rory and Vanessa. Kelsey pours in behind him and pulls a chair up to the table. She starts texting on her phone but Colton steals it from her, pocketing it. She gives him a look before digging into the tortilla chips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Vanessa says, throwing a chip at Colton.</p><p>He picks it off his shirt and eats it, shrugging. \u201cI was watching this new show called I\u2019ll Eat Anything. It\u2019s disgusting! But I couldn\u2019t look away. People win money based on how much weird shit they eat. Like, today, this one lady had to eat a coconut shell full of frog fallopian tubes!\u201d</p><p>Vanessa chokes on her food and gives Colton the look of death, but he doesn\u2019t notice because he\u2019s eyeing Kelsey.</p><p>\u201cAnnnnywayyyy,\u201d Rory says, talking with his mouth full. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking. Do y\u2019all want to go to that Halloween Haunted Forest thing up in Cookeville next weekend after the homecoming dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d Jack says, squeezing my hand under the table. \u201cAs long as we take some fireworks with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd set them off in the Haunted Forest?\u201d Rory asks.</p><p>Vanessa says, \u201cThat should definitely get us kicked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly,\u201d Jack says with a laugh. He faces Rory. \u201cYou\u2019ll bring the fireworks?\u201d</p><p>Rory grins. \u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>June, eight months later</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>At dusk, I\u2019m standing in Greenbriar pasture, lecturing the young filly that\u2019s causing me all sorts of trouble. Cherry Lollipop, who Jack named after me, is a descendent of Secretariat. Lollipop should be faster than a bullet, but she\u2019s too easily distracted. She loves chasing birds and butterflies and other fillies. One second she\u2019ll be cantering along and the next she\u2019s streaking off the track and into the gardens to chase a bunny rabbit. She\u2019s also been known to terrorize a colt or two.</p><p>\u201cYou have to do better, young lady, understand?\u201d I smooth the chestnut hair on the filly\u2019s face. Jack plans to enter her in races starting next year, and I think she\u2019ll be a winner. If I can get her trained up good, that is.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>I whip around to find Jack leaning against the white fence, wearing a tuxedo. His hair is slicked back with gel and he\u2019s grinning. His smile speeds away with my heart.</p><p>\u201cJust checking on Lollipop,\u201d I say.</p><p>He opens the gate and walks over to us, scanning my dress appreciatively. I found this beautiful black gown at a thrift store in Nashville. It hugs me just right.</p><p>\u201cMy mother asked where you are,\u201d Jack says, wrapping his hands around my waist. Our parents have sort of gotten used to the idea of us dating\u2014they know our relationship isn\u2019t a passing thing.</p><p>\u201cMom wants to introduce you to the governor\u2019s daughters,\u201d Jack goes on. \u201cThey want to meet the famous girl horse jockey, Savannah Barrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hush.\u201d I gaze at the white tent set up on the Goodwins\u2019 lawn. Classical music rings across the countryside. Today is the 215th anniversary of Tennessee becoming a state, so the Goodwins are having a party. \u201cDo we have to? I mean, we\u2019re finally alone.\u201d</p><p>My little sister Nina wails every time I leave her. She\u2019s addicted to me like I\u2019m addicted to candy. And even worse, even though she\u2019s three months old, she likes grabbing at Jack\u2019s cell phone. She cries every time he pockets it. I love her, but I love alone time with my boyfriend too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>His mouth lifts into a smirk. \u201cYou know the deal.

One time at the grocery store, he twirled me into a waltz in the produce section. We glided past the lemons, people rolled their eyes at us, and he murmured in my ear, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you dance. It\u2019s only who you\u2019re with.\u201d</p> <p>Laughing, we spin around in circles beneath the stars, barely avoiding a patch of manure.</p><p>Jack sweeps me into an elegant dip. \u201cYou like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cJust okay?\u201d</p><p>I whisper how much I love him.</p> <p>He weaves his hands in my curls, capturing my lips with his. \u201cI love you too.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
