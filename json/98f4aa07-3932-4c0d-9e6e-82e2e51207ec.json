Its back arched. Hackles stood on end. Sharp teeth gnashed at the air as it snarled a threat. My body froze despite my rapidly beating heart.</p><p>The beast took a slow, calculated circle around me, snapping and growling in my direction. I mimicked its movements, my feet moving with the wolf\u2019s, as my eyes shot in different directions looking for anything that could be used as a weapon. The landscape of the Big Horn Mountains did not offer much other than a few downed branches or palm sized rocks\u2014useless against the creature this size.</p><p>I bent down bit by bit and stretched my hand towards a limb, never taking my eyes off the wolf. Any protection was better than nothing. I gripped the branch tightly, its bark feeling slippery in my sweaty palm. A deep rumble sounded from the wolf again. My body trembled as I imagined those teeth sinking into my flesh. Its angry, vicious face was about four feet away, one leap and I was a goner.</p> <p>My knuckles turned white and ached as I held the branch between us. If I wanted a chance at escaping, I had to stand back up. My legs shook, and my muscles screamed in protest as I inched up. Any sudden movement could trigger the wolf.</p><p>When I was straightened, I shuffled my feet backwards to gain ground between the wolf and me. However, with each step I took, the wolf inched forward baring its teeth. My breath became labored as adrenaline coursed through my body. My heart thudded in my chest hard. We stared into one another\u2019s eyes\u2014human and beast. The scenery disappeared as I kept my gaze pinned on the wolf. I kept dragging my feet backwards, not knowing what my escape route was. I just needed to get away. Crack. A branch snapped under my foot and everything went into slow motion. I had a split second to realize that the wolf\u2019s taunting games were over and that I would have to run for my life. Like a bell in a boxing ring, the wolf charged and I screamed. I darted left as the wolf leapt through the air. A heavy crash behind me propelled my feet forward. Zigzagging through pine trees and decaying branches, they whipped across my face. The wolf\u2019s growls taunted me\u2014too close. There was no way I could out run it\u2014we both knew that.</p><p>Whirling around another batch of trees, I skidded to a stop at the edge of a cliff. My eyes shot to the bottom\u2014at least 400 feet down\u2014and then to the wolf sauntering through the forest as if it knew I was out of space. A glint of victory flashed in its eerie eyes; our gazes locked. I felt like a gazelle staring down a lion. A million useless thoughts rushed through my mind. How long will it take them to find my devoured corpse? Will they even find me? I\u2019m about to be eaten alive. Did I mail the electricity payment? I need a drink.</p><p>A howl echoed through the mountains and reverberated in my eardrums. My attacker perked its head to one side and listened. When it looked back, something changed in its eyes. The beast rushed forward, and out of instinct, I stepped back. My feet slid off the ledge and then I was slipping over the edge. My arms flailed as I tried to grab anything I could to keep from falling 400 feet. For a split second I was thankful I might die from the fall and not be eaten alive. But the wolf\u2019s teeth sank into my forearm, nearly ripping it from my body. I screamed as it tugged back. The flesh pulled from my arm and its teeth scraped against the bone. I scrambled to use my other arm to heave myself back up. My top half flattened against the solid ground before I stopped, tears streaming down my cheeks. My adrenaline charged strength was waning.</p><p>The beast released my arm and went for my throat, its teeth digging into my jugular and cutting off my oxygen. Before it could snap my neck, a deep growl sounded next to us. The wolf released me and rolled on its back. I didn\u2019t have time to think about how strange that was; the edges of my vision were blurry from tears and the site of my own blood dripping down my arm. Blood made me woozy, not an attribute that helped me right now.</p> <p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d a man asked. His voice sounded muddled to my ears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The words formed as a whisper on my lips. I wasn\u2019t sure who I was apologizing to\u2014maybe to myself. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have gone into the mountains alone. There had been multiple animal attacks the past month, I knew better than this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you have first dibs,\u201d a female said and was answered with a deep growl.</p><p>A giggle bubbled up my throat as I imagined the wolves talking\u2014woozy hallucinations. Peeling an eyelid open, I stared at two naked bodies. The woman had shoulder length brown hair that brushed her skin as the wind played with it. The man had wavy, honey-colored locks. Both of them stared at me, the woman with hunger and the man with remorse.</p><p>Blinking a few times, I searched for the wolf that attacked me and the other one that growled. When my eyes didn\u2019t find the beasts, I wondered why the man and woman were naked. Perhaps they\u2019d been camping nearby and my cries of pain interrupted their lovemaking. I feared for their safety. Somewhere, two wolves lingered waiting for the opportunity to strike the couple.</p><p>My fingers found the puncture wounds on my neck and came away slick with blood. I was going to die. Staring up at the sky, I found a sense of peace and excitement that I\u2019d see my parents again. They were up there, beyond the clouds, waiting for me by a set of pearly gates. Their smiling faces would welcome me.</p> <p>\u201cYou know you want her as much as I do,\u201d the woman said with anxiousness.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop this,\u201d the man said, his words angry and disgusted.</p><p>I didn\u2019t waste any more thoughts on their strange conversation. Instead, I continued to stare at the sky until darkness clouded its beauty and my eyelids fell shut.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>\u201cAnna, we need more wood,\u201d Elle called from the kitchen.</p><p>Three months had passed after I was attacked in the mountains. The fates had something other than death in store for me, something far more complex. Fairytales weren\u2019t just stories. One little bite turned me into a creature who answered to the moon with deep, carnal needs that were harder to ignore than a streaker at a football game.</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d I told my pack-mate. It was strange to be a member of a pack. But I was thankful to have a group of people who shared the same affinity for the moon and the same animalistic emotions. I didn\u2019t remember a lot about the day I was attacked, and no one stepped forward to claim me as theirs. Rumors of a rogue werewolf spread, but I wasn\u2019t so sure. One day my memory would return, and I\u2019d know who sired me\u2014then I\u2019d kill them for what they\u2019d done.</p><p>I pushed through the screen door and headed around the back of the house. Every society has a pecking order: children listen to their parents, employees to their bosses, and a person climbs the ladder through time and hard work. I was at the bottom of the order here and expected to prove myself every day. The jobs no one wanted landed on my shoulders, and if I mouthed off or refused, I was taught a lesson through embarrassment. Adam, the alpha of our pack, would transform into his wolf and clasp my jugular between his teeth in front of everyone. When I first heard about that, I laughed, sure that it wouldn\u2019t be all that bad. It wasn\u2019t until it happened to me that I understood how humiliating it was. There was something in my DNA now that took on the traits of a common wolf. In their world, being reprimanded by the alpha in front of the pack was mortifying. You\u2019d think I would\u2019ve learned my lesson after the first time, but since then, Adam has had his teeth around my throat four other times.</p> <p>Curling my fingers around the axe handle, I split the wood for the fireplaces. Before I was infected with wolf saliva, there was no way I could\u2019ve swung an axe, let alone split piles of wood all day long. Now, however, I was stronger than an ox. It was both a gift and a curse. A gift because, well, it was cool to be able to lift a car, and a curse because I couldn\u2019t use exhaustion as an excuse to quit.</p><p>The Everwood pack\u2014named after its alpha, Adam Everwood\u2014consisted of twenty-five members. Their homes were sprinkled within the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming. It was my job to chop and deliver wood to each of their homes. I spent two days a week chopping and delivering, and the other five doing equally belittling tasks. My life BW (before werewolf) had been simple. I worked as a teller at a small bank, lived in the home my parents left me when they died, and came home every night to my dog, Jitters. My life AW (after werewolf) meant selling my parents\u2019 home, moving into the mountains with the Everwood pack, and handing my dog over to my neighbor. Jitters didn\u2019t like me now that I was a canine.</p><p>My parents died three years ago in plane crash with a newly licensed pilot. I told them not to fly with him, but they didn\u2019t listen. They craved life and adventure and that had gotten them killed. They were the only children in their families which meant no aunts or uncles for me. A few of their cousins contacted me after they died, but not enough to notice when I suddenly vanished from my old life. If they called, they\u2019d find the number had been disconnected and the house sold. I didn\u2019t have a ton of friends or a love life that consisted of more than a couple dates.</p><p>When I was happy with the amount of wood I chopped, I pulled my Ford F150 around back and loaded the bed. I didn\u2019t own a truck BW, but Adam insisted I trade my small sedan for something useful. At the time, I thought he meant a truck would come in handy for driving the rough mountain roads. Had I known what he really meant, the truck would serve as my delivery vehicle, I would\u2019ve dug in my heels and kept my car\u2014and probably end up with his teeth around my throat again. Life was a bitch and because of my attack, so was I\u2014literally.</p><p>Driving from house to house was the most peaceful part of my day. The summer breeze blew through the cab while Lady Antebellum filled the air. I belted American Honey, and the wind caressed my hand that hung out of the window. The sun glistened on the river, and the scent of flowers hung in the air. An eagle soared high above my truck looking for some critter to feast on. I loved summer and the life and cheer it brought. I intended to soak up every ray before winter reached the mountains.</p><p>I turned into the Anderson\u2019s driveway and jumped out of the truck. Every home up here was made of logs. The only difference was the color of tin on their roofs. The Anderson\u2019s chose navy and continued the theme in the color of their shutters and front door. I tightened my ponytail, unlatched the tailgate and piled the logs in a neat pile by their garage. Most of the pack held regular jobs and were gone during the day, but they were seasoned wolves and I was not. I had trouble keeping a lid on my inner beast, and Adam worried I\u2019d snap and devour someone. The thought was enough to scare me, so I didn\u2019t complain; even though, the alternative was being a work horse for the pack. I made six more stops before I went towards Adam\u2019s home\u2014I should\u2019ve delivered to his house first, this was my little way of showing rebellion. I was in the middle of belting out another Lady Antebellum tune about the sun shining and clouds having silver linings, when I pulled into Adam\u2019s driveway and choked on my words. Adam, all six-foot-three feet of him, was curled over the engine of his Silverado. The crunching of my tires drew his attention, our eyes locked before I looked away. It was considered a challenge to stare the alpha in the eyes for too long. I learned that lesson the way I learned all my lessons since becoming a wolf\u2014the hard way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shut the truck off and hopped out. I stood perfectly still for a moment and bowed my head to acknowledge his authority and power over us mere unworthy subjects. The whole thing made me snort in derision\u2014at least mentally. I wasn\u2019t brave enough to defy Adam like I wanted to, my wolf wouldn\u2019t allow it, it cowered in his presence\u2014the pansy.</p><p>When a deep rumbling echoed in Adam\u2019s throat, a sign to carry on, I turned and got to work unloading his supply of firewood. I spared a glance in his direction and immediately looked away when my gaze found his. It was a common occurrence for him to reprimand me for something, but he didn\u2019t punish for admiration, luckily. It was pure instinct I found him attractive, all the female wolves did\u2014perks of being the alpha. The gleam in his aqua eyes and the smirk on his full lips said he loved the attention. I heard stories about him, gossip that traveled on the lips of admiring females. They say he takes what he wants, if you know what I mean, one girl said with an anticipating smile. He chooses a new mistress every month, another claimed. That particular piece of gossip got my carnal juices flowing and fleeing. There were only nine women in our pack, how long before he got tired of sampling the same tail and came searching for something new? I was the newbie, the untouched wolf. The fact I might interest my alpha caused a frenzy of emotions. It\u2019s hard to find someone attractive when you both resented and admired them. Adam took me in when I was lost, but he\u2019d also shown me just how much of an ass he could be. None of the woman in our pack would confirm whether or not Adam had sampled their goods. I figured the reason for their silence was either: smart, mandatory, or it was just plain gossip.</p><p>None of it mattered though. If Adam so much as sniffed in my direction, Evelyn, or Eve as she preferred, would take care of me. Behind every alpha was an alpha female waiting to rip your head off should you even think about stealing her place of power. When I first learned my alphas were named Adam and Eve, I thought it was some sick way of paying tribute to them, like a bad nick name or something. It wasn\u2019t. I was told there used to be twenty-eight members of the pack before Eve killed three females for moving in on her territory. With only nine women left, I was surprised the men weren\u2019t chomping at the bit to raid our panties. Some were married, but most weren\u2019t, including Adam and Eve. There were hookups from time to time, but only two couples in the entire pack were actually dating. If I had hopes of finding love, it wouldn\u2019t be here. Ninety percent of human males were dogs; throw in a group of actual wolves and the pickings for a faithful, loving mate were slim to none.</p> <p>I finished unloading Adam\u2019s supply and was ready to jump in my truck and hightail it as far away from his lingering gaze as possible when he called my name.</p><p>\u201cAnna, a moment,\u201d he said.</p><p>What did I do now? Did I not stack the firewood to his liking? Was he going to make me move it around the house and watch me sweat while he sipped lemonade? Keeping my eyes to the ground, I walked over to where he stood and waited. I swear the man got off on making me uncomfortable. A minute passed while I stood in front of him, and he didn\u2019t say one word. I didn\u2019t dare shift my eyes from the gravel driveway or grumble like I wanted to, which I suspected was what he waited for. I also had the suspicion he liked disciplining me.</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d his deep baritone ordered. I hated to admit it, but the wolf inside me quivered from the sound of his masculine voice.</p><p>The crunching of his footsteps headed towards the house, and I followed obediently. I\u2019d been delivering wood for three months and not once had Adam invited me into his house. All of the gossip floated through my mind, and my heart beat harder with each step. Was he planning on ravishing me? Could I say no? Would I say no? How long before Eve ripped my throat out?</p> <p>\u201cSit,\u201d Adam ordered once we were standing in the kitchen.</p><p>I took a seat at the table and focused on my shoes rather than him. Being this close was like breathing underwater. Everything about him from his broad chest to his shoulder length blond hair, sculpted muscles, piercing blue eyes, and cocky attitude screamed alpha male. He knew what he was and how the woman perceived him. All he had to say was \u201copen sesame\u201d and legs would spread. It was barbaric, misogynist, and hot as hell\u2014at least the beast within me thought so. The human part of me, the part I tried to white knuckle and hold onto like my life depended on it, thought it was as far from sexy as one could get.</p><p>\u201cSawyer is looking for a female to settle down with,\u201d he began, and I could see the walls of my world crumbling. \u201cI do not force relationships, but seeing as there are more men than women in our pack, I do ask you to at least go on a couple dates. The future of the pack depends on its successors, Anna.\u201d</p><p>Was he asking me to have children? Before I even talked to the man? Oh he said it nicely, but what he meant was, \u201cYou will date Sawyer whether you want to or not.\u201d Women fought for equality for years, and I was lucky enough to be born in a time of their success. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t matter in a werewolf pack. Men ruled while their mates supported. Adam wanted to turn me into a shadow of my former self, and he thought he\u2019d break me into submission. Boy, did I have news for him.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I decline?\u201d I asked nervously. No one ever refused his orders or even questioned his judgment. I was treading on thin ice and about to be submerged in the frigid depths. I waited for him to growl in warning, a sign to remember my place. I waited for him to scream his demands as if raising his voice would help the order sink into my stubborn brain. I waited for him to show me exactly where my spot was on the proverbial ladder through threats, violence, and teeth wrapped around my throat. When none of my worst fears happened, I glanced up and into the eyes of my alpha.</p><p>For a few moments, I stared into the eyes of the most powerful man, and my wolf devoured the sensation\u2014strength, bravery and equality. My human side stomped down her fascination and I averted my gaze, but for that speck of time I stared down Adam, and he didn\u2019t show the slightest inclination in correcting my discourtesy.</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>I sulked in my bedroom for the rest of the day. When I questioned what would happen if I didn\u2019t want to date Sawyer, Adam threatened to pair me with Luke. No woman in her right mind would want the title of being mated to that man. He was savage and had a fascination with using and abusing women. As if the thought of being black and blue for the rest of my life wasn\u2019t scary enough, Luke was also in his mid-sixties. Not that his age was worse than his bite, but bile rose in my throat at the thought of his hands on my body.</p><p>Luke was old and crazy enough that the pack pretty much left him alone. He didn\u2019t partake in our evening meals or monthly hunts, and I was happy for that. The one time I\u2019d seen him he raked his eyes over my entire twenty-three year old body and left me feeling dirty. Even though he hadn\u2019t touched me, I showered, scrubbed, and repeated twice.</p><p>In the end, I agreed to go on one date with Sawyer, but Adam countered with at least five dates. The alternative was more horrifying than a handful of bad dates, so I tucked my tail between my legs and didn\u2019t put up a fight. I didn\u2019t know much about Sawyer other than: he was around my age, had spiky dirty blond hair, green eyes, five o\u2019clock shadow, and enjoyed fishing. He was cute, and for all intents and purposes, seemed like a nice guy.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s ready,\u201d Elle called from my door.</p><p>Every night the pack gathered, sans Luke the kook as I called him, and ate together. The house where I lived was considered the main house. Everyone congregated here for dinners and meetings. Elle was a few years older than me in age and superiority. She had been the last wolf made before I showed up. Climbing out of bed, I made my way towards the kitchen. Elle was labeled the cook of the pack, but I helped her with setting the table and washing the dishes. A pack of twenty-five wolves could cause quite a mess.</p><p>Members arrived while I set plates, cups, and silverware on the counter. We always ate buffet style, but not a crumb of food would be touched until Adam and Eve made their plates.</p><p>Adam made sure the main house was large enough to accommodate his pack. Like everyone else\u2019s house, it was log cabin style. The main floor was open and spacious. The kitchen was in the back corner while a large living room sat adjacent. A bathroom, three bedrooms, laundry room, and library were also housed on this floor. On the second floor, a balcony made of knobby wood looked over the main floor and housed four more bedrooms, an office, and another large bathroom. Only Elle and I occupied the large home, but as the pack arrived, the space filled up quickly.</p> <p>All of the men were stocky, broad, or just plain muscular\u2014traits of a male wolf. Most kept their hair a little long and their apparel tended to resemble that of blue collar workers and cowboys: jeans, t-shirts, boots, flannel. The women were just as casual. Where the men had chiseled valleys that made up their strong bodies, the women were toned and cut\u2014lithe. Both genders could and would hand out an ass whooping if they had to.</p><p>Sawyer walked into my line of sight, and I wondered if Adam told him the news, that for the next five nights he\u2019d have a date on his arm. I hoped he wouldn\u2019t find out how against it I had been. Another thought occurred to me. Did Sawyer request me or did Adam think we\u2019d pair up well? It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t think I was worthy of getting a male\u2019s attention. I was pretty enough, but I\u2019d never call myself beautiful. I was too awkward and mouthy. My hair is blonde and hits just below my shoulders. My eyes are the color of cinnamon, and my size six body had curves in all the appropriate places. I wasn\u2019t tall, but I wasn\u2019t short either\u2014five-foot-six. My skin was smooth and bronzed thanks to all the time I spent in the sun and my bosom filled out my C cup nicely. Still, it made me uneasy to think Sawyer singled me out. There may have been a shortage of women, but there were far prettier females than me in our pack, Elle for example. She had long red hair that looked like molten copper in the sun, a sprinkle of freckles along the bridge of her nose that only added to her beauty, large green eyes that looked like emeralds, and a tiny waist that led to long, toned legs she often showcased in diminutive denim shorts. If she had a superpower, it\u2019d be causing men to break their necks to get one more look at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sawyer smiled in my direction, and when I realized I was still staring at him, I smiled back sheepishly. Our attention was drawn away from each other when Adam and Eve walked through the door. Every single member bowed their heads in acknowledgment and remained still while the alphas made their way through the house. The air prickled with their power and the hair on my arms stood on end. Separate they each had a powerful presence, but together it was overwhelming. My wolf fidgeted within me, ready for a command from her alpha couple. My wolf lived and breathed to please them. The sensation of having feelings that didn\u2019t yet make sense to my human mind was still alien to me. The one thing I could count on was that my inner wolf would never lead me astray. I could trust those feelings, even if I didn\u2019t understand them.</p><p>Adam and Eve made their plates, sauntered over to the table, and the pack\u2019s stoic bodies became active as each member rushed to fill their plates as well. Like everything else in the Everwood Pack, eating also had a pecking order. Guess who waited until everyone else got their food?</p><p>Leaning against the wall, I watched my brethren attack the buffet with excited vigor. If there was one thing to be said about werewolves, it was that we loved to eat. My stomach grumbled as the scent of roasted meats, potatoes, and cornbread teased my nostrils. Becoming a wolf amped up my metabolism; I could eat my weight in food and not gain a pound.</p> <p>Sawyer wandered over to me, carrying two plates stacked with food. His lips quirked into a smile, and his head motioned for me to follow him. I could tell multiple sets of eyes were focused on our interaction; mating was sort of a big deal in our pack and a rarity. Had Adam announced to everyone that the newbie was promised to Sawyer Matthews? My eyes traveled over the bodies in the kitchen and met many curious stares. Sawyer waited patiently while I decided if I would follow him or ignore him. If I snubbed him, I\u2019d be presented on Luke\u2019s doorstep and black and blue come morning.</p><p>Taking a step forward, I followed Sawyer through the house. He headed towards the sliding glass doors that led to a large deck. Before I stepped outside, I caught Adam\u2019s approving gaze. I had my fair share of mouthy moments that led to Adam disciplining me, but he knew I wouldn\u2019t disobey this particular order\u2014he\u2019d made sure of that. Sawyer set the plates on the patio table and took a seat. I sat across from him and stared at my food. It felt like our parents planned our marriage from birth, and we were meeting for the first time\u2014in other words, it was awkward as hell, at least for me. Sawyer seemed perfectly at ease as he tore through a chicken leg. I found out very quickly that manners didn\u2019t exist in a werewolf pack. We were all animals, why not act like it was the motto of the pack, one I hadn\u2019t quite picked up on yet.</p><p>\u201cNot hungry?\u201d Sawyer asked around a mouthful of food. I shot him a look and frowned at the steak sauce that dribbled from his lip. If this was his idea of wooing me, my love life was in serious trouble. Ignoring his amusement, I stabbed my fork into my mashed potatoes and took a bite. Hollers and loud laughter sounded from inside the house, and I wished I was in there rather than being stared at by Sawyer.</p><p>After taking a few more bites, I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. I dropped my fork and glared at my date. \u201cWhat the hell are you looking at?\u201d Boldness was a trait I picked up during the three months since becoming a wolf. I had to be tough, otherwise the pack would always walk all over me. I didn\u2019t plan on spending the rest of my life as their welcome mat.</p><p>\u201cI love to watch a woman eat,\u201d Sawyer replied softly. \u201cThere\u2019s something sexy about a woman with a healthy appetite.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re wolves. We all have healthy appetites. Using that pickup line here is like going to a bar and being shocked they serve alcohol.\u201d I had no patience for people who stated the obvious. Maybe that was why I hadn\u2019t dated anyone more than once in two years. Sawyer was handsome, but it wasn\u2019t enough to turn me into a blubbering idiot who giggled at his so-called charm.</p><p>Sawyer laughed and leaned back in his chair, his eyes appraising me. His fingers brushed the side of his stubble lined jaw and a dangerous glint replaced his amusement. \u201cI also find a feisty woman sexy,\u201d he paused. \u201cI like a good chase. What about you, Anna? Do you like a good chase?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes in response, but my wolf bristled under my skin. It had been a long time since I\u2019d been with a man, and now that I was an animal, my sex drive was carnal, wild, and ready for action. It was a constant war between my human side and my wolf side. Before changing, I wouldn\u2019t have fallen for the hungry glint in Sawyers eyes or gotten wet from the sight of the bulge in his pants. Now, I was as turned on as a nympho. Stamping down my rising yearning, I stood, grabbed my plate, and headed for the door. I would not allow my wolf to turn me into a piece of ass for the men in our pack. Most of the women here had lost that war, I didn\u2019t intend to.</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s body pressed against my back, his erection digging into my backside. My wolf quivered like an excited puppy. Gritting my teeth and anger rising to overcome my desire, I turned and pushed Sawyer backwards. Anger was my only defense against my wolf\u2019s carnal appetite\u2014she loved a good fight almost more than a good romp in the sheets. Sawyer was hip to my game though, he pushed forward, his hand wrapping around my waist and clasping my behind. My wolf was close to taking control of the situation which would end with me wrapped around Sawyer\u2019s dick and a big helping of regret in the morning.</p><p>The pack heard the commotion from our sick little dance and filed onto the deck. The air grew thick with desire, hunger, and excitement as they watched Sawyer and I play our game.</p><p>\u201cTeach that pup who\u2019s boss,\u201d someone called and was rewarded with deep guttural laughs.</p> <p>\u201cI got my money on the bitch,\u201d another said. This wasn\u2019t the first time a male sniffed in my direction and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. My wolf may be stronger than me, but I learned how to distract her\u2014with a fight.</p><p>Catcalls and laughter surrounded us while I waited for Sawyer\u2019s next move. There was a lot riding on the outcome of our game. If he failed in mating with me, his manhood would be ridiculed, at least for a while. Two other men dealt with the taunts after failing to bed me and so would Sawyer.</p><p>A smile curled my lips while a rush of excitement raced through my veins. Sawyer stepped forward, fisted a hand in my hair, and tilted my head back. To the pack it looked like he had overpowered me. I could smell their desire in the air. They were ready to see two hot bodies, flesh to flesh, moaning and growling in desire as Sawyer claimed my body. His fingers slipped behind the waist of jeans, ready to rip them away and show me who was boss. Victory revealed itself in his green eyes. Just like a man to celebrate early.</p><p>Bringing my knee up quick and swift, I landed a hard blow between his legs. Sawyer\u2019s hand dropped from my hair as he cradled his genitals. Men think they\u2019re tough, but can be brought to their knees in an instant if their dicks take a blow\u2014no pun intended. My wolf quivered for a fight now, and I was happy to oblige. While he was distracted, I grabbed him by the shoulders, pulled him to his feet, and threw him over the balcony. Cheers echoed in the back of my mind. I was too focused on handing Sawyer his ass to focus on my pack\u2019s reaction. If I took it a step too far, Adam would step in and stop me\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be the first time.</p><p>Sawyer snarled, jumped to his feet, and rushed me. I was quick though, I stepped to the side, positioned myself behind him, and when he turned around, my fist connected with his face. Blood poured from his flared nostrils and a dangerous smile curled his lips into a sneer.</p><p>\u201cI can put that fire to better use,\u201d Sawyer teased, his eyes flicking to my low cut tank top.</p><p>\u201cDoubt it,\u201d I remarked bored.</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s chest rose and fell as he took a heavy breath, his eyes locked with mine and his frustration slowly faded away. I could tell he was giving up, and I thanked the heavens for that. I may not back down from a fight, but I didn\u2019t enjoy it. Okay, sometimes I did, but I only resorted to fighting when a male came sniffing in my direction and thought he could claim me sexually like I was a piece of property. That shit didn\u2019t fly with me, as my pack mates were quickly learning. I wouldn\u2019t be a willing female like the others.</p> <p>\u201cSo, this was a fun first date,\u201d Sawyer said more to the pack than to me, and they rewarded him with teasing and laughter. I couldn\u2019t help myself, I laughed right along with them. My new life was bizarre, but I was learning to deal with it and so far not one male had been victorious in getting into my pants.</p><p>Sawyer wiped at the blood coming from his nose and held out his hand to me. With a smile, I took his hand in mine and shook it. To the unknowing spectator it looked like Sawyer tried to rape me, but he hadn\u2019t. He quit long before he should have, and had he been successful in breaking me, I would\u2019ve willingly slept with him. It was the way of the wolf.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope your game is better for the second,\u201d I told him.</p><p>After everyone patted me on the back for giving Sawyer a run for his money, I snuck off. I liked hanging out with them, but I liked being by myself and come tomorrow morning I\u2019d be busy with more chores.</p><p>Shifting into my wolf, which became less painful the more I did it, I headed for the tree line. The first month was torture as my body shifted and contorted into something unnatural and foreign. Adam made me transform over and over so I built up a tolerance to the pain. Now, the only discomfort was sore muscles. As a wolf not only had my strength and metabolism increased, I now had the ability to heal a lot quicker.</p><p>My wolf was as white as the snow capping the mountains and the only one in the pack. Some people thought it was a sign I would do great things, but after three months of screwing up, they\u2019d given up on that theory. I didn\u2019t know why I was the singular white wolf amongst my pack, but I didn\u2019t think it had anything to do with my destiny.</p><p>Cutting across a meadow, I ran like the wind to where a small stream bubbled through the mountains, a place called Crazy Woman Canyon. The moon was bright in the night sky as it cast a silvery glow on the earth. We didn\u2019t need a full moon to change, but we couldn\u2019t refuse changing during one. During those times of month the pack came together and hunted, taking down moose and elk as a team. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once I came to the stream I often visited, I took a long drink. Trout swam through the water, my eyes watching them as they scurried away from my hungry stare. With a quick precise movement, my jaws snapped around one. It wiggled and fought to free itself from my sharp teeth, not knowing it didn\u2019t stand a chance. Lying down with my paws outstretched, I bit a chuck out of the fish. The breeze stirred, crickets chirped, and the sky was filled with twinkling diamonds\u2014I loved the peacefulness of the night.</p><p>As I was about to take another bite, a jet black wolf stepped through the trees. Its eyes were the color of citrines and stood out against its ebony fur. This wolf demanded my respect and servitude, and my inner beast cowered in its presence. Forgetting about my dinner, I rolled onto my back to expose my belly and throat\u2014the two most fragile parts on a wolf.</p><p>The black wolf sauntered over to where I lay submissive and sniffed my belly. My wolf whimpered. The black wolf moved its mouth to my throat and clasped my jugular between its teeth, but the pressure I expected didn\u2019t come. The black wolf removed its mouth from my esophagus and licked the side of my jaw. The action caused confusion and relief in my wolf\u2014and a bit of excitement. This was her alpha, my alpha, and he\u2019d shown affection towards her, towards me. Adam barely spoke to me unless he was lecturing on the ways of the wolf. It was against the pack rules to wander off by myself, but I did anyway. Adam should\u2019ve punished me, not licked me.</p> <p>Rolling over, I nudged the fish with my nose, an offering to my alpha. Adam eyed the half eaten fish, turned towards the stream, and grabbed his own. We ate side by side for the next ten minutes like equals.</p><p>\u201cShift,\u201d his voice penetrated my mind. It freaked me out the first time he\u2019d spoken to me through telepathy. Only the alpha could speak to us that way though, so at least I didn\u2019t have the entire pack inside my head.</p><p>My skin itched and the hair on my back prickled and thinned as I obeyed his order. When the sensation subsided, I lay on the dewy grass fully human again and naked. I stashed my clothes at the entrance to the tree line and hadn\u2019t expected to change forms until I returned home.</p><p>Adam transformed as well and stood in front of me as nude as the day he was born. Nudity was another insecurity the pack didn\u2019t share with humans. For all intents and purposes, they were animals through and through. I hadn\u2019t been a wolf long enough for my human side to not be embarrassed about walking around in the flesh.</p><p>I stared at the ground and waited for Adam to make his move. Why in the hell was he here? I\u2019d been sneaking out of the house and running through the forest since I built up a tolerance to the pain. My wolf yearned to feel the wind through her fur and taste the spoils of a fresh kill. Adam never once met me in the woods or even mentioned he knew I did it.</p> <p>\u201cStand,\u201d Adam said. He wasn\u2019t much of a talker, at least not to me. Our conversations usually consisted of him giving me one word commands.</p><p>Trying to cover all of my bare bits with my arms and hands, I stood awkwardly. I wrapped one arm around my breast and placed my other hand in front of my dark curls. It did little to hide my body, but it was enough I didn\u2019t feel completely exposed.</p><p>Adam walked closer and my wolf panted in excitement. She wanted her alpha to take her right then and there. I, on the other hand, did not. I would not become a mistress for anyone, not even the alpha of the Everwood pack.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Adam said softly.</p><p>I dragged my eyes from the ground up to his. My chest rose and fell as my breaths became labored and nervous.</p><p>\u201cStand with your arms at your sides, Anna.\u201d When I hesitated he said, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>There was something intertwined within me that couldn\u2019t defy his orders. While I hesitated, I couldn\u2019t refuse. My arms fell to my sides while we stared at each other. His eyes broke contact with mine as he trailed them down the length of me, drinking in my body. My wolf scratched and moaned for his attention, absorbed his presence and begged for his touch. I shuddered against the feel of my inner beast\u2019s anticipation. There was no clear way to describe what it was like to have an animal lying in the wait just under your skin. It was like being possessed. Like two souls were occupying the same body\u2014my body. She had separate thoughts than I did, and they came through strong. I figured out how to please her when she became aroused, but I didn\u2019t think starting a fight with the alpha would be smart.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid of me, Anna,\u201d Adam spoke gently as he closed the space between us with a single step.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I lied. It was as obvious as the moon in the sky I was absolutely terrified. My voice shook as well as my body. My heart jack hammered in my chest, and if I could see my face, I\u2019d say it looked just as frightened.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think of Sawyer? Will he become your mate?</p><p>He wanted to talk about Sawyer? \u201cI don\u2019t need a mate,\u201d I told him.</p><p>With one finger, he started at my collarbone and trailed it downward between my breasts. I could feel his excitement press against my leg, and it made me want to turn and run as far away from him as possible. If he forced me to have sex with him, I\u2019d be gone before the sun rose. My wolf may be anxious to feel him inside her, but I wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to be labeled as the alpha\u2019s mistress\u2014I was better than that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you crave a man, Anna? You\u2019ve been here three months and haven\u2019t let one male experience your body,\u201d he paused. \u201cOr do you prefer women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t crave a man or no you don\u2019t love the ladies?\u201d He laughed and my wolf whimpered.</p><p>\u201cNo to both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me, Anna? If I was to offer myself to you, would you accept it willingly? Do you crave me?\u201d</p><p>My wolf screamed yes! I found him attractive and not just because he was my alpha. He had the looks and body of a God many women would love to worship. I wasn\u2019t blind and I wasn\u2019t gay. I could appreciate how beautiful he was. But that was all ruined by his way of thinking\u2014primitive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good looking and many women here would eagerly be your mistress, but that\u2019s not the type of woman I am. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said with as much confidence as I could muster.</p><p>\u201cI admire that about you, and I will not force you to do anything you do not want to, at least in this manner,\u201d he laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re still expected to do your chores.\u201d</p><p>A smile broke against my lips as some of my muscles relaxed. I hadn\u2019t expected him to not force himself on me, most alphas would have from the stories I\u2019d heard.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want a mate, but that won\u2019t always be the case. One day your wolf will want a companion, Anna. When that time comes, come to me. Let me be the first to taste you, to fill you, to please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you get first dibs on all of the women here? Eve is such a lucky girl,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Adam growled, and I immediately cowered. Maybe I misread the situation, and we weren\u2019t having an open discussion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the alpha. I don\u2019t waste my time with simple women even if they\u2019re willing to spread their legs. What I offered you is more than I\u2019ve offered any other. It\u2019s a compliment. Don\u2019t turn it into something foul and meaningless.\u201d</p><p>Staring at the ground again I said, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re strong and not just physically, but mentally. You don\u2019t show cowardice toward the men, even me. You\u2019re only three months old, and you\u2019ve already got the personality of a leader, an alpha. How many women have you seen look me in the eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cExcept you. You don\u2019t fold under my stare, and I suspect the only reason you advert your gaze is because you\u2019ve been taught to. But the ones teaching you are followers, and you, Anna, are not. I offer myself to you as a man, an equal, not as your alpha or superior.\u201d</p><p>Fire burned behind his sapphire eyes as he waited for my response. He laid out a good speech, but that didn\u2019t change my mind. When I was with a man, I didn\u2019t share, and I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to share Adam with Eve.</p><p>\u201cThank you for thinking so highly of me,\u201d I started. \u201cBut I still cannot be your mistress. If I should want a mate, that man will be mine completely, and I\u2019ll be his. I know you guys have a different way of thinking, but I still hang onto the ways of my human world. I have no plans to share my mate or jump from one bed to another simply because my wolf is a horny bitch\u2014\u201d</p><p>My words were cut off when Adam burst out laughing. Maybe I held the tiniest bit of resentment towards my inner beast. She didn\u2019t make refusing a man easy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offering right here and now to satisfy her,\u201d Adam stated. Wrapping an arm around my waist, he pulled me against the plains of his hard body. My breasts smashed against his chest and his dick teased in between my legs\u2014rock hard and ready to drive into me. I could practically feel my wolf drooling. \u201cI\u2019ve fantasized about having your body wiggling and moaning underneath me. How you\u2019d taste and the look of desire in your brown eyes. Put me out of my misery and give into me, Anna.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t get a chance to respond, his mouth found mine and cut off my protests. Anger radiated through every last one of my veins. Hadn\u2019t I just got done telling him no?</p><p>Pushing against him, I broke free of his embrace, changed into my wolf and ran like hell back to the house.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>It\u2019d been two days since the night Adam offered himself to me. Every night I snuck out, changed, and ran to the stream. It was a ritual I\u2019d adopted for escapism, but now the place felt different. My wolf expected Adam to pop through the woods and offer her company while she devoured whatever fresh kill she made. Needless to say, I wasn\u2019t as upset about Adam keeping his distance.</p><p>Sawyer and I hunted together last night, a wolf\u2019s way of taking a girl out to dinner. Was it too much to ask for an actual restaurant, instead of ripping into the flesh of a deer we took down together? I learned that romance was nonexistent in the pack. A part of me wondered if I\u2019d be like the rest of them someday. Granted I wasn\u2019t a mushy type girl, but I did believe in the basic type dates. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sky was cloudy today. I rested one hand on the steering wheel while I cruised down the winding mountain road. Elle needed groceries, and I needed time away from the compound. Wyoming was vast, which meant I had to drive a long time before I got to any semblance of humanity. I didn\u2019t mind though; the drive helped me sort through my emotions. Now that I was wolf, I was alert to everything around me. Sometimes it played hell with my head\u2014trying to tune out the sound of nature was the most annoying. Most of the time, I drowned out the chatter out by blaring the radio in my truck. Another thing that changed was my anger. It didn\u2019t take much for the flood gates to open and my inner beast to show herself. My wolf thought she was superior to humans; therefore, if someone got mouthy with me, she\u2019d punch their lights out\u2014and with my newfound strength that could be deadly.</p><p>I pulled the truck into a parking spot at Asher\u2019s butcher shop. Asher was a member of our pack. He kept our fridges stocked with meat. We had ten freezers in the basement that only lasted a month with our group who could eat their weight in food.</p><p>I strode through the door, slapped our order on the counter, and smiled at Asher. He was one of the older wolves, but I\u2019d never say that to him. He prided himself on his strength and ability to keep up with the youngsters. His shaggy brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail. The wrinkles around his hazel, flecked with yellow eyes deepened when he returned my smile.</p> <p>\u201cYou have other shopping to do?\u201d he asked as he scanned the list.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m heading over to Wal-Mart to get the rest of the groceries,\u201d I told him as I slapped a wad of bills on the counter. Adam owned a construction company, but he also got a percentage of the rest of the pack\u2019s income. It wasn\u2019t cheap feeding twenty-five wolves.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll have this ready within the hour.\u201d Asher handed the list to one of his employees.</p><p>Walking through the door, I hopped in the cab of my truck and made my way across the street. I was about to park when a car cut in front of me and stole my space. My wolf bristled and growled within me. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, and I flexed them out as I tried to ease the anger that emanated inside me.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d I told myself.</p> <p>I eyed the man that emerged from the SUV, and the wolf fought to break free. A car behind me honked, bringing me out of my red haze. Finding a place a few spots back, I shut off my truck and took a moment to rein in my inner beast. I adjusted the rearview mirror, appraising my face to make sure my eyes weren\u2019t yellow. When my brown eyes stared back at me, I sighed in relief. My inner wolf was difficult to control if she got too pissed off. Luckily, the douche bag hadn\u2019t ruffled her enough for me to lose my grip.</p><p>After making two trips to fill two carts of food, I went back to Asher\u2019s. When I stepped inside, however, I came face to face with Adam. It took me a few seconds to recover from the surprise before I glanced away. I suspected he\u2019d been ignoring me because I turned him down. As much as I told myself I didn\u2019t care for his attention, when I saw him I realized I\u2019d been lying.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d he greeted me.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I responded with a nod.</p><p>Three men with dollies stacked with boxes made their way out from back and headed towards my navy truck. Leaning against the wall while I waited for the food to be loaded, I crossed my arms and stared out the large window. The image of Adam\u2019s naked body against mine stirred in my mind, and I closed my eyes as my wolf purred in remembrance. I memorized every cut of muscle and the way his eyes glinted as he urged me to give into him.</p><p>I must have gotten lost in the memory because when I focused again, Adam was standing directly in front of me. I unclenched my teeth from the lip I\u2019d been biting and cursed as heat warmed my cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cMay I have a word,\u201d Adam said, a smile struggling to form on his tight lips.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d I followed him outside where we walked down the short sidewalk and around the side of the building. When Adam stopped, his face took on an entirely different look. Gone was the stony alpha fa\u00e7ade and in its place was a man who craved a woman. His eyes penetrated every inch of me as they roamed up and down my body\u2014I could almost feel the heat they left in their wake. My breath caught as my wolf panted for his attention. My body tense, I leaned against the brick wall to put space between us.</p><p>Adam walked closer, resting his hand on the wall to pin me in my place. His blond hair fell forward as he looked down at me. Slowly, I trailed my gaze up and met his stare. We watched each other for a few moments before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cThe group is going to Weston\u2019s tonight. I\u2019d like you to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m ready to mingle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you attack anyone today while shopping?\u201d His voice was amused. Since I\u2019d been living in the Big Horn Mountains, I\u2019d never been allowed to leave. The fact that I left today, without his consent, was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was going to ask, but I couldn\u2019t find you and we needed groceries. I didn\u2019t\u2014.\u201d</p><p>Adam placed a finger on my lips to silence my lies. I hadn\u2019t even thought about asking for his permission, and he knew it.</p> <p>\u201cThen I suppose you\u2019re ready. You deserve a fun night, and I know all the men wanna see your moves,\u201d he quirked an eyebrow as his hand settled on my hip. I dug my fingers into the brick behind me to keep from reaching out.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I breathed, my voice uneven.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d a voice interrupted and Adam stepped away, the stony alpha disguise was back in place. Adam went with Asher, and I took a moment to catch my breath. It pissed me off he thought he could toy with my emotions and then ignore me as if our interaction never happened.</p><p>I smacked the irritation away and focused on the fact that I was going to Weston\u2019s with the rest of the group instead of staying home doing laundry. If the men wanted to see my moves on the dance floor, then this girl was happy to oblige.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Weston\u2019s gravel parking lot was packed full of pickup trucks and SUVs. The barn siding of the bar was painted red and a wood sign above the door announced it was the best rootin\u2019 tootin\u2019 country bar around. I hopped out of Sawyer\u2019s truck and adjusted my flannel shirt tied just under my breasts. A good portion of my stomach was exposed, and my denim skirt showcased my tan legs. The clothes, down to the brown cowboy boots, were Elle\u2019s. My wardrobe didn\u2019t consist of anything that would make a man drool, and tonight, I was on a mission.</p><p>Sawyer wore jeans and a tight fitting plaid shirt. His spiky blonde hair was perfectly mussed and his woodsy, spicy scent enticed me. Sawyer was growing on me. While he could be a pig most of the time, he\u2019d taken his time and tried to get to know me.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, little lady?\u201d Sawyer asked in his best cowboy voice.</p><p>I laughed and looped my arm with his as we walked into Weston\u2019s. The entire place was one big dance floor with tables and a bar that surrounded it. Sawdust covered the ground and large industrial lights hung from wood rafters. Music beat against my sensitive eardrums causing me to cringe. I took a moment to tune it out as best I could. Sawyer and I walked towards the bar, his hand on the small of my back. My eyes roamed over the large space. The dance floor was congested with people line dancing. As my gaze traveled over the patrons, they stopped when they met with a pair of cobalt eyes. Adam was dressed in jeans and a tight fitting t-shirt that hugged his broad chest. His blond hair had been freshly cut and fell to his jawline now. He sat at a table with a group of our pack mates, Eve propped on his lap. My wolf roared at seeing her on him.</p><p>Adam looked away and laughed at something someone said, but soon returned his attention towards me. I stared bullets, hating that he caused this reaction.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d</p><p>I broke my gaze and looked up at Sawyer. I grabbed the longneck he offered and took a long drink to snuff the fire that erupted in my stomach. Making our way over to the table, I leaned into Sawyer\u2019s arm.</p><p>Adam\u2019s eyes flicked to our closeness. His lips tightened and his hand on the table fisted. A smile curled my lips, happy that seeing me with someone else bothered him. Sawyer wrapped an arm around my waist, his hand caressing my bare skin. Adam squirmed even more.</p><p>\u201cWell, lookie here. The pup is running with the big dogs,\u201d Joe said, causing laughter to circle the table.</p><p>\u201cI bet this pup can drink you under the table, old man,\u201d I laughed. Joe wasn\u2019t actually old. He was in his mid-thirties, but had been a wolf since he was nineteen. He ranked pretty high on the totem pole.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d he teased, a glint reflecting in his brown eyes.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cLine \u2018em up.\u201d</p><p>After ten minutes, Joe and I stood on either side of an empty table, six shots in front of each of us. Our pack surrounded us, taking bets on who would finish first. Sawyer stood next to me, his hand rubbing my ass. I shot him a disapproving look, and he smiled and withdrew his grip.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Elle asked and we nodded. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>I slammed the first shot and then the second. The tequila burned my throat, but I wouldn\u2019t let that stop me from winning. Joe was on his third shot. I slammed shot three and four down, took a moment to breathe and then attacked the last two. Joe and I reached for the sixth one at the same time. I slammed the glass right before Joe and the pack cheered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty fierce, little one.\u201d Joe laughed as he clapped me on the back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they keep telling me.\u201d I smiled in return.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but I believe I owe the woman who kicked your ass a dance,\u201d Sawyer said, grabbing my hand.</p><p>\u201cSo long as she saves one for me,\u201d Joe replied.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t want you to break a hip.\u201d</p><p>Joe tousled my hair and I laughed. He and I always went back and forth with the banter. He was like the brother I never had but always wanted.</p><p>I allowed Sawyer to drag me onto the dance floor. The line dancers were gone and couples filled the space. (Kissed you) Goodnight by Gloriana played. Sawyer placed his hands on either side of my hips, his fingers warm against my skin, and drew me towards him. Placing my arms on his shoulders, I let him guide me along the dance floor. I rested my head against his chest and inhaled the scent of him. It\u2019d been so long since I\u2019d been with a man. Sawyer may have been rough around the edges, but he was a good man. I had fun getting to know him and being in his arms made me feel safe. My body reacted to his masculinity, heating up and ready for him. I was proud I was stronger than my urges, but it frustrated the hell out of my libido. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou feel so good in my arms,\u201d Sawyer spoke softly.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking the same thing.\u201d I smiled up at him, loving how his eyes sparkled when he looked at me. Ever so slowly, he lowered his head towards mine and with the softest brush against my lips, he kissed me. My fingers trailed up his neck and ran though his hair as our lips grew more eager.</p><p>Realizing we were surrounded by multiple witnesses, I withdrew and looked away with a fresh blush to my cheeks. A smile stretched across my mouth as Sawyer twirled me out and back to his chest. As we moved, Adam watched us with too much interest. He was always watching me. I ignored his gaze and enjoyed being close to Sawyer.</p> <p>When the song ended, a man walked up and asked, \u201cMind if I cut in?\u201d He was very much human and my wolf sneered at his approach. I tamped down her disapproval and tried to appear like she wasn\u2019t attempting to break free.</p><p>Sawyer looked at me, and I looked at the man. He was young, around my age, and had a buzz cut. His skin held quite a few blemishes and his clothes looked like they\u2019d been picked out by his grandparents. Overall, I was impressed at his courage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a dance,\u201d I told him with a smile.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Anna?\u201d Sawyer asked in a warning tone. Everyone knew I had a hard time keeping a lid on my inner beast, but I was determined to get a handle on her. I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my weekends stuck in the house while my pack went bar hopping.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I told Sawyer and accepted the young man\u2019s outstretched hand.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right over here,\u201d Sawyer said as he walked off the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tim,\u201d the man said as he curled his arm around my waist. As he made contact the hairs on my arms stood on end and my gums became sore as my wolf pushed forward. I closed my eyes and resisted the change. When my wolf settled a little, I opened my eyes and smiled at Tim.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Anna,\u201d I told him. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve had a lot of drinks and the room started to spin. I\u2019m fine now though.\u201d My lie for my bizarre behavior fooled him. He nodded as if he understood and began to move with the music.</p><p>Although Tim wasn\u2019t my taste, I wasn\u2019t a mean girl. Before I became a wolf, I would\u2019ve enjoyed dancing with him, but now I could hardly stand to be next to him. I smiled and laughed while he made small talk, but keeping a handle on the wolf was distracting as hell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it from here,\u201d a masculine voice interrupted one of Tim\u2019s jokes. I smiled apologetically, but was thrilled to be free of him. Tim stared at Adam and lowered his gaze as he scurried away. He may have had the courage to ask a girl to dance, but not enough to refuse a man like Adam.</p><p>Adam and I stood in the middle of the dance floor as people danced around us. We stared at one another for a few moments. I\u2019d forgotten to lower my gaze and worried someone in the pack would realize I was staring down our alpha. I dropped my eyes and stared at my boots.</p> <p>Adam stepped closer, and my wolf howled in excitement. His fingers curled around my waist, sending waves of heat through my skin, and drew my body towards his. Lady Antebellum\u2019s song I Need You Now played mimicking my thoughts. Despite my better judgment, I did want him, need him. He affected me in a way Sawyer didn\u2019t. I wanted to lose myself in his embrace and drown in those cobalt eyes, but our pack was present and I had to play the good submissive pup.</p><p>Resting my head on his chest, I closed my eyes and listened to his heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about what I asked?\u201d Adam whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to think about it, that\u2019s not who I am,\u201d I spoke against his shirt. His muscles tensed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like Sawyer touching you,\u201d he said almost hesitantly. I smiled at his unease about admitting his weakness. Jealously wasn\u2019t something an alpha werewolf felt for someone other than his alpha mate. Something they shouldn\u2019t feel for anyone else.</p><p>\u201cShoulda thought about that before you promised me to him,\u201d I paused. \u201cI don\u2019t like Eve touching you,\u201d I admitted and then cringed at allowing my lips to voice my inner thoughts.</p><p>Adam\u2019s fingers dug into my side as he drew me even closer, a noticeable bulge growing between his legs. His breath stirred my hair and a low growl echoed through his chest.</p><p>\u201cBe mine, Anna. Visit my bed; let me claim your body.\u201d</p> <p>I groaned in frustration. My libido was revved up and ready for action, but I couldn\u2019t allow it to control me. I would not become a mistress or allow Adam to think so little of me. I deserved his full attention, not just when he wanted to get his rocks off.</p><p>I pulled out of his embrace and began to walk away. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I told him sternly.</p><p>Adam grabbed my arm and tugged me back. \u201cWhat do you want from me, Anna? Eve is my alpha mate. We vowed ourselves to each other.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. They may not have been married, but the pairing of an alpha couple was serious business. Adam and Eve were born wolves and their pairing had been set in stone since birth. Something about uniting two packs. Eve, from what I heard, came from a pack in Montana. Since she was mated to Adam, the Montana pack was considered our brother pack. It was a bunch of political crap that I didn\u2019t\u2019 have the patience for. No matter how much Adam stirred the fire within me, I wouldn\u2019t allow myself to give into it.</p><p>An alpha could only pair with a true blood, not a made wolf like me. All he could ever offer me was a romp in the sheets from time to time. Realization that the attraction I felt would never amount to anything was painful.</p><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t have all of you, I don\u2019t want any of you,\u201d I whispered and then broke free of his hold. He didn\u2019t try to stop me this time. I could feel his eyes drilling into my back, but I ignored it. I caught Eve\u2019s glare when I stepped off the dance floor. Annoyed, I headed to the restroom.</p><p>When the door shut behind me, I leaned against the wall and grumbled in aggravation. My life was a lot more complicated now that rules dictated my life and tempting men tested the boundaries of my willpower.</p><p>The door slammed open, causing my wolf to perk up and growl. Eve strolled through the bathroom and headed straight for me. The clacking of her high-heeled boots was menacing. Her short auburn hair bobbed up and down as she marched directly for me. When I stood up straight, she shoved me against the wall.</p><p>\u201cCare to tell me what you and my mate were so chatty about?\u201d Her voice dripped with venom while her nails dug into my shoulder. I winced against the pain and wanted nothing more than to break her hand.</p><p>\u201cHe was giving me tips to interact with humans,\u201d I lied. \u201cI had a difficult time controlling myself with the man I danced with.\u201d Part of that was true, and I hoped it covered my fib. While my wolf begged for Adam\u2019s attention, she didn\u2019t like Eve at all. Although we respected her, that didn\u2019t mean we liked her\u2014especially when she was sleeping with the man we wanted.</p><p>\u201cJust make sure you don\u2019t get any ideas. I\u2019ve seen the way you look at him,\u201d Eve snickered. \u201cLike an alpha would waste his time on a mutt.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and held her gaze. Surprise contorted her face when I didn\u2019t cower under her stare. A smile crawled on my lips, and my wolf bristled at our show of strength.</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t mean to interrupt, but Adam needs to speak with you, Eve,\u201d Elle said behind us.</p><p>Eve sneered for a few more seconds before she pushed against me and strolled out of the restroom. My anger seethed at being confronted by Adam\u2019s mate. Turning around, I punched the wall as hard as I could. The tile cracked and fell to the floor. My knuckles broke open and blood trailed down my hand.</p><p>Elle rushed over and led me to the sink where she washed off my hand. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve thought I was moving in on Adam because he danced with me,\u201d I said like it was the most ridiculous thing in the world.</p><p>\u201cYou two did look pretty intimate out there, but she has no room to talk,\u201d Elle snapped her mouth shut and focused her attention on my injury.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Elle glanced up. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything to anybody, got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I was almost giddy about getting dirt on Eve. I restrained the smile that tried to spread across my lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but I overheard Asher saying he thinks Eve is sleeping with another wolf,\u201d Elle whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes him think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, don\u2019t really care,\u201d Elle shrugged. \u201cHow\u2019s about we get you another drink and sing some karaoke? I know the perfect song,\u201d she waggled her eyebrows.</p><p>I laughed and followed her out of the bathroom, all the while thinking about who the wolf was that Eve was seeing behind Adam\u2019s back\u2014if it was true.</p><p>When the D.J called Elle\u2019s and my name, we strolled up to the stage. The pack whooped and hollered. Whistles from admiring men pierced through the noise. I figure those were more for Elle than me. The music for Cowboy Casanova by Carrie Underwood started to play, and I laughed. I could relate to this song on many different levels. Elle started out and I joined in on the chorus. As we danced and sang on the stage, I caught sight of Sawyer standing next to Adam. I made a point to look at them both, but I winked at Sawyer. He screamed, \u201cThat\u2019s my girl!\u201d and Adam shot him a displeased look that made me to grin.</p><p>Elle and I cat walked across the stage working both sides of the crowd like we\u2019d rehearsed it. By the end of the song, we struck a pose and the place erupted in cheers.</p><p>\u201cEncore,\u201d someone yelled. Elle looked at me, pursing her lips. I shrugged my confirmation, and the D.J began another song. This time he played Kerosene by Miranda Lambert. I started the song this time and Elle fell in behind me. When we finished, I had a thin layer of sweat covering my body and needed a drink.</p><p>\u201cGood job, you got some pipes,\u201d Elle said, slinging an arm around my shoulders as we climbed off the stage. We made our way to the bar where we downed a couple cherry bombs. A hand slid around my waist and yanked me into the hard plains of a chest. Glancing over my shoulder, I smiled at Sawyer. He leaned forward and whispered in my ear, \u201cYou were so fucking hot up there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Spinning on the barstool, I faced him. I caught a glimpse of Adam and Eve in the distance. She was plastered against his body, her arms slung around his neck as they kissed. Anger radiated through me. Drawing my attention back to Sawyer, I snaked my hand around his neck and pulled him towards me, where he willingly met my lips.</p><p>\u201cOkay you two, break it up,\u201d Elle said beside us. I began to pull away, but Sawyer lifted me off of the stool and planted one last kiss on my lips. When he released me, I laughed at the hunger in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDown boy,\u201d I teased. It\u2019d been over two years since I\u2019d slept with a man, and only one before him. Having a revved up sex drive may be normal for werewolves but it was still an unusual feeling to a girl as inexperienced as I was. I could understand how some of the woman in our pack bent under the pressure of their desires. It wasn\u2019t an easy thing to tame.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s about we head home,\u201d Sawyer waggled his eyebrows and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I replied, my voice husky. When Sawyer\u2019s eyebrows arched in surprise, I laughed. \u201cYou can take a cold shower, and I\u2019ll go to sleep.\u201d Sawyer\u2019s excitement vanished and both Elle and I giggled.</p><p>It was almost midnight and the night left me tired and angry. I had fun with Sawyer and Elle, but my interactions with Eve and Adam left a lot to be desired. With one quick glance in my alpha\u2019s direction, I hopped off the barstool and followed Sawyer out to his truck. Someone grabbed my shoulder. I whirled around and full out growled. My wolf didn\u2019t like being surprised, someone was liable to lose a hand. When I faced my assailant, I saw Tim. His eyebrows crawled up his forehead while his eyes shot wide. My wolf wasn\u2019t happy to see the human again.</p><p>\u201cHey is everything okay?\u201d Sawyer asked.</p><p>\u201cS-sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to startle you. You dropped this,\u201d Tim stammered. I looked at the wallet he held out and grabbed it a little rougher than what was considered polite.</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I turned on my heel and hopped into Sawyer\u2019s truck.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>I ran through town on a mission. The wind whipped against my fur as I stalked closer to my prey. When I got to Weston\u2019s, the parking lot was nearly empty. I sauntered over to the dumpster and waited for the one I came for. A few people stumbled out to their cars, and I itched to take them down. But they weren\u2019t the ones I was after.</p><p>The man I\u2019d danced with finally emerged from the bar, and my wolf shot to her feet. I flicked a glance around the parking lot to make sure we were alone. When I was satisfied that it was just me and him, I trotted closer. He walked to his truck. He couldn\u2019t hear my soft footsteps behind him.</p><p>Saliva filled my mouth as I envisioned my teeth sinking into his jugular. Just as he stuck his key in the door, I jumped, landing on his back. He let out a scream that was like music to my ears. He shook his body from side to side to try and fling me off, but I was stronger than him. With one hard yank, I ripped his shoulder open, and he fell to his knees. He writhed on the ground, eyes wide and tears streaming down his face. Normally, I liked to take my time with a kill, but we were in public.</p><p>Standing over him, I struck his throat. My teeth buried deep in his flesh until I felt bone beneath them. With a hard snap, I broke his neck and shivered in delight as the blood filled my mouth.</p> <p>I popped up in bed covered in sweat. My heart pounded from the vivid dream. The sun streamed into my bedroom and reminded me that it wasn\u2019t real. I didn\u2019t rip a man\u2019s throat out and give in to my inner beast, or did I? Had it been my dream? Was my wolf side able to dream? She didn\u2019t like Tim approaching us last night.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d Elle called</p><p>Shrugging off my worries, I stepped out of bed and headed into the kitchen. Elle and Sawyer stood in the living room. Sawyer\u2019s eyes smiled as they roamed up and down my body. Elle smirked and nodded towards me. Looking down, I was dressed in my bra and underwear. I must have shucked my clothes and hopped into bed last night. While the pack didn\u2019t think nudity was a big deal, they knew I did. Granted I wasn\u2019t naked, but I was close enough I felt uncomfortable under Sawyer\u2019s hungry gaze.</p><p>\u201cGo get a dictionary and look up the word gentleman,\u201d I told Sawyer as I padded back to my bedroom to get dressed. I slipped into a pair of sweats and pulled a t-shirt over my head. When I returned to the living room, Sawyer was reading something on his phone.</p><p>\u201cGentleman,\u201d he began. \u201cIt says here on this thingamajig that it means a polite and cultured man that behaves with courtesy and thoughtfulness,\u201d Sawyer said in a hillbilly voice and then looked up at me. \u201cWhy\u2019d you wanna know? You trying to extend your vocabulary?\u201d He cocked his head to the side and gave me his best confused look.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible,\u201d I told him, and then set out for the kitchen to find breakfast. Sawyer and Elle followed me. Grabbing some leftover steak, I made my way to the table and sat. I was unusually hungry today; maybe the dream had awakened my appetite.</p><p>\u201cYou know, showing appreciation to such a beautiful body could be considered thoughtful.\u201d Sawyer\u2019s eyes roamed the length of my body. \u201cJust think of all the women out there who are ignored by their significant others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my significant other,\u201d I said around a mouthful of food.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I doubt you\u2019ll ever be,\u201d Elle chimed in. \u201cAnna has taste.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer gave her a displeased look, and both Elle and I burst out laughing. Sawyer was a nice enough guy, but I wasn\u2019t ready to settle down and have puppies\u2014er babies\u2014with him. I was only twenty-three and still getting used to my new life.</p><p>\u201cAw, you know we\u2019re kidding,\u201d I told him to ease his mind.</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d Elle muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous,\u201d Sawyer said to Elle and was answered with a kick under the table. Sawyer laughed, and Elle stood up to get a cup of coffee. I doubted Elle was jealous Sawyer was courting me.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, the reason I came by was to see if you wanted to go fishing with me. I\u2019m headed up to Tie Hack.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t. I have chores to do,\u201d I told him with a smile. I only got one night off, and of course, it wasn\u2019t on the weekend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Adam wouldn\u2019t mind if you ignored your chores to go with me.\u201d Sawyer winked.</p><p>\u201cWhat wouldn\u2019t I mind?\u201d a deep baritone asked. Sawyer and I turned to see Adam\u2019s displeased look. His hair was slightly messy and his button down shirt was undone so his muscular chest was in full view. I trailed my eyes down his impressive physique and bit my lip when I saw the V his muscles formed by his waistband. A trail of dark hair led below his jeans.</p><p>Elle and Sawyer lowered their eyes, and I gazed up at Adam before I remembered I should lower mine too. He grinned at my appreciation of his body, causing my cheeks to burn crimson. Snapping my stare to the floor, I silently cursed myself. I made a promise to myself last night that I wouldn\u2019t show any interest in Adam again. I\u2019d continue to be his workhorse and only speak to him when spoken to. His appearance today threw all my plans out the window. It wasn\u2019t easy to ignore a man as beautiful as Adam.</p><p>\u201cI asked Anna if she wanted to go to Tie Hack with me to go fishing,\u201d Sawyer answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd talking her into shunning her duties in the process,\u201d Adam remarked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I planned on helping her make them up later today,\u201d Sawyer said and looked at me out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>\u201cWell, I need to speak with Anna alone. Sawyer, why don\u2019t you grab some of the other guys, go fishing, and tonight we\u2019ll feast on your catch. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d</p><p>Elle and Sawyer scampered out of the kitchen. Adam scooted a chair close to mine and sat so our legs were touching. My wolf bristled in excitement at the closeness of our alpha, causing heat to flood my body.</p><p>With the tip of his pointer finger, Adam tipped my chin upwards so he could look into my eyes. I could drown in his sapphire gaze and not care. Every part of me craved him, and I hated it.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do last night, Anna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I whispered, too struck by his closeness to speak normal.</p><p>\u201cI saw you kiss him,\u201d Adam admitted, his voice growing hard. \u201cSo, I ask again, what happened when he drove you home?\u201d</p><p>I shifted my eyes, unsure as to whether I should lie and say I\u2019d slept with Sawyer, or tell Adam the truth. If he thought I\u2019d slept with him he\u2019d be pissed, but maybe he\u2019d lose interest in me. My wolf whined at the thought of our alpha not paying her attention. I stamped down her disappointment and looked back at Adam.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? He is the one who claimed me, who had the balls to announce to the pack he wanted me,\u201d I bit out. Once the words left my lips I regretted them. I was toeing a very dangerous line. Not to mention a fair thing to say. My frustration with Adam caused my bitchiness to show itself sometimes.</p><p>He sat back and let out a deep, annoyed breath. \u201cDamn it, Anna. I can\u2019t offer you what you want, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want you with anyone else. I\u2019m offering as much of myself as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re offering me your dick, and while I have a strong sexual appetite, it\u2019s not the only thing I want from a man. I want a relationship between equals. I don\u2019t want to sneak around,\u201d I paused my rant. \u201cDo you think I want to spend the rest of my life as a mistress?\u201d Not that I\u2019d be his mistress forever. He\u2019d eventually grow tired of me and move onto the next. \u201cPlease let this go. Besides, it seemed Eve was fully capable of pleasing you last night,\u201d I snipped as I remembered her arms wrapped around his neck and her lips plastered to his. My wolf wanted to rip her to shreds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see I\u2019m not the only one jealous.\u201d Adam laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous, just stating the facts,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Adam said unconvinced. He leaned forward so his lips were mere millimeters from mine. \u201cI can\u2019t let this go because I want you so damn bad. Seeing you last night in those skimpy clothes left me with a permanent hard on all night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam pushed his legs between mine. His hands gripped my waist, and in one fluid motion, he lifted me and sat me on his lap. Tangling his hand in my hair, he brought my face closer to his. As his lips made contact with mine, my entire body became ravenous for him. I grabbed onto his hair and devoured his mouth. His excitement pushed against my sweats, my panties moistened in response.</p><p>Adams hands cupped my ass and rocked me against his erection that strained to break free. I moaned against his lips, ready for him to take me on the kitchen table, damn the consequences.</p><p>His hand ripped away my sweats, and when I heard the clicking of his zipper, my eyes snapped open. The kitchen was gone and in its place was my bedroom. When in the hell had that happened? The door was closed and Adam stood over me shirtless and ready for action. His eyes blazed with a fire that scorched me, and if I allowed this to continue, I\u2019d be a pile of ashes by the end. I\u2019d lose myself and my freedom. Once my wolf got a taste of what she craved, she\u2019d demand it again and again, leaving me the very thing I didn\u2019t want to become\u2014a mistress.</p> <p>Adam leaned down on the bed so his body was on mine and kissed me again. His hand trailed south, and I yelped when he\u2019d found what he was looking for.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said against his lips.</p><p>Adam paused. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d I shoved against him and scurried out from under his weight. My wolf was not a happy camper. She whined for completion and made me want to say screw it\u2014or screw him rather. This wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d reined her in and refused her the comfort of a man, and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. It was a constant battle.</p><p>Adam grumbled. \u201cIt seemed like you were enjoying it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe wolf enjoyed it,\u201d I remarked and grabbed for my blankets to cover myself.</p><p>\u201cYour wolf isn\u2019t separate from you, Anna. You are the wolf,\u201d Adam explained, a little annoyed by my disconnection with my inner beast. \u201cIt\u2019s just a new sensation, and you haven\u2019t connected with the change yet.\u201d Adam tugged his jeans up and grabbed for his shirt. \u201cYou can tell yourself that it\u2019s the wolf who wants to be with me, but you\u2019re the only one who believes that lie.\u201d Without another word, Adam walked out.</p><p>The sun beat down on me while I drove the riding lawnmower around the yard. The interaction with Adam left me frustrated and in a foul mood. Having someone you want offer a portion of themselves to you was torture. I knew he was mated to Eve, but I didn\u2019t care. I wanted all of him.</p><p>When two werewolves wanted the same female, they\u2019d fight and the winner won the female. Sometimes those fights ended in death, but nine times out of ten, they didn\u2019t. I was so angry with my frustrated libido that I daydreamed about fighting to the death with Eve. Dreaming about it was all I could do. She\u2019s the alpha which meant she was stronger. Fighting with her would result in my death, and I wasn\u2019t ready to die just yet.</p><p>What about Sawyer? I thought. He\u2019s cute, strong, and he\u2019s free. He\u2019d be mine. A girl could only take so many cold showers before she invited someone in to share one with her. Sawyer made me laugh and even surprised me by being a good kisser. Kissing was a must. If a man couldn\u2019t make me weak in the knees with his lips, then chances were he couldn\u2019t perform in other areas either. That was some advice a friend of mine gave me and it\u2019d just stuck. I wasn\u2019t very experienced in that area. I remember kissing this guy who slobbered all over my face and I was instantly put off sexually. Inexperienced or not, no one wants to be slobbered on.</p><p>I\u2019d eventually give into my ache, and when I did, I didn\u2019t want to regret my choice. As much as I wanted to be with Adam, I knew I would regret it. I\u2019d devour him, get drunk on his affection, and then have a killer hangover in the morning\u2014no thank you.</p> <p>An hour later, I parked the riding lawnmower in the shed and made my way around the house. Sawyer, Joe, Mark, and Allen pulled up in a truck. Sawyer had his arm hanging out of the window, and a smile lit his face when he saw me. The boys hopped out of the truck, fishing supplies and three stringers full of fish in hand.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019ll eat tonight,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDid you doubt my manly talents?\u201d Sawyer asked as he walked up to me. A small part of me was riddled with guilt over almost having sex with Adam this morning. I could see genuine interest in Sawyer\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Leaning down, Sawyer brought his lips to mine. I returned his kiss and laughed when the boys started whooping and hollering.</p><p>\u201cGet a room, you two,\u201d Joe teased.</p><p>\u201cScrew that, They\u2019re fine right where they are,\u201d Mark interjected.</p><p>\u201cOur little Anna isn\u2019t going to mate in front of us. She\u2019s too shy for that,\u201d Allen replied.</p><p>I broke away from Sawyer and gave each of them a pointed look. \u201cYa\u2019ll are a bunch of perverted dogs.\u201d</p> <p>They all howled in unison causing me to bust out laughing. \u201cGive me those.\u201d I grabbed for the fish and headed back around the house. A small table was set up for this very reason.</p><p>Grabbing a filet knife, I cleaned the rainbow trout. Sawyer walked into the backyard and wrapped his arms around my waist. Resting his chin on my shoulder, he watched me gut the fish.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked with pretend innocence.</p><p>\u201cAre you warming up to me? I was sure when you kissed me last night it was because you were drunk. But I don\u2019t smell alcohol on your breath today.\u201d</p><p>I was quiet for a moment. Had I kissed him because I was warming up to him? Or had the kiss been because I was sexually frustrated? It was a result of both. I laid the knife down and turned around to face him.</p><p>\u201cI may be warming up to you.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s smile widened to showcase twin rows of white teeth.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be your mate,\u201d I told him before he could get any ideas.</p><p>His smile faltered.</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell do you want a mate anyway? None of the other men want to settle down.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer shrugged. \u201cMaybe they haven\u2019t found anyone worth settling down for. I\u2019ve liked you since you came here, Anna, and I knew we\u2019d be great together. Why wouldn\u2019t I wanna settle down with someone like you?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t the romantic type of girl. I didn\u2019t care for cheesy romantic comedies or Valentine\u2019s Day. But, his words left me momentarily speechless and awkward. Deep down I think I wanted to meet someone special. It just hadn\u2019t happened yet and that left me critical to relationships and mushiness.</p><p>How did I respond to his comment when I didn\u2019t feel the same? The fact that he saw something in me that he thought he could live with for forever was unsettling. Commitments scared the living hell out of me. Here was a guy who wanted to be with me, who wanted to share all of himself with me, and yet all I could think of was why couldn\u2019t Adam say those words? He apparently wanted me too, so why couldn\u2019t he be with me. If what Elle said was true, and Eve was cheating on him, then I shouldn\u2019t of held an ounce of guilt over wanting their relationship to end. I was not a home wrecker, but they didn\u2019t exactly live in a happy home from what I saw.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d</p><p>I looked up and into Sawyer\u2019s eyes. He\u2019s here and willing, why not? Don\u2019t waste your time on something you can\u2019t have, Anna.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sawyer. That was one of the sweetest things I\u2019ve ever heard. You\u2019re either really good at conning women, or I\u2019m a fool.\u201d I laughed nervously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie. I really do like you, Anna, but I don\u2019t want to get invested if you\u2019re not willing to return those feelings.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip. \u201cWe\u2019ll date and see how it goes, but I\u2019m not ready to get married and have babies. That\u2019s all I can give you for now.\u201d</p><p>The smile returned to Sawyer\u2019s face. \u201cSounds like a plan, ma\u2019 lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork.\u201d</p><p>After dinner we all gathered around a bonfire. Sawyer brought his guitar and sang songs while we drank beer and socialized. I had to admit that learning Sawyer played guitar and sang made my panties wet. I had a thing for musicians.</p><p>Adam didn\u2019t even glance in my direction, which both disappointed and excited me. I\u2019d been having a mental conversation all night on how I would focus on Sawyer and forget Adam existed.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Sawyer said and everyone quieted to look at him. \u201cI have a special melody for my little lady, Anna.\u201d Everyone looked at me, sans Adam, and I buried my face in my hands. Sawyer strummed his guitar and sang Must Be Doin\u2019 Something Right by Billy Currington. His voice was low and husky as his emerald eyes focused on me. My panties went from moist to soaking wet in 0.2 seconds. I didn\u2019t care that more than twenty wolves were present; I was ready to tackle him to the ground and have my way with him.</p><p>When the song was over, the pack broke out into a chant. \u201cKiss..kiss...kiss.\u201d I rose from the hay bale I\u2019d been sitting on and walked the short distance to Sawyer. Sitting on his lap, I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him like my life depended on it. Chills radiated up my thighs and traveled to the spot I\u2019d been neglecting. The man could kiss! The pack clapped and whistled as Sawyer and I forgot about the world.</p><p>\u201cSawyer, I do believe you\u2019ll be the first to tame that girl,\u201d Joe laughed.</p><p>We broke the kiss, Sawyer wrapping an arm around my waist. \u201cI should get a trophy.\u201d Sawyer laughed, and I punched him in the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s \u2018bout it, Adam. Should we erect a bronze statue in Sawyer\u2019s honor for taming the elusive Anna?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Adam shot Sawyer and me a look, anger evident in his eyes. The emotion fled as soon as it came. He turned to look at Joe and said, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t trapped her yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s come the closest,\u201d Asher commented.</p><p>\u201cWill everyone stop talking about me like I\u2019m not here, geez!\u201d I said.</p><p>Adam rose and walked away without another word. The pack mates didn\u2019t seem to mind, but I knew the reason behind his early departure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The pack went back to talking amongst themselves, telling jokes and stories.</p><p>\u201cWill you come with me somewhere?\u201d Sawyer whispered into my ear.</p><p>I arched an eyebrow and nodded.</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>Sawyer and I made our way through the dense pine trees. The moon was high in the sky and bathed the landscape in its buttery glow. Crickets chirped and the wind serenaded the night as it rushed through the tree limbs. He led me by the hand to a small lake hid away from the world. Nestled by rock and trees, it was secluded. The view of the mountains and moon reflected on the still water. In the mountains it was pitch dark. No annoying city lights to ruin the beauty. The stars were huge diamonds in the sky and seemed so close that all I\u2019d have to do is reach my hand up to touch them.</p><p>We stopped walking by the water\u2019s edge, and he turned towards me. The look in his eyes was one I\u2019d come to recognize\u2014hunger. With a soft hand, he brushed away strands of my hair, his fingers causing chills. His green eyes gleamed with mischief and the smirk that lifted his lips was sexy as hell. His hair was perfectly mussed, and he licked his full lips as his hand trailed down to my shoulder.</p><p>Tonight would be different. I wanted Sawyer, needed him to satisfy the building ache I\u2019d been ignoring for so long. I needed his strong hands on my body, gripping my hips, and driving into me fast and hard. My wolf perked up in anticipation, sending my building desire over the edge I was tiptoeing. Once I gave myself to Sawyer, my mysterious taboo would dissolve. Men would see it was possible to get between my legs and come for me. I brushed the pesky thought away and focused on the moment.</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s fingers grasped the hem of my shirt and trailed it up my body and over my head. His surprise that I\u2019d allow him to do it showed in his eyes. I smirked, wrapped a hand around his neck, and guided his sexy lips towards mine. My breasts smashed against his chest, the sensation of my excited nipples rubbing against his cotton t-shirt was enough to drive me insane.</p> <p>Wrapping an arm around my waist, Sawyer hoisted me up and closer to his body. He was a quite a bit taller than me so my feet dangled in the air for a while before he set me back down. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you wanna do this?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re a gentleman after all.\u201d I tugged at the bottom of his shirt, and he obliged by pulling it over his head. My eyes became hooded as I saw his impressive chest. Every inch of it was made of muscular ridges. Trailing a hand over his six pack, I devoured the feel of him beneath my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d I whispered as I stared.</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d he responded. Sawyer looked out at the lake and then down at me. \u201cYou wanna go swimming?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Had I misread the situation? I was ready for flesh to flesh and to finally get release. Sawyer chuckled at my expression. \u201cI want to take my time, enjoy this moment. When tomorrow comes, you may run like a scared deer. I want to use every second of tonight to enjoy you.\u201d</p><p>If he kept talking like that, I wouldn\u2019t need him inside of me to find release. I was dangerously close to becoming one of those girls who swooned at the first sight of a cockeyed grin and shimmering eyes. Maybe my neglected libido turned me into a needy woman. I'd correct that tonight.</p> <p>I looked up at the moon and then back at Sawyer. \u201cYou have five hours until daybreak. Do your best.\u201d</p><p>We stripped down to our underwear and walked into the lake. It was cold compared to the other lakes because the runoff of the melting snow drained in it. The frigid water didn\u2019t affect us though, we ran a little hotter than normal. I dove down and submerged my body and when I popped back up, Sawyer was gone. Wading, I searched the space for him. When I thought he\u2019d hightailed it and left me hanging, two arms snatched me from behind.</p><p>Turning me around, Sawyer kissed me again. His lips were sure to reduce me to a pile of goo. I ran my fingers through his wet hair and trailed them down his expansive shoulders. I could feel his erection pressing against his underwear, and I moaned as I envisioned it driving into me. I wanted to beg and plead for him to rush this moment, but I liked men who took control. I\u2019d bide my time and wait for Sawyer to claim me, even if it frustrated my impatient need.</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s hand disappeared under the water, his fingers finding refuge between my legs. Ripping my underwear away, he buried two fingers deep inside of me, and I choked on my moans. Holding onto him with an arm around his neck, I gyrated my hips in sync with his movement, heat building until I was breathless. My release came quickly, but my body craved more. I dipped a hand below the water and cupped his bulge.</p><p>If I\u2019d know what was waiting down there, I would\u2019ve given in three dates ago.</p><p>Sawyer groaned as I massaged him, and then swooped me up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re a little impatient, so how about we take this to more solid ground?\u201d He laughed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need slow. I need fast and hard.\u201d I winked at him.</p><p>He rushed to the shoreline and once we were back on the ground, he set me down. \u201cYour wish is my command, pretty lady.\u201d He shucked his boxers, and I had a nice view of what awaited me. I almost jumped for joy!</p><p>Sawyer lay in the grass and motioned for me. Without a second thought, I climbed atop him and moaned as his long shaft buried itself within me. I rode him hard, bracing myself on his pecs. His hands rested on my hips and moved me against his hardness. Sitting up, he took my breasts in his mouth and twirled his tongue around my nipple.</p><p>\u201cYou like it rough, huh?\u201d He teased.</p><p>\u201cTonight I do,\u201d I said against his lips. His emerald eyes glinted and his hands lifted me and drove me hard against him over and over. As Sawyer continued to drive into me, I glanced over his shoulder with hooded eyes. A black wolf stood not thirty feet away, its citrine stare glued to us. Something about Adam watching us ignited the fire that burned within me. I locked eyes with him and rode Sawyer, trailing my nails up his back and kissing his neck.</p><p>An orgasm shot through my body, ricocheting through my bones. Sawyer found his release moments after. Our bodies\u2019 slick with sweat, we stayed embraced in each other\u2019s arms for a while. I peeked over Sawyer\u2019s shoulder to see Adam but he\u2019d disappeared. A twinge of guilt struck me but I ignored it. Wasn\u2019t I supposed to be dating Sawyer?</p><p>\u201cThat was so fucking good,\u201d Sawyer said against my skin. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll give me the chance to experience it again.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cAre you always thinking about the future?\u201d I didn\u2019t see the future, only the now. My parents had a happy marriage, so I didn\u2019t understand my reservations towards commitment. I never dated anyone longer than a month before I found a reason to break things off. While I enjoyed Sawyer, I didn\u2019t want to pick out our China pattern.</p><p>\u201cWhen that future means I\u2019ll be spending time between your legs, then yes I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see how things go,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Sawyer was quiet for a moment. I giggled and he leaned back on his arms to look at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...usually, it\u2019s the woman pressuring the man to commit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying we should get married tomorrow, but I do want to continue seeing you and see where it goes,\u201d he paused. \u201cI guess what I\u2019m saying is, after our five dates are up, are you going to be done with me? Are you only here because our Adam demanded it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answered truthfully and then scrambled to explain when Sawyer frowned. \u201cThe main reason I agreed to date you is because he threatened that if I didn\u2019t, he\u2019d give me to Luke the kook. But I slept with you because of your wily charm and gorgeous, good-looks. Plus singing to me loosened my grip on my panties.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer snorted and I smiled in response. His smile, like everything else about him, was beautiful. I began to climb off of him to get dressed, but before I could grab my clothes, Sawyer reached for my arm and pressed me against his hard body to begin the seduction all over. \u201cI still have four hours left.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cAnna, get up!\u201d Elle yelled as she pounded on my bedroom door. I grumbled and pulled myself out of bed. I spent all night with Sawyer, not getting home until the sun peeked over the mountains. The thought of my night brought a smile to my tired body. Stop it! Sex is like breathing for a werewolf. Ignoring my inner dialect, I headed out to find Elle. What I found was a house full of werewolves. The scent of bacon, eggs, sausage, and pancakes filled the space as everyone circled around the island to fill their plates.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked Elle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Adam called an emergency meeting.\u201d</p><p>The notion of seeing him again made me anxious. He saw what I did last night, and it was only a matter of time before he pulled me aside and chewed me out for giving up the very thing he\u2019d been trying to get. He only wants me because he can\u2019t have me. I trudged into the kitchen and poured a cup of coffee. Hugging the warm mug, I leaned against the wall and tried not to fall asleep. The clock on the stove said it was 7:00 a.m., so I got two hours of sleep.</p><p>I caught Sawyer\u2019s gaze across the room. He winked and began to close the space between us, but at that moment, Adam and Eve walked into the house. Everyone stopped what they were doing to show respect to the alpha couple.</p><p>\u201cYou can eat later,\u201d Adam said huffily. \u201cEveryone in the living room now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in a foul mood,\u201d Elle whispered.</p><p>I nodded, but didn\u2019t comment. I had a sneaking suspicion why.</p><p>We filed into the living room. Sawyer made his way over to where I stood behind the couch. His hand rubbed against mine while he stared forward. I restrained my smile.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been another murder,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Another murder?</p><p>He held up a newspaper, and a black and white photograph of a familiar face stared back at me. I swallowed around the lump that formed in my throat. I dreamt about killing him, and now he was dead. My heartbeat echoed in my eardrums as I tried to make sense of what Adam was saying.</p><p>\u201cTim Emerson was attacked Friday night in the parking lot of Weston\u2019s. The same night we were there. The officials are saying a mountain lion must have wandered into town, but I think we all know it wasn\u2019t a cat that did this.\u201d Adam flicked his gaze around the room and finally settled on my face. I dropped my eyes and tried to slow the pounding of my heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI believe this was the man that danced with you, Anna?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head rapidly, unable to speak. I hadn\u2019t told anyone about the dream, and now I never would. It was too much of a coincidence for it not to be connected. Did I kill him? Did my wolf take over and the only recollection I held was what I thought was a dream?</p><p>\u201cDid you speak to him after the dance?\u201d Adam asked, his voice hard.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was leaving...I dropped my wallet and he gave it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I was there, and we left right after,\u201d Sawyer added.</p><p>Adam gave him a murderous glare. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I spoke to you.\u201d I curled my fingers around his hand and gave a gentle squeeze. Sawyer dropped his gaze and remained silent. He didn\u2019t know Adam\u2019s attitude was because of me.</p><p>\u201cAnna, everyone saw how you reacted to him. Clearly, you\u2019re not ready to be around humans,\u201d Eve interjected and was rewarded with a growl from Adam.</p><p>\u201cThe last time this happened it was the results of a rogue wolf. We\u2019re not accusing you, Anna, but it doesn\u2019t look good that you were the last to see him alive.\u201d Adam was silent for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll be assigning each of you to a group. You\u2019ll scour the mountain and see if you can find any trace of a trespasser. This will be our base to report back to. Anna, you\u2019ll stay here with me. You\u2019ll be under close watch until we have proof of your innocence. Eve has the lists.\u201d Adam motioned for me to follow him upstairs.</p> <p>I was under house arrest with Adam as my warden? Giving Sawyer one last look, I followed Adam to the second floor. The house was around five thousand square feet, so there was definitely space for privacy should one need it. With a pounding heart, I entered the office that Adam disappeared into. He shut the door, and I braced myself for his punishment.</p><p>He walked over to the desk and sat on the edge. I remained by the door, not sure what I should say or do. His blonde hair hung over his eye when he looked up at me. The V-neck t-shirt he wore allowed me to see his sculpted pecs. The muscles in his arms flexed as he gripped the desk.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I stood frozen in my place. My wolf wanted to go to him, but I wanted to stay as far away as possible.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, outstretching his arm towards me.</p><p>With hesitant steps, I moved closer. When I was standing within reach, he grabbed onto my hand and tugged my body between his legs. His arms encircled my waist, and he trailed his nosed between my breasts. My wolf begged for him, and I cursed the bitch. We were sated last night, more than once! How can you still be horny? I was sure that once I slept with Sawyer, she\u2019d be happy as a clam and the attraction to Adam wouldn\u2019t be as strong. But it seemed stronger now.</p> <p>Adam looked up, his blue eyes pleading for me, softening my heart. I trailed my fingers through his hair, and he closed his eyes at my touch. I was surprised he was still interested knowing that another man had me. My plan backfired.</p><p>With a gentle hand, he steered my face towards his and pressed a soft kiss on my lips. Passion boiled to the surface, my hormones screaming for attention. Now that I was a wolf, I felt like an addict. My body demanded sex, needed it with a fury I didn\u2019t understand. If I was going to sleep with a man, it\u2019d only be one at a time. But how will I know what I like if I don\u2019t sample them all? I thought about that for a minute before I squashed it. I was more human than wolf, or at least I was trying to be. In human terms, sleeping with multiple men would qualify me as a slut. As a wolf, it was just another day, another bed, and another man. The two ideals contradicted each other so harshly that my mind was one big ball of confusion. To screw or not to screw? That seemed to always be the question.</p><p>\u201cWhen he was inside of you, did you wish it was me?\u201d Adam whispered, glancing up at me. \u201cDid you envision my hands on your body?\u201d He ran his hands down my arms and a shiver skipped up my spine. \u201cWas it my face you saw when you looked at him? Rode him? Kissed him?\u201d Adam spoke so soft that his words had more of an impact. I could feel the caress of his eyes as they roamed over my body.</p><p>Adam slipped a hand under my shorts. \u201cDid he make you as wet as I do?\u201d His fingers buried themselves in me, and I gasped as the friction amped up my ever present desire. \u201cWas it my cock you craved?\u201d Adam moved his hand faster, and I clasped his shoulder to steady myself. We kept eye contact the entire time, too lost in each other\u2019s gaze to look away. \u201cDid you scream for me in your head? Did you picture me slamming into you, filling you?\u201d Adam pulled my tank top down to expose my breast, his tongue flicking my nipple. \u201cWas it my mouth you wanted on your skin? Did you wish it was me between your legs?\u201d His movements grew faster and faster until an orgasm shot through me, leaving my legs wobbly like two wet noodles. \u201cDoes he satisfy your inner beast the way I do?\u201d Adam withdrew his fingers and kissed me hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have all of you, Anna, and make you forget him,\u201d he said against my mouth. His dominance was sexy as hell. I wanted to rip his clothes off and have him pound into me from behind while he fisted my hair and showed me who was boss. A smile curled his lips in victory. My shield crumbled to the floor as he walked out of the room and left me stunned.</p><p>A few hours later, I showered and dressed for the day. The pack members were out trying to pick up the scent of another wolf. I thought about my dream and wondered if it was possible that I could kill someone and not remember it. The dream had been so real, to the point of being able to taste the blood and feel the bone snap. I shuddered as the memory flicked through my mind.</p><p>Filling a plate with food, I sat at the kitchen table. My intimate moment with Adam scorched my nerves and left me hyperaware of his presence. It was just the two of us in the house. Even Eve went with the rest of the pack. I wondered if that was her decision or Adam\u2019s. Adam sauntered into the kitchen, sparing me a look. The smug smile on his lips was both sexy and infuriating. He knew he\u2019d gotten to me. If I decided to remain strong in my decision to stay away from him, I\u2019d have to put up four foot thick cement walls around my hungry libido.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy the show last night?\u201d I asked as I took a bite of pancake. Adam turned around and crossed his arms across his chest. Before I became a wolf I would\u2019ve never thought I\u2019d enjoy an audience when I slept with a man, but seeing Adam heightened the experience.</p> <p>\u201cI enjoyed the look of boredom on your face,\u201d Adam remarked with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cI was not bored! In fact, Sawyer entertained me several times.\u201d I laughed when the smug smile fell off of his lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you challenging me to show you what real entertainment feels like?\u201d Adam quirked an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo, just stating the facts. I\u2019ve been missing out this whole time. Sex as a werewolf is powerful stuff.\u201d And it was. Sex as a human was good, but sex as a werewolf was amazing. All of my senses were amplified, causing the surge of an orgasm to feel like pure heaven.</p><p>Adam closed the space between us, grabbed my wrist, and drew me to my feet. \u201cGood God, woman, you won\u2019t be happy until you\u2019ve ruined all of me.\u201d His lips found mine and just as he was about to tear through my clothes like a kid on Christmas morning, I stopped him. Fury blazed in his cobalt eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a one-man woman,\u201d I told him and sat back down. My wolf growled at me, but inside, I did a happy dance that I stood up to him this time. Adam ran a hand through his hair and took the seat opposite of me. If looks could kill, I\u2019d be dead.</p><p>\u201cSo, about these previous murders,\u201d I changed the subject. \u201cWhen did they happen?\u201d</p><p>Adam regarded me for a while, his eyes trailing towards my chest and then snapping back up. \u201cThree months ago there were a string of animal attacks. You may have read about it in the newspaper. They sent hunters into the mountains, sure that there was a bear or mountain lion killing hikers.\u201d</p><p>The food in my stomach turned sour. \u201cI was supposed to die that day,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cThat\u2019s how you know it\u2019s a wolf doing this?\u201d I looked up. Flashes of my attack bombarded my mind. I still couldn\u2019t put the incoherent pieces together and form a distinct memory of the event.</p><p>Adam nodded. \u201cAside from the obvious marks that clearly were from a werewolf, I smelt a wolf on you. It was faint so you must\u2019ve been in the forest for a while before I stumbled upon you. That and the fact there\u2019d been a string of other hikers found mauled just days before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said thank you for saving me,\u201d I told him. If it wasn\u2019t for him, I\u2019d be just another body found in the woods. He could\u2019ve left me for dead. I\u2019d been confused and a bit pissed about becoming a werewolf that I hadn\u2019t taken a moment to step back and consider the other possibility. No matter how much I struggled with taming the wolf, I was happy to be alive.</p><p>\u201cThanks are not necessary. The only reason I brought you back here was so the hunters wouldn\u2019t find another body and continue to search. It was to protect my pack,\u201d Adam stated.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not to say I\u2019m not happy you survived the bite. I wasn\u2019t sure you would, your heartbeat was just a slight tapping in your chest. I don\u2019t know why the wolf that attacked you didn\u2019t finish the job, but you\u2019re one lucky woman.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s me, lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Sawyer,\u201d Adam said, switching the topic back to waters I didn\u2019t want to tread.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d I smiled and then chided myself. It seemed that happened at the mention of his name or if I thought about him. Have great sex and now you\u2019re a sappy mess!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m releasing you from your remaining dates,\u201d Adam said like this information would be music to my ears.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because he\u2019s your competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the alpha. I don\u2019t have competition.\u201d He gave me a piercing look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not some shiny new toy you can steal so none of the other boys play with it. I\u2019m a grown ass woman, and if I want to continue seeing Sawyer, and screwing him, then I will. I respect you, Adam, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to spread my legs for you. You\u2019re mated to Eve, and the strong animalistic pull we have towards each other won\u2019t change that.\u201d I glared at him before I\u2019d realized what I\u2019d said. No matter how laid back he seemed around me, he was still my alpha and talking back to him wasn\u2019t wise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I heard the groan of wood under Adam\u2019s heavy grasp and then a loud crack as the arm of the chair broke off. Adam glared at me with such anger my wolf whimpered. My eyes went wide when Adam shot up and the kitchen table went flying across the room where it crashed against the wall.</p><p>I jumped out of my chair and crouched on the floor\u2014the equivalent of tucking my tail between my legs and exposing my stomach. Adam was pissed, and if I didn\u2019t play what little cards I still held, I\u2019d end up at the wrong end of his sharp teeth. Werewolf men\u2019s anger was on a hair trigger, and a woman talking back was just the touch it needed to go off the deep end. While most men didn\u2019t abuse their women for talking back or having an opinion, Adam didn\u2019t appreciate being disobeyed by anyone\u2014man or woman.</p><p>Adam stood over me, and I waited for my punishment. I anticipated him shifting into wolf form and grasping me by the throat so that I could barely breathe. Instead, he jerked me to my feet, slammed me against the wall, and leaned in so he towered over me.</p> <p>\u201cYou piss me off so fucking much,\u201d he bit out. I kept my eyes to the floor and tried to capture the breath I\u2019d lost. The slam against the wall didn\u2019t hurt, werewolves are difficult to injure. It was the pure essence of him that suffocated me. My alpha was pissed, and that power wrapped around me and demanded submission.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any disrespect.\u201d</p><p>Adam lifted my chin so he could look into my eyes. His stare searched for something on my face. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid of me, Anna. I may talk a big game, but when it comes to you, I\u2019m as dangerous as a kitten,\u201d He took a moment to think. \u201cIt\u2019s a new emotion for me, one that pisses me off actually.\u201d</p><p>I gaped, my mind too confused to form words.</p><p>\u201cI want you, Anna. I\u2019ve always wanted you, but I knew I couldn\u2019t have you. I thought once you mated with Sawyer I\u2019d let the silly notion of me and you go, but seeing him with you, with his hands on your body...I wanted to rip his fucking head off. I deserve you, Anna, and you deserve me. I\u2019m sure that if fate made it to where we could be together, our love would be so fierce they\u2019d talk about it for generations.\u201d His hand cupped my face. \u201cI\u2019m not a silly man. I don\u2019t romanticize life or see the world through rose-colored glasses. I know how ugly the world we live in is, but I think...I know... that if I had you by my side, all the ugliness in the world couldn\u2019t penetrate me. I don\u2019t just want you\u2014I need you.\u201d Adam pushed off of the wall, glanced over his shoulder and left the house, the front door slamming.</p> <p>I slid down the wall, hugging my knees to my chest and replayed every word he said over and over. His eyes were so frail that in that moment, he was just a man voicing his inner thoughts. Not my alpha that growled and snapped when things didn\u2019t go his way. He was vulnerable, something I never expected to associate with such a powerful man.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Three days passed. The pack searched the mountain for signs of the rogue werewolf and always came back without a trace. Adam made himself scarce and wouldn\u2019t even talk to me. I suspected the admittance of his feelings left him a bit embarrassed. Adam was strong, a leader, and that position didn\u2019t include pouring your heart out to a female. Especially when that female was the lowest wolf on the totem pole. I was what they called a mutt, a made werewolf instead of bred. Girls like me didn\u2019t end up with alphas. Yet there was something in my DNA that allowed me to defy my alphas. I wasn\u2019t just an underling like the pack thought. Despite my tainted blood, I was an equal.</p><p>I spent my time on my chores during the day, and at night when I was alone in my bedroom, I\u2019d think about the two handsome wolves who wanted to claim me. Being attracted to two men was hell on my brain. Love didn\u2019t play into the scenario. I didn\u2019t believe in love. It came down to guilt. If I continued seeing Sawyer, I couldn\u2019t give myself to Adam. I couldn\u2019t hurt Sawyer that way. If I gave in to Adam, I\u2019d let myself down. I may not want love, but I still wanted the man I was with to be with only me. I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of Adam leaving my bed to hop into the one he shared with Eve. It made me feel dirty just thinking about it. Still, my qualms did nothing to erase the attraction. He was a big serving of walking, talking sex appeal, and every time I was around him I craved his delectable body.</p><p>I\u2019m a horrible person. Life would be so much easier if I could live on my own like before I became hairy. If I took myself out of the equation, everyone\u2019s life could go back to normal. Sawyer and Adam would forget about me, and I\u2019d be free of their charms. I needed to get out of the house. I\u2019d been cramped up so long the huge place felt like a cardboard box. I needed room to breathe, to run, to feel the wind whip through my fur as I fled as far away from my problems as I could.</p><p>Tiptoeing out of my bedroom, I made my way to the sliding glass doors in the kitchen. With delicate hands, I unlocked the door and shut it quietly behind me. The night was a bit cool, but felt amazing on my heated skin. My wolf scratched at the surface. My bones contorted and shifted as my body changed forms. It only took a few seconds between changes. Once I was on four paws, I bolted from the deck and disappeared into the tree line. I ran without purpose, stretching my muscles against the burn that surged through my blood. Whipping around trees and leaping over large rocks, I pushed forward. The wind ruffled my fur, cooling the heat that rose from my body. I leapt over a downed tree and when I landed, something clamped around my back leg. I yelped in pain and tried to pull free, but whatever had me sunk its teeth in. Turning, I saw the bear trap fastened around my hind leg. I immediately shifted forms and cringed when the pain intensified. Blood seeped down my ankle, the skin torn from my thrashing. Bending over, I used my strength to pry the mouth of the trap open. I slipped my leg out and tried to stand, but the pressure made me collapse.</p> <p>I heaved myself up, using the support of a tree. You\u2019ve stepped in it this time. Just had to sneak out, didn\u2019t you? Leaning against the tree, I took a moment to catch my breath. My eyes scanned the perimeter, seeing only dense forest all around. The trees were so thick that the diamond encrusted sky wasn\u2019t visible. I knew the area around our compound like the back of my hand, and this wasn\u2019t it. I wasn\u2019t sure how long I\u2019d been running before the hunk of metal attacked me. Deciding I needed to move, I hopped from one tree to the next. At this rate, I won\u2019t get home until next week! Lifting my leg up, I inspected the wound. I healed at an exceptional rate, but it wasn\u2019t an instant healing. The wound was deep, and I could see bone through the flaps of skin. It looked like my leg had lost a fight with a meat grinder. It\u2019d take at least a week before the skin and bone healed back to normal\u2014a thought that didn\u2019t help me right now.</p><p>With each hop, electric agony shot up my limb. I gritted my teeth and continued my journey back to the main house. My body grew weak as I trudged on; my movements becoming slower than they already were. For the healing process to begin, I needed sleep. My body was shutting down, and no matter how hard I tried to keep my eyes open, they grew heavier by the second.</p><p>A deer crossed my path, its big brown eyes laughing at the helpless wolf. Even though in human form, the animal knew what I was. I\u2019d killed countless of its brethren. Because God has a sense of humor, the deer stepped closer to me and sniffed my belly and then trotted away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, Bambi,\u201d I said to it as it went about its business. I could feel my energy draining and my legs growing weaker. I slid down the tree I used as a crutch and fell to sleep.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>The man had a gun slung over his shoulder as his flashlight swayed from side to side. I crouched down behind him and waited for him to turn towards me. His walkie talkie chimed, and he pressed the button to speak. \u201cOkay, heading back now.\u201d He didn\u2019t know how wrong he was. As the man turned around, I pounced. My teeth made contact with his throat. With a tug to the right, his blood filled my mouth, causing a shiver of delight to soar through me.</p><p>My eyes snapped open. Daylight caused me to blink a few times. Squinting, I could make out the outline of a man\u2019s face and realized I was being carried.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d I croaked.</p> <p>\u201cShh, save your energy.\u201d</p><p>I nestled against his warmth, my naked body no longer producing the amount of heat I was used to. The jostling of his movements caused the pain to pulse through my leg. Gritting my teeth, I fisted his shirt in my hands and focused on his heavenly scent rather than the fire that crawled up my calf. I must have passed out because when I opened my eyes again, I was laying in my bed. My leg was propped up on pillows and bandaged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d Elle said with a smile and sat on the edge of my bed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She grabbed for a washcloth and trailed it over my forehead, a concerned smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cI need something to drink.\u201d My throat burned. Elle retrieved a glass of water and handed it to me. I gulped the entire contents.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, Anna, what happened?\u201d Sawyer burst through my bedroom door, kneeling beside the bed. His hand cupped my face. As much as I hated the reaction, I blushed at seeing his concern. He placed a kiss on my forehead and held my hand. It\u2019d been almost three days since I\u2019d seen him. Adam kept him busy with tracking.</p><p>\u201cI went for a run,\u201d I began and then looked over when Adam walked through my door. \u201cI needed some air from being cooped up. The hunters must have set traps. I leapt over a downed tree and landed on a bear trap.\u201d</p><p>Elle cringed and Sawyer\u2019s grip on my hand tightened.</p><p>\u201cHave you started healing?\u201d Sawyer asked.</p><p>\u201cI think so. My body shut down in the forest. I tried to hop back, but my strength drained too quickly. I guess I\u2019m lucky our alpha found me and not a hunter or hungry mountain lion.\u201d I looked over at Adam and smiled. He\u2019d saved my life twice now.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak to Anna, and she needs her rest. You guys can see her later,\u201d Adam told Elle and Sawyer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the video store to rent movies. We\u2019re having a girl\u2019s night tonight,\u201d Elle smiled and left my room. Sawyer leaned over me and pressed a soft kiss to my lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think she\u2019ll allow one boy at your girl\u2019s party?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI think I can talk her into it.\u201d Sawyer rose and nodded to Adam as he left. Adam glared at his back and then shut the door, turning the lock. He crossed his arms and watched me. I was dressed now. I wondered if Elle or Adam clothed me.</p><p>\u201cThank you for saving me, again,\u201d I told him. \u201cHow\u2019d you find me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll always find you, Anna.\u201d His voice was soft, but held an edge, a promise. Walking towards me, he placed his arms on either side of me and leaned down. His lips claiming my mouth, separating my lips as his tongue darted out and swirled with mine. The excruciating pain was temporarily forgotten as I lost myself in his kiss. Dear God help me! I\u2019m a fool for this man.</p><p>\u201cThere. Now it\u2019s my taste on your lips,\u201d Adam said with a smirk. \u201cWhat were you thinking going out in the middle of the night when there are hunters on our mountain?\u201d Adam sat up straight, turning his back to me while he rested his elbows on his knees. \u201cDo you have any idea what I thought when I found your naked body splayed on the forest floor?\u201d He looked over his shoulder at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I planned this,\u201d I said, motioning towards my bum leg. Adam was quiet for a while, his muscles tense as he thought about something.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, I need to know why you were really out there\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you, I needed to run. It\u2019d been three days since I shifted, and I was antsy. I didn\u2019t think hunters would be out at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother body was found,\u201d Adam stated. When I didn\u2019t respond, he turned to face me. \u201cTell me you\u2019re not the one killing these men.\u201d</p><p>I gaped at him. \u201cHow could I have killed him when I was passed out in the forest last night?\u201d Although I\u2019d been out of it, the dream I\u2019d had this morning revisited my mind. Was that the man who\u2019d been killed?</p><p>\u201cThe man was a hunter,\u201d Adam said, answering my question. My breath caught in my throat. \u201cI found him not fifty yards from you. His throat was ripped out like the other.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my forehead as if the motion would erase the memory of the dream that stalked my mind. I couldn\u2019t explain any of it, and it\u2019d be only a matter time before all fingers pointed to me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d I muttered, but my voice lacked conviction. Was my wolf so bloodthirsty that she killed two men? Shouldn\u2019t I have some memory of the killings besides the dreams?</p> <p>\u201cAnna, if you\u2019re the one responsible I need to know. If I find out later, I won\u2019t be able to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it. I mean, I don\u2019t think I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean? You either did or didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed a few times before I found the courage to explain. \u201cI had dreams...about the killings. I saw their deaths. The dreams were so lifelike...I could practically taste the blood.\u201d I focused on my hands, too afraid to see what emotion was on Adam\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think you should tell me this when Tim was found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid I\u2019d be accused of murder. I was the last to see him alive, and at the time, I thought it was just a dream,\u201d I paused. \u201cBut now...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Adam released a heavy breath, scrubbed his hands over his face and stood up. He paced my bedroom, the wheels in his mind working overtime to think of a solution. \u201cYou\u2019re not to leave my sight, understand? The only way I can know for sure whether you\u2019re responsible or not is if I\u2019m with you at all times.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to protest, but snapped it shut when Adam glared at me.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not up for discussion. I have a pack to look out for, and if the murders continue, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the police come sniffing our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this has happened before. Isn\u2019t it possible that the same wolf is responsible for the new killings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but we\u2019ve been scouring the mountain for the past few days, and the only scents we\u2019ve picked up are of the pack. You have a strong reaction around humans, so it stands to reason that you could be the culprit.\u201d Adam said.</p><p>As much as I wanted to scream and yell to defend myself, I remained silent. The dreams were too vivid not to be connected, which meant Adam was right\u2014I could be the killer.</p><p>Elle\u2019s girl\u2019s night had two male attendees. Sawyer sat on one side of me, his hand holding mine. While Adam sat on the other side, his hand resting on the couch so that it touched my leg. The living room had a large sectional, enough room to seat eight people comfortably. Adam may have been pissed about the current killings and my possible involvement, but that didn\u2019t distract from his subtle claim of me.</p><p>Elle stretched out on the longer part of the sofa. She\u2019d rented romantic comedies which only made my predicament all the more uncomfortable. I spent the night having Sawyer try to take care of me, offering a blanket when I was cold or drinks when I was thirsty, and Adam sending murderous glares his way. My muscles were so sore from the tension I was sure they\u2019d snap.</p><p>The clicking of heels brought our attention away from the flat screen. Eve stomped into the living room, glowered at me, and said, \u201cI need to speak to you, Adam.\u201d With the whip of her dark hair, Eve strode into the hallway. Adam stood and followed her, a door slamming followed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think that\u2019s about?\u201d Elle asked as she looked over at me.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWho knows with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows you have a thing for that mutt!\u201d Eve\u2019s voice carried through the house. Elle and Sawyer looked at me. I shook my head, feigning innocence. The worry in Sawyers eyes made me avoid his gaze.</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down!\u201d Adam snarled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta go,\u201d Sawyer said, standing up.</p><p>\u201cSawyer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s my turn to track, so I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d He watched me for a few seconds before turning and leaving. The disappointment in his green eyes was enough to form a lump of guilt in my stomach. As much as I didn\u2019t want to admit it, I liked Sawyer. Thinking about not spending time with him again caused a reaction I hadn\u2019t expected.</p><p>Elle glanced at the clock. \u201cOh, I have to go too. I\u2019m in Sawyer\u2019s group.\u201d She stood up and said, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah, just another day in the life of a wolf.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over and squeezed my arm, a small smile on her lips. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later. Right now our alpha demands I go out and search the mountain,\u201d she grumbled and rolled her eyes.</p><p>When both Sawyer and Elle left, I sat on the couch and tried to focus on the sappy couple on the TV screen. I could hear Adam and Eve arguing, and it had me on edge. Would Adam stop her if she decided to attack me? Since Eve was an alpha, she was stronger than me, even without the bum leg. The sound of a door opening awakened my wolf. She was ready for a fight and would claw and bite until the bitter end. Adam walked out, his hands fisted at his side and a scowl on his face. Eve followed after him and stopped. Adam put himself between me and his mate, and I released the breath I\u2019d been holding.</p><p>\u201cYou and I will have it out one way or another,\u201d she snapped and then left.</p><p>Adam walked over to the couch and sat down. Pinching the bridge of his nose, he dropped his head back against the couch.</p><p>\u201cShould I even ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems my affections didn\u2019t go unnoticed,\u201d Adam said, looking over at me. His eyes watched me so intently I forgot myself for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI need to know why you waited so long. I\u2019ve been here for three months and other than teaching me about the wolves, or punishing me, you never spoke to me. You threatened to give me to Luke if I didn\u2019t date Sawyer, and now you want me for yourself,\u201d I paused to take a breath. \u201cWhatever game you\u2019re playing, I\u2019m not. I like Sawyer, and you\u2019re mated to Eve. I\u2019m not willing to die for something I can\u2019t have.\u201d I spoke the words that\u2019d been lingering on my lips for days. I coated them with authority and confidence, in hope they\u2019d penetrate Adam\u2019s stubborn head.</p><p>Inside, it felt like water rushing down a drain. Everything I allowed myself to believe could happen with Adam was withdrawing and left me empty. Against my better judgment and morals, I wanted Adam as sure as the farmers want rain. I craved his presence and touch like a drug addict\u2014sure that if I didn\u2019t get a taste of him my body would convulse. The realization was so strong it left me breathless, suffocating on the emotions that gnawed on my insides until there was nothing left.</p><p>\u201cEve won\u2019t touch you,\u201d Adam began, his hand reaching out. I flinched away from him, afraid that if he touched me I\u2019d cave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had no right to act the way I have, and it\u2019s only caused more problems. I know Eve is a dangerous enemy to have and that Sawyer really likes you. I know you\u2019re worth more than what I\u2019m offering and that you deserve to be happy,\u201d Adam sat up, cracked his knuckle\u2019s and ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cI know all of that, but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care that Eve and I were paired together. I don\u2019t care that Sawyer would make a worthy mate and make you happy because I know I could make you happier. If I had to only admire you from afar rather than feel your body beneath my hands, I\u2019d go insane. I had to step up in some way to have you and your stubbornness has only driven me more over the edge.\u201d Adam snorted and glanced at me. \u201cI\u2019ll never stop wanting you,\u201d he said softly, looking away. \u201cBut I will stop my advances and never speak of this again. Eve was given to me to rule by my side and going against that covenant would put your life in danger.\u201d Adam stood, keeping his back toward me. \u201cElle will be your watcher from now on. You will not leave her sight. We still need to figure out who\u2019s behind the murders. Goodnight, Anna.\u201d</p><p>I watched him leave, the sound of the front door closing like vice around my heart. Something within me drew me towards Adam like a moth to a flame. He was my beacon in the dark world. I always assumed the emotion was due to the fact he was my alpha and my wolf was vowed to this authority. Now, I wasn\u2019t so sure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Two weeks passed. I\u2019d only seen Adam in passing. I was invisible to him and that hurt more than I expected. He\u2019d told me he wouldn\u2019t speak of our connection again, but I didn\u2019t believe him. Surely something so strong and primal couldn\u2019t be ignored. Unfortunately, it could and was.</p><p>Sawyer and I continued to hang out sans sex. He\u2019d been distant and not his normal mischievous self since that night Eve came to the house. We\u2019d go fishing, hunting, and watch movies together, but he wouldn\u2019t touch me.</p> <p>Moving on and away from Adam was the smartest choice for everyone, and in time, I\u2019d feel those feelings for Sawyer. I tried to kiss him and even snake my hand under his shirt a few times, only to watch him step back and out of my grasp. I figured he assumed I was Adam\u2019s mistress and that was the reason for his cold demeanor, but I hadn\u2019t asked. I didn\u2019t want to speak about Adam. I needed to ignore him as much as he ignored me.</p><p>Tonight, Sawyer met me by the hidden lake where we\u2019d first slept together. The sky was orange as the sun descended over the horizon. The warm wind hugged my body and offered a bit of comfort. I stared out at the still water, my arms across my chest. Sawyer walked up next to me and stared out at the lake too.</p><p>Looking over at him, I smiled at the way the glowing sunset highlighted his high cheekbones and dirty blonde hair. He can make you happy. I thought to myself and actually believed it. I\u2019d spent the first week trying to convince myself of this fact, but each day got easier. The more I thought about it and spent time with him, I knew it wasn\u2019t a lie. Sawyer was fantastic and beautiful and unlike Adam, he could be mine. I stepped closer, wrapping my arms around his side. I leaned on his shoulder. Sawyer\u2019s body stiffened, but eventually his arms wrapped around me. I sighed in relief at not getting shunned again, and we watched the world reflect on our special lake.</p><p>\u201cAnna, I think it\u2019s best if we stop seeing each other,\u201d Sawyer finally said.</p><p>I didn\u2019t move. I knew this moment was coming. \u201cCan I ask why?\u201d I whispered as I watched a crow fly over the trees.</p> <p>\u201cI think you know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sawyer said, his voice stiff.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d I told him. That wasn\u2019t exactly true but Sawyer didn\u2019t need to know all the details.</p><p>Sawyer stepped out of my embrace and turned to face me. \u201cPerhaps not, but it will. I like you, Anna, but I\u2019ve never seen you look at me the way you do him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSawyer, please don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s for the best.\u201d Sawyer\u2019s lips lifted in a sad smile. \u201cA relationship doesn\u2019t work when only one person is falling.\u201d</p><p>It seemed I was always watching the men I cared about walk away. Maybe I should take that as a hint.</p><p>Although late, I headed around the back of the house and picked up the axe. My insides were twisted in irritation. I walked to the tree line and swung the axe against the base of a large pine. I needed to hit something, to channel my anger. I struck the tree over and over, Adam and Sawyer\u2019s faces flashing through my mind. I hated this, hated that two men had affected me so intensely I was no longer sure of myself. I wasn\u2019t that girl. I didn\u2019t get caught up in relationships or second guess who I was.</p><p>\u201cHey, lumberjack,\u201d a man called.</p><p>I turned around, a scowl on my face and a thick layer of sweat on my forehead. Joe stood on the deck. \u201cThere\u2019s been a meeting called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there has,\u201d I mumbled. I was in no mood to see Adam or Sawyer, let alone in the same room together. I swung the axe one last time, left it in the tree and headed for the house.</p><p>The living room was full of my pack, me being the last to show up. I glanced at Adam as I shuffled into the room, but he didn\u2019t even gaze in my direction. Eve smirked at my disappointment, and my wolf snarled. Oh to smack that smug smile off her face.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now that everyone is here,\u201d Adam began, his voice sending tremors through my body. My wolf whimpered and howled for his attention, just a glance was all she needed. But Adam kept his eyes on those around me, avoiding the space where I stood. I\u2019d spent the last couple weeks telling him no, and now I regretted it. Of course if I would have given into him and then lost him, it would\u2019ve hurt ten times worse. If we ever slept together, there\u2019d be no going back.</p> <p>\u201cThe full moon is tomorrow night and although there haven\u2019t been any more killings, our hunt will be different. We\u2019ll be hunting up at Trigger Lake. It\u2019s further away which will offer us safety should there be hunters in the area. We\u2019re to leave at 7:00 p.m. sharp. That\u2019s all,\u201d Adam finished.</p><p>The pack dispersed to the kitchen where dinner waited. I stayed in the living room, leaning against the wall. My home had turned into a torture chamber. Seeing Adam caused me agony. I replayed his last words over and over and had them memorized. Once I was left alone, I headed up to the second floor. I made my way to the office and shut the door. Walking closer to the desk, I ran my fingertips over the spot Adam had sat. The memory of his hunger and dominance caused my need for him to build.</p><p>My hands trailed down my body, my fingers rubbing the spot that ached for him. Was it my face you saw when you looked at him? Rode him? Kissed him? His words floated through my mind, my fingers slipping under the hem of my shorts. Did you picture me slamming into you, filling you? A moan escaped my lips as I moved my hand deeper. I envisioned his blonde hair, blue eyes, and strong broad chest. The way those blue eyes lit up when they roamed my body. The way his hands felt against my skin. Licking my lips, I fantasized about his kiss and how he tasted on my mouth. The pressure built, my breaths becoming labored. Did you wish it was me between your legs?</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I moaned, the pressure breaking free, sending cascades of pleasure washing through me. When I opened my eyes, my fantasy was gone. Staring back me was an empty office. Get yourself together!</p><p>Making my way downstairs, I headed for my bedroom. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to eat. I lay on my bed and listened to the chatter of my pack laughing and talking amongst themselves. In a house full of people, I was alone. Even the wolf was depressed without Adam\u2019s attention. I hated it. I was not a woman who needed a man to complete me. What the hell was wrong with me and when would it stop?</p><p>Two soft knocks sounded from my door. \u201cAnna?\u201d Elle peeked her head inside. I looked over at her with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Elle sat on my bed, her long red hair falling forward.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cIt is if it\u2019s bothering you. You know you can talk to me.\u201d</p><p>I regarded her and thought about whether I should say what was abusing my mind. In the time I\u2019d been living here, I never saw her with a guy or even seen any of the guys fight to mate with her. I watched her full green eyes, the sprinkle of freckles across her nose, and her full pink lips. She was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cHow have you kept the guys from wanting to mate with you?\u201d I spoke before I thought about what I was saying. It wasn\u2019t normal that someone who looked like her didn\u2019t have men going insane.</p><p>\u201cOh, you noticed that, did you?\u201d She looked away, almost uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it. It\u2019s just you\u2019re very pretty. Surely the men here have tried mating with you.\u201d The main reason I was interested was so she could give me advice. I needed someone with experience to teach me how to survive this feeling.</p><p>\u201cThe men in our pack can tell what I am, so they don\u2019t want anything to do with me, which is cool. But it does get a little lonely,\u201d Elle said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d I asked dumbfounded.</p><p>Elle laughed. My face must have been as confused as my brain. \u201cI\u2019m gay, Anna. The men pick up on it and know that trying to get into my panties wouldn\u2019t do them any good. I must give off different pheromones than other women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said lamely. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Elle shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t advertise it. Being around a bunch of men who can sniff it out, there\u2019s no need.\u201d She watched me for a few moments. \u201cSo what\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSawyer dumped me,\u201d I told her. Of course I was bothered by the fact that Sawyer didn\u2019t want to see me anymore, but the real reason was Adam and the unnatural pull I had towards him. As much as I liked hanging out with Sawyer, Adam was a constant thought on my mind.</p><p>\u201cCan you blame him?\u201d Elle said, surprising me.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in the same house. I know Adam has been pursuing you. I see the way you guys devour each other with your eyes. What man would want to compete with that sort of attraction?\u201d Elle smiled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even want to compete with that sort of attraction. It\u2019s driving me insane. I thought it was just because he was my alpha, but the other women don\u2019t act like that around him.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI mean of course they find him attractive, you\u2019d have to be blind not to, but I feel like...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Elle was quiet for a moment. I looked up from the blanket I\u2019d been wringing in my hands. \u201cI sound like a pathetic loser, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. There\u2019s a myth about wolves that I heard once, and it makes me wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What was the myth?\u201d Adam trained me on controlling the beast and hunting, but he\u2019d never taught me the history of the werewolves. Up until now, I\u2019d never thought about it. Becoming an animal kept my mind busy enough without piling on a history lesson.</p><p>\u201cLong ago wolves only mated once they found what the Indian\u2019s called their chante. It means heart. Wolves bonded for a lifetime when they found their heart. It\u2019s said they knew this person by the overwhelming pull they felt towards them. Not just attraction, but like your soul is being physically drawn towards the other,\u201d Elle paused. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s going on with you and Adam, but what if it is? What if the stories aren\u2019t just stories? Nowadays born wolves are paired up with other packs to form alliances. There hasn\u2019t been a member that I\u2019ve ever heard of who has found their chante.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thought about my connection to Adam, and it sounded exactly like what Elle described, but it also sounded hokey. Surely, there wasn\u2019t such a thing as soul mates. I\u2019d spoke a good game in keeping him out of my pants, but I never ceased to kiss him back or push him away quick enough. Inside I wanted him, and my fa\u00e7ade pushed him further away. He no longer acknowledged me and that hurt worse than a bear trap around the leg.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2019s it,\u201d I told Elle. \u201cAdam doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me anymore\u2014which is for the best, I guess. He\u2019s mated to Eve, and if she ever gets the chance, she\u2019ll rip my throat out.\u201d I had a sneaking suspicion that the only reason I was still alive was because Adam made sure I stayed that way. I saw the bloodthirsty glare in Eve\u2019s eyes every time she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWe could find out more about it,\u201d Elle whispered.</p> <p>\u201cHow? I doubt Adam will tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a book. It\u2019s been passed down from alpha to alpha, and it holds every bit of information on werewolves. Adam keeps it in his study.\u201d A devious smile curled Elle\u2019s pink lips and a glint of mischief lit her green eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou want us to sneak into Adam and Eve\u2019s house to find some book about myths that are most likely only stories? Do you have a death wish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t get caught. We\u2019ll do it during the hunt tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. \u201cWe\u2019ll be wolves. How are we going to break in with paws?\u201d Tomorrow night was the full moon and the change was absolute. We couldn\u2019t switch forms until the sun rose.</p> <p>\u201cAdam has a doggy door in case he ever needs to get into the house for an emergency. And the book is hidden under the floorboards. With a little effort, we can totally grab it, read it, and then return it when we\u2019re back to our normal selves.\u201d</p><p>I considered her words and the consequences should we get caught. We\u2019d be punished, but so long as that punishment didn\u2019t include death, which I knew it wouldn\u2019t, I was game. I needed to know what the story was all about, and if there was a possibility it could be true, as crazy as it sounded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a partner in crime,\u201d I said, and Elle beamed.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>The pack gathered at the house, ready to head up to Trigger Lake for our hunt. Elle and I devised a plan to track back towards the houses while the others were busying stalking dinner. With luck, we\u2019d grab the book, stow it, and be back before anyone realized we\u2019d left. When a full moon approached everyone got a little antsy. I watched my pack shift from foot to foot as they waited to be called by the moon. Once an animal was in our sights, Adam would direct us to circle it until we closed in and took it down. Usually, we killed two larger animals during a full moon so there was enough to go around. My mouth watered at the thought of sinking my teeth into a moose or elk. Elle and I would have to wait for our dinner though; we had to find the book as quick as possible.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d Adam called out. He wore a pair of Adidas track pants and nothing else. My eyes absorbed the beauty of his broad chest and the ripples that made up his six pack stomach. My fingers itched to feel those ripples. Snapping my eyes up, I looked at Adam\u2019s face and he was watching me. My wolf yipped in excitement. It\u2019d been almost a month since he shown any semblance of notice towards me. The look in those cobalt pools before he glanced away was warm and hungry. Maybe he did still have a thing for me. My heart skipped a beat. You\u2019re a pathetic loser.</p> <p>Jumping in my truck with Elle sitting shotgun, I pulled onto the mountain road and followed the rest of the pack. The track to Trigger Lake was rocky and difficult to maneuver, but we\u2019d make it. The twilight sky caused my skin to itch and prickle with excitement. My muscles were tense and my wolf emerged. Glancing in the rearview mirror, my brown eyes were now amber. I looked over at Elle and her eyes had changed as well. She rolled her neck to ease the strain. The moon was a powerful thing. Changing during a full one was a lot more dramatic than changing without one. Our wolves took complete control, the feeling almost sensual as we gave in to our inner beasts.</p><p>\u201cOnce everyone is ordered to their hunting areas, we\u2019ll break away, and head back,\u201d Elle said.</p><p>Nodding, I said, \u201cAre you sure this is a good idea?\u201d</p><p>She looked over, her eyes almost glowing. \u201cDon\u2019t you wanna know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright then.\u201d</p><p>After managing not to break a spring over the large rocks, we pulled in to Trigger Lake. Mountains and pine trees surrounded the area, giving us the privacy we needed. The sky was now dark enough, the moon visible against the purple smeared clouds. Everyone hopped out of their trucks and began shucking their clothing and stowing them. Seeing twenty-four naked bodies shouldn\u2019t have surprised me, but I still got uneasy at seeing my friends in the flesh.</p><p>I dragged my tank top over my head and threw it in the cab of the truck. Unbuttoning my shorts, I stepped out of them, and also threw them in the truck. Everyone knew I kept my bra and panties on until I absolutely had to take them off, so when I unhooked my bra and stepped out of my underwear, admiring gazes found my now naked body.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the men\u2019s stares though. I was focused on Adam. Our eyes locked, and I swear his jaw tighten.</p><p>\u201cHot damn, Anna, can I get a taste?\u201d Mark teased.</p><p>\u201cLike you could handle me.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>I caught Sawyer\u2019s gaze, and he winked and smiled in appreciation. I returned his smile, happy he didn\u2019t seem to be pissed at me anymore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to prove you wrong,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Adam barked, and Mark, along with the other men, ignored my exposed flesh. A grin lifted my lips.</p><p>Elle kept staring.</p><p>I laughed and said, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t handle me either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d She chuckled, her cheeks reddening.</p><p>Adam assigned areas, breaking us down in crews of four and five. When we found an elk or moose, we were supposed to alert him, and he\u2019d direct the others to set up the trap.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s bodies began to wither and soft moans filled the secluded area. The sky was dark enough for the call of the moon to be too strong to refuse. One by one each person shifted.</p><p>I felt the rush of the change and within a blink of an eye I was on four paws. I don\u2019t know about normal wolves, but werewolves see everything in color. A trait I\u2019d been happy to keep. Adam padded through pack so he stood in the middle of the circle and let out a long howl. Eve followed and each wolf joined in according to their superiority. When it was my turn, my wolf joined in on the song to the moon. Adam yipped, and we broke out in teams. Elle and I were lucky enough to be paired together. Running into the tree line with her right beside me, we headed for our designation. Asher and Joe were in front of us, both of their wolves silver. Once they were out of sight, Elle nudged me with her nose. We stopped running and listened for a few seconds before turning around and heading back. We ran like hell. It\u2019d be some time before the wolves got far enough into the mountain to hunt, but it was at least five miles back to the house.</p><p>Elle kept pace with me, her wolf was a reddish color with black sprinklings. She stood a little shorter than my wolf, but that didn\u2019t distract from her ability to run next to me. I bolted through the wind, my heart hammering in my chest, and my eyes focused on the space in front of me. I was afraid that if I saw an animal, my wolf would take control and hunt rather than flee.</p><p>\u201cYour little stunt is going to have all the men pounding on my door to claim you,\u201d Adam\u2019s voice penetrated my mind, causing my hurried steps to falter. Worry pumped through my veins. Did he know I wasn\u2019t with the group? I glanced over at Elle, but she didn\u2019t show any signs of having heard Adam.</p><p>\u201cThat should make you happy,\u201d I thought back. I guess it took seeing me naked to get a rise out of Adam.</p><p>Just when I thought Adam had gone back to ignoring me, his voice sounded in my mind again. \u201cNothing about you being with other men makes me happy, Anna.\u201d His voice held an edge that caused shivers to radiate through my body. I craved his possessiveness, the power in his tone that wanted me all to himself.</p><p>\u201cSawyer dumped me,\u201d I told him, not exactly sure why. I guess I wanted him to know that no other man would be sampling my goods.</p><p>\u201cWhat a fool,\u201d Adam snorted.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond again. I needed to stop entertaining the idea of Adam being mine. As much as I wanted to be with him, I wouldn\u2019t share him with Eve. I snarled at the thought. I wouldn\u2019t allow myself to get drawn in again just to be thrown away.</p><p>I could now see the lights of the houses as I pushed forward, my claws digging into the soft earth. Elle and I headed towards Adam and Eve\u2019s large log cabin. Heading around the back, Elle slipped in through the doggy door with me following behind.</p><p>Heading down the hallway, we stepped into a large office. Elle scratched at the area rug until it fell back to reveal the hardwood floor. A small notch was cut out of one board. Elle stood over the board and pawed at the floor. I watched her determination with appreciation. When her claw hooked the notch, she pulled back slow and the board lifted to reveal an opening. Bending down, I clutched the leather bound book in my teeth.</p><p>Elle let the board fall, tamped it down, and pulled the rug back to cover it. I was impressed with our thievery as wolves. Not wasting any more time, we left Adam\u2019s and ran like hell towards the main house. We didn\u2019t have a doggy door installed so I stored the book behind a row of evergreen bushes that lined the front of our home.</p><p>\u201cGroup two head southeast,\u201d Adam\u2019s voice demanded. Elle and I glanced at each other, our tongues lolling in our best wolfy grins and headed back towards Trigger Lake. We took off in full run, our main mission was to return unnoticed. The group had dispersed throughout the mountain, so finding them was going to take some time. We had to be there for the kill.</p><p>It took us less than twenty minutes to return to the hunting ground. Elle and I found our group quick and fell into formation as they pushed a large moose towards the group on its other side. Snapping and snarling at the moose\u2019s hind legs, the animal ran in the direction we wanted. The wolves waited for it on the other side, ready to attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the moose bounded through the trees, Adam sprung up and jumped on its back. The moose cried out as Adam\u2019s teeth sunk into its shoulder. One by one, the pack attacked the animal, and it slumped to the ground. Eve rushed towards it, her teeth sinking into its throat and the struggling stopped.</p><p>My wolf salivated at our fresh kill, ready to sink her sharp teeth into the meat. But I had to wait my turn. Adam and Eve tore chunks off and devoured them like savage beasts, blood coating their muzzles.</p><p>When they\u2019d had their fill, the other high ranking wolves feasted. I padded back and forth, antsy for my meal. Unless we took down another animal, there wouldn\u2019t be too much left for me.</p> <p>\u201cAnna, come over here,\u201d Adam said, his voice sounding in my mind. My wolf held no reservations about her attraction to the alpha. She bolted around the group of feeding wolves towards him.</p><p>He was hidden in the trees, his black fur blending in with the night. The beautiful glow of his yellow eyes shone against the darkness, but I didn\u2019t need to see him to know where he was\u2014I was drawn to him.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d he said, amused as he nudged a hunk of meat towards me. I stared at the offering, trotting closer, and devoured the moose flesh. When I was done, I began cleaning off my paws and muzzle. Adam watched me for a few moments before slipping away. My wolf whined when her alpha disappeared. I even felt myself sag in sadness. My attraction towards Adam wasn\u2019t due to the fact that he was my alpha. It wasn\u2019t because he was gorgeous, powerful, and the leader of our group. I wasn\u2019t just attracted to him\u2014I was pulled towards him. Being around him was magnetic. It not only hurt my heart, but it crushed my soul because I knew he was unavailable.</p><p>As soon as the sun rose and I was back to my normal, human self, I\u2019d go through that book with a fine tooth comb and find out if Adam could be my chante.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p> <p>\u201cIs the door locked?\u201d I asked Elle.</p><p>\u201cYou already asked that, and yes it is for the twentieth time.\u201d We\u2019d retrieved the book from the bushes and sat on my bed hovering over it. It was covered in leather with an emblem of some sort of intricate circle design on the front. It had to be at least five inches thick and filled with ivory paper.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of Adam\u2019s wrath, or Eve\u2019s for that matter,\u201d I told my friend. Elle ignored my concerns and flipped the book open. The pages were filled in with dark ink, some drawings, but mostly passages from previous alphas. Each article was signed and dated with the inscriber\u2019s name.</p><p>The page Elle flipped to was a picture of wolves in a circle with one larger wolf in the middle. The surrounding wolves had their heads bowed and in elegant script it read: The Reign of Edwards.</p><p>\u201cIs this the alpha ceremony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s sorta a big deal,\u201d Elle said. As we flipped through the pages there were five other alpha ceremony drawings, the last one of Adam. All of the pack mates surrounded him pledging their loyalty. In the back of my mind, I wondered how that must feel to have so many dedicated followers. Pride stirred in my heart as I stared at the black wolf\u2014my wolf.</p> <p>\u201cWho taught you about all this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been a history buff. When I was changed I hounded anyone I could for information on the creature I became,\u201d Elle laughed to herself in remembrance. \u201cAdam sat me down after hearing about how much I was annoying people with my questions. He and I discussed the legends and myths until two in the morning. That\u2019s how I knew where he hid the book. I was in the room when he retrieved it. It\u2019s more hidden so that humans or other packs can\u2019t find it.\u201d I smiled at her and wondered why I hadn\u2019t wanted to find this stuff out.</p><p>\u201cI think this is it,\u201d Elle said as she flipped to another page. Her finger ran down the paper as she read to herself.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d My lungs tighten as I waited for the verdict.</p><p>\u201cChante,\u201d Elle read, \u201cis an old Indian legend. It is said that every heart has a counterpart and until it is found, a person will not know true happiness. Nature has paired man and woman since the dawn of time, but when you find your chante, she alerts you. The earth moves, guiding you towards one another. It is said that no force can undo what Mother Nature has set into motion.\u201d</p><p>Elle looked up and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, but this could be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still not sure I believe in soul mates. I mean I can\u2019t be the only female who is drawn to Adam. He is gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re not,\u201d Elle agreed. \u201cBut you\u2019re the only female he\u2019s been drawn to. I\u2019ve never even seen him like that, even with Eve.\u201d Her smile grew wider until twin rows of sparkly white teeth showed. I smiled back, happy to have a piece of hope that maybe, just maybe, Adam was my chante.</p> <p>\u201cAnna?\u201d Adam\u2019s voice boomed through the house, and Elle and I scrambled to hide the book.</p><p>We rushed to where Adam stood in the kitchen. Four other men I didn\u2019t recognize were with him and emanating pure power. My wolf respected these men. I bowed my head and Elle followed suit. Strange.</p><p>\u201cAnna, the leaders have traveled a long distance to meet you,\u201d Adam said and my head popped up. \u201cThis is Wade,\u201d Adam gestured towards a man who looked to be in his thirties. I hadn\u2019t expected a leader to be so young. He was tall, at least six-foot-three, and rock solid. His clothes stretched the span of his wide chest and bulbous arms. His jeans fit loosely but I could tell muscular legs hid underneath. I nodded my head in his direction, not sure whether I should speak. I kept my eyes on his chest so I wouldn\u2019t make eye contact. Everything within me said I wouldn\u2019t get away with staring one of these men down like I did Adam.</p><p>\u201cThis is Nicholas, Michael, and Jeff,\u201d Adam continued, and I nodded in each of their directions. All of them were stocky and frightening. Their faces hard and serious.</p><p>\u201cNice to finally meet you, Anna Avery,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cAnd you, Elle Andrews.\u201d</p><p>Elle and I both nodded again. An extreme urge to curtsey filled me, but figured that\u2019d only get me laughed at. I\u2019d never been so out of sorts that I didn\u2019t know how to act. My wolf was a nervous mess, which in turn made me just as nervous.</p><p>\u201cShall we sit and discuss what\u2019s been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, my lord,\u201d Adam said, and the four men turned to go into the living room. Just as Elle and I were about to follow, Adam stopped us.</p><p>\u201cElle, this meeting is for Anna. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d</p><p>Elle nodded, squeezed my arm and turned to leave. I wanted to beg for her not to go, but I kept my unease to myself.</p><p>Adam leaned down so his mouth was close to my ear. His warm breath stirred my hair and my hands itched to reach out to him. It\u2019d been so long since he\u2019d been this close.</p><p>\u201cYou will be respectful. They aren\u2019t as forgiving as I am,\u201d he warned.</p><p>When he withdrew from me, he placed a hand on the small of my back and together we met the leaders in the living room.</p><p>All four men sat together on the longer side of the sectional. I took the spot furthest away and stared at my clasped hands in my lap. I hated this. Hated feeling inadequate and beneath these men\u2019s feet. Everything inside of me wanted to meet their eyes and show them I was their equal. But my wolf held power over me in this situation and would not allow me to defy Adam\u2019s warning.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cWe hear that there have been a couple murders and you were the last to see the victims alive.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be straight with you, and you will answer truthfully,\u201d the man paused and I nodded again. \u201cDid you kill these men?\u201d</p><p>I was quiet for a moment while I thought about the dreams and the taste of blood in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow can you not know?\u201d another man asked, his voice slightly deeper than the previous interrogator. \u201cYou either did or you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember killing anyone, but I had dreams of the killings,\u201d I explained. The room was quiet for a moment, spiking my already jumpy nerves. Squeezing my hands tighter, I focused on the pain of my nails digging into my skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens in these dreams?\u201d Yet another man asked. It\u2019d be really nice if I could put a face with the voice, but I kept my eyes down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the wolf,\u201d I told them. \u201cI see everything from its perspective and its thoughts are the ones I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very...\u201d one of the men started.</p><p>\u201cBizarre, it\u2019s bizarre,\u201d another one finished.</p><p>I bit my lower lip and shifted on the couch.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, you were the last to see these two men alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201dJust the one, Tim, the first victim. I\u2019d had a mishap in the forest and passed out. The hunter\u2019s body was found close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mishap?\u201d A leader questioned.</p><p>\u201cShe fell onto a bear trap set up by rangers hunting for a rabid wolf or mountain lion,\u201d Adam explained.</p><p>\u201cI see and you\u2019ve had trouble being around humans in the past?\u201d</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cIs it possible that her wolf is so strong it overtakes her without her knowledge, and therefore, the only memories she retains are dreamlike?\u201d One of the men asked and the four of them began mumbling as they talked amongst themselves.</p><p>I closed my eyes and tried to calm my nerves, but when Adam approached my lids snapped open. He stood next to me, making sure not to touch me. My muscles eased a bit, and I could breathe easier with his close proximity.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to tell you that exposing us to humans is very dangerous,\u201d the man with the deeper voice said.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cIf what you say is true, and you don\u2019t remember killing the men, then I believe we have no other choice than to stay and observe your actions. You\u2019ll be kept under a watchful eye, and sooner or later, we\u2019ll get to the bottom of this.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes for a moment, releasing a heavy breath. Elle had been my babysitter which was fine with me. Now I\u2019d have four leaders scrutinizing my every move. Damn it! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re happy to have you,\u201d Adam said, clearly as surprised as I was. \u201cYou may stay in the main house, there are plenty of bedrooms.\u201d</p><p>They were staying in my house?</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d one of the leaders said. \u201cOur bags are in the SUV, we thought this might not be solved tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tend to them,\u201d Adam said and began to leave the house.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, have Anna retrieve them. An alpha shouldn\u2019t be reduced to a bellboy, even if it is for your leaders.\u201d</p><p>Adam seemed like he wanted to say something, but I stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to,\u201d I said and smiled for good measure. Honestly, just getting out of the house and away from their stares was purpose enough.</p><p>Once outside, I took a moment to catch my breath and gain my composure. What if I was the one going on a killing spree? Surely, the penalty would be death. Would the leaders do it or would I die at the hands of Adam? My body wouldn\u2019t calm down and more thoughts bombarded my mind. If it came to death, I hoped it\u2019d be Adam who ended my life. I needed to know he\u2019d be the last person I saw as I faded from this world.</p> <p>\u201cAnna?\u201d</p><p>I half turned and blinked away the tears that stung my eyes. Adam walked towards me, stopping a couple feet away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out,\u201d he said, and something within me snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhy should you care? You\u2019ve ignored me for the past month!\u201d Once the words left my lips I realized how much I wanted an answer. I needed to know how he could be on me one minute and discard me the next. But most of all, I needed reassurance that I wasn\u2019t alone in the feelings I had for him. You\u2019re a needy wreck!</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d I told him. I didn\u2019t want to hear the same spiel about how he was Eve\u2019s mate and there was nothing he could do about it. My heart couldn\u2019t take the hammering of those words again.</p><p>I opened the door to the SUV and unloaded the suitcases.</p> <p>\u201cAnna...I,\u201d Adam began as if he couldn\u2019t find the words.</p><p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s okay. I understand,\u201d I lied as I lifted the luggage. I started towards the house, but Adam stepped in front of me.</p><p>\u201cTell me why you were crying.\u201d</p><p>I shifted my gaze away from his concern. \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Adam reached a hand out; his fingers caressed the side of my face. My eyes closed against the feel of his warm skin on mine.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I am the one responsible? I\u2019ll be sentenced to death.\u201d I kept my voice low as if speaking any louder would make the words true. When Adam didn\u2019t respond, I looked up. His eyes changed to fierce and protective.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel in your heart that you\u2019re responsible?\u201d</p> <p>I thought for a moment, really thought and then shook my head. \u201cNo,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut none of it makes sense. Why would I have the dreams or memories, whatever they are?\u201d</p><p>Adam stepped closer. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but we\u2019ll figure it out together.\u201d</p><p>I released an annoyed breath. I hated the worry on his face and the promise of his words. \u201cThank you, my alpha. You\u2019re most gracious.\u201d</p><p>Adam stepped away as if my words burned him. If he wanted to spout shit about his duties, I\u2019d go back to being his loyal subject. There\u2019s a reason why the phrase \u201ccan\u2019t have your cake and eat it too\u201d existed. I wouldn\u2019t allow him to pay attention to me when it pleased him and ignore me when he wanted. As much as my hands wanted to roam over his broad shoulders and rippling abs, I would rein in my overpowering lust and be just another member of his pack.</p><p>I pushed past him.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d Adam said my name with authority, and I turned around, unable to ignore the power of my alpha. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>I remained silent, unsure where he was going. With confident steps, he moved closer. His eyes shifted towards the house as if he were making sure no one was watching. Leaning down, his cheek rested against the side of my face as his lips spoke against my hair.</p><p>\u201cI want you, have always wanted you. It\u2019s not fair that you judge my merit when you refused to be with me because I\u2019m mated to Eve.\u201d The sound of him licking his lips sent a shiver through my body. \u201cBelieve me when I say that the only thing keeping me from taking you right now is that it\u2019s what\u2019s best for you. I want to keep you safe.\u201d Adam stood up straight, looked at me with an intensity that burned to my very core and then disappeared into the house.</p><p>I swallowed around the lump in my throat, grabbed the luggage, and followed with a small smile on my lips.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Anna.\u201d</p><p>I looked through groggy eyes at four large men sitting at the kitchen table. Elle was in the process of cooking bacon, eggs, sausage and pancakes. The aroma was mouthwatering.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I said to the leaders. \u201cYou slept well, I hope?\u201d</p><p>Each of them grunted in agreement.</p><p>Making my way towards Elle, I opened the fridge and poured a glass of orange juice.</p><p>\u201cNeed any help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you get the plates, forks and glasses?\u201d Elle asked and I nodded.</p><p>While I set the table, I could tell that four pairs of eyes observed me. It made the hair on my arms stand on end as I wondered what they saw when they looked at me. Did they already have their minds made up and waited for an opportunity to convict me?</p><p>\u201cAny dreams last night?\u201d one of the leaders asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. It\u2019s been almost a month since I had my last uh...dream.\u201d I continued to place a plate, glass, and silverware in front of each man.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for the day?\u201d another leader asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be doing my chores,\u201d I told them as I stood back and hugged my arms to my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou may look upon us,\u201d the man with the deeper voice said. The shock caused me to look over at Elle. She shrugged and I turned my attention towards the table. I was hesitant to peel my eyes from the floor, but if I didn\u2019t, it could be considered rude. When I looked up, four stone cold faces greeted me. I\u2019d only seen them through peripheral and those hard lines and tight jaws were still in place.</p><p>\u201cThe old ways state that one shall not look a leader, or alpha, in the eyes as a show of respect,\u201d the man with the deeper voice continued. I assumed this was Wade considering his younger face. His brown hair was cut closely to his head and his square face held a five o\u2019clock shadow.</p><p>\u201cWe realize that making those below us avert their gazes may be impersonal. We want to connect with our people and show we are just as loyal to them as they are to us.\u201d</p><p>I took a moment to look at each of the leaders. The three other gentlemen were older, late forties and fifties. Wade looked to be in his thirties. How\u2019d he become a leader so young? Leaders were a group of men who acted as our government. They policed packs that found themselves in the sort of trouble an alpha couldn\u2019t handle alone. The fact that they were staying in my house was a bit embarrassing. Only four months as a werewolf and I already got the attention of the bigwigs.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told them. \u201cThat is very gracious of you.\u201d What I really wanted to say was it was about time and the old way was asinine. Luckily, I bit down on my tongue before my thought could slip through.</p><p>\u201cSo, chores?\u201d Wade asked and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that entail?\u201d Nick, Michael or Jeff asked. I couldn\u2019t be sure which man was which.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cJust depends. I chop wood, mow the lawns, and anything else that needs to be done. Today, I\u2019m trimming a couple tree branches that are too close to some of the houses.\u201d I smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not glamorous, but it\u2019s my life.\u201d</p><p>Wade smiled and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve had my fair share of those not so glamorous times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before his daddy claimed him and stuck a silver spoon in his mouth, or a platinum spoon rather, silver would torture,\u201d either Michael, Nick or Jeff said with a smile. The three of them laughed, but Wade shifted his eyes and clenched his jaw so tight I could practically hear his teeth grinding.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d I said and began to leave the room. It was clear the three older leaders didn\u2019t show Wade the same respect, and I had enough problems without standing in the middle of their ribbing.</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d Wade said, following me down the hallway. \u201cWe may not be the hard asses you originally thought, but we were serious when we said you\u2019d be kept under a watchful eye. I\u2019ll tag along with you today.\u201d</p><p>Oh goodie! \u201cElle can watch me. I\u2019m sure you have better things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElle\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Wade nodded. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we can\u2019t trust her to really watch you. Go get dressed, and I\u2019ll be waiting out front.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the back of his head and pretended if I blinked just right, it\u2019d explode. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work. Once in my bedroom, I shut and locked the door. Elle and I stored the book underneath my bed and knowing it was there with the leaders just outside caused my skin to itch. Personally, I didn\u2019t mind borrowing it without Adam\u2019s knowledge, but my wolf was a nervous nelly. Her feelings soaked through me and made me anxious. Bending down, I grabbed the book and placed it under some shirts in my dresser. I figured that\u2019d be a better hiding place, unless the leaders decided to raid my room.</p><p>Once dressed in shorts and a blue tank top I headed outside. Wade leaned against my truck, his ankles and arms crossed. This sucks! I walked around my truck, opened the door, and hopped inside. Wade followed suit and soon we were driving.</p><p>\u201cWhen were you turned?\u201d Wade asked.</p><p>I looked over, but he stared straight ahead with one arm propped on the door. His profile was beautiful and hard; he was definitely leader material.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been four months now,\u201d I told him. \u201cI was jogging and a wolf attacked me. Adam found me and took me in.\u201d I flexed my fingers against the steering wheel and rolled my neck to ease my nervous muscles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd the wolf that attacked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d I looked over again.</p><p>\u201cDid you figure out who it was?\u201d</p> <p>I sucked in a deep breath. \u201cNo, but Adam thinks it was a rogue. He said there were other attacks shortly before mine. I was the only one who survived.\u201d</p><p>Wade was quiet for a while, and I used the time to think about my attack. The memory was foggy, but I\u2019d been trying to remember and little bits became clearer. I remembered falling off a cliff and the wolf pulling me back onto solid ground and its teeth sinking into my throat, but that was about it.</p><p>\u201cThe others died because they weren\u2019t strong enough,\u201d Wade finally said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe magic that turns one into a werewolf only seeks out those strong enough to accept it. If the other victims died, it\u2019s because they weren\u2019t as strong as you. You should feel grateful that the magic saw something within you.\u201d</p> <p>I snorted. \u201cConsidering I could be six feet under right now, I am grateful. Then again, I could be six feet under by the end of the week if the leaders convict me of murder.\u201d I stared at him trying to capture an emotion that\u2019d tell me where they stood on my conviction.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re innocent, you have nothing to worry about,\u201d Wade replied with a serious face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m innocent,\u201d I said, pulling into the driveway of my first stop. I didn\u2019t wait for Wade\u2019s response. Instead, I hopped out of the truck, grabbed the pruning shears from the bed, and headed towards the tree.</p><p>I stopped short when I rounded the corner and came face to face with a man. A human. My wolf bristled causing the hair on my arms to stand on end. Don\u2019t freak out while I have a leader with me! The man was bent down checking the gas meter, but stood when I approached him. His brown eyes shot wide at my aggressive demeanor, and as I stepped towards him, he stepped back.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I all but growled.</p><p>\u201cI work for the energy company, just making my rounds,\u201d the man said a little shaken.</p> <p>\u201cThere a problem?\u201d Wade asked from behind me. I closed my eyes and took a couple deep breaths to calm myself down. I prayed my eyes hadn\u2019t changed, but from the look on the man\u2019s face I\u2019d say those prayers would go unanswered.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I told Wade and reined my wolf in. Taking a couple steps backwards, I put distance between me and the human.</p><p>\u201cSorry, you must have startled my sister,\u201d Wade said and the man nodded, but still looked frightened. After he left, Wade grasped my arm so tight I cringed from the pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cMy wolf doesn\u2019t like humans, I guess...\u201d</p><p>Wade loosened his grip, but didn\u2019t let me go. His eyes turned into stones as he glared at me and his cheeks tightened in a scowl.</p><p>\u201cHave you always acted like that with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been around a lot of humans since turning. Adam kept me here because he thought it was safer.\u201d</p> <p>Wade released me and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual for werewolves to have such distaste for humans. Of course we think of ourselves as superior, but that doesn\u2019t mean we want to kill them.\u201d He paced back and forth. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that man thinks he imagined the change of your eyes. If our secret gets out to the humans, you and the rest of us will be as good as dead.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d acted as bad as Wade implied, but I still felt embarrassed. Sure I\u2019d stalked towards the man and been a little rude, but it wasn\u2019t like I growled at him or even tried to bite him. If anything, he\u2019d think I was a bitch. Of course that didn\u2019t explain why my eyes went from brown to gold, but the sun had been in my face, so maybe the man didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been trying to control it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think what you need is more interaction. By alienating you, Adam has made the change harder on you.\u201d Wade rubbed the stubble lining his jaw. \u201cI\u2019ll have to talk with your alpha.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. I thought but then smiled. Adam getting reprimanded could be fun to watch, especially since he\u2019d spent the last few months doing the same to me.</p><p>After finishing up with my chores, Wade and I headed back to the house. When I pulled into the long driveway, the three other leaders stood outside with the rest of the pack.</p><p>\u201cWhich leader is which?\u201d I asked Wade as I shut the truck off. I felt silly not knowing how to address them.</p><p>\u201cThe one with the crew cut is Jeff,\u201d Wade pointed to a man with brown hair. He was stocky and around five-foot-ten. \u201cThat\u2019s Michael,\u201d Wade pointed to the next man. Michael was taller, around six-foot-one, with shaggy reddish brown hair. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Nicholas.\u201d Wade nodded in the man\u2019s direction. Nicholas was the same height as Michael, but had a more dangerous feel. His jet black hair hung to his stubble lined jaw and his piercing blue eyes burned as he appraised the females.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d stay away from Nicholas,\u201d Wade warned, and I nodded. I could practically feel Nicholas\u2019 sexual energy in the cab of the truck. While I\u2019d been lucky that Adam hadn\u2019t forced me to have sex with him, I wasn\u2019t so confident when it came to Nicholas.</p><p>Exiting the truck, Wade and I headed over to the rest of the members. The scent of grilled meats hung in the air and awakened my appetite. Various members held beers in their hands and chatted amongst themselves. Adam was talking with Joe and Asher, but looked up when I got closer. I gave a short nod and shifted my gaze. I want you, I\u2019ve always wanted you. Adam\u2019s previous words sounded in my mind, and my wolf bristled with lust. The few times Adam and I touched were enough to make me hungry to experience all of him. Sighing in frustration, I headed inside the house. My libido couldn\u2019t take much more of Adam\u2019s torture, and my mind wouldn\u2019t allow my cravings to be sated. Why in the hell did my alpha have to be mated?</p><p>\u201cSo, how was your day with the babysitter?\u201d Elle smiled.</p><p>I snatched a potato skin and stuffed my mouth. The one thing I loved about being a werewolf was the fact that I could eat anything I wanted and not gain a pound. Food was a different kind of lust for us, one that was causing me to purr in delight.</p><p>\u201cIt was okay...whatever. I may have blown my chance at winning the leaders over when I snarled at a human today.\u201d I began to grab another potato skin when Elle smacked my hand.</p><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Elle snapped. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about a human?\u201d She placed a hand on her cocked hip and waited for me to explain.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d I told her. \u201cJust a man checking the gas meters. My eyes may have changed, but nothing else happened. Wade was pretty pissed.\u201d</p><p>Elle released a heavy breath. \u201cJust when I start liking someone around here, she\u2019s gonna get herself killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking...kinda. You have major issues when it comes to humans.\u201d Elle turned to grab something off of the counter, and I took the opportunity to snatch more food.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>I smiled and popped the food in my mouth then turned and headed towards the shower.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The hot spray pounded against my back and eased my sore muscles. My chores today hadn\u2019t been all that tiring, but Wade put me on edge. He\u2019d watched me very closely after I snapped at the human. I\u2019d just lathered shampoo in my hair when the creaking of the door alerted me I wasn\u2019t alone. Each wolf gave off their own scent, and I knew each member of my packs like the back of my hand. The person in the bathroom with me was not of my pack.</p><p>Footsteps sounded closer, echoing on the tile. My heart hammered in my chest as I anticipated the intruder. Grabbing the towel hanging over the shower bar, I wrapped it around my naked body.</p><p>Fingers curled around the shower curtain and whipped it back quickly. Nicholas stood in front of me, a grin on his lips, and his eyes roaming the length of my body. Sexual desire scented the air and smelled like sharp spices.</p><p>\u201cExcuse the intrusion,\u201d he said. His voice reminded me of velvet, soft and sensual. My wolf perked up from his attention\u2014the slut.</p><p>\u201cI...uh was just getting out,\u201d I lied.</p><p>He spanned his arms against either side of the wall blocking my escape and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t let me stop you,\u201d he said with a cock of his head. \u201cI\u2019d love to wash your back.\u201d</p><p>Before I could refuse his offer, he pulled his t-shirt over his head revealing a tight, rippling stomach. A shiver danced through my body as I imagined him and I intertwined and moaning. He looked to be in his forties but that didn\u2019t hinder from his good looks.</p><p>\u201cReally, that\u2019s okay,\u201d I told him and stepped out of the tub. Without warning, Nicholas lifted me up and sat me on the counter with a hard thump.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I demanded, but he didn\u2019t seem to hear me or care that I had objections.</p><p>\u201cCome now,\u201d he said softly as he squeezed between my legs and leaned down to the crook of my throat. His warm breath caused goose bumps to flit along my skin and my bones to turn to mush. \u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful woman, and I\u2019m a willing man, don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t want it. I can smell your desire.\u201d</p><p>I was turned on, then again it didn\u2019t take much being a werewolf, but I\u2019d made it four months without giving in to every dog that sniffed my way, and I wouldn\u2019t give in now. The problem was, since sleeping with Sawyer, my body craved intimacy now. Sex was like a drug that gave off the most exciting high. The sheer raw sexuality of our kind called to me, and I found myself opening my legs wider to make room for Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl,\u201d he whispered as he pressed kisses along my throat. A moan escaped my mouth, and it seemed my hands had a mind of their own because they were currently raking down his chest.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s about we get rid of this pesky thing?\u201d Nicholas said as he unwrapped the towel from my body. I had a split second to think that I should stop him when his mouth found my nipple and all thoughts ceased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnna?\u201d Adam knocked and smacked the lusty thoughts from my mind. I shoved against Nicholas, and he growled. The door opened and Adam froze as he saw me perched atop the counter and Nicholas between my legs.</p><p>Nicholas smiled. \u201cUntil we meet again,\u201d he told me and then pushed past Adam. The look on Adam\u2019s face was enough to turn my veins to ice. He slammed the door and paced back and forth, his hands fisting at his sides. When he looked at me, his eyes were citrine and blazing with anger.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p> <p>I fumbled to wrap the towel back around me as tears filled my eyes. Looking away, I wanted to crumple to the ground and bawl.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Adam said softer as he approached me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to yell at you. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>I stared up at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t stop him, and now you probably think I\u2019m a whore.\u201d</p><p>Adam placed his hands on my shoulders and brought me towards his body where he hugged me to him. \u201cI do not think you\u2019re a whore, Anna. Nicholas has a sort of superpower. He can influence women. His sexuality is so strong it\u2019s almost impossible for females to say no to him, and believe me, he takes advantage of it. He\u2019s already slept with two of the women here. I\u2019m just happy I walked in when I did, and you didn\u2019t end up number three.\u201d</p><p>What he said made me feel better, but I wasn\u2019t completely sure whether Nicholas\u2019 sexuality made me act that way or if it was just me. \u201cStill, I feel like a piece of shit right now\u2014dirty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs do the other woman he tricked into bed, I suspect. I\u2019m sorry and if I could rip his heart from his chest, I would.\u201d</p><p>We were quiet for a while before I asked, \u201cWhat did you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you knock, what made you come to the bathroom?\u201d I wiped the tears that fell from my eyes and sniffed. I felt like a complete idiot and of course Adam was witness to my embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, and stepped away from me. \u201cGet dressed, dinner\u2019s almost ready.\u201d</p><p>When he turned to leave, I hopped off of the counter and walked to him. \u201cTell me.\u201d Placing a hand on his arm, I tugged him to a stop. When he turned around he wouldn\u2019t look at me. He really does think I\u2019m a whore.</p> <p>\u201cI... wanted to see you,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThis past month has been difficult.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught in my throat and my heart pounded in my chest almost painfully. \u201cOh,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure Nicholas leaves you alone,\u201d he said before he slipped out of the bathroom.</p><p>We ate outside. The deck was set up with three long tables and piled with food. The pack ate like starving hyenas, but my appetite had waned. The episode with Nicholas turned my stomach sour. Sure I had trouble controlling my urges, but I\u2019d never considered sleeping with a man I didn\u2019t even know. And I\u2019d never given in so easily. I kept my eyes on the untouched food on my plate, so I wouldn\u2019t catch Nicholas\u2019 gaze. The pack chatted about this and that, but I tuned them out and thought about Adam. His admittance that he\u2019d missed me was like a weight being lifted off of my heart. As much as I craved sex, Adam was the one man who I needed. If I were a flame, then he was the oxygen I needed to burn. I hated it and loved it at the same time. Even though he was close, he might as well have been halfway around the world for all the good it did me. It didn\u2019t matter how much he missed me, it wouldn\u2019t change his relationship status.</p><p>\u201cI plan to take Anna to town tonight.\u201d</p><p>My head snapped up when I heard my name. Wade spoke to the other leaders and Adam. He looked at me and raised an eyebrow. I guessed this was his solution to integrating my werewolf with humans. Or maybe he was baiting me into attacking one so they\u2019d have a reason to kill me.</p><p>\u201cI believe that by keeping her up here on this mountain, you\u2019ve hurt her. The beast within her only associates with other wolves, and therefore isn\u2019t sure how to handle humans,\u201d Wade said to Adam. Multiple pairs of eyes turned towards me. Heat rushed to my cheeks, and I excused myself. I\u2019d gotten a lot of shit about being the pup around here, but I didn\u2019t need almost thirty people focusing on my incompetence.</p><p>Heading into the house, I cut across the kitchen and living room and went out the front door. Just as I made it down the first two porch steps, Sawyer came around the house.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said to him. Tonight he was dressed in dark jeans and a gray T-shirt. His dark blonde hair was spiked, and his eyes seemed to glow as he watched me. He was beautiful, and I was an idiot for allowing my feelings for Adam ruin what we had.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said back casually. \u201cWant some company?\u201d</p><p>Not really. \u201cSure,\u201d I told him deciding it was better than being alone. \u201cI was going to go for a walk.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure why I\u2019d left the table so abruptly, maybe seeing Adam reprimanded in front of his pack wasn\u2019t as fun as I thought it\u2019d be. I didn\u2019t want to see the leaders belittle the man I cared about or see the look of humiliation on his face as they questioned his methods.</p><p>\u201cLead the way,\u201d Sawyer said, extending an arm towards the road. I began forward and Sawyer followed.</p><p>\u201cSo, you wanna tell me why Adam has me watching you?\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said to keep an eye on you earlier tonight. Something about you not being left alone.\u201d Sawyer shrugged, and I smiled. I guess this is what Adam meant when he said he\u2019d make sure Nicholas would leave me alone. Nicholas seemed like the type to make his move when there weren\u2019t any witnesses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you got roped into this,\u201d I told him and continued to walk. Sawyer fell into stride beside me. \u201cI know it must be awkward for you considering...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big boy, Anna.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWhat we had was short, but I don\u2019t hold any ill feelings towards you. I guess you can\u2019t help who you fall in love with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in love with Adam,\u201d I retorted. Sawyer nodded his head and pursed his lips to mock my words. Was I in love with Adam? How was I supposed to know? I\u2019d never fallen in love before.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re a hot piece of ass, so you\u2019ll land on your feet,\u201d I told him. Sawyer pushed my arm, and I stumbled a couple inches. Laughing, I hit him back.</p><p>\u201cWell for that to happen, I\u2019d have to leave Wyoming. If you haven\u2019t noticed there aren\u2019t a lot of pickings here.\u201d</p><p>I frowned because he was right. Our pack was seriously lacking in the female department. Poor Elle and Sawyer were bound to end up alone if something didn\u2019t change.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I tapped his arm. \u201cJust sing to them, it made my panties drop.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer laughed. \u201cIs that the only thing that made you sleep with me? Are you one of those groupie girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d be lying if I said it didn\u2019t help.\u201d Sawyer and I were both laughing when someone called my name.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d</p><p>We stopped and turned to see Adam and Wade driving up the road.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh, I think it\u2019s time for your experiment,\u201d Sawyer teased.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Wade stopped the SUV alongside us. Adam sat in the passenger\u2019s seat, and his eyes flicked between Sawyer and me. Not that he had anything to worry about, Sawyer and I were just friends, but the jealousy in his sapphire eyes pleased me.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d Adam ordered. I said goodbye to Sawyer and hopped in the backseat. Wade pulled away and took off down the winding mountain road. The uncomfortable silence hung thick in the air. Both men\u2019s bodies were ridged and hard.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d I finally asked.</p><p>\u201cNowhere specific,\u201d Wade said. \u201cJust around town to get you used to humans.\u201d He looked over at Adam. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be necessary if your alpha would\u2019ve raised you right.\u201d</p><p>Adam released a heavy breath and continued to stare out the window. Wade returned his eyes to the road, and I slouched in my seat. In the four months I\u2019d been in Adam\u2019s care, he\u2019d taught me a lot about who I now was. I assumed the reason the leaders were being hard on him was because of the killings. There was a possibility that I was responsible, and Adam was the scapegoat for my alleged actions.</p><p>\u201cI went grocery shopping by myself a month ago, and I didn\u2019t attack anyone,\u201d I told Wade like this was the equivalent to winning a gold medal.</p><p>Wade looked at me through the rearview mirror and said, \u201cCongratulations, but from what I saw today you still aren\u2019t comfortable with humans.\u201d</p><p>I had the strong urge to stick my tongue out, but decided that would be immature and not help my cause. We sat in silence for the rest of the trip, which like everything else in Wyoming, took forever. Buffalo was at least forty-five minutes away, and the view outside my window was land with a few houses every ten miles or so. My mind traveled back to when I was still human. I adapted to living with Adam\u2019s pack so quickly I hadn\u2019t thought about the life I\u2019d lost. Not that I really had a life to speak of, but it was a lot simpler then. Sure I barely made enough money to get by and I came home to a dog at night, but my life was my own. Now, I could be a murderer and was obsessed with a man who was with someone else. Oh how the tides turn. I\u2019d traded one extreme\u2014boring life\u2014for another\u2014exciting and dangerous life.</p><p>I eyed the back of Adam\u2019s profile. His blonde hair was tucked behind his ear, giving a clear view of his strong jaw and full lips. Part of me wished I\u2019d given into him a month ago and to hell with the consequences. Of course that\u2019s how I felt now, sans sex. I hated the thought of them sharing a bed or worse\u2014their bodies.</p><p>I shook the thought from my mind. As much as I didn\u2019t like Eve, I felt like a horrible person for wanting her man. Adam was hers, and it wasn\u2019t right, or moral, to want otherwise. I felt like one of those bimbos who got involved with a married man and believed when he said \u201che\u2019s going to leave his wife.\u201d How pathetic was I? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head snapped up when Wade pulled into the theater. Not exactly the venue I\u2019d expected for testing my limitations to humans. The small cinema only showed two movies at a time and those movies had been out for months. Of course since I\u2019d been a werewolf for the past few months, I hadn\u2019t seen the flicks. Once Wade parked, he hopped out of the SUV and Adam and I followed. Downtown Buffalo could barely be considered a city. Its buildings were small and the majority sold hunting stuff and antiques. Even the theater was tiny with its square roof and bland plastered walls. If it wasn\u2019t for the sign announcing what it was, it could\u2019ve passed for a warehouse.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we seeing?\u201d No matter how sad the building was, I was excited to see a movie in an actual theater instead of in my living room. I guess that explained how pitiful my life was. Not that I was a social butterfly before becoming a werewolf, but I did have times I\u2019d have fun.</p><p>\u201cYou choose,\u201d Wade said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not here to have fun. We\u2019re here to see how you do sitting in a room with humans. We\u2019ll start here and see how you do just being around them, and then we\u2019ll interact, depending on how this goes.\u201d</p> <p>Great, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy the movie with two pairs of eyes judging my reactions to the crowd. Maybe I could stuff my face with buttery popcorn and get lost in some hot vampire action, so I wouldn\u2019t notice being stared at for two hours.</p><p>\u201cFright Night,\u201d I said, pointing to the poster of Colin Farrell in a tight white tank top. Both Wade and Adam groaned as I walked inside the building. I stopped short as a thought came to me. I leaned closer to Wade, cupped a hand in front of my mouth, and asked, \u201cAre vampires real?\u201d It seemed likely considering I was living proof werewolves weren\u2019t just the monsters fairytales are made of.</p><p>Wade sucked in a deep breath as if annoyed or pissed. \u201cYes, they exist.\u201d</p><p>My eyes shot wide. \u201cSeriously? Have you met any? Are they sexy and mysterious like in the movies and books?\u201d I couldn\u2019t keep the excitement out of my voice.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Wade said, smiling. \u201cThey don\u2019t sparkle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d The young girl behind the counter asked. I took a moment to judge my reaction to her. My wolf bristled underneath my skin as the girl stared me in the eyes. I sucked in a deep breath and tried to calm my inner beast.</p><p>\u201cThree for...Fright Night,\u201d Wade said dismally. I smiled at the girl, but turned towards Adam so my wolf had something more scrumptious to focus on. My clever trick worked because as soon as my eyes found those azure orbs, my body relaxed. Adam smiled and a shudder ran the length of my spine. Man, he was gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cCome on you two,\u201d Wade ordered and we followed him over to the concession stand. A young man with a skin condition smiled at us revealing braces wrapped around his teeth. Man, I\u2019m happy I\u2019m out of that awkward stage.</p><p>\u201cTell the man what you want, Anna,\u201d Wade said. I stepped closer to the counter, took another deep breath, and made sure my eyes were focused on the menu board instead of the kid. As I searched the set of choices, my stomach rumbled. I hadn\u2019t eaten at dinner and now I was feeling the effects of my lost appetite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a large popcorn, large coke, and nachos\u201d The young kid looked surprised at how much food I\u2019d ordered. His beady eyes flicked to my slim waistline and then he nodded. He probably thought I would scarf the greasy goodness down and throw it up later. Hey, as long as he didn\u2019t think I was a werewolf all was good.</p><p>After we had our junk food, we headed for the room that our movie was playing in. It wasn\u2019t hard to find, there were only two showings total. As I picked a row and walked towards the middle of the seating, Wade took the row behind me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see your reactions better if I sit behind you,\u201d he said as he sat down. Shrugging, I placed my soda in the drink holder and sat down as I tried not to drop my popcorn and nachos. Adam sat next to me, which was both awkward and exciting. Almost like we were on a date.</p><p>There weren\u2019t a lot of humans in the room, maybe six. So far my wolf was more focused on the food and Adam\u2019s close proximity to worry about them. The lights dimmed and the large screen flickered to life as previews started to play. I was aware that the arm rest to my right was pushed up and Adam\u2019s hand was resting against the side of my leg. I wondered if Wade would have a problem with Adam and mine\u2019s relationship, or if it was normal for alphas to sleep with the females in their packs. Knowing how Nicholas was, Wade probably wouldn\u2019t bat an eyelash if Adam stripped and mounted me right there. My wolf got excited thinking about it.</p><p>The spot that the back of Adam\u2019s hand touched tingled. Closing my eyes, I gave myself a pep talk to ignore those lustful feelings and concentrate on the screen in front of me. Unfortunately, the pep talk didn\u2019t work. When I opened my eyes, I snuck a peek at Adam and a sexy smirk lifted one side of his mouth. How I wanted to kiss those lips. Fisting a hand in my popcorn, I shoved the kernels into my mouth and ground them into nothingness. Adam turned his hand so his fingers faced my leg, and with the slightest movement, he caressed it. Heat flourished through my body. The arm holding the popcorn squeezed the bucket tighter while my free hand crushed the arm rest. What in the hell was he doing?</p><p>I can\u2019t focus on anything but you. Adam\u2019s voice sounded in my head and the intrusion was surprising enough that I jumped. Luckily, a scary preview was showing, and Wade would think I got scared. Adam didn\u2019t speak to us, well me, telepathically unless we were in wolf form.</p><p>Well, Wade is focusing on me too, so knock it off. I smiled, unable to contain it.</p><p>Oh, come on. Don\u2019t you want to see how far we can go before we\u2019re caught? His voice grew huskier.</p><p>I bit my lower lip as the heat settled between my legs. Considering he\u2019s right behind us, we won\u2019t get far. There may have been a bit of disappointment in my voice.</p> <p>Is that a challenge?</p><p>I suppose it is. I ran a hand over my mouth to conceal my growing smile.</p><p>\u201cAnna has to go to the restroom,\u201d Adam said, turning around to face Wade. My eyes shot wide as I realized what Adam was thinking. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should take her,\u201d Wade countered, and Adam\u2019s defenses perked up before he calmed himself down. \u201cAnna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I stammered. \u201cI\u2019m okay with Adam.\u201d I hoped the nervousness in my stomach didn\u2019t sound in my words.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but don\u2019t let her out of your sight,\u201d Wade warned Adam.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be on her like white on rice,\u201d Adam replied with a grin that caused my legs to shake. A whole month and he hadn\u2019t touched me. The anticipation was so strong I about sprinted to the bathroom.</p><p>As I stood I caught Wade\u2019s eyes and the suspicion within them. Looking away, I followed Adam out of the theater and towards the restroom. My heart was jackhammering in my chest.</p><p>You go in first, Adam said. Shouldering past him, I stepped into the small bathroom. Deciding it\u2019d be safer to hide in one of the stalls, I shoved the doors open on all of them and entered the last one. It would make it easier for Adam to know which one I was waiting for him in. I was so excited I felt jittery. Blowing into my hand, I checked my breath. Ack, popcorn, that couldn\u2019t be sexy. Slipping out of the stall, I turned on the faucet and brought a handful of water to my lips. Swishing it around, I spit into the sink and slipped back into the stall. It was the best I could do and hopefully Adam wouldn\u2019t mind too much.</p><p>Two minutes passed and no Adam. I leaned against the wall, shifting my feet back and forth and staring at my watch. Four minutes and still no Adam. Did I misread the situation, and he was just waiting for me to pee? That didn\u2019t make sense. After eight minutes, I was no longer jittery with excitement. I slipped out of the bathroom and headed out. Adam stood off to the side, cell phone pressed to his ear, and an annoyed look on his face.</p><p>\u201cEve, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. She\u2019s my responsibility, and I couldn\u2019t just shove my duties off on Wade. There\u2019s nothing going on between me and Anna.\u201d</p><p>And there it was, the proof I needed that Adam didn\u2019t feel the same way I did for him. My heart felt like it\u2019d fallen to my feet and my chest rose and fell heavily as I stared at him. He looked up and our eyes met. His eyebrows furrowed and his mouth hung open slightly as he realized I heard his conversation. I didn\u2019t want to hear anymore, I stalked back to the theater.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>If someone asked if Fright Night was good, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell them. After Adam returned from his phone conversation, he tried to talk to me through telepathy for the entire movie. I ignored him as best as I could, but it made focusing on the film difficult. The only good thing that came out of it was that I also couldn\u2019t focus on the humans. After the movie, we hopped back in the SUV, and Wade drove to Wal-Mart. It was the only store that was open all night and had a sufficient amount of people. I walked on the side of Wade where Adam wasn\u2019t. How could I believe he was my chante or that the heartfelt words he\u2019d spoken in the past had meaning. They were just that\u2014words.</p><p>\u201cYou did very well at the theater,\u201d Wade said, and I reined in my anger to pay attention.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said coolly. \u201cSo are vampires as sexy as Collin Farrell?\u201d I needed something to occupy my mind, so why not find out more about the fanged?</p><p>Wade laughed. \u201cOnly if they were sexy to begin with. Turning vampire isn\u2019t an instant beauty serum; they look just like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>I could have met one and not even known it. \u201cAre there any in Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are a few, but they tend to migrate to more crowded states.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever met one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wade said a bit annoyed. \u201cEnough about vamps. I need you to pay attention to the humans. Your wolf needs to interact with them.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, but kept my lips sealed. \u201cHello,\u201d I said to the greeter at the doors. The old gentleman smiled and my wolf perked up. I reminded myself that the elderly man wasn\u2019t challenging me, just simply smiling. Once we stepped into the large store the scent of human overwhelmed my senses. Sweat, perfume, cologne, urine, and food assaulted my nostrils and made my brain swirl with mixed emotions. My wolf wanted to growl, while I wanted to vomit. All the smells mixed together were enough to turn the greasy theater food sour in my stomach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We walked down the aisles in silence. Wade observed my body language, and I hoped he didn\u2019t notice I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the people. Instead, I stared at various items on the shelves. If a human crossed my line of sight, I\u2019d shift to another item.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Wade asked, using a psychiatrist tone.</p><p>\u201cWell, Doc, I\u2019m feeling a little agitated that I\u2019m being paraded through the store like a science project.\u201d Uh-oh, the bitchy attitude was a dead giveaway that the humans were getting to me. Not that I wanted to turn hairy and chomp down on some homo sapiens, but my wolf didn\u2019t enjoy their company. Her feelings make me agitated. I needed to calm down and show Wade they didn\u2019t have an affect over me.</p> <p>Wade growled low in his throat. \u201cIf dead bodies weren\u2019t showing up on Adam\u2019s mountain, you wouldn\u2019t be subjected to this experiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one body was found on the mountain,\u201d I argued. Not smart. Wade grabbed my arm and hauled me into an empty aisle.</p><p>\u201cYou will respect the leaders and their methods. I say you need to interact with humans, so you\u2019ll interact with them. No more back talk, understand?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and kept the snide remark on the tip on my tongue from slipping out.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now I want you to go up to the woman and ask where the paper plates are, got it?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded again and looked in the direction he pointed to. My eyes shot wide when I recognized the young woman\u2019s face. She was tall and slender with wavy brown hair that hit to the middle of her back. Large, almond-shaped, blue eyes studied some sort of pricing gun in her hand. With unsteady steps, I walked up to my old friend.</p><p>\u201cChelsea?\u201d I said with mock surprise. Chelsea\u2019s head popped up and her face brightened at seeing me. We\u2019d met in high school and had been almost as close as best friends. It wasn\u2019t until a year after school that we lost contact. I assumed she went away to college while I hung back.</p><p>\u201cAnna? Oh my gosh, it\u2019s been forever!\u201d Her arms went around my neck and squeezed. My body went rigid and on high alert. My wolf squirmed underneath my skin and fought to break free. Closing my eyes, I sucked in a breath through my nose and released it through my mouth. This is Chelsea, she\u2019s not a threat. Calm down.</p><p>When she released me I was a bit calmer. She didn\u2019t run away screaming, or look scared, so my eyes must have remained their normal brown. A wide smile stretched her lips and all the tension in my body subsided.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d I asked when I was sure words would leave my lips instead of a growl.</p><p>\u201cGood. I just finished school. I couldn\u2019t find a job in graphic design, so I came home, hence the horrible work attire.\u201d She held out her blue vest and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m living with my parents, but I\u2019ve almost have enough saved up to get my own place,\u201d she paused. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve always been a talker. How have you been? What school did you go to?\u201d</p> <p>I returned her smile and shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college. It wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d Chelsea nodded as if she knew as much. I was the type of kid to go to school and do my homework simply because I had to. I didn\u2019t strive for straight A\u2019s or have stacks of college pamphlets as a freshman.</p><p>\u201cI heard about your parents. I\u2019m so sorry. Are you living in their house?\u201d</p><p>No. I\u2019m a werewolf and living with a whole pack up in the mountains.</p><p>\u201cUm, no I sold it. Sad memories and all that,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Two large bodies sandwiched me and Chelsea\u2019s eyes went wide. I couldn\u2019t imagine what she was thinking as she took in Wade and Adam\u2019s huge frames next to my slim one. Both men towered over me. If anything, she\u2019d think they were my bodyguards.</p><p>\u201cDid you find the paper plates?\u201d Wade asked with a pointed look. I glanced back at Chelsea expectantly.</p><p>\u201cThere down that way, aisle seven,\u201d she said with awed tone. \u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d Chelsea nodded in Wade\u2019s direction. I wasn\u2019t sure if she gave a second glance at Adam, which was strange\u2014Adam was ten times hotter than Wade. But maybe I was biased.</p><p>Adam\u2019s body changed to steel at Chelsea\u2019s question, and before I could come up with an explanation, Adam stepped forward.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019d be me,\u201d he said, outstretching his hand. \u201cAdam Everwood. This is Wade Smith.\u201d Adam motioned with head to large man to my left. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoo, Wade Smith sounds like a spy\u2019s name.\u201d Chelsea giggled, and I knew she had a thing for my leader. If she only knew...</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, but we really must be going,\u201d Wade said, barely paying the poor girl any attention. Chelsea\u2019s smile straightened, and she focused back on me.</p><p>\u201cLet me give you my number. I\u2019d love to catch up.\u201d Her eyes shifted towards Wade then back to me. She pulled a piece of paper and pen out of her pocket and scribbled her phone number down.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I told her as I stuffed the paper into my pocket. Wade began to pull me away, but we stopped when Chelsea spoke again.</p><p>\u201cIt was so nice seeing you again, Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d I told her careful not to make her to think we\u2019d see each other again. My life was a hairy, complicated mess\u2014one that didn\u2019t allow humans.</p><p>\u201cNice meeting you too, Adam and Wade,\u201d she said, lingering on Wade\u2019s square face. He nodded and pulled me away. Once we were out of earshot and down aisle seven. Wade stopped and released my arm. His sudden personality change was strange, but didn\u2019t comment. Leaders were the alphas of all the werewolves, who was I to question their mood swings?</p><p>Wade closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cYou did very well with that woman,\u201d he said breathy.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you alright?\u201d He looked beaten, like he\u2019d just ran a marathon and had trouble holding up his large frame.</p><p>\u201cFine, it\u2019s just...nothing. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d I replied and then looked at Adam. \u201cMy boyfriend?\u201d I arched my eyebrows as I waited for his response.</p><p>\u201cWe needed a story,\u201d Adam explained. \u201cWe don\u2019t want her blabbing to other humans that she saw you with two dangerous-looking men and that you seemed on edge. That would raise red flags. Plus, she was enamored with Wade, so I didn\u2019t want to crush her hopes.\u201d Adam laughed and slapped Wade on the arm.</p><p>Back at the house, Wade excused himself and headed off into the woods. I was acutely aware I was alone with Adam. I made a beeline for the house when his fingers curled around my arm and stopped me.</p><p>\u201cAnna, wait.\u201d</p><p>I turned around, but looked off into the distance so I wouldn\u2019t get lost in his blue eyes or full, sexy lips. One smirk or wink and I\u2019d lose my resolve and forget that horrible phone conversation.</p><p>\u201cPlease join me,\u201d Adam said, and when I looked up he pointed to the back seat of the SUV. I scoffed and tried to pull away, but his grip tightened. \u201cSo we can talk in private,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>\u201cAdam, I\u2019m really over this whole thing,\u201d I told him. In honesty, I was. I was tired of wanting what I couldn\u2019t have and tired of hearing excuses, both his and mine.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said as he released me and scooted along the leather seats to make room for me. \u201cJust listen to what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m such a glutton for punishment. I slid into the car and shut the door, making sure to keep as far away from him as the small space would allow.</p><p>\u201cThere are things you don\u2019t understand, Anna,\u201d Adam began, and I rolled my eyes. Wasn\u2019t that always the excuse in this scenario? \u201cDid you expect me to tell Eve that I couldn\u2019t talk to her because you were waiting for me to ravish you in the theater bathroom?\u201d</p><p>A smile curled my lips at the thought of Eve\u2019s face if she\u2019d heard those words. Of course I wouldn\u2019t be smiling long if she had\u2014I\u2019d be dead.</p><p>\u201cAs my mate, and a pure bred werewolf, Eve has the right to kill any female who threatens her position. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying, Anna?\u201d</p><p>I looked over at him. His face was serious and his eyes were filled with an inner turmoil I\u2019d never seen.</p><p>\u201cAlphas sleep around all the time,\u201d I said, throwing a monkey wrench into his logic. Adam\u2019s arm closed the gap between us and his hand rested on my leg. Prickly tingles radiated up my thigh causing goose bumps along my skin.</p><p>\u201cThose encounters are purely sexual,\u201d Adam said. \u201cIf one threatens her position as alpha female, she can kill them. You have to know I don\u2019t just want you for sex. If that\u2019s all I wanted, I could visit any of the females here.\u201d He scooted closer, and I pressed against the door. I needed to keep a level head and not get swept away in the lust he always seemed to ignite within me. But he smelt so good, like the forest and spices. His tongue snuck out and licked his upper lip, the heat boiled between my legs. This man had the power to turn me into a blubbering idiot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not threatening her position,\u201d I whispered. Adam was so close the entire right side of his body pressed against me. He slung an arm across the back of the seat while his other hand held my chin.</p><p>\u201cAh, but you are,\u201d he said softly as he dipped his mouth to mine. \u201cYou will not have me while I\u2019m mated, and I cannot have another because of you. You\u2019ve already eradicated her from my mind and bed.\u201d His lips pressed against my mouth, and my whole body sagged as I lost myself in the kiss. \u201cMy mind and heart are full of only you, and Eve sees that. She\u2019s not jealous. She doesn\u2019t love me, nor I her. It\u2019s the power she\u2019s frightened of losing. You are mine, Anna. I feel it so strongly, like it\u2019s engraved in my heart. Eve doesn\u2019t belong by my side.\u201d</p><p>Adam brought his lips to mine, but I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what he said. Did he feel so strongly because I was his chante? Excitement and fear washed through me. Isn\u2019t this what you wanted? I thought as I focused on kissing Adam.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said as I pressed against his chest. Adam\u2019s eyes were a vibrant gold and glowed in the darkened car. The scent of his arousal permeated the air and called to me. \u201cWhy have your eyes changed?\u201d I asked after I got over the initial shock of the need coursing through my body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt happens when wolves are turned on.\u201d Adam didn\u2019t wait for a response. He laid back on the seat and dragged me with him so I was laying on top of his hard body.</p><p>\u201cWas that why Wade acted like strange tonight?\u201d</p><p>Adam grumbled. \u201cYes. I think he liked Chelsea as much as she liked him, and he had trouble controlling the urge to rip her clothes off in front of everyone. A male wolf\u2019s passion can get a little...well it turns us into savages sometimes and makes it hard to reign in our control,\u201d Adam grinned. \u201cKinda like how I\u2019m finding it very difficult to control myself right now.\u201d And just to show he was being honest, Adam tore my shirt down the front. Luckily, I\u2019d done laundry and wore one of my cute bras instead of the blas\u00e9 ones I wore when I didn\u2019t have anything else. Adam\u2019s lips kissed around the red lace, licking the plump flesh of my breasts. His fingers worked the clasp. With a hard thrust, his pelvis dug into the spot between my legs. Man, how I wanted him\u2014needed him. But if I gave in, I\u2019d be the other woman. That thought constantly nagged at my mind whenever I was around him, always ruining the moment.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d I told him as tears stung my eyes. Instead of focusing on Adam, I quickly tied my shirt together as best as I could and opened the door. Adam stopped me.</p><p>\u201cAnna, I love you,\u201d he blurted.</p><p>My breath caught in my throat and my heart stopped beating. The tears I\u2019d been trying to hold back spilled over my cheeks and my entire body was numb. His words were perfect, but the situation was all wrong.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...I have to go...I...\u201d I stuttered as I fell out of the car and ran. Adam didn\u2019t chase me, and I was happy for that. I needed time to think and clear my head, time to understand what all of it meant and how I should handle it. I bolted into the trees, jumping over rotting logs and rocks. After a while, I allowed the sounds of my heavy footfalls to overpower the questions in my head.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>\u201cNo....stop,\u201d the woman screamed. My teeth sank into her leg, just above her knee. Her weak fists pounded against my back. If I wasn\u2019t a wolf, I\u2019d have laughed at her feeble attempt to hurt me. A warm spray of her coppery blood splashed my mouth, a tingle of delight washed through me.</p><p>The woman continued to scream and flail. I needed to shut her up and quick! Pouncing, I pinned her shoulders with my large paws and growled, revealing my finely pointed teeth. Tears soaked her cheeks, her lips quivering as her eyes shot wide. I especially liked my reflection in them.</p><p>\u201cKim?\u201d A man called from about fifty feet away. We were hidden behind a garage, just out of view of the man. The woman cried out to get the man\u2019s attention, but I clamped down around her throat to cut off her plea. A melodic tone sounded from her jeans\u2014a cell phone.</p><p>\u201cKim?\u201d The man yelled again. I liked to enjoy my kill, but time was of the essence, and the man could find us at any minute. With just the right amount of pressure, my teeth popped through the woman\u2019s flesh, her body falling still. A prickle of excitement ran through my veins at ending her life, her blood coating my muzzle like war paint.</p><p>I was yanked out of my bed by two men. Their strong hands wrapped around my arms and hauled me out of my sleep. Once I was up, they let me fall to my bedroom floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell guys?\u201d I said, looking up at Wade and Nicholas with heavy eyelids. Both men\u2019s faces were deathly serious, their bodies ridged and emanating power.</p> <p>\u201cAnna, you are hereby convicted of murder,\u201d Wade said and I gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d I scrambled off the floor. Nicholas stepped in front of my door to make sure I didn\u2019t make a run for it.</p><p>\u201cLook at your feet,\u201d Wade said, his head nodding in their direction. My head fell, my eyes going to toes. They were covered in mud.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t,\u201d I shook my head back and forth as I stared at my feet. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean I killed someone,\u201d I managed to say, bringing my focus back to the leaders. Wade\u2019s features grew tighter, his lips thinned to a straight line. With a tight grasp, he yanked me out of my bedroom and towards the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said, his finger pointing towards the large mirror that sat above the double sinks. I was hesitant to see my reflection, afraid that whatever I saw would be the final nail in my coffin.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d Wade said a little louder. Peeling my eyes off the counter, I stared ahead. Red blotches of dried blood dotted my cheeks, forehead and neck. My hair was a stringy mess, leaves and other debris littering my blonde locks.</p><p>\u201cI...didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, my voice no more than a whisper. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d I shifted my eyes, unable to look at the evidence right in front of me.</p><p>\u201cThere was another body found early this morning,\u201d Wade said, his voice almost sad. \u201cDid you have another dream last night, Anna?\u201d</p> <p>Realization dawned on me as I remembered the dream I\u2019d been having right before I was yanked from my bed. In the confusion I\u2019d forgotten all about it.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I had that dream right before you woke me up,\u201d I said, my eyes pleading with Wade. Nicholas leaned against the door frame, his arms crossed and a smug look on his face. I hated him, hated being so close to him and what he\u2019d done to me.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t murder the woman,\u201d Wade said, his dark eyes boring into me. \u201cPerhaps you killed her earlier and were reliving the glory of the kill.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d I scoffed. \u201cI\u2019d never kill anyone.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter what words came out of my mouth, I couldn\u2019t fight the blood splattered on my face. I wanted to object and believe in my innocence, but I was starting to think I was guilty.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me how did this get here?\u201d Wade\u2019s fingers dug into my skin as he turned my face towards the mirror again. \u201cTell me why your feet are covered in dirt? Did you go out for a run last night and kill an animal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did go for a run, but not in wolf form, and no, I did not kill anything last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Elle said, peeking her head into the bathroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I caught her gaze in the mirror and instantly began to cry. I\u2019d grown fond of Elle, and now I was going to be killed for supposedly killing others.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t concern you,\u201d Nicholas said, stepping in front of her to block her way.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Adam asked, coming into view. \u201cShe\u2019s part of my pack, I deserve to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d My heart stopped beating for a millisecond as I remembered what he\u2019d told me last night.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Nicholas said snidely. \u201cLook at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware we convicted people without concrete proof,\u201d Adam said, shouldering past Nicholas and stopping just in front of me.</p><p>\u201cIs blood on her face, dirt on her feet, and the confession of having another dream about killing not proof enough?\u201d Wade bit out. It was a pity Wade was being such a jerk, I was starting to like him.</p><p>\u201cDoes the blood on her face match the murdered woman\u2019s? If she was the killer wouldn\u2019t she of woken up like this before? I find it a little odd that this happened after the leaders arrived,\u201d Adam countered. I watched the muscles in his arms flex as he crossed them across his expansive chest. He stared daggers at Wade, while I wished I could feel those arms surrounding me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting your feelings cloud your judgment,\u201d Wade said, ignoring Adam\u2019s question. \u201cIf this were any other person, you\u2019d be as ready to convict her as we are.\u201d</p><p>Was it that obvious? Did the entire pack know Adam and I had feelings for each other? I wondered if the leaders spoke to Adam about our predicament and reminded him of his duty to Eve. If they had, it didn\u2019t show. Adam wasn\u2019t ignoring me anymore and even put his neck on the line to defend me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Adam replied. \u201cI would want a fair trial for any member of my pack. And, as you know, as her alpha, I must agree with your verdict, or I can defend her.\u201d</p><p>Elle gasped from the doorway. Nicholas snorted as if what Adam said was the silliest thing he\u2019d heard. Wade released his grip on me and nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cWe have a member on the police force,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI\u2019ll have him run a DNA test on the blood found on Anna and the victim. If it\u2019s a match, will that be evidence enough for you? I\u2019d hate to have to kill two people because one of them is hard up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what? Why would you have to kill two people?\u201d I asked, turning to look at Wade.</p><p>\u201cHer lack of knowledge about our laws is astounding,\u201d Wade said to Adam. \u201cYour alpha is graciously ready to fight on your behalf. If an alpha believes that one of his wolves is being unfairly judged, he can fight one of the leaders. If he wins, the accused goes free,\u201d Wade told me.</p><p>My breath became labored as I thought about Adam fighting for me. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t believe in him, I knew he was strong, but there was a reason the leaders were leaders. They\u2019d been the strongest of the bloodline and earned their positions.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if he doesn\u2019t win?\u201d I asked, my voice breathy.</p><p>\u201cUse your imagination,\u201d Nicholas chimed in.</p><p>My head was shaking back and forth while words failed to form on my lips. I stared at Adam with wide eyes, tears streaming down my cheeks. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d I told him. \u201cIf I\u2019m killing people, I will accept the punishment.\u201d Even though my insides twisted in fear, my voice came out strong. I didn\u2019t want to die, but I wouldn\u2019t allow someone else pay for my crimes. If the blood on my face was in fact the murdered woman\u2019s, I deserved death. How could I live knowing that three people were dead because of me? I wasn\u2019t about to add another body to that count. Adam would live even if I had to shoot him with a tranquilizer gun so he\u2019d miss the fight.</p><p>\u201cIt seems your pack mate doesn\u2019t have as much faith in her innocence as you do, alpha.\u201d Nicholas snorted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d Adam said, his eyes falling to me. \u201cI have enough faith for the both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014yeah, you guys like each other,\u201d Nicolas said, walking into the bathroom and grabbing my arm.</p><p>Wade opened the medicine cabinet, grabbed a couple cotton swabs and began to swab the blood from my face. When he was happy with the amount he collected, he nodded towards Nicholas.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, resisting wherever it was he was trying to pull me. After what happened last time I was alone with him, I didn\u2019t want another occurrence. If what Adam said was true and Nicholas has some super lusty juju, then I\u2019d rather die than have my free will yanked from me.</p><p>\u201cAnna must be confined until I can get in touch with Doug,\u201d Wade said, holding Adam back when he tried to get in the between me and Nicholas. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a couple days for him to run the tests. We can\u2019t have her killing more people.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smirked at Adam and a rumble came from his chest. \u201cElle, you will stay with her at all times. If you so much as look away from her, it\u2019ll be your head, understand?\u201d Adam growled. \u201cAnd,\u201d he continued, shifting his eyes to Nicholas, \u201cif you touch her inappropriately, we won\u2019t have to wait for the results for a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas will not use his charms on her,\u201d Wade promised, giving Nicholas a warning glare. \u201cAnd Elle is welcome to keep her company. She\u2019s not to be let out of this house and a guard must be with her at all times. If word gets out that werewolves exist it\u2019ll cause a worldwide panic.\u201d Wade began to leave and then stopped. \u201cI like you, Anna, but I won\u2019t allow you to put our entire race in danger. If the test comes back positive, you will be put down.\u201d He turned and walked away, leaving me with my jaw on the floor.</p><p>\u201cAnna, calm down,\u201d Elle said, resting her hand on my shoulder to stop me. I\u2019d been pacing my room for the last two hours. Nicholas left his duty as guard and Michael had taken up post in front of my bedroom. He wouldn\u2019t allow me to close my door, afraid I\u2019d sneak out of my window.</p> <p>\u201cHow am I supposed to calm down?\u201d I shrieked. \u201cYou\u2019d be freaking out too if you knew you were going to die.\u201d I picked up pacing again. My fingernails were chewed down to nubs, and I was sure I\u2019d worn a trail into my carpet.</p><p>\u201cAre you psychic now?\u201d Elle asked with sarcasm. \u201cHave you seen the future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I told her. \u201cThis is serious....as in deadly serious!\u201d I trailed a finger across my throat to mimic a beheading. If I did die, at least it\u2019d be quick\u2014or at least I hoped.</p><p>\u201cI am being serious,\u201d Elle snapped back. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like you already know you\u2019re guilty and there\u2019s a headstone waiting for you. Besides...\u201d Elle glanced over at Michael whose back was turned towards us. Stepping close to me, she leaned in and whispered in my ear, \u201cYou know Adam isn\u2019t going to let anything happen to you, even if you are guilty, which I doubt.\u201d</p><p>Michael turned around at our sudden silence. Elle backed away and smiled at him. He didn\u2019t return the friendly gesture. Once he turned back around, I whispered back to Elle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let Adam kill himself for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike you could stop him,\u201d Elle replied and then mumbled, \u201cor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked a little louder than intended. Michael looked over his shoulder and glared at both of us. His eyes were baggy, as if he hadn\u2019t gotten any sleep. When he turned back around, I grabbed a hold of Elle\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you won\u2019t interfere with my sentencing.\u201d I couldn\u2019t deal with the fact that two people might die because of me. As much as Adam and Elle thought they could save me, it\u2019d only get them killed.</p><p>\u201cIf it were me, would you sit by and watch me die?\u201d Elle asked, crossing her arms and tilting her head in question.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me, and I say to stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Elle drawled out. \u201cLook whose growing into her big girl panties. It\u2019s about damn time.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, my frustration levels too high to form an argument with my friend. Instead, I ran my fingers through my hair and paced again. Even my wolf was agitated. I could feel her squirming underneath the surface, making my skin itch and my temper short. My reflection from this morning flashed into my mind. Red splatters coating my face and debris in my hair. What in the hell happened? Closing my eyes, I thought about the previous night. Sure I had the dream, but I couldn\u2019t remember one solid memory of killing anyone. The not knowing was driving me insane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get you some tea,\u201d Elle said, flipping her red hair over a shoulder. I watched as she sauntered out of the room and disappeared down the hall. Michael turned to look at me, his eyes shooting towards the window.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m just as curious as you guys to find out what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrection,\u201d Michael stated, turning so that he was facing me head on. \u201cWe already think you\u2019re guilty. The only reason we\u2019re running the test is to please your alpha. It may surprise you, but we don\u2019t like killing people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys seem ready to kill me,\u201d I retorted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different, you\u2019re a threat\u2014Adam isn\u2019t. It\u2019d be a shame to lose an alpha.\u201d Michael smiled and turned back around, leaning a shoulder against the wall. I sneered at his back and wished I had a silver bullet.</p><p>Sitting on my bed, I eyed my alarm clock. It\u2019d been two hours since Adam and Wade left. What was taking them so long? Granted they wouldn\u2019t have the results for a couple days, but I needed to speak to Adam, to find out what, if anything, they found out. Looking around the room, my gaze settled on my dresser. Inside was the book we\u2019d stolen from Adam and never put back. If the leaders decided to search my room, they could add thief to the charges against me. The thought of Adam and the events from last night popped into my head. He said those three terrifying words, words that had never been spoken to me. I didn\u2019t know how I felt about him, but having the alpha confess he loved me was just another problem I faced. He knew we couldn\u2019t be together, so what was the point in telling me how he felt? It only complicated how my feelings and left me lost on what I should do. It was a sick twisted game of torture where there were no winners.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d Elle said, bringing me out of head. I looked up and reached for the cup of hot tea. The scent was harsh and caused my upper lip to draw up on my teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I held the cup out as far away from me as possible.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tea,\u201d Elle stated.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, this doesn\u2019t smell like any kind of tea I\u2019ve ever had before. What\u2019s in it?\u201d</p><p>Elle cocked a hip and crossed her arms, giving me a look that said I should shut up and down the nasty smelling liquid. With an arched eyebrow, Elle nodded towards my cup and waited until I took a sip.</p><p>Bringing the mug to my lips, I allowed a drizzle to coat my tongue and almost gagged. The taste was worse than the smell.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, what is this?\u201d I asked around a cough. My tongue tingled and my wolf retreated, if that made sense. I could feel her presence almost cowering, her strength waning.</p><p>Elle walked over to the bed and sat beside me. Holding onto the bed with both hands, she leaned forward, her copper hair spilling over her shoulders. With a sideways glance, her green eyes glinted as her lips whispered, \u201cWolfsbane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shrieked and dropped the cup. The brownish green liquid soaked into my carpet, and I edged back onto my bed. Michael turned around and eyed both of us before his gaze found the stain on the floor.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a bit shaken up and clumsy,\u201d Elle lied. Michael rolled his eyes and turned back around. Elle grabbed my arm and tugged me towards her until our faces were touching.</p><p>\u201cYou need to drink it,\u201d she bit out. \u201cIt\u2019ll help you calm down and get out of your head for a while.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s poison,\u201d I hissed, knowing why my wolf shied away from it. The herb was deadly to werewolves, and I\u2019d ingested some of it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only poisonous in large quantities.\u201d Elle slipped off of the bed, bent down and retrieved my cup. Walking over to my dresser, she lifted a kettle and refilled my mug. Looking over, she raised her cup towards me and then downed its contents.</p><p>I watched her with wide eyes, worried she\u2019d just sealed her fate, and I\u2019d be burying my friend come morning.</p><p>After drinking the tea, she filled the cup up again and walked back over to me. \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>Biting my lip, I looked up and then down at the glass. When it seemed Elle was fine and what she said must be true, I clasped the mug.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d I asked as I stared at the liquid.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like puffer fish,\u201d Elle said and I frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s poisonous, but when it\u2019s sliced just right, it can be eaten. The same goes for wolfsbane. A little is harmless.\u201d</p><p>Her comparison left a lot to be desired, but I believed her. Slowly raising the cup to my lips, I allowed a small portion to flood my mouth. My tongue tingled and my wolf scurried away. Swallowing the tea, I took another drink and then another until the cup was empty. When I finished the last of the drink, I felt strangely at peace. The burden of whether I was a killer, my complicated relationship with Adam, and the fear of possibly dying all vanished.</p><p>\u201cSee, isn\u2019t that better?\u201d Elle asked as she tugged the covers back and helped me slip into bed. The warmth of my blankets surrounded me like serene cocoon. My eyelids grew heavy and drooped closed. I snapped them open. Elle\u2019s red hair glowed as she blocked out the light from my ceiling. Leaning over me, she pressed a kiss to my forehead and whispered, \u201cGoodnight, Anna.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Flashes of forest raced through my mind as I tried to outrun the wolf. My legs were tired from my earlier jog, now burning and growing weak. Still, I kept running. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was falling over a cliff. The air whooshed my hair out and into my face. A sharp, searing pain shot through my arm, causing me to cry out. Like the event was on fast forward, I was on the ground listening to two people talk. Tilting my head back, I stared at the two naked bodies and shock grabbed ahold of my lungs and squeezed.</p><p>My eyes shot open. Reaching a hand up, I rested it over my beating heart that seemed on a mission to bruise my ribcage. Sitting up and hugging my knees to my chest, my eyes darted around my bedroom. The dream was a vivid replay of when I\u2019d been attacked by the wolf, the day my life changed forever. Those events were fuzzy at best and revisiting them was discomforting. In my dream, I\u2019d seen Adam standing next to Eve, or at least I think it was Eve. Her hair was longer and a darker shade of brown. Even Adam looked slightly different. His hair was to the middle of his chest and his eyes seemed more hazel than blue. Although sorrow smothered his face, a trace of ominous rejoice was also there. I imagined the whole thing. It\u2019s just my brain\u2019s way of dealing with all of the drama in my life.</p><p>Two loud bangs startled me. The visitor didn\u2019t wait for my invitation, instead the door swung open and Wade stood on the other side. My heart pounded in my chest as I waited for the news. Did he already have the results of the test and was he coming to kill me?</p> <p>\u201cGet up,\u201d he ordered. Glancing at the clock, I realized it was still the same day only later. The wolfsbane tea knocked me out, and I\u2019d slept for nine hours. Now the sky was dark and the crickets chirped. I could see the glow of a fire in the backyard and hear the strum of Sawyer\u2019s guitar. Bonfires were a common thing in the summer, something I loved.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d I edged out of bed, grabbing a rubber band off my nightstand. Now was not the time to worry about whether my hair was presentable or not. My entire body trembled as I thought that I could die tonight. There was so much I wanted to do, so much I hadn\u2019t said to a particular alpha. I finally found a group of people I considered family, and now I\u2019d lose them\u2014or rather they\u2019d lose me.</p><p>\u201cMeeting at Adam\u2019s,\u201d Wade said, his tone lacking any semblance of emotion. His face was stony and his eyes serious\u2014not good. I glanced at my dresser, the place that held the stolen book. If I were going to die, I didn\u2019t want Adam finding it later and thinking I was a thief, even if I was. Getting it out without Wade seeing was going to be a problem.</p><p>\u201cCould you turn around?\u201d I asked and was rewarded with an annoyed groan. \u201cI need to change shirts,\u201d I lied. Wade\u2019s eyes went to my window and then he turned around. Being treated like a criminal was getting old. Did he really think I\u2019d make a break for it with him only a few feet away?</p><p>Opening my closet, I dug around until I found my messenger bag. Moving quickly, I opened my drawer and shuffled the large book inside. After I was sure the book was securely hidden, I changed my shirt quickly.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said as I slung the strap to my purse around my chest. Wade eyed my accessory, but didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he moved to the side and held out his arm as a sign that I should go first.</p><p>Having him walk behind me was being led to the gallows by the undertaker. My muscles were tense and the hairs on my arms stood on end. Even my wolf was silent, either scared or still loopy from the wolfsbane.</p><p>\u201cSo...what\u2019s the verdict?\u201d I looked over my shoulder, but kept walking towards the living room. Out of my peripheral I saw the gang circled around the fire going on with their lives. I desperately wanted to be part of their carelessness. I wanted to hear Sawyer sing, listen to Joe\u2019s jokes, and eat large amounts of grilled meats. Unfortunately, fate had something else in store for me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it at Adam\u2019s,\u201d Wade responded. Would they set up a time and date that Adam would have to fight for my freedom, or did they plan to kill me without the knowledge of the pack? Not that any of them would put up too much of a fight, except Adam and maybe Elle. If I was responsible, I put their lives in danger. The secret of our kind could not get out without serious repercussions. That meant if I was the wolf strolling around attacking humans, I needed to be put down.</p><p>As Wade and I climbed into his SUV, I stared out the window and thought about my dream. It\u2019s not easy trying to decipher whether there\u2019s any truth to a hallucination. The fact that all my other dreams had come true was a bit alarming. Was Eve the one killing humans and Adam knew it? The short drive seemed to last forever. I couldn\u2019t stop fidgeting, wondering, and worrying about what I\u2019d learn tonight. When Wade pulled to a stop outside of Adam\u2019s house, he got out while I waited in the car. Adam\u2019s house, once normal, now scared the hell out of me. Inside the leaders and my fate waited for me. I thought for sure I\u2019d be strong and accept whatever verdict they came to, but now that I was about to hear it, all I wanted to do was wake up from this nightmare.</p><p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d Wade asked, tapping on the passenger side window.</p> <p>I nodded, clasping the door handle and slowly opening it. The air in my lungs thinned as I tried to suck in a deep breath. I was sure that if I looked down, I\u2019d see my shirt pulsating from the violent beat of my heart. I couldn\u2019t help but think that I was supposed to die three months ago. I was obviously in the right place at the right time for fates sneaky plan to work, although it hadn\u2019t. I\u2019d survived my attack and now death had circled back around to claim me again. As Wade and I walked up to Adam\u2019s house, I saw the life I\u2019d reclaimed slowly slipping out of my grasp. Flashes of my bloody reflection, the dreams, and how I reacted to humans bombarded my mind. The puzzle pieces slipped together. The wait no longer felt unbearable because I knew I was to blame. This whole time the signs were smack dab in front of me and my denial made me blind to them.</p><p>Wade stepped through the front door; I was hesitant to follow. I could hear the leaders clamoring inside and Adam shouting back. My name was the topic of their heated discussion, a fact that didn\u2019t help my feet move forward.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Wade said, wrapping an arm around my shoulders and guiding me into the house. \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he called out and the argument ceased.</p><p>As we rounded the corner to the dining room, everyone\u2019s heads snapped up, their steely eyes pinning me in my place. The only person I could focus on was Adam. He sat at the head of the table, his hair messy and his eyes tired. The atmosphere of the room was thick with tension and anger. My skin tingled with the sensation of unease as my wolf gauged the situation. No matter if I accepted the guilty verdict, my wolf wouldn\u2019t bow so easily.</p><p>\u201cSit, please,\u201d Wade instructed as he pulled out a chair at the end of the table. Glancing down, I slid into the seat and closed my eyes for a split second. When I looked back up, my gaze found Eve\u2019s. She sat on Adam\u2019s right, her hands clasped in front of her and an evil smirk on her lips. Now that I was in the presence of both of them, my dream seemed more real. Though Adam claimed he didn\u2019t love Eve, he stood beside her. I wanted to believe that he felt something for me, possibly loved me, but that was just me being foolish. If he\u2019d really loved me, wouldn\u2019t he have left Eve for me? Wouldn\u2019t he have made a proclamation to the leaders that he wanted to have me as his mate? I knew there was a lot of political crap, but I also knew that those kinds of things didn\u2019t, or shouldn\u2019t, pertain to matters of the heart.</p><p>\u201cAnna, we received the test back early,\u201d Wade said as he sat down to my left. A red folder lay in front of him on the table, his fingers peeling back the flap to reveal the papers inside.</p><p>\u201cI need a minute,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cSorry...I just...I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Slipping out of the chair, I raced to the bathroom. Shutting the door, I braced both hands on either side of the sink and hung my head. Maybe I wasn\u2019t as at peace with the news as I thought I\u2019d be. What normal person would be?</p><p>Looking up, I caught my reflection and shook my head. If my parents were alive, what would they say? Would I even be in this mess? I cringed at what they\u2019d think of me now. How they\u2019d look at me knowing I killed three people. I could barely look at myself without repulsion. The beast I thought I had under control, controlled me all along.</p> <p>Two soft knocks sounded at the door. My head snapped in the direction and then at the small window over the toilet. The prospect of running was so damn alluring. But being on the run for the rest of my life was not.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d Adam said softly.</p><p>My entire body sagged at hearing his voice. Clasping the handle, I opened the door and swallowed around the lump in my throat. Adam watched me with caution, almost sorrow. The expression on his face told me all I needed to know. Why would he look so sad if I were innocent?</p><p>Stepping inside, Adam closed the door behind him. His arms went around my body as he hugged me to his chest. Resting his head on mine, he said, \u201cI love you.\u201d The words were so soft I barely caught them. I wanted to forget about the leaders waiting in the other room and lose myself in his embrace, but my dream wouldn\u2019t allow me to. Adam\u2019s arms no longer felt welcoming. All I could think about was the vision of him standing next to Eve while I lay dying in front of them and all the times he pretended he didn\u2019t know who attacked me.</p><p>Stepping back, I wrapped my arms around myself and stared at the floor. I couldn\u2019t gaze into those sapphire eyes without crying or getting so angry I would attack him. The confliction of emotions was enough to drive me insane.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Adam asked, stepping forward.</p><p>I held out my hand to stop him and took a step back. \u201cDo you know who changed me?\u201d I decided to ask again so I could watch his facial expression closer this time.</p><p>Adam\u2019s brow arched in confusion. \u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond right away. I studied his face and body language. He didn\u2019t tense or look away from my hard stare. For all intents and purposes, he seemed legitimately confused by my question. So why did I still feel uneasy towards him? Did it even matter if I was going to be sentenced to death? Maybe it was my way to hold onto hope. Part of me had faith that my life wouldn\u2019t end, and Adam and I had a future. Stupid, I know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had another dream,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt was of the day I was attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, why are we discussing this? The leaders are waiting for you, and they\u2019re already in a foul mood.\u201d Adam stepped forward again and I stepped back.</p><p>\u201cIn my dream, I saw the faces of two people,\u201d I continued. Adam\u2019s body grew slightly stiff, barely noticeable, but I\u2019d caught it. His fingers flexed at his sides and he glanced away when I continued to stare at him.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this later. Right now, we need to finish up with this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a woman...and a man,\u201d I said, ignoring his attempts to distract me. I paused for a few seconds. As I looked at Adam, I tried to see the truth of my dream. Was the Adam I knew capable of keeping such a secret? Was that the reason why he found me? Because he\u2019d been there when it happened?</p><p>\u201cAnna, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Adam said, his tone hard.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know who they were, Adam?\u201d</p><p>The door swung open and broke my attention.</p> <p>\u201cAnna, we\u2019ve waited long enough,\u201d Wade said. He walked in the room and grasped my wrist, his fingers digging into my skin a little harder than necessary. As he pulled me out of the room, I looked back at Adam. He stared me with an emotion I couldn\u2019t put into words\u2014uncertainty maybe?</p><p>Sitting back in front of the leaders, I clasped my hands in my lap and stared straight ahead. I couldn\u2019t think about my dream or if there was any truth to it. If I were going to be sentenced to death, what was the point in worrying about who\u2019d turned me? The reason I wanted to know, needed to know, was because of my feelings for Adam. Sure I wanted to know who attacked me and changed my life forever, but the idea of Adam lying to me for this long was almost unbearable. Were the feelings I thought I felt real or a product of manipulation?</p><p>\u201cAnna, as I said before we have the results of the test,\u201d Wade said as he lifted the thin, white paper off the table. His eyes moved from side to side as he read the black text.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you want to say before I read this aloud?\u201d</p><p>I thought for a moment. \u201cOnly that if I am guilty, it was done unconsciously. I don\u2019t want to hurt people any more than you guys want me to. If by some chance my wolf has taken over and done these horrible things, I accept your punishment.\u201d I\u2019d forgotten to breathe while talking, so I took a deep breath and settled in for the inevitable.</p><p>Adam walked into the room and stood to my left. I could see out of the corner of my eye that his hands were fisted at his sides. I cut my eyes across the table and glanced at Eve. She stared straight at me. Her face was serious, but I could see the gleam of happiness behind her steely brown eyes. If the leaders weren\u2019t here, she\u2019d jump up for joy.</p> <p>\u201cThe test concludes that the blood on your face was that of the victim, Mary Hillson,\u201d Wade said, looking at me over the top of the paper.</p><p>My stomach sunk and my heart stopped beating as I heard his words. I was the killer, the one tearing humans\u2019 throats out, and I enjoyed every minute of it. A shiver of disgust trailed up my spine. Bile rose in my throat and sweat broke out along my forehead.</p><p>\u201cThere were a few drops of your blood mixed with Ms. Hillson\u2019s,\u201d Wade continued. \u201cAnd a couple specks of blood we have yet to determine who they belongs to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I mumbled, still trying to come to grips that I was guilty.</p><p>\u201cThat means,\u201d Adam began when Wade started to talk, \u201cthat there could have been someone else with you. Perhaps it\u2019s a setup and someone is trying to make you look guilty.\u201d I looked up at Adam, surprised that he still thought I was innocent.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bull,\u201d Michael argued. \u201cShe had the dreams, and then we find her with the victim\u2019s blood splattered all over her face and her feet muddy. Did this someone also go through the trouble of slathering her toes in dirt just so she looked guiltier?\u201d He snorted and shook his head.</p><p>I had to admit it was pretty farfetched. Wouldn\u2019t I have woken up if someone was in my room spraying me with blood and mud? I kept my objections to myself, though, because right then another fight broke out. The leaders were arguing with Adam as he pleaded my case. Different theories went back and forth and were shot down by one or more leaders. Adam continued to think of reasons why I looked guilty, but was innocent. After a while I zoned out and went inside my own head. I\u2019d really stepped in it this time, and Adam\u2019s feeble attempts to pull me out didn\u2019t seem to be working.</p><p>\u201cI have the right to defend her if I do not agree with your judgment,\u201d Adam snarled, bringing me out of my zoned out state. Had they stated what their judgment was and I hadn\u2019t heard? Obviously it was bad if Adam would to put his life on the line.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stupid man,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cGoing against the leaders is a death wish. Is she really worth it?\u201d He nodded in my direction.</p><p>My head shook from side to side, but my lips wouldn\u2019t work. I looked up at Adam, begging with my eyes for him to rethink what he was saying. The room was quiet while they waited for Adam\u2019s response. Out of curiosity, I glanced at Eve. She was seething. Her jaw was clenched tight and her brown eyes had a slight golden glow to them. Her shoulders were stiff, nostrils flared, and the murderous stare she gave me said that if she had anything to say about it, I\u2019d be dead come morning.</p><p>Standing up, I cut in front of Adam and said, \u201cCan I refuse his offering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Adam said incredulously. \u201cAre you in such a hurry to die, Anna?\u201d</p><p>I ignored the anger in his voice and waited for the leaders to answer me. I would not allow Adam to kill himself. I could feel anger radiating off of him as he stood behind me. I\u2019d much rather him be pissed than marching off to fight.</p><p>\u201cIf you object to your alpha\u2019s help, there\u2019s nothing Adam can say about it,\u201d Wade said, almost regretfully.</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d Adam spat, turning around and punching the nearby wall. He stalked off into another room, the door slamming so hard it rattled the room. Eve stood, walked around the table, and stopped as she passed me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been nice knowing you. On second thought, no it hasn\u2019t.\u201d She smiled and left the room, probably to bitch at her mate. I hated, absolutely hated, that she and Adam would still be together after I bit the dust. If I had one dying wish, it\u2019d be that Adam would be rid of her for once and all. Maybe he\u2019d find someone to make him happy instead of being obligated to her.</p><p>\u201cWhen does it happen?\u201d I asked, hugging my arms to my chest.</p><p>\u201cNormally, a sort of assembly is called where you pack mates stand witness to your death,\u201d Wades said with a bit of unease. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say Wade was almost sad.</p><p>\u201cSo...tomorrow night?\u201d Something was seriously wrong with me if I was discussing my death as calmly as a summer morning. It was like I had shut down and accepted it. I didn\u2019t need to be told how unusual that was, I knew.</p><p>Wade looked at the men sitting at the table. They all shrugged as if to say that was fine with them. At least I\u2019d have one more day to say my goodbyes. Maybe I\u2019d contact the families of the murdered and apologize. I could feign mental illness or some nonsense to help them understand why I did what I did. Not that any excuse would make them okay with the fact they\u2019d lost a loved one. My stomach lurched at the thought. I remembered how it felt when I lost my parents. That was a feeling I didn\u2019t want to bestow on anyone, yet I had.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night then,\u201d Wade answered, rising from his chair. I turned to leave, but stopped when Wade called my name.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t run,\u201d I told him. I needed some time alone. He didn\u2019t look like he liked that idea, but he didn\u2019t press further. He nodded, his eyes full of understanding, and I walked out.</p><p>I made it back to my house when someone grabbed me from behind. I whirled around, ready to punch my attacker when two sapphire eyes caught the light. Adam\u2019s face was full of fury, but his eyes were so sad my breath caught in my throat. If anything would make me run, it was this man. If I could spend the rest of my life with him, I\u2019d gladly play the part of an outlaw. Never seeing Adam again was the only thing that weighed on my mind. What about the fact that you killed three people? I closed my eyes and shook away the thought. The only thing I could do about that was pay with my life. Give mine for taking theirs.</p><p>Adam didn\u2019t speak. Instead, his big arms encircled my waist, and he squeezed me to his chest. His head rested on mine as his breath stirred my hair. The silence of the night and the beating of our hearts was a melody so hauntingly beautiful I closed my eyes and focused on the tune. As I listened, our heartbeats were in sync. As I thought about it, mine began to beat harder. Adam\u2019s rhythm picked up in pace and matched mine perfectly. I stepped out of his embrace and stared at him dumbfounded. It could be that because I was loyal to him and he was my alpha, my wolf was in tune with him. Maybe it was some sort of werewolf thing I didn\u2019t know about. Still, something told me it wasn\u2019t a connection between alpha and subordinate. My hand fell to my side where my fingers brushed against my messenger bag and the heavy book I\u2019d forgotten to return. Maybe the beating of our hearts had something to do with a myth that lay within its pages.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d Adam finally spoke, his eyes crinkling as he stared at me. \u201cYou can\u2019t lie down and die, Anna. You and I both know you did not kill those people.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the ground, unable to see the anger on his face. What if I did give in to hope and come tomorrow night, it let me down? That\u2019d be worse than having an entire day to accept what was coming.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t argue with the facts,\u201d I told him, glancing up to judge his reaction.</p><p>He took a step back and scrubbed a hand over his face as if that\u2019d erase the frustration he was feeling. \u201cThat test was not proof you killed that lady\u2014or the others. A trace of someone else\u2019s blood was found. Maybe that was the actual killer. Yet you\u2019re so ready to take the blame.\u201d As he talked his words got louder and louder until he was yelling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What could I say that would calm him down? No matter what was said anger would be the result. I was dead set on accepting the leader\u2019s punishment, and Adam was dead set against it. Instead of trying to diffuse the situation, I remained quiet. Adam needed an outlet for his anger, and I was willing to be that for him.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Adam spoke again. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything you want to live for?\u201d</p><p>I knew it was a loaded question. What he really meant was, wasn\u2019t he important enough to me to fight for my life, so we could be together. Tears blurred my eyes and splashed against my cheeks as I looked away. I couldn\u2019t go down that road again. I wouldn\u2019t bring up the fact that even if I did lived, he was still mated to Eve. That was like chasing a merry-go-round, it never went anywhere except in circles. I thought about telling him how much he meant to me, but I faced the same problem. What would be the point in pouring my heart out when nothing would come of it? I never thought about fate or destiny until I became a werewolf. Now, more than ever, I was convinced it was a heartless bitch that got off on screwing up people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t discuss this anymore.\u201d I turned to leave, but Adam was in front of me so quickly I almost ran into him. Both of his hands gripped my arms as he stared down at me. I wondered if our hearts were still in sync and if his was beating as hard as mine.</p><p>\u201cGive me tonight, Anna. I know your mind is made up and there\u2019s nothing I can do to change it. Please just give me tonight.\u201d</p><p>My tears picked up as if his words had turned on a faucet. My lip quivered and my nose filled. I was pretty sure I wasn\u2019t much to look at, at that moment, but Adam\u2019s interest never wavered. I planned on locking myself in my room and staring at a picture of my parents until sleep claimed me, but as Adam stood in front of me, I knew it\u2019d be stupid not to share my last night with him.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Adam took me to a small cabin that sat higher up in the mountains. It looked like an abandoned hunting building that hadn\u2019t been used in a long time. A thick layer of dust covered every square inch. Aside from a wood burning stove and a set of bunk beds, there wasn\u2019t anything else in the space. Two small windows on either side of the room were covered with red and green plaid curtains. The walls were wood planks that looked like they\u2019d been recycled from an old barn. I stood beside the door as Adam got to work at starting a fire. Being at this high of altitude there was still snow on the ground and a chill in the air. The night had taken a lot out of me emotionally. My body was tired and lethargic, even my wolf was quiet. Adam hadn\u2019t spoken much on the drive up. Instead, he seemed oddly focused on his thoughts, and I let him. I was too overwhelmed with my own problems to dissect his.</p> <p>Once the fire was started, Adam looked back at me. The space between us felt more like miles than feet. We stood at a standstill as we observed each other, the unspoken words so heavy they were like a physical weight bearing down on me. No thoughts occupied my mind as I stared at the man I\u2019d wanted so badly, but never gave into. All of the rejecting seemed so pointless now.</p><p>Adam took slow, calculated steps towards me, and my body tensed in response. I knew what was going to happen, yet I wasn\u2019t ready for it. At least, I didn\u2019t think I was. My mind wasn\u2019t in the right place to fully appreciate his company.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Anna?\u201d Adam\u2019s head tilted to the side and he watched me through thick lashes. His mouth was slightly upturned, but his smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I hated how small my voice sounded. Now that I needed the strength of my werewolf, the bitch was cowering somewhere within me. I needed that extra helping of sass only she provided. Without her I was weak and vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t going to die tomorrow, what would you want out of life?\u201d Adam asked again, his fingers trailing down to the buttons on his shirt. One by one he popped them open until ridges of muscle were displayed.</p><p>My eyes stared at the small portion of exposed flesh as I answered. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d It was as honest of answer I could give him. Before I became werewolf, I didn\u2019t have a future mapped out. I worked my job, paid my bills, and lived one day at a time. I learned when my parents died that the future could be short. What was the point in planning for something that may not come?</p> <p>\u201cWell that\u2019s just not true, is it?\u201d Adam said, taking a few steps closer. \u201cYou\u2019re not the type to settle down behind a white picket fence and taxi rug-rats to soccer matches. So tell me, what type are you? What do you crave from life?\u201d</p><p>I drew my eyes up and met his, they held a challenge I wasn\u2019t getting. A fire burned behind those sapphires and heated me from the inside out. I felt more alive as something stirred between me and Adam.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t figured it out yet,\u201d I responded, standing up straighter. At the moment, I was longing for the man in front of me. My lethargic body had been awakened by his sexuality. Without thinking, I licked my lips and watched him through hooded eyelids.</p><p>Adam slipped his flannel shirt over his broad shoulders slowly and then tossed it onto the bed. The sight of him in the flesh was breathtaking. I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes from roaming over every square inch that showed. A trail of sandy brown hair went from his abdomen and below his pants. His jeans hung low on his hips, revealing the sexiest \u201cV\u201d I\u2019d ever seen. Adam\u2019s skin was sun-kissed and golden, the light reflecting off of it. I crossed my arms over my chest and dug my nails into my palms. Giving into Adam would not change anything. I couldn\u2019t allow myself to fall victim to the fantasies I once had of the two of us being together. I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d give him tonight, but it wouldn\u2019t change what tomorrow would bring.</p><p>With slow, smooth steps, Adam stepped even closer. His hand reached out, and his fingers curled under the strap of my messenger bag. As he drew the purse away, he set it on the floor. A split second of panic pounded through me as I worried he\u2019d find out what was in the bag and that I\u2019d stolen it from him. That moment was quickly squashed when his attention was focused back on me. With his pointer finger, he tilted my chin up and leaned forward. He hovered in front of my mouth, his lips teasing mine.</p><p>\u201cSince you don\u2019t seem to know what you want, let me enlighten you,\u201d Adam said, his breath caressing my face.</p><p>I swallowed hard and tried to remain calm. So many times I\u2019d been this close to him and rejected what we both wanted. Tonight I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d have the strength to deny the one thing I craved from life, the one thing I wouldn\u2019t admit to him. He was the one thing I wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou want adventure,\u201d Adam began, pressing a soft kiss to my eager lips. \u201cYou want a life full of excitement.\u201d His mouth trailed down my neck, goose bumps broke out along my skin. \u201cYou want spontaneity.\u201d He ran his hands down the side of my stomach, his fingers gripping the hem of my tank top. My chest rose and fell in anticipation and nervousness. A smirk lifted his lips as he tugged my shirt over my head. I could see my breasts rising and falling as my breathing picked up.</p> <p>Adam walked around me, my head swiveling to watch him. He was the sexiest predator and I would willingly be his prey. With one hand he brushed my blonde hair to the side and kissed up the length of my neck. \u201cYou want passion.\u201d While I was distracted by the sensation of his delectable kisses, he unclasped my bra. Drawling the straps over my shoulders, he let it fall to the floor. My hands instinctively went up to cover myself.</p><p>Being like this with Adam was so much different than it had been with Sawyer. With Sawyer it had just been sex, but with Adam I had stronger feelings. I felt as nervous as a virgin on her wedding night. Adam\u2019s eyes devoured me and left me breathless. Here was a man who wanted to claim my body, his sheer presence consumed me. Out of all the men I\u2019d met, Adam was the only one who could make me forget myself.</p><p>As he walked around me, he spoke with authority. \u201cTonight you\u2019ll be mine, Anna. No more scurrying away. No more teasing. No more talk of me and Eve. Tonight it\u2019s you and me. Tonight...I\u2019ll make you moan for me.\u201d</p><p>I was practically moaning already. His dominance was a major turn on. I loved a man who knew what he wanted and took it\u2014so long as the woman was willing\u2014and believe me, I was willing.</p><p>Adam stood in front of me. I couldn\u2019t speak as I watched him stake out my body. Slowly, he knelt in front of me, his hands resting on my hips, his fingers indenting my flesh. His mouth enclosed around the button on my shorts. Somehow he managed to unfasten them, his teeth clasping the zipper and finishing the job. I knew my mouth was hanging open as I watched him slide them down my legs, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I was a raging ball of hormones. Even my wolf perked up. She sent a wave of want through my body so intense I about tackled Adam to the floor. The only thing that held me back was how nervous I was. Adam was going to be a game changer. Good thing I wouldn\u2019t be around after tomorrow night, otherwise I\u2019d become a slave for him. After I got a taste of my alpha, I\u2019d be his mistress without so much as an argument. Eve who?</p><p>I shook away the thoughts. We only had tonight and that was all that mattered. I no longer needed to worry about becoming a mistress or being treated as an unequal. Tonight was about me and Adam, nothing else mattered in this tiny cabin. The outside world\u2019s problems would be waiting for me tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cYour body is torturous,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>I scrunched my face in confusion. \u201cTorturous?\u201d That didn\u2019t sound good. I looked down at myself. My breasts were a nice size and my stomach was flat. I even had a nice tan. I thought I looked pretty damn hot.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Adam confirmed. \u201cIt has taunted my dreams these past months. Its beauty always on display, but just out of reach. It\u2019s a lethal, beautiful thing.\u201d</p><p>I laughed nervously. How was I supposed to respond to that? I said the first thing that came into my head, \u201cThanks,\u201d and then regretted it. Heat rushed to my cheeks and Adam smirked again.</p><p>He hooked his fingers over my underwear and trailed them down my legs, and the heat in my cheeks grew hotter. What in the hell was wrong with me? I\u2019d only been with two men in my entire life, but I hadn\u2019t been this shy with Sawyer. I decided that Adam threatened my commitment phobia\u2014he scared me. Adam was the first man I could see myself in a relationship with. That was stupid though. I\u2019d be dead tomorrow. Still, it did nothing to ease my nerves or the shyness that overtook me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe this isn\u2019t such a good idea,\u201d I began and then yelped when something hot and moist delved between my legs. Looking down, Adam\u2019s face was buried between my thighs as his tongue lapped at my folds. His hand gripped my ankle and raised my leg to settle on his shoulder. I collapsed against the wall, thankful it was there to hold me up as my body went limp. In that moment, I didn\u2019t care about what was right and wrong, my shyness, or the fact that we crossed the line and were now freefalling. My fingers gripped his head and my hips arched so he had a clear entrance to the spot that burned for him. His tongue flicked out, circled, and penetrated me until I wasn\u2019t sure I could hold myself up any longer. My moans filled the small space and my heartbeat echoed in my eardrums as I lost myself in the pleasure.</p><p>My eyes snapped open when Adam slung my other leg over his shoulder, his hands cupping my behind while never ceasing his exploration of my body. I was completely helpless, pinned between the wall and his muscular body. I\u2019d never experienced this level of pleasure from oral sex. I didn\u2019t even know it was possible. It was a whole other level of intimacy that left me choking on my words and my bones flimsy. The pressure built and built, his tongue darting faster and faster until waves of ecstasy tore through my body, leaving me dizzy and smiling like a fool. My head lolled back as aftershocks vibrated through my body.</p><p>When Adam lowered me, his lips found mine in an instant. Taking myself on his lips ignited my possessiveness. Mine. The word flitted through my mind, and against my better judgment, I liked the way it sounded. Just for the night I would pretend he was mine, that we were just another couple taking advantage of being alone together. I held onto the fantasy with a vengeance and felt more like myself. No longer was I shy or self-conscious. I would claim the beautiful man in front of me as much as he had claimed me.</p> <p>Adam broke the kiss and licked his lips. My eyes tracked the motion. Oh how talented that tongue was. \u201cYou taste so good,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI could savor you all night.\u201d</p><p>My body shivered in response. Wrapping an arm around his neck, I tugged him closer and reclaimed his mouth, my breasts pressing against his chest. My nipples were hard nubs, and the sensation of our skin touching was an erotic caress. I raked my fingernails down his chest to where I could unbutton his jeans. Slipping my hand inside, I cupped the growing bulge, and he moaned against my mouth. Stepping back, Adam grabbed my hand and escorted me across the room. Taking a blanket from the bed, he spread it out onto the floor. Kneeling down, he offered a hand to me and I took it. I lay on the floor, Adam between my legs and gripped the blanket in my hand. This was it, the moment I\u2019d been avoiding, but wanting so much. Adam\u2019s blond hair hung forward as he leaned over me, the light reflected in it like liquid gold. His eyes pierced to my very core and trapped me in their gaze. I was powerless against this man, and I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Adam kissed my knee and then stood up. He shimmied out of his jeans and boxer briefs, discarding them off to the side. A smile spread across my lips as I got a good look at what I was in for. I quivered in anticipation. As Adam lowered back to the blanket, he positioned himself between my legs. My chest rose and fell rapidly as he pressed kisses to my stomach. Making his way up, he suckled on my breast, his tongue flicking my excited nipple. A moan that sounded like a growl vibrated through my throat. My fingers intertwined in his hair, and I arched my back when his teeth clamped down softly around the sensitive flesh. Sliding up my body, Adam claimed my mouth, his hand softly caressing my hair.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he whispered, and rocked his hips forward. I choked on my moans as he buried himself within me. He filled me so completely it was as if he\u2019d been made just for me. A strange calm replaced my anxiety. We locked eyes as he withdrew slowly and then drove forward again and again. After a ten minutes, or it could have been an hour, Adam\u2019s arms slid underneath my body and brought me forward so I straddled him. As he sat up, I wrapped my legs around his waist and moved my hips in rhythm with his hands on my backside. I arched my back and hung my head as I rode out the waves of pleasure. Adam\u2019s mouth found my nipple again, his hot breath like a seductive caress. Adam lay down, and I braced myself on his strong, muscular chest, my nails digging into his flesh. As I rode him, he propped himself up on his elbows, his hand slipping around my neck as he brought me forward to claim my mouth again. Spams of desire shot through my legs, and they trembled with the aftershocks.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d I breathed as I stared down at Adam. His eyes glowed an eerie mixture of blue and gold, and I knew something strange was happening. My body felt powerful and complete, like I\u2019d been traveling a long and winding road and finally found my destination. My weary journey was over, and I\u2019d found my place. I cupped Adam\u2019s face, leaned down slowly, and pressed a soft kiss to his lips. His expression was just as confused as I felt.</p> <p>\u201cAnna,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cI know. I feel it too,\u201d I told him, my eyes blurring with tears. I felt so silly crying, but an overwhelming joy penetrated the very core of me. In all of my twenty-three years of life, I hadn\u2019t felt lost, but somehow, now, I felt as if I was found. The sheer completeness of my heart was overpowering.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What happened?\u201d Adam asked, sitting up. His eyes shot wide as he stared at me.</p><p>What answers could I give him? Looking over my shoulder, I eyed my messenger bag sitting by the front door. I stood up and retrieved my bag. As I walked back to Adam, I hesitated. Would he be pissed that I\u2019d taken the book? Or would the myth about wolves finding their chantes freak him out? He watched me expectantly, his eyes volleying between my face and the bag. He brushed a strand of hair out of his face and something red caught my gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I nodded towards his palm.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014?\u201d Adam\u2019s words cut off when he turned his hand over and looked at the raised pink scar visible on his palm. Bending down, I reached for his hand and examined the mark. It was in the shape of circle, about two inches in diameter. Inside was what looked like a four leaf clover. The longer I looked at it, the more I noticed how much a four leaf clover\u2019s leaves look like hearts. In middle of the clover design was an infinity symbol. I quickly looked at my own hands, and sure enough, the exact same mark was on my left palm. Adam had been quiet, so I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye. He stared at my hand and then at his in awe.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, not sure why I was apologizing. Maybe because he looked really freaked out. My high of feeling complete and blissful fell quickly as I worried what his reaction would be. I had a sneaking suspicion of what the markings meant, and surprisingly, it didn\u2019t scare me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Anna?\u201d</p><p>I retrieved the book from my bag and held it out to him.</p><p>Adam\u2019s brows scrunched as he looked at the book. \u201cHow\u2019d you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night of the hunt, I backtracked and took it. I needed answers.\u201d I kept Elle out of it, she didn\u2019t need Adam pissed at her.</p><p>\u201cAnswers about what?\u201d Adam asked. So far he was calm which was good.</p><p>I hesitated to respond. Given what we\u2019d just done, it seemed silly to be embarrassed to tell him the truth. \u201cAbout my feelings for you. I needed to know if it was normal or if it was something else.\u201d</p><p>Adam rubbed his chin, his hand trailing up his jaw line. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask me?\u201d</p> <p>I snorted. \u201cYou were ignoring me. I could barely get you to look at me, let alone sit down and have a discussion about how I felt for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you feel about me?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>I looked up at his question. \u201cLike you\u2019re everything,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI know it sounds cheesy, and I\u2019m the lowest wolf in the pack, and not a purebred, but I can\u2019t help\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel exactly the same way,\u201d Adam said, interrupting me. \u201cI told you that I wanted you the moment you joined us. Keeping my distance was for your benefit, not mine. It\u2019s been hell being around you and not being able to be with you, and I\u2019m not just talking about sex. I often wondered what it\u2019d be like to come home to you at night and have dinner together and talk about our days.\u201d</p><p>Adam set the book down and drew me into his arms, my back pressed against his chest. His hands settled on my stomach, and he rested his head against mine. \u201cI know it hasn\u2019t been easy, Anna. I\u2019ve sent mixed signals and that had to be confusing. I really thought this feeling would pass once I saw you with Sawyer. Turns out, when you two together, it only made it worse. The fact that he\u2019s still breathing is only because I have a very good handle on my self-control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what it means?\u201d I raised my arm, trailing a finger over my new scar. I tilted my head back to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read the book from cover to end. I never imagined the myths were true,\u201d he answered in an awed tone.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t either. I still don\u2019t know what to make of it,\u201d I paused. \u201cAt least you won\u2019t be stuck with me too much longer.\u201d I gave a nervous laugh, meant to lighten the mood. It had the opposite effect. Adam\u2019s arms tightened around me, and I felt the muscle\u2019s in his chest flex.</p><p>\u201cEven after what just happened, you\u2019re still planning on turning yourself in?\u201d To say Adam was pissed was an understatement. His tone sounded beyond frustrated and angry.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have a choice,\u201d I told him. \u201cThey already think I\u2019m guilty, hell maybe I am. The point is, they have enough evidence to convict me. Who\u2019s going to go against the leaders and their test results?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI\u2019m not losing you right after getting you, Anna.\u201d He brought his hand around, tucking it under my chin to tilt my head up and then kissed me. Warmth spread between my legs, very aware that we were embracing each other still nude. I could feel Adam hardening beneath me and I moaned.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Adam said, pulling away from my lips and reaching for the book. I silently grumbled and sat up, reaching for a pillow off of the bed and holding it in my lap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m correct, the leaders cannot kill someone\u2019s chante.\u201d</p><p>I guess he wasn\u2019t lying when he said he read the book from cover to cover. Hearing him say \u201cchante\u201d was almost surreal, as if I\u2019d make it up and now he was confirming I hadn\u2019t. I took a moment to inventory my feelings. Did I feel different towards Adam now that we\u2019d done the deed? I watched him as he opened the book and scanned the words inside. His chest glistened in the light and the shadows on his face highlighted his features\u2014he was beautiful. Something resembling pride welled in my heart. I felt a little bit different, but not so much that I was a slobbery fool begging at his feet. Part of me worried that\u2019s what I\u2019d turn into, that\u2019d I\u2019d lose my independence and let my feelings for him control me. I was never happier to be proven wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they be able to kill me?\u201d I finally asked.</p> <p>Adam looked up from the book. \u201cBecause you\u2019re my other half. They cannot kill you without killing me.\u201d He turned the book around so I could see it. \u201cSee, it says here:</p><p>Mates said to be chantes share an everlasting bond. To lose</p><p>one is to lose the other. Their hearts are intertwined. What the great</p><p>spirit has united let no one tear asunder.</p><p>I read the text and even though we had proof, in the form of scars on our palms, I still had a hard time believing all of this was real. \u201cAnd you think the leaders will abide by this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnless they want to go against our laws, they will,\u201d Adam said with a smile. \u201cThis book is sacred to our kind. It not only holds all the rules and rituals, but also our history. To go against it would be like second guessing everything that makes us who we are.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat about Eve?\u201d How was I supposed to deal being bonded to the alpha when he was mated to another woman? The fact that I\u2019d just slept with her man twisted my insides and caused guilt to push a current of nausea through my stomach. No matter how much I disliked her, what I\u2019d done was wrong.</p><p>\u201cI said we weren\u2019t talking about her tonight,\u201d Adam said, tugging the pillow out of my lap and raking his eyes over my body.</p><p>\u201cBut...will you two still be mated?\u201d</p><p>Adam crawled towards me, his smile devilish and sexy. As he moved closer, the only option I had was to lie down. He lowered his head between my legs, and I grasped his hair in both hands and tugged his face up so he\u2019d look at me. Though, at the moment, he seemed a little distracted by more primal matters.</p><p>\u201cAdam, I need to know.\u201d</p> <p>He breathed deep. \u201cThat may be a little trickier, but we\u2019ll get through it.\u201d He began to dip his head between my thighs again, but I halted his attempt.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019ll be trickier?\u201d How could severing an alpha couple be more difficult than stopping a death sentence?</p><p>Adam grumbled, reaching his hand up to clasp both of my wrists so I couldn\u2019t hold him back. \u201cOur pairing was between my father\u2019s pack and her father\u2019s pack. If we wish to sever it, and I do, then it may cause problems with her original pack. No matter, it will happen, and we will get through it.\u201d He raised an eyebrow and gave me a look that dared me to say another word on the matter. \u201cNow, lay back and let me taste you. Today\u2019s problems will be waiting for us tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I began to speak, but Adam\u2019s tongue slipped into my sensitive flesh and made me forget what I wanted to say. Forgetting our problems all of a sudden seemed like a very smart idea.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>My eyes fluttered open as the sun cut across the room and hit my face. I lay there for a few seconds as I finished waking up. An arm was slung over my stomach, reminding me of what happened last night. A smile spread across my lips, and I looked over my shoulder. Adam was sound asleep, his face more peaceful than I\u2019d seen before. So many times I\u2019d wondered what it\u2019d be like to wake up next to him. It was amazing.</p><p>\u201cStop staring at me,\u201d Adam\u2019s raspy voice said, scaring me. He peeked through an eyelid and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d I lied. \u201cJust seeing if you are awake.\u201d</p> <p>Adam\u2019s arm tightened around my waist as he tugged me against his body. His lips found my nape and pressed a soft kiss to my skin. I had to be dreaming. There was no way I was this happy and comfortable with a man. The old me would never have stayed the night with a date, let alone been happy to see them in the morning. Surprisingly, my feet weren\u2019t itching to run away. I could stay in the bed all day wrapped in Adam\u2019s arms.</p><p>Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t happen. Someone pounded on the door, causing me to sit up fast and scramble to cover myself with the blankets.</p><p>\u201cWho in the hell could that be?\u201d I asked Adam.</p><p>\u201cI told Joe where he could reach me if an emergency arose,\u201d Adam responded, sitting up and pulling on his jeans. \u201cI\u2019m the alpha after all. It\u2019d be irresponsible to disappear for a night without being able to be reached.\u201d He smiled and walked across the room, opening the door. I pressed my body against the wall, hoping the shadows from the top bunk hid me.</p><p>\u201cSir, sorry to disturb you,\u201d Joe said. His face was haggard and his eyes bloodshot. Something was seriously wrong. \u201cI tried calling but you must not have service this far up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Adam asked, extending his arm to invite Joe inside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Eve,\u201d Joe said solemnly. \u201cShe\u2019s missing. Her purse was found at the edge of the woods and there was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Adam questioned with impatience.</p><p>\u201cIt had blood on it. No one has seen her since your meeting last night.\u201d</p><p>Adam looked over at me, his face hard and unreadable. Was he mad at me for distracting him? Or did he think I\u2019d arranged the whole thing and had a partner kidnap her while I preoccupied him? I knew that was silly, but the look on his face caused me to question his thoughts.</p><p>Adam walked over and grabbed my clothes off the floor and tossed them on the bed. \u201cGet dressed,\u201d he told me.</p><p>Looks like the honeymoon is over.</p><p>\u201cHave you tried calling her cell?\u201d Adam asked Joe.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have it on her. We found it in her bag.\u201d</p><p>While they chatted about what to do, I got dressed while holding the blanket up so Joe wouldn\u2019t catch a peek of my nudity. With Eve missing, the leaders would try to blame me. Everyone knew she hated me, and I didn\u2019t necessarily care for her. It didn\u2019t look good that I shacked up with her mate last night. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for alphas to have women on the side, but they kept it quiet. As much as Adam and I might want to keep our tryst silent for the time being, that would be hard to do with a large raised scar on our palms. If someone got a glimpse of it, they\u2019d know not only that the myth was true, but suspect it gave me motive for wanting to take Eve out of the picture. An alpha couldn\u2019t be mated to two different women.</p><p>Climbing out of bed, I adjusted my shirt and walked over to the two men.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d I made a point to tuck my hands behind my back so that Joe wouldn\u2019t accidently see my scar. Adam didn\u2019t have the same worries. He either forgot about the mark or didn\u2019t care who saw it, either way it made me nervous.</p><p>\u201cJoe, I want you to head back to the main house and call an emergency meeting,\u201d Adam said. \u201cHave the leaders been alerted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we searched the forest around the house, but to no avail.\u201d Joe looked like he hadn\u2019t gotten much sleep and was about to crash where he stood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done good.\u201d Adam clapped Joe on the back. \u201cOnce you alert every one of the meeting, take a couple hours to get some rest.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded and headed outside where he hopped in his truck and took off. I watched out of the small window as he disappeared down the mountain.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d I turned to face Adam. He bent over and picked up his shirt off of the floor, slipping it over his shoulders and working the buttons.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it isn\u2019t sounding good.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t make eye contact with me. Instead, he went about the cabin straightening items and picking up what little we\u2019d messed up.</p><p>I hugged my arms to my chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know this must be scary for you.\u201d Though those words hurt to say, I knew they needed to be said. Eve was his mate after all. That hadn\u2019t changed because we\u2019d slept together and were marked. Nothing in life was ever that easy.</p><p>Adam stopped what he was doing and looked at me through thick eyelashes. His blond hair fell forward, casting shadows against his face. \u201cThis is probably awkward for you, huh?\u201d Without waiting for my response, Adam crossed the room. His arms went around me as he held me against his chest. The scent of spices and forest teased my nostrils and sent a wave of calm through my body.</p><p>\u201cI meant everything I said last night,\u201d Adam spoke softly. \u201cI love you, Anna.\u201d He reached for my hand, turning it over so the scar faced upwards. With a finger, he trailed the mark and clasped our hands together so the scars met. \u201cThe earth has spoken, and you are mine, and I am yours. There\u2019s nothing that can undo that.\u201d Leaning down, his lips met mine ever so softly and were gone before I realized it. \u201cCome on, I have a feeling the bad news is just beginning,\u201d Adam said. I shuffled the book back into my messenger bag, looped it over my shoulder and we headed out.</p><p>Back at the house, the pack was already arriving. Elle set up a small buffet, featuring coffee, muffins and what looked like egg sandwiches with bacon. The leaders sat at the kitchen table, devouring their food. When I walked in they all looked up as if they\u2019d choreographed the movement. I kept my hands fisted at my side so they wouldn\u2019t see the scar just yet. We needed to find Eve, and if word got out that Adam and I were each other\u2019s chantes, then it\u2019d cause a plethora of questioning and excitement. I never thought I\u2019d rather focus on Eve than me and Adam, but I was still guilty over last night. It made me sick to my stomach to think that while we were finally giving into each other, Eve was kidnapped or worse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d Elle said with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I told her, making sure to also smile at the leaders. They watched me with heavy scrutiny, and I held back the urge to shake under their penetrating stares.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a quick shower,\u201d I told no one in particular and then headed to the bathroom. Once I shut the door, I leaned against it and let out the breath I\u2019d been holding. My chest felt heavy and my hands were unsteady. Shaking out my arms, I tried to get myself together. What I really needed to do was get over the guilt. Could I help it that Adam and I were drawn towards each other? If what the book said was true, then it was out of my hands. I\u2019ve always been a firm believer in the saying \u201cWhat is supposed to happen will always find its way\u201d. So why couldn\u2019t I grasp that concept right now?</p> <p>I undressed, turned on the shower, and slipped inside. The hot water beat against my skin, and I imagined it washing away all of my remorse over last night. It was a shame that rather than replaying the ecstasy Adam had given me, I was ruining our time together by feeling like this.</p><p>I closed my eyes and concentrated on the beat of the water, allowing the steam to clear my head. A flicker of light danced behind my eyelids and startled me. My eyes popped open, and I peeked behind the shower curtain. No one else was in the bathroom and none of the lights had blown. Ignoring the oddity, I closed my eyes again and leaned against the tile wall. Flickers flashed again, this time more violent than before. Squeezing my eyes tighter, I bent over and leaned on my knees from the vertigo it caused.</p><p>A picture, although muddled, replaced the flickers. It looked like grass and trees, but it was moving up and down as if I was running. The sound of heavy breath sounded in my eardrums, and I jerked in response. The picture moved to the side as if I looked to my left. My breathing picked up as if I was out of breath or scared. Shadows from the tree limbs lent an eerie feeling to the forest, my eyes shooting in every direction as I sought out something. Bit by bit the scenery disappeared into blackness.</p><p>My eyes snapped open, and I immediately retched. Since I hadn\u2019t eaten since last night not a whole came up, but that didn\u2019t stop my body from trying to expel any amount of food it could. A knock sounded and then the door opened.</p><p>\u201cAnna? Are you alright?\u201d Elle yanked back the shower curtain and found me on my hands and knees. \u201cOh my God! What happened?\u201d Her voice sounded funny, as if she were speaking while holding a hand over her mouth. She slipped a towel around my back and tucked her hands under my arms to help me stand. As soon as I stepped out of the shower, Adam came barreling through the door. I had to blink back the stars that danced within my vision to focus on his face. It seemed there was a lot of commotion, and I couldn\u2019t make sense of any of it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Adam all but yelled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Elle replied. \u201cI heard her vomiting and came in to find her crouched on the shower floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d Adam\u2019s hands encased my face and lifted my head so he could look into my eyes. He looked blurry so I blinked a few times. Still, I couldn\u2019t seem to pinpoint exactly where his face was.</p><p>\u201cAnna, what happened? Are you alright?\u201d Adam\u2019s voice came through just as muddled as Elle\u2019s had. I knew what they were saying, but it was disorienting with all of their movements. I didn\u2019t respond, at the moment I was working very hard not to retch again. The jostling movements of my body as Adam tried to figure out what was wrong with me caused the nausea to come back in strong waves.</p><p>I was being carried. Even if I couldn\u2019t make out the outline of Adam\u2019s face and blond hair, I\u2019d know it was him. His scent was home. It calmed my nerves and helped settle my stomach a little bit.</p><p>He laid me on a bed, my room by the smell of it, and I felt the bed indent as he sat down beside me. \u201cAnna, you have to say something. You\u2019re freaking me out.\u201d Adam brushed my wet hair away from my face and pressed a kiss to my forehead. I rubbed my eyes and when I opened them again everything was a little clearer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cDid you fall in the shower?\u201d Adam asked with concern.</p><p>I snorted. It was a logical question, and I wished he was right because what actually happened was so bizarre I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it, or what to tell him. I watched him for a few moments, debating on my answer. I felt better by the second, and we still had to discuss how we were going to find Eve. Adam shouldn\u2019t be beside my bed worried about me when there were more important things to deal with.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I told him. \u201cThe floor was really slippery, and I just went down.\u201d</p><p>Adam stared at me for a while. \u201cWhy were you getting sick?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip and shrugged. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m coming down with something.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and hugged my knees to my chest, unable to look Adam in the eye. It didn\u2019t feel right lying to him, but it was for the best for the time being.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should conceal that?\u201d I asked, nodding towards his hand to change the subject.</p> <p>Adam raised his hand and looked at his palm, a smile lifting his lips. \u201cWhy would I want to hide proof that we\u2019re meant to be together?\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped to his, and my heart melted a little bit. Figures that he\u2019d say something like that and make all the time I\u2019d spent worrying over it pointless.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Elle said, stepping into my room. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. We should probably get the meeting started.\u201d I looked at Adam, and he nodded, pressing a kiss to my forehead before standing up and leaving. Elle closed my bedroom door and rushed over to my bed with a huge smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like, dudes, but how was our alpha in the sack?\u201d She waggled her eyebrows and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think we slept together?\u201d</p><p>Elle gave me an \u201cout-with-it-already\u201d look and I laughed again.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, he was...fantastic. The bones in my body melted. He completely consumed me last night.\u201d</p><p>Elle bounced up and down. \u201c\u2019bout damned time! I swear if you guys didn\u2019t screw soon, I was going to slip you guys some E\u2014try refusing him on with a high like that.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows drew together. \u201cE?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcstasy, you know the drug that gives a whole new meaning to horny.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve never done drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a rough childhood, drugs were my go-to escape route. That all changed when I became a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never asked Elle how she\u2019d been changed. I guess I assumed she knew about werewolves beforehand and was accepted for the change. It was common to have humans living amongst the bigger packs. From what I heard, they were considered staff until they proved themselves worthy enough to be chosen for the change. It was dangerous though, only half survived the bite of a werewolf. Not worth the risk in my opinion.</p><p>\u201cHey, what is that?\u201d Elle reached for my hand and yanked my arm out.</p><p>\u201cTear my arm off why don\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Elle asked as she examined the scar on my palm.</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise not to tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it to my grave.\u201d</p><p>I eyed the door and then brought my attention back to Elle. \u201cThe myth is true,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI told you!\u201d Elle exclaimed. \u201cIt didn\u2019t say anything about marking the couple though. That\u2019s both cool and bizarre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d I got up from my bed and walked over to my closet to get dressed. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what will happen now that Adam and I are bonded.\u201d I chose a pair of denim capris and a yellow top with ruffles on the sleeves.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Eve will be kicked to the curb, and you\u2019ll be our new alpha female,\u201d Elle replied.</p><p>\u201cNothing is ever that easy, Elle.\u201d</p><p>Elle and I headed out to the living room. The meeting had already started, so we slipped through the crowd and tried to catch up. The leaders stood behind Adam as he spoke. As soon as I\u2019d entered the room their eyes found me. I shifted my feet, unable to stand still, or make eye contact with any of them. Instead of focusing on them, I thought about what happened in the shower. I never had a dream while I was awake, but that\u2019s exactly what it felt like, except I wasn\u2019t a wolf. There was nothing I could piece together and make sense out of, and that was frustrating.</p><p>Elle elbowed me. I raised my head and she nodded towards Adam with a smile. I hadn\u2019t been listening to what he said, but now my eyes shot wide and I had to work really hard to keep my jaw from dropping on the floor. He stood with his legs shoulder width apart, his head held high, full of pride, and his arm outstretched as he showed the pack his palm.</p><p>\u201cMany of you may not know what this means,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThere are a lot of legends surrounding our kind. Some are true and some are nonsense. Last night I learned that one of them is very much real: the myth of the wolves who find their true partner. I don\u2019t pretend to know the magic behind it, but the Great Spirit has spoken, and she has paired me and Anna together.\u201d Adam smiled, an emotion out of place for a meeting about one of our own missing.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d Adam said as an invitation to join him up front. I hesitated, not wanting to take focus off of why we were all joined today. It was too late though, Adam spilled the beans prematurely. I shouldered my way through bodies and walked up front, standing off to the side.</p><p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d Wade asked in awe. I looked behind me and nodded.</p><p>\u201cShow them your hand,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>I gave him a dirty look, but held my hand out. The pack gasped and asked questions all at once. The leaders grabbed for our hands and inspected the marks. My annoyance and anger got the better of me. I ripped my hand away from Michael and stepped in front of Adam and the leaders.</p><p>\u201cThe myth is true, but I think we should have waited to reveal it,\u201d I shot Adam a displeased look. \u201cWe are here to find Eve, not celebrate. Most of you know that Eve and I didn\u2019t really like each other, and maybe this is why,\u201d I held my hand out. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t devote every waking hour to finding her. One of our own is missing, and it\u2019s our job to find her. If you guys have questions about the pairing of Adam and I, please wait until after this mess is cleared up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once I finished talking, I realized everyone looked at me like I\u2019d shown up for school naked. Realizing that my speech might have been considered rude to Adam and our leaders, I turned and apologized. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your questioning about our scars, but it doesn\u2019t feel like the right time for all of this.\u201d</p><p>Wade smiled and nodded while the other leaders gave me stony glares.</p><p>\u201cAnna is right,\u201d Adam stepped forward. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Anna. I\u2019m just really...well, I wanted share my excitement. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to find Eve. I\u2019ve already divided search teams up and gave them locations to look.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I whispered, embarrassed. I guess I should have thought about that since Elle and I arrived late. Still, I wished he wouldn\u2019t have put his hand on display for everyone. Our scars weren\u2019t magical in that we were hopelessly, mushy zombies.</p><p>Wade stepped forward. \u201cWe have her blood, which is the strongest scent. Each of you will smell this on your way out the door.\u201d He held up Eve\u2019s purse that was found along the woods and handed it to Melissa, one of the few females in our pack. She took a long sniff and then passed it to the next person. As each person caught Eve\u2019s scent, their eyes glowed, looking eerily beautiful against their human faces.</p><p>One by one they headed outside, clothes shredding as they transformed into wolves. I was about to join them when Jeff stopped me.</p><p>\u201cAnna, a minute,\u201d the leader requested.</p><p>I should have known my murder trial wouldn\u2019t be overlooked so easily. Now it was time to find out if my bond to Adam would save me.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Jeff said as they sat around the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be out helping track Eve?\u201d I may have been stalling, but could I really be faulted for that? I was ready to die yesterday, but now that Adam and I were marked, I wanted to live\u2014needed to.</p><p>\u201cYour brothers and sisters are searching for Eve. I doubt one less wolf will make a difference,\u201d Jeff replied, giving me a look that I shouldn\u2019t argue the subject. Sitting down, I rested my folded arms on the table and tried to appear strong and confident. Adam stood behind me, his hand resting on my right shoulder. Whatever news I was about to hear could end badly. If they carried out my sentence, Adam would die right along with me. There was no way he\u2019d stand by and watch his chante be murdered. Heaviness settled in my chest as I thought about him dying because of me.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill Eve?\u201d Michael asked. His blunt question threw me off guard, even though I\u2019d expected it.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhy would I want to look for her if I killed her?\u201d I took a breath to calm myself down. I was really tired of being treated like a criminal. The sooner the leaders left the better.</p> <p>\u201cDoes a murderer act guilty?\u201d Nicolas asked. \u201cIt\u2019s apparent you\u2019ve wanted her mate all along. What\u2019s the best way to ensure that happens? By killing her of course. You couldn\u2019t defeat her by demanding a duel, so you took the easy road. Of course how you were able to get the drop on an alpha female is beyond me. Perhaps you had help?\u201d He shifted his steely gaze from me and focused on Adam.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u201d I snorted. Adam was the last person in the world who\u2019d murder Eve. He took his responsibilities far too seriously.</p><p>\u201cI find it funny that the one night we allow you your freedom, Eve goes missing,\u201d Jeff added. \u201cWhere were you last night, Anna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was with me,\u201d Adam answered.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, a partner.\u201d Nicholas smiled. \u201cPerhaps since you two were so enamored with each other, and obviously each other\u2019s chante\u2019s, which we\u2019ll discuss later, you cooked up a plan to get rid of the woman who was given to you as a peace offering. You knew that if you were to reject Eve and replace her with Anna, it\u2019d start a war with her people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Adam snarled.</p><p>\u201cAdam wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d I said. \u201cHe takes being mated to Eve seriously.\u201d I didn\u2019t mention how annoying it was because that would only help their case against me. Hearing Adam tell me there was nothing he could do about his relationship with Eve had nearly driven me crazy, but not enough to kill which is what the leaders would assume.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d I added. \u201cWe were together last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re each other\u2019s alibis. I guess we overreacted and everyone can go on their merry way,\u201d Nicholas said with a sarcastic smile. If I knew I could get away with it, I would have reached across the table and smacked him.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I find funny?\u201d I replied, gaining courage the madder I got. \u201cThat Adam and I are treated like criminals when you, a leader, are free to molest women and no one says anything to you. If anyone deserves to be punished, it\u2019s you, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>The room got scary quiet, the leaders all traded looks. The air around the table was suffocating. Nicholas was emanating an overwhelming, angry power. He. Was. Pissed. He might have had some lusty juju, but that wasn\u2019t an excuse to use it on whomever he wanted. Sure the women thought they wanted him, but once his seductive influence was withdrawn, the women were left feeling dirty and used. I couldn\u2019t be the only one who had a problem with a man like that as one of our leaders.</p><p>Nicholas shot up and stalked around the table, his angry gaze trained on me. I knew what was coming and couldn\u2019t do anything about it. If I struck him back, the leaders would bring the hammer down on my ass.</p><p>Adam stepped around my chair, blocking Nicholas\u2019 path. \u201cYou can\u2019t get mad at her for telling the truth. If she has said something that\u2019s not true, by all means, prove her wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you stand against me, alpha,\u201d Nicholas said, his voice dripping with venom. \u201cMove!\u201d</p><p>Adam held his ground, squaring his shoulders and curling his hands into tight fist. As much as I would\u2019ve loved to see Adam take Nicholas down a notch, it wouldn\u2019t have ended well. Adam would be punished for assaulting a leader. Luckily, the remaining leaders took care of the situation before anything uglier happened.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, take a walk,\u201d Jeff advised, rising from his chair with Wade and Michael following suit. Nicolas looked over at his brethren, and then turned his icy glare to me.</p><p>\u201cThe day will come when they won\u2019t be here to protect you. I look forward to that day,\u201d he threatened, stalking out of the room.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, what\u2019s up with him being a leader?\u201d I asked, turning towards the men around the table.</p><p>\u201cIt was his birthright,\u201d Wade answered. \u201cHis father was leader before him, his grandfather before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did they also have the influence to take away a woman\u2019s willpower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, his grandfather was a ladies man, but I don\u2019t think he had any special power. His father had a little bit, but it seems to have gotten stronger with Nicolas. I\u2019d hate to see what his son will be like.\u201d Wade stared in the direction Nicholas had stormed out, a look of disgust on his face.</p><p>At least I wasn\u2019t the only one who thought Nicholas was a sleezeball. \u201cDo a lot of werewolves have special powers?\u201d I sat back down, anxious to learn more about my kind. Adam took the chair Nicolas had been sitting in, and the energy in the room settled to a comfortable level, well as comfortable as it could being in the presence of three leaders and an alpha.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare, but it\u2019s not so uncommon that it\u2019s a big deal, ya know?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and was about to ask another question when Michael spoke up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good at distraction, Ms. Avery. We\u2019re here to talk about you, not the history of our kind or how loathsome Nicholas may be.\u201d</p><p>The relaxed look on Wade\u2019s face disappeared and was replaced with seriousness. I glanced at Adam. He\u2019d calmed down now that Nicholas was gone, but I could still tell he was revved up.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know if I killed, Eve,\u201d I said, tired of the questioning. \u201cI did not. If I wanted to kill her simply to be with Adam, I would\u2019ve done it months ago. Matter of fact, I turned Adam down countless times because I didn\u2019t think we should be together while he was mated to her,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cYet you didn\u2019t hold those same worries last night,\u201d Jeff noted.</p><p>\u201cDo you deny your stomach when you\u2019re hungry?\u201d I asked, and I heard a soft laugh escape from Wade. \u201cI was supposed to be sentenced to death tonight. I didn\u2019t hold any worries last night. If I was going to die, then I was going to end my life on a happy note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could\u2019ve killed Eve, since as you said, you had no worries. What would be the point of worrying about being caught for murder when you would be dead within the day?\u201d Michael questioned.</p><p>\u201cFor crying out loud! I\u2019m talking about sleeping with a man that I\u2019ve refused myself, not murdering his mate! I don\u2019t care enough about Eve to go through the trouble of killing her out of spite. I know you want to pile all the guilt onto my shoulders, that\u2019d be the easiest path, but by killing me for the crime, you\u2019d become the very thing you\u2019re accusing me of\u2014a murderer. I am innocent in this matter.\u201d</p><p>When I was a kid I hated the merry-go-round. I didn\u2019t see the point of climbing onto a metal circle and being spun until I was so dizzy I couldn\u2019t see straight. Tonight I was of a figurative merry-go-round. The questions went around and around, but never went anywhere. Asking the same questions a different way kept the problem at a standstill and me dizzy with fury.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe, Anna, then believe me,\u201d Adam said, reaching a hand under the table, his fingers gently squeezing my knee. \u201cAll of you have known me for a long time. I was with Anna last night and at no point did she leave my side, nor I hers. We spent the entire time in the cabin until Joe came this morning.\u201d</p><p>The leaders looked at each other as if they were having a mental conversation that our ears couldn\u2019t hear. Hell, maybe they were. Their eyebrows would arch, dip, and scrunch as if debating their argument to each other. This went on for at least five minutes. I reached my hand under the table and gripped Adam\u2019s. Life was so much easier before becoming a werewolf. I\u2019d never seen the inside of a police station, and now I felt like I was on trial every day of my life. I\u2019d gladly go back to doing my chores and not complaining if it meant the leaders would leave and never come back. I had a soft spot for Wade. He was like a moody older brother. Still, he was a leader first and foremost and wasn\u2019t the type to let a friendship get in the way of his duties. As I watched him, I wished Elle batted for his team\u2014they\u2019d make a great couple. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA decision has been made,\u201d Michael announced. \u201cWe believe you when you say that you did not have a hand in Eve\u2019s disappearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d I questioned.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot overlook the link between you and the murdered humans. This connection to Adam impedes with your sentencing. I do not know if it\u2019s true, but if we were to kill you, Adam would die also\u2014or at least suffer severely from the loss. We do not wish to punish him for your wrongdoings.\u201d</p> <p>It sounded good, anything was better than death.</p><p>\u201cYou will be shipped to Idaho and be housed in the Anderson pack. There you will work as a servant until the end of your days,\u201d Michael said, causing me to gasp.</p><p>\u201cI request to go with her,\u201d Adam insisted, his fingers gripping my hand so tightly I winced.</p><p>\u201cYou would abandon your pack for your own selfish reasons?\u201d Jeff asked with aversion.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I interrupted. Looking at Adam, I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t give up your post as their alpha because of me. I won\u2019t allow you to leave them for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of life will I have if you\u2019re not by my side? Do you think I\u2019ll be a good alpha when I\u2019m distracted by thoughts of you? I will not lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were going to lose me anyway,\u201d I reminded him. Had it not been for our pairing last night, I would have died tonight. \u201cAt least this way I\u2019ll still be alive, and I\u2019m sure I can have visitors,\u201d I looked at the leaders. \u201cEven people in prison are permitted visitors.\u201d</p><p>The leaders talked amongst themselves, and Adam stared at the tabletop, his jaw set in stone and his eyes just as hard. I was getting very good at putting on a brave face. The truth was I was terrified. I didn\u2019t want to leave Adam or my pack. Would the new alpha be as respectable as Adam, or would he try to visit my bed every night? Would I be treated like a criminal for the rest of my life? All of these thoughts sent a shot of fear through me, but I had to remain strong on the outside for Adam\u2019s sake. I was going to make sure that his number one priority was taking care of our pack.</p><p>\u201cWe will grant you seven, one day breaks where visitors will be allowed to visit you. But you are not to leave the grounds, and you\u2019ll have a spectator with you at all times,\u201d Michael said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take joy in tearing you away from your family, Anna, but horrific crimes have been committed, and we have to take action.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to refute his words.</p><p>\u201cIf Anna is murdering people, and I still don\u2019t think she is for the record, then what\u2019s to stop her from doing the same in Idaho?\u201d Adam questioned with anger.</p> <p>\u201cFrom what we understand, the attacks happened at night,\u201d Jeff said, crossing his arms. \u201cAnna will be caged during the dark hours with surveillance. This will help us see if she is, in fact, changing without remembering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit!\u201d Adam shot up and paced the floor like he was a caged animal. \u201cShe does not deserve to be treated like some dog!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it sounds,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cThe cage is very large and a full sized bed is inside, along with a mini fridge. We\u2019re not sadistic, Adam.\u201d</p><p>Just as I was about to say something to try and calm Adam down, the phone rang. Adam answered it a little ruder than necessary and then his face fell. \u201cBe right there,\u201d he told the caller, hanging the phone up. When he looked at us his eyes were wide and his mouth slightly open.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wade asked.</p><p>\u201cEve\u2019s shirt was found two miles from here. It was soaked in blood,\u201d Adam replied.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>We combed the forest for any more clues. Eve\u2019s bloody shirt had been found hanging from a broken branch, but no other traces of her existed. The sky let lose a downpour of rain, colder this high up in the mountains. The pack spread out and continued to search for hours. Emotions grew heavy the longer we looked and didn\u2019t find anything. Adam had been quiet. I gave him space, knowing this couldn\u2019t be easy on him. They\u2019d been together awhile so I didn\u2019t take offence that he held feelings towards her. What kind of person would that make me if I were to get jealous of a potentially dead woman?</p> <p>\u201cI think I found something,\u201d Sawyer called from twenty feet away. Digging my heels into the soggy earth, I ran forward. The sensation of running, the scenery bobbing up and down with my heavy footfalls, brought this morning\u2019s weird episode back. I stopped, ignoring Sawyer and those who rushed to his side. Tilting my head up, I stared at the canopy of the trees. The sky was a gloomy gray, lending a dark eerie feeling to the forest. Swiveling my head from left to right, it was like I was seeing the vision again. This was the place I\u2019d seen in the shower, but how?</p><p>The chattering of the pack drew me out of my thoughts. Jogging the rest of the way, I weaved in between the bodies to see what they were looking at. Sawyer knelt down on the ground, his hands carefully brushing leaves away from some markings in the dirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Elle questioned, bending over to get a closer look.</p><p>\u201cLooks like scratches, like someone was digging their nails into the dirt.\u201d Sawyer placed his hand over the markings, not to touching them. I knelt beside him and placed my hand over the indents. My head filled with pressure and my eyelids grew heavy, my arm falling towards the earth. As my fingertips made contact with the scratch marks, it happened again. Nausea churned in my stomach. A cold sweat broke along my brow and I became lightheaded. Then the vision came.</p><p>A hand clung to the earth. The fingernails digging into the soil for purchase. The person\u2019s arm jerked back as if something tugged its body away from the spot. The movement was a simple one, but I\u2019d never been more frightened in my life. The hand lost its grip with the earth and slid along the leaf littered ground as something pulled it away. Now that the nails weren\u2019t obscured within the dirt, I got a good look at them\u2014long, red, and tipped in white\u2014exactly how Eve did her nails.</p><p>\u201cAnna...Anna,\u201d someone called frantically, shaking my shoulder. My eyes opened\u2014a lazy action that felt like slow motion. I focused on Elle\u2019s face in front of me, her red hair wet, and clinging to her head. Her green eyes were wide and water droplets trickled down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I murmured, still a bit dazed. \u201cIt was Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was Eve?\u201d Sawyer and Elle asked at the same time. I hadn\u2019t meant to say it aloud. These visions, or whatever they were, would only make the leaders think I was guiltier. They\u2019d say they were glimpses into my memories, ones I thought I didn\u2019t have. Sawyer and Elle waited as I bit my lip and wondered what to tell them. They both watched me with suspicion, a look I couldn\u2019t take from my friends.</p><p>\u201cI saw it,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI saw her hand being dragged away.\u201d</p><p>Elle and Sawyer looked at each other. \u201cWhat do you mean, you saw it?\u201d Elle knelt down and slung her arm around my soaked shoulders. The rain continued to assault my body until I felt the icy coldness soaking into my bones.</p><p>\u201cIt was like a movie playing. I saw the arm that was here, nails digging into the earth as something pulled it away.\u201d I looked down at the indent in the dirt. The rain was quickly washing it away, but I could still see the harsh lines from where Eve\u2019s nails raked as she tried to hold on.</p><p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s true,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cHow do you know it was Eve\u2019s hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s the only one I know who wears fire engine red nail polish and keeps her nails longer.\u201d The majority of the women, what little we had, all had jobs to do. That meant long, pretty nails didn\u2019t last long. Eve, as the alpha female, didn\u2019t have that problem. Aside from guarding her territory next to Adam\u2019s side, she didn\u2019t contribute much.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on? You guys find something?\u201d We all turned to see Adam peering over our shoulders, staring at the muddy ground. Elle and Sawyer didn\u2019t say anything. That meant a lot because they swore their loyalty to Adam\u2014not me. I couldn\u2019t help but feel proud to have them on my side.</p><p>\u201cWe thought so, but it was just mountain lion tacks,\u201d I lied. The words tasted bad in my mouth. Adam and I were just starting our complicated relationship, and I was already lying. I\u2019d been horrible at relationships my whole life; I couldn\u2019t expect to become an expert overnight, right? I\u2019d eventually tell Adam everything. I needed to understand what it all meant first. The logical side of my brain told me that if I told Adam, perhaps he could lend some insight. Then again, when did I ever listen to logic? I was too stubborn to give into it.</p><p>\u201cThe weather is getting bad,\u201d Adam said, looking over his shoulder. The pack was heading out of the woods. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick up the search as soon as the rain lets up. For now let\u2019s get home and get something to eat.\u201d</p><p>I stood and Adam slung his arm around my shoulder, pulling me against the warmth of his body. I gave Elle and Sawyer a \u2018thank-you\u2019 look and followed Adam back to the truck.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that back there?\u201d Elle and Sawyer cornered me in the laundry room as soon as they saw their chance. Sawyer stood guard by the door so I couldn\u2019t make a run for it, while Elle stood like a brick wall in front of me\u2014her green eyes squinting and impatient.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cThis morning is the first time it has happened.\u201d I reached for a dry towel from the metal shelves where we stored them and rubbed it through my hair. \u201cI\u2019ve had dreams...\u201d I ignored their confused faces and yanked my soaked shirt off. Luckily, I\u2019d done a load of laundry the other day and it still waited for me in the dryer. I shifted the wrinkled clothes around until I found a white babydoll tee that had a sunset and palm tree design on the front. The shirt was old and the picture was fading, but it held a special place in my heart. My mother got it for me a few years ago when her and my father visited the Bahamas. Wearing it made me feel closer to her, and at the moment there was nothing I wanted more than for her to tell me everything was going to be alright. As I thought about it, I heard her voice say those exact words. I\u2019d stored it in my memory and pulled it out when I felt like crumbling. When I was younger, I always believed those comforting words, now...now I wasn\u2019t so sure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been lying to me?\u201d Elle accused. Her eyes drooped and her lips turned downward as she looked away from me.</p><p>\u201cNot lying\u2014just not telling you everything. I was scared and for good reason. The leaders are convicting me of the murders. I was supposed to be dead already.\u201d</p><p>I expected to be bombarded with questions. Instead, Elle\u2019s arms reached out, clasping behind my back as she hugged me tight. I looked over her shoulder and saw Sawyer was staring at me, his eyebrows drawn and his lips in a thin line. I gave him a small smile. I bet he was happy he wasn\u2019t involved with a mess like me anymore.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll run away,\u201d Elle said, stepping back to look at me. Her hands gripped my arms almost painfully.</p><p>\u201cAre they still planning on doing it tonight?\u201d Sawyer asked so quietly I almost didn\u2019t catch it.</p><p>Peering around Elle\u2019s body, I said, \u201cNot anymore. Because Adam and I are bonded, it would kill him if I were to die.\u201d Looking back at Elle I said, \u201cI can\u2019t run away. That would also kill Adam, and I don\u2019t want to spend my life on the run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...what are they planning to do with you?\u201d Elle asked, her voice trembling.</p><p>I hesitated, hating that I had to break the news that this could be the last time they saw me. \u201cI\u2019m being shipped to the Idaho pack.\u201d The stipulations of that sentence hadn\u2019t sunk in yet. There\u2019d been too much going on to really think about what it meant.</p> <p>\u201cSo you did kill those people?\u201d Elle questioned with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThey did a DNA test and it came back positive. I don\u2019t remember doing it, but I can\u2019t argue with lab results.\u201d Up until now I hadn\u2019t talked about the murders with anyone except Adam and the leaders. I was sure that gossip was flowing through the pack. I mean there was only one reason why the leaders always wanted to have secret meetings with me. The obviousness of my situation spoke volumes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cSure you don\u2019t like humans, but I can\u2019t see you going on a killing rampage. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re just going along with this. I can\u2019t believe Adam is going along with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much we can do aside from going against the leaders. I\u2019d much rather be shipped off than killed.\u201d I crossed my arms as my stomach rumbled. \u201cCan we go eat now?\u201d I started forward, but Elle stopped me.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were having dreams.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, already tired of having this conversation. It seemed the last few months of my life were dedicated to it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat kinds of dreams? Were they visions like today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if todays were visions,\u201d I put extra emphasis on the word, thinking how hokey it all sounded. When Elle raised her eyebrow in annoyance, I continued. \u201cIn the dreams I was the wolf attacking the humans. They were very real and very scary. The leaders think it\u2019s my subconscious\u2019 way of reminding me of what I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd today you saw glimpses of things, no murdering?\u201d Elle\u2019s voice was growing more and more interested as if she knew something I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered cautiously.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d A smile spread across her pink glossed lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go eat,\u201d she said, ignoring my question. Maybe she was putting a friendly face on all the while getting ready to commit me to the nearest psych ward. With the way my life was going I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p> <p>I awoke to someone getting into my bed. The left side indented; the weight of the person enough to jostle my body. Looking over my shoulder, I smiled at Adam. It was still weird my first reaction wasn\u2019t to tell him to get lost. The bond threw all my previous qualms out the window, or maybe I was giving into what I always wanted.</p><p>Adam curled up behind me, his arm snaking its way through mine and holding my hand. The warmth of his flesh felt like fire against my skin, arousing my wolf. Her desire pounded through my body, erasing my sleepiness.</p><p>\u201cYou were quiet tonight,\u201d Adam said, speaking softly. His voice, even as a whisper was a sweet masculine rumble that did funny things to me. It was like a seductive tune that played for my ears alone.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about everything,\u201d I explained. The house was filled with the pack tonight. Adam thought it\u2019d be a good idea to have them all in one place. The rain let up a few hours ago and search teams were out scouring the mountain. When one returned, another would take its place.</p><p>\u201cWade told me they won\u2019t transport you until next week. I\u2019m doing everything I can to find the real killer before then. I\u2019m not losing you, Anna.\u201d I felt the bed shift again. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I turned to face Adam. He was propped up on one elbow, his chest highlighted by the glow of the moon streaming through my window. Shadows played along his face, detailing his strong jawline and high cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cEverything is going to be okay,\u201d he said, and I smiled. The words I desperately wanted to hear from my mother came from his lips and comforted me just the same.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d I asked him. \u201cI know you and Eve weren\u2019t in love, but it can\u2019t be easy not knowing what happened to her.\u201d</p><p>Adam trailed a finger down my arm, his eyes following the movement. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult...the not knowing,\u201d he admitted. When it came to Eve he never said much. I knew he cared for her, at least in a small way. They\u2019d been together for a while, feelings were bound to grow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d I reassured him.</p><p>Adam nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about her right now. I want to be here with you, feel your body beneath my fingers, and listen to your heart race as I make love to you.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Using the phrase \u2018making love\u2019 was a pet peeve of mine, one that others didn\u2019t seem to share. To me it sounded cheesier than Velveeta. Then again, maybe that was why I was so bad at relationships. I didn\u2019t know how to be in love. Adam didn\u2019t notice my aversion for his words. He leaned down and pressed a kiss to my lips, soft and promising more. Reaching for my arm, he guided my body forward to where I was sitting up and drew me over to him. Wrapping an arm around my waist, he laid down so that I was laying horizontally against the length of his body.</p><p>His arms enclosed around my waist as his blue eyes swirled with gold. My wolf had been pretty quiet the past few days, aside from popping up every once in a while to let me know she approved of what I was doing\u2014or who I was doing.</p><p>Adam\u2019s hands slid to my backside, his fingers gripping my butt, and grinding me against the growing hardness beneath his cotton pajama pants. I moaned as he continued to move me against his body. Our mouths quickly found each other, hungry and eager for one another.</p><p>Adam gripped my legs and moved them so they rested on either side of his hips. Sitting up, he lifted my tee over my head, throwing it on the floor. Since I didn\u2019t sleep in a bra, my breasts were right in his face, nipples hard nubs begging for his attention. The power this man had over me was astounding. Every fiber of my being craved him, burned for him.</p><p>His mouth closed over one of my breasts, his tongue doing clever circles around the areola. I moved my hips, making sure to press hard against his lower region. Adam looked up at me through his lashes; a possessive look promised this man was mine.</p><p>\u201cAdam, you in there?\u201d Asher called from outside my door.</p><p>\u201cGo. Away!\u201d Adam ordered. He snaked a hand around my neck, tugging to bring me closer to his lips. The bulge in his pants was hard as a rock beneath me, my own panties growing wetter in response.</p><p>\u201cSir, they found her,\u201d Asher said, his voice raising an octave. Adam and I became as still as mannequins, our eyes locked.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d I told him. \u201cEve needs you.\u201d Had I really just said that? What I really wanted to do was cuff him to my bed and keep him all to myself. It was some kind of cruel punishment to ignite my body and not tame the flame.</p><p>\u201cIs she...alive?\u201d Adam asked, keeping his eyes on me.</p><p>\u201cJust barely,\u201d Asher responded. Adam closed his eyes as if in relief.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute,\u201d Adam called. Asher\u2019s footsteps echoed down the hallway until they disappeared completely.</p><p>Climbing off of Adam, I scooped my shirt up and redressed myself. My wolf growled in frustration, but I ignored her. My stomach was in too many knots to worry about finding completion with Adam. The air in my bedroom seemed thicker, as if the stress of our situation was enough to suffocate us. I had mixed emotions on the situation. I knew sending him to be with her was the right thing to do, but the illogical side of my brain didn\u2019t give a damn. Adam was mine and nothing else mattered.</p><p>Adam walked up behind me, placing his hands on my shoulders, and kissed the top of my head. Was it wrong that I wasn\u2019t all that happy they\u2019d found Eve? Of course it was. Just thinking those sorts of thoughts made me hate myself. I couldn\u2019t blame the emotion on my wolf, though she wasn\u2019t happy either. It was jealousy plain and simple.</p><p>\u201cI have to deal with this,\u201d Adam began. \u201cAs soon as I\u2019m back we\u2019ll pick up where we left off.\u201d He turned to leave, but stopped, his hand resting on the doorknob. \u201cEverything will be alright, don\u2019t look so sad.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him as I hugged my arms to my chest. \u201cSaying that doesn\u2019t make it so.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that I was worried about Eve\u2019s recovery and what that meant for Adam and me as a couple. It was that I knew come next week, I\u2019d be in Idaho. Realizing that I was being whiny, I forced a smile onto my face. \u201cNever mind, I\u2019m just tired. Go take care of Eve.\u201d I was proud that my words came out unruffled. Inside I was like an earthquake\u2014shaking and breaking apart.</p><p>Adam watched me for a few seconds before nodding and leaving my bedroom. He\u2019d left the door open so I could see the entire house was up and active, all anticipating the return of their alpha female. Again, the illogical side hated him for leaving. I gave into that anger for all of ten seconds before I pushed it away. I couldn\u2019t handle putting on a brave face for the rest of the night, so I climbed out my bedroom window. Judging by the lightness of the sky I\u2019d say it was around 2:00 a.m. I\u2019d gotten three hours of sleep, but I was too antsy to sleep anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaking a run for it?\u201d</p><p>I gasped and jerked backwards. Looking to the right, Wade was leaning against the side of the house, a cigarette glowing against the darkness as he took a drag.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I bit back, annoyed he\u2019d startled me. \u201cI just needed some air.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, the return of your lover\u2019s mate can\u2019t be an easy thing to deal with,\u201d he mocked.</p><p>I shook my head, too annoyed to deal with a cocky leader. When I walked away, footsteps sounded behind me. Looking over my shoulder, I frowned at Wade following me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter,\u201d I snapped, turning around and continuing my walk to the forest edge.</p><p>\u201cSeeing as how you\u2019re being shipped off to another pack because people are dying, I\u2019d say you do,\u201d Wade remarked, not missing a step as I quickened my pace.</p><p>Whirling around, I stopped and glared at him. My emotions were in a frenzy of jealousy, fear, and sexual frustration. If Wade kept pushing, I was liable to do something stupid, like attack him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going for a run,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go get a drink? The pack will be busy attending to Eve for a while.\u201d Wade took another drag off of his cigarette, the cherry lighting his face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 2:00 a.m.,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI know a bar that doesn\u2019t close until 4:00 a.m.\u201d</p><p>My main reason for wanting to change and run was to relieve stress, alcohol would also work. I glanced back at the house. Wade was right. They\u2019d be occupied with Eve for the rest of the night.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d I told him, and followed him to his truck.</p> <p>The small, little bar sat back behind a row of hunting and fishing stores. Looking from the street you\u2019d never know it was there. I followed Wade down a tiny alleyway, littered with discarded trash. The brick exterior was painted dark green with the words \u2018Wild Things\u2019 on a rectangular board in white. There were no windows on the outside and the metal door had one of those slide thingies that allowed the people inside to peek out and demand a password. Or maybe I\u2019d seen too many movies.</p><p>Wade knocked three times, pausing in between as if a special code was being given. The slide moved open, and two orange eyes stared back at us. I knew those sorts of peepers, whoever this dude was, he was a werewolf.</p><p>Wade pushed the sleeve of his shirt up and held up his arm, his wrist facing the man. The peephole closed and the clanging of deadbolts being unlocked echoed through the door.</p><p>\u201cBack so soon, Mr. Wade?\u201d A large man asked, extending an arm as an invitation to come in. The man, who was as thick and solid as a tree trunk, stood around six-foot-five. What little light there was gleamed off of his bald head like a spotlight. His black T-shirt fit snuggly around each protruding muscle in his arms, which were covered in various tattoos. The one that caught my eye was of two werewolves\u2014one gray and one black\u2014doing the deed under a full moon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the best whiskey in town,\u201d Wade said, and the man grunted in agreement. His eyes quickly found me, piercing and suspicious. \u201cThis is Anna Avery, new one.\u201d</p><p>I resented still being called a \u201cnew one\u201d. I\u2019d been around for four months. That should have given me some semblance of respect.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t turned yesterday,\u201d I snapped at Wade, extending my arm to the brawny man. \u201cNice to meet you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Puck,\u201d Wade said, \u201cand he doesn\u2019t like to be touched.\u201d</p> <p>I let my arm fall and gave Puck a thin lipped smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind the pretty ladies touching me,\u201d Puck drawled, smiling in my direction and holding out his arm. I looked at Wade and he nodded. I clasped Puck\u2019s hand; his so large mine nearly disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Wild Things, Ms. Anna,\u201d Puck smiled and released my hand. A shiver shimmied up my spine, but I did my best to not let my discomfort show. Judging from Puck\u2019s demeanor, this was a place where weakness would be used against you.</p><p>Wade and I stepped inside, my eyes roaming over the small space. The bar wasn\u2019t very big, maybe twenty feet by fifteen. A counter, with shelves full of alcohol bottles behind it, sat towards the back. The lighting was low, puffs of smoke swirling within the soft beams. Most of the patrons were men, with the exception of three women who were sitting at the bar. They were dressed in short skirts or shorts, and their tops left little to the imagination. I caught sight of three doors, all with \u2018do not disturb\u2019 signs on them. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say this was a werewolf brothel. My suspicions were confirmed when a couple stepped out of one of the rooms, the man buckling his belt and the woman adjusting her shirt. The man handed her a roll of cash and they both went their separate ways.</p><p>Wade walked up to the bar, me on his heels. When he stopped I wasn\u2019t watching where I was going and ran into his back. He looked over his shoulder, a smile growing on his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA screwdriver.\u201d</p><p>Wade and the bartender laughed. \u201cShe\u2019ll have a shot of your famous whiskey,\u201d he told the bartender. \u201cSame for me.\u201d The guy smiled and poured the drinks, sliding them to us.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go over here,\u201d Wade said, nodding his head to the right. He walked over to a table that sat further away from the others, and I took the seat across from him. He threw back the shot, and I did the same. The whiskey sliding down my throat burned, warming my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cEw, that\u2019s some strong stuff,\u201d I said around a cough. \u201cSo, what\u2019s this all about? You want to liquor me up and see if I\u2019ll confess to the murders?\u201d I leaned back in my chair and stared at him. Wade was a nice enough guy, but he was also a leader. He may have seemed relaxed, but I wouldn\u2019t let that fool me into letting my guard down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already been sentenced, why would I need a confession?\u201d Wade asked, pushing the shot glass back and forth between his hands. \u201cI just thought you could use some time away from the house. I can tell when you\u2019re trying to be strong, yet breaking inside.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was I supposed to say to that? \u201cYou can?\u201d I asked with skepticism.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hide it as well as you think. It\u2019s written all over your face.\u201d</p><p>I looked away, annoyed that he was right. I\u2019d always been a horrible liar. \u201cThanks, Dr. Phil. I\u2019ll work on it.\u201d</p><p>Wade released a heavy breath, raising his arm in the air to signal the bartender.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the Idaho pack like?\u201d I asked nervously. It\u2019d been a constant question in my brain since I heard I\u2019d be shipped off. My punishment may have been moving away from my new family and working as a servant for the rest of my life, but integrating myself into a new pack was what really scared me. Werewolves tended to be suspicious, judgmental, and mean towards wolves they didn\u2019t know. It all boiled down to packs being a tight knit group who stuck together. There were so many different packs we sorta had to be that way towards others. If we showed weakness, the surrounding packs would take that as a cue to ambush our homes and claim the wolves, thus making their packs larger. Not all large packs happen this way, but it\u2019s not unheard of when dealing with the ruthless, power hungry alphas.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a well-functioning pack of around eighty. The alpha\u2019s name is Ben Jenkins. He\u2019s one of the youngest alphas, and the fiercest. He runs his pack like a well-oiled machine and has bested every man who\u2019s challenged his position. Then again, so has your mate.\u201d Wade winked.</p><p>Mate\u2014that word didn\u2019t apply to what Adam was to me. It wasn\u2019t strong enough to describe who we were to each other. Surprise filled me though at learning that Adam was undefeated when it came to fights. I never thought about someone going against him to claim the alpha spot. I guess I was still na\u00efve when it came to stuff like that. I\u2019d never seen anyone go against Adam\u2019s judgment, but that didn\u2019t mean men weren\u2019t secretly vying for his position.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was pretty cool how you handed Nicholas his ass last night,\u201d Wade said, interrupting my thoughts. A woman in her forties, wearing a red corset, black shorts and black hose with a lace pattern walked up to our table. She set down two chubby glasses filled with amber liquid and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cYou here to interview, honey? You\u2019re hired,\u201d She winked. \u201cWith a face and body like that, you\u2019ll be booked for the next year.\u201d The woman, whose hair was obviously dyed blonde, smiled wide, revealing a chipped front tooth.</p><p>\u201cI...uh...no,\u201d I muttered, too grossed out at the thought to form a coherent sentence.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a friend of mine, Ruth. Just here to keep me company,\u201d Wade told the woman, sliding money across the table. Ruth picked the bills up and tucked them into her bra.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever change your mind,\u201d Ruth said, lying her business card down in front of me. Who knew prostitutes had business cards?</p><p>I nodded, at a loss for words. It wasn\u2019t every day I got propositioned to become a lady of the night. When Ruth sauntered away, I started laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I said through a giggle. \u201cAre seedy underbelly places your normal hangouts?\u201d</p><p>The thought may have grossed me out, but I could see how alluring a place like this would be to a male werewolf\u2014well any male for that matter. Werewolf men just happened to be a little friskier than the humans.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of my job to know the seedy underbelly side of our kind.\u201d Wade smirked.</p><p>I wondered just how well he knew Ruth and her kind. I shuddered thinking about it. Wade was a good-looking guy; surely he didn\u2019t need to depend on paid pleasure to satisfy him.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you a question,\u201d Wade said, sitting forward and propping his elbows on the table. \u201cIf you\u2019re innocent, then why are you not fighting us on your punishment? You do believe you\u2019re innocent, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d I questioned. \u201cYou guys already have your minds made up. Me throwing a tantrum isn\u2019t going to affect your judgment, right?\u201d I frowned, wondering if maybe I should\u2019ve been fighting more. What logical person would accept being shipped off to a strange new pack without so much as a fight? A normal person might even have thoughts of running away so they weren\u2019t treated like a prisoner for the rest of their lives. Did my lack of argument on the subject make me look guiltier? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHumor me,\u201d Wade said, taking a drink.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m actually innocent or not. Just seeing those murders through my dreams was enough to make me sick to my stomach. I don\u2019t want to be that kind of monster. If by some chance I am killing, then being locked up is what\u2019s best for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Wade tipped his head to the side and gave me a sideways glance. \u201cThat\u2019s very...mature of you. Most bloodthirsty werewolves we deal with aren\u2019t so accepting.\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sure most of the murderers you guys deal with don\u2019t have morals.\u201d I snorted. The idea was ridiculous\u2014a murderous werewolf with a conscience.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking you\u2019re not the one who\u2019s killing,\u201d Wade replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the DNA test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t test the other speck of blood we found. The fact that the victims\u2019 blood was on you was enough for the rest of the leaders,\u201d Wade explained, looking away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been having visions,\u201d I blurted. There had to be a connection between the dreams and the strange episodes yesterday. Maybe it was something that would prove I was in fact innocent.</p> <p>Wade shifted in his seat, crossing a leg over his knee. \u201cWhen did this start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday. It first happened when I was taking a shower and when we were in the woods looking for Eve.\u201d I studied Wade\u2019s face to judge his reaction. \u201cThis isn\u2019t normal.\u201d I hadn\u2019t said those words out loud yet and now that they were out, acceptance filled me. I\u2019d be in denial, shucking them off as just dreams. Now, however, they weren\u2019t just happening in my sleep. I couldn\u2019t ignore their importance anymore.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re a seer,\u201d Wade said very calmly. In my mind I envisioned a woman draped in gaudy silks, long fingernails, dramatic eyes, and crystals hanging around her neck as she waved her hands theatrically over a crystal ball. Wade had to be screwing with me.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping for some real answers,\u201d I said with exhaustion. I eyed my drink and pushed the glass away. I wasn\u2019t a big drinker. I was what people called a lightweight, until I became a werewolf. Now I could drain every sip from this bar and walk out of here without so much as a stumble. Okay, that wasn\u2019t true. I could get drunk it just took a hell of a lot more liquor. Still, the alcohol wasn\u2019t sitting well with me tonight, and I\u2019d only had the one shot.</p><p>\u201cWho says what I say is not the truth?\u201d Wade countered. \u201cYou can\u2019t be so na\u00efve as to think magic does not exist. You\u2019re living proof that it does\u2014a werewolf. Plus after sleeping with Adam, you\u2019re branded\u2014fate saying you belong to each other. Add to the fact that Nicholas has his own sordid magic. Plus, you\u2019re a white wolf.\u201d</p><p>First off, how did he know I was a white wolf? \u201cAnd that means I\u2019m some mystical fortune teller?\u201d I snorted, my sleeplessness catching up with me. \u201cI\u2019m ready to head back home.\u201d</p> <p>Wade finished his drink and stood. \u201cDenial only lasts for so long before you\u2019re forced to see the truth, Anna.\u201d</p><p>I followed him out of the bar, making sure to stay far away from Puck as we exited. I didn\u2019t respond to Wade because a nagging voice in the back of my mind told me maybe he was right.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you have first dibs,\u201d the woman teased, laughter following her words. The man...I couldn\u2019t breathe as I looked at him. I recognized both of the people standing over my bleeding body, but the man....oh God...the man. His eyes, blond hair, and the hard lines that made up his angry face</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop this,\u201d he barked at the woman, his eyes filled with remorse. He didn\u2019t know who I was. I was still a stranger to him, a woman he\u2019d feed a story to, to hide a nasty secret.</p><p>My eyes snapped open, and I stared at my bedroom ceiling as I tried to calm the sporadic rhythm of my heart. The day I was attacked rushed full force into my mind. I remembered everything. I was such a fool, a puppet, and Adam was the puppeteer. I danced on his strings and walked the path he guided me down. How could I have been so stupid?</p><p>I checked the time and saw I wasn\u2019t alone in my bed. Adam slept on his side, facing the door. Everything I thought I felt for him turned sour, wilting and dying within me. How could I have not known? There\u2019d been so many of the puzzle pieces right in front of me, yet I didn\u2019t put them together.</p><p>First, Adam found me after the attack. It hadn\u2019t been luck, he\u2019d been there the whole time. Second, Adam found me after I had the run in with the bear trap. \u201cHow\u2019d you find me\u201d I\u2019d asked him. \u201cI\u2019ll always find you.\u201d There\u2019d been a promise in his words, a declaration that I\u2019d misunderstood for passion. Could he find me so easily because he was the one who bit me? No, I was sure that had been Eve. Third, he gained my trust, fooling me into thinking he felt something for me. This one hurt the most. Did he just want to know what I remembered? Or to be close to me when I remembered so he could silence me?</p> <p>A whirlwind of emotion filled my mind and fiery heat rushed through my veins. Anger, betrayal, and depression made me dizzy. My heart jackhammered and my palms turned sweaty. Inching out of bed, I tiptoed out of the door. I took a moment to lean against the wall to catch my breath. My chest rose and fell heavily, and I choked on the sobs that tried to escape my throat. I had to be quiet. What would I say if Adam woke up and saw me like this? Making my way down the hall, I slipped on my sandals and headed outside. The cool morning air helped clear my head a little, but my body was wracked with indecision. I fisted my hands, closed my eyes, and bit back on the scream that lingered on my lips.</p><p>Was I overreacting? Making something out of nothing? This was the second dream I had about Adam and Eve and my attack. Was it my subconscious\u2019 way of telling me something I didn\u2019t want to believe? Shit, this whole thing is so confusing. After the first dream I\u2019d let the nagging feeling go because Adam had tempted me to spend the night with him. Stupid.</p><p>I wanted to run away as much as I wanted to stalk back into the house and demand answers. My choice was made when the front door opened and Adam leaned against the doorframe.</p><p>\u201cAnna, what are you doing out here this early?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him over my shoulder, my hands fisting at my sides. Adam\u2019s eyes widened, and he stepped out of the house, walking over to me. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>I cursed when tears welled in my eyes. All I could do was shake my head and stare at him.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Anna, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Adam\u2019s eyes searched my face and body as if looking for injury. \u201cSay something.\u201d Adam\u2019s hands rested on my shoulders, shaking me.</p><p>\u201cYou knew all along, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I finally said.</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has Eve been killing humans? How long have you been covering for her?\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s face fell, his mouth agape in stunned silence. I turned around and walked towards my truck. I needed to get away from him, away from her, and off the mountain. She\u2019s weak right now. You could kill her easily. I stopped in my tracks and turned, a thought occurring to me.</p><p>\u201cDid you attack Eve to throw us off your trail?\u201d Adam stood in the same space, a lost look on his face. His hair was ruffled from sleeping, and his bare chest was highlighted by the rising sun. It should have been a crime to look that good and be evil.</p><p>\u201cAnna, we need to talk about this,\u201d Adam pleaded.</p><p>\u201cHere I am, talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. I didn\u2019t know\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop lying, Adam,\u201d I interrupted. How could this man be my other half, my chante? The mark on my hand was a brand of stupidity\u2014for believing in something when all the warning signs were right in front of me. Stupid. I ignored Adam and walked around my truck, opening the door, and slipping inside. Adam ran forward, and I slapped my hand down on the lock. He fought with the handle, his eyes wild.</p><p>\u201cAnna, please don\u2019t leave. I can explain.\u201d I flipped the visor down and caught the keys that fell, slipping them into the ignition, and starting the truck. I spared Adam one last glance before putting pressure on the gas pedal and driving away. The death grip on the steering wheel turned my knuckles white. Glancing in the rearview mirror, I watched as Adam\u2019s body got smaller and smaller. Once away from him, I allowed the tears to fall.</p><p>It must have been true. Why else would he react like that? I slammed a hand against the steering wheel in frustration, flipping on the radio to tune out the screams in my head.</p><p>Not knowing where to go, I headed up the mountain to Trigger Lake. It was far enough away and rarely had tourists due to the rough terrain. I was still in my pajamas and hadn\u2019t grabbed my purse on the way out. I checked the ashtray. I usually kept a few spare bills hidden inside. There was only ten bucks, not enough to do anything with. How the in hell was I supposed to flee when I was broke?</p><p>Anna, please come back. I swear I can explain. Adam\u2019s voice penetrated my mind, causing me to swerve. Reaching out, I turned the radio knob all the way up, the music filling the cab, but it didn\u2019t drown out Adam\u2019s voice like I hoped.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know Eve was responsible, I promise. I knew she was up to something, but I swear I didn\u2019t know it was this. The strain of his inner voice nagged at my heart like a knife slicing through butter.</p><p>Leave. Me. Alone. I closed my eyes for a split second. When I opened them Adam stood in the middle of the road, ten feet away. What in the hell? Slamming on the breaks, my truck fishtailed. The tires squealed against the asphalt. I fought to get the steering wheel under control, but in my state of panic and distress, I turned it the wrong way and then I was rolling. A blood curdling scream ripped from my lips and filled the cab of the truck. My head bounced off of the driver\u2019s side door, and stars danced within my vision. Metal against road screeched and groaned as my truck slid along the road. When the truck stopped moving, I worked with clumsy hands to unlatch the seatbelt. Adrenaline rushed through my veins. My heart raced and my body shook. The truck landed on the passenger\u2019s side, so once I got the seatbelt undone, I stood up as best as I could. With my elbow, I pushed forward and the sheet of glass fell outside. Bracing my hands on either side of the window, I hoisted my body up, sitting on the door and bringing my legs up. Hopping down, I stumbled away from the truck and rested against the guardrail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My entire body shook uncontrollably and tears and blood streamed down my face. Reaching up, I touched the gash on my forehead and winced from the pain. There was a cut on my right arm and my pajama pants were torn. Remembering the reason for the accident, I tried to find Adam. What was he doing in the middle of the highway? And how had he gotten up here so quickly? Smoke rose from the hood of the truck, but just beyond it I could make out the silhouette of a body. A breeze swept the smoke away giving me a clear view of Adam. His jaw was set in stone, and he walked with purpose towards me, a sickening smile transforming his face from beautiful to sinister. I swallowed around the lump in my throat, afraid of what he\u2019d do. I couldn\u2019t fight back, not after tumbling around in my truck like clothes in a washer.</p><p>Adam stopped in front of me, his eyes regarding me with anger. I watched him, speechless and afraid. The man who stood before me wasn\u2019t the same man I\u2019d slept with. Gone was the loving gaze and in its place was ugliness. As I opened my mouth to say something, Adam lifted his hand and swung. His fist connected with the side of my face, the impact knocked me over the guardrail and then it was lights out.</p><p>I came to with a nasty headache and dry mouth. When I opened my eyes, I was shrouded in darkness. My arms were above my head and I couldn\u2019t move them. The rattling of chains echoed through the room with each movement I made. The cold metal bit into my wrist, not giving an inch of space.</p> <p>It took my eyes a little longer to adjust to the darkness; my head still throbbed. Adam had stripped me down. I didn\u2019t wear underwear or a bra to bed, so I was naked. With my foot, I felt around on the floor that was made of lose dirt. Inhaling, I tried to capture the scent of anything that might give me a clue where I was. Mildew, rodents, and blood hung in the air. Looking to my left, there was a sliver of light piercing through the darkness underneath what must be a door. Footsteps sounded behind it. I fought against the chains, but to no avail.</p><p>The door swung open hard, causing me to jump. Adam stood in the doorway, that same sickening smile on his face. This had to be a nightmare. There was no way this man and my Adam were the same person. Wake up...wake up! I repeated the mantra over and over in my head, but my pleas went unanswered. Stalking into the room, Adam flicked a switch on the wall and the room lit up with dim light. I closed my eyelids; even the subtle light hurt my eyes. The clang of the door being shut urged me to open them again. Adam paced in front of me, his hands tucked behind his back as he kept focus on my naked body.</p><p>Oh how I hated him and myself. How had he fooled me so cleverly?</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re confused,\u201d he said, smiling as if there was some inside joke I wasn\u2019t privy to.</p><p>I stared, too angry to engage in a conversation with this monster.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is, I\u2019m a purebred, and you\u2019re beneath me in every way. Packs used to kill your kind\u2014when times made sense. Now, packs are full of half breeds...mutts,\u201d He said half breeds and mutts as if they tasted bad on his tongue. \u201cThe only thing you\u2019re good for is a fuck every now and then.\u201d He stopped pacing, his eyes dropping to my bare breasts.</p><p>I cringed under his insinuating stare, my stomach nauseous from learning the truth of who I fell in love with.</p><p>\u201cDid you really think you were worthy of an alpha?\u201d He laughed. \u201cSo na\u00efve.\u201d</p><p>He paced back and forth, his eyes regarding me with hatred. Well the feeling was mutual.</p><p>\u201cEve,\u201d he called. The door opened and in stepped the other person I hated, Eve. Her short auburn hair was perfectly styled, her face made up, and she wore black cotton shorts, a white tank top and red heels. It didn\u2019t look like she\u2019d been attacked by a werewolf. What in the hell?</p><p>\u201cNow this,\u201d Adam continued, holding out his hand towards Eve. She grasped it and stepped into his embrace. \u201cIs a woman worthy of an alpha. She\u2019s beautiful, ruthless, and fucks like an angel.\u201d They shared a seductive laugh before their lips found each other and kissed passionately. I closed my eyes to shield myself from the pain. I may not have been able to see them, but I could hear them. Moans and the rustling of clothes beat against my eardrums. It was my nightmare coming true. Please don\u2019t let them have sex.</p> <p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d Eve\u2019s voice replaced the smacking sounds, and I opened my eyes. She wiped her mouth with her thumb, a smile on her red lips. \u201cI told you to stay away from him, but like the whore you are, you just couldn\u2019t help yourself. I can\u2019t blame you, though. He is tempting.\u201d She glanced at Adam and he winked.</p><p>\u201cNow, here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Eve said, stepping towards me and kneeling down so we were eye level. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep you alive for a day or so and have some fun with you. After that, well, use your imagination. We\u2019ll tell the leaders we caught you feasting on another human, and in our attempts to subdue you, you fought against us. We had no choice but to put you down. The case will be closed and the leaders will leave.\u201d She smiled, her eyes alight with excitement. \u201cI thought for sure the leaders would kill after finding the blood on your face.\u201d Eve shook her head, annoyed. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll have to do it myself.\u201d</p><p>None of this made any sense.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get away with it,\u201d I bit back.</p><p>\u201cDid she talk back to me?\u201d Eve asked, turning to speak to Adam.</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d Adam answered with a smile. \u201cMaybe you should show her what happens when mutts get mouthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d Eve grinned.</p><p>My head snapped back against the stone wall as Eve slapped my face, hard. My cheek burned, tingling in the aftermath of her assault.</p> <p>\u201cYou know how long I\u2019ve wanted to do that?\u201d she asked. \u201cPlease say something else. I dare you.\u201d</p><p>I glared, but kept my lips sealed. When I didn\u2019t respond, Eve frowned.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d she growled, landing another slap against my face.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want her too bruised for when we give her body to the leaders.\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s fingers flexed against her knee, itching to land another blow. I released the breath I\u2019d been holding when she stood back up.</p><p>Walking over to Adam, Eve hooked a finger in his jeans and tugged him closer. \u201cCome on, you know how violence gets me horny.\u201d They shared a seductive look and without another word, left the room, flipping the light switch off as they went.</p><p>I leaned my head against the brick wall, overwhelmed and panicked. Were they planning on torturing me before they killed me? That\u2019s what it sounded like. How in the hell was I going to get out of this? My mind was numb, to full of deception to think straight. Adam and Eve had played a good game. My arms were sore. I didn\u2019t know how long I\u2019d been chained up before I came to. There weren\u2019t any windows in the small room. It could have been hours or days, time didn\u2019t exist here. I tried, in vain, to fight against the shackles, but the metal bit deeper into my flesh the more I struggled. What kind of person has a torture chamber just waiting to be used? A sick bitch like Eve, that\u2019s who.</p><p>Giving up, I became lethargic and my eyelids heavy. Moans sounded from somewhere, floating into my room and abusing my ears. Closing my eyes, I took a deep breath and let sleep take me away from the painful melody.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>\u201cWake up,\u201d someone ordered. Frigid water splashed across my body. I fought myself back to reality, shaking my head to fling the water off of my face. Adam stood in front of me, an empty bucket in his hands.</p><p>\u201cDinner time.\u201d He smiled, nodding towards the right. Looking in the direction, a dog bowl sat filled with what looked like wet dog food. I wanted to scream and cry, unable to believe someone could be this heartless. But I held the emotions inside, not allowing Adam the pleasure of seeing me break.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little hard to eat with my hands bound,\u201d I told him. He dug in his pocket, pulling out a small silver key and holding it up. This was good. All I needed was my arms free and then I could shift and fight.</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been here?\u201d I had to keep talking to make him think I wasn\u2019t plotting my escape.</p><p>\u201cThree days,\u201d Adam said, grabbing my chained wrists and inserting the key. \u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to know your friends are searching for you. It\u2019s a pity they won\u2019t find you...alive.\u201d</p><p>Once the shackles were unlocked, my arms dropped to my sides like wet noodles. Adam stepped back, putting space between us. Reaching behind him, he produced a glock and aimed it at me.</p><p>\u201cOne false move and these silver bullets will find a home in your heart, got it?\u201d</p><p>Well shit. That took care of my escape plan.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d Adam ordered, leaning against the wall.</p><p>I stared at him, studied his face and noticed a few oddities. His hair wasn\u2019t as blond as before and his eyes, what little I could see of them, were a greenish blue, not the dark sapphires I\u2019d lost myself in before. My eyebrows furrowed as I noted each difference.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell are you staring at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see your palms,\u201d I asked.</p><p>Adam laughed, a harsh sound that had nothing to do with joy. Holding out his hands, my mouth dropped open when I saw smooth flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d keep that mark did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I mumbled, too befuddled to think of anything else.</p><p>\u201cMelted the skin. The scar slid right off,\u201d Adam turned his palm to study it. \u201cIt was painful as fuck, but worth it. Like an alpha could ever be bonded to a mutt. Disgusting.\u201d</p><p>A lump the size of a golf ball lodged in my throat, making breathing a chore. Disgusting. That\u2019s what he thought of me. The tears I\u2019d been hiding from him filled my eyes and fell against my cheeks. I dropped my head, hating myself for showing weakness in front of Adam.</p><p>\u201cAw.\u201d His voice was closer than before. I looked up through my eyelashes, and he was bent down in front of me. His finger tilted my chin up so he could see my whole face. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t all bad,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou were a good fuck. We had fun, didn\u2019t we?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I didn\u2019t answer, he gripped my chin tighter. \u201cDidn\u2019t we?\u201d he asked again, his voice harder and demanding I agree with him.</p><p>Though my arms were sore and tired from being held above my head, I lifted one and swung with as much force as I could. Adam caught my wrist before it landed its blow. That was the last straw, the last hope I\u2019d hung onto. I was defeated and weak, a blip on my captors radar and nothing more. I never felt so helpless in my life. Adam gripped both of my wrists in one hand and slammed them against the wall above my head. I didn\u2019t move as he shackled them again. He left the room, not saying another word, making sure to turn the light off as he went.</p><p>My mind was in a dark, dark place; one that I never visited before. It was filled with hatred, self-loathing, and a depression so great it ate away at me. I sat still, staring ahead into the darkness as I let all of emotion in at once. My wolf snapped and bit to break free. She was angry and just as rabid as I felt. Time slipped by at a snail\u2019s pace. I sat in the same position staring ahead, dazed as I retreated to the dark hell inside my head. When his voice penetrated through the ugly emotions, it took me a moment to understand it was really there and not just me thinking of his words.</p> <p>Anna, where are you? Answer me, Chante.</p><p>Hot fresh tears spilled over my cheeks, heating my cool skin. So this was the torture Adam planned to inflict on me, making me think he still loved me? It was worse than I expected, worse than any physical pain he could cause. This kind of abuse attacked my heart and my fragile state of mind. I didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Damn it. Anna, please answer me. Tell me you\u2019re okay. I don\u2019t care if you need space. I just need to know if you\u2019re alright.</p><p>His voice wasn\u2019t hard anymore. It sounded velvety soft and concerned. Reminding me how easily he\u2019d fooled me.</p><p>You should win an Emmy, I responded.</p> <p>Holy hell, Anna, where are you?</p><p>I tried to block out his voice. I wouldn\u2019t play this game and lose what little bit of my mind I still had. That fantasy was dead.</p><p>The days dragged on and on and on. Adam and Eve visited me once a day either to bring me slop or to knock me around a little. I found myself hoping they\u2019d put me out of my misery. But they were having too much fun holding me captive to grant me my wish.</p><p>Adam continued to speak to me telepathically, but I never responded. My body was weak from the lack of food. The last time I\u2019d eaten was the last day I\u2019d spent with the pack. I felt like crying, but I had nothing left to give. My eyes couldn\u2019t shed anymore tears. My arms were numb, having been pinned above my head for who knows how long. I tried to flex my fingers, but I couldn\u2019t feel them anymore. My body, which ran hot, was freezing and hurt from shaking so much.</p><p>Loud bangs and what sounded like growling sounded above me. I tilted my head up, studying the ceiling. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was real or my imagination playing tricks with my mind. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time since I\u2019d been here. A similar noise traveled outside the door. Sickening cracks, snarls, and yelps serenated the small space. I watched the door in horror, afraid of what was coming. With one last feeble attempt, I pulled against my chains. They didn\u2019t budge, not that I expected them to.</p><p>Something was thrown against the door, the metal to groan in protest. The handle jiggled, but the intruder couldn\u2019t get in without a key. Crunching metal echoed a horrific sound and the door was kicked open. I screeched, moving as far away as my binds would allow. I tucked my head down, not wanting to see what was in the room with me. I just hoped it\u2019d killed me quick.</p> <p>When nothing happened, I looked up, peaking through the stringy strands of my hair. Enough light filtered through the door so I could see Adam. His face depicted disbelief and relief all in one. His eyes were wide, his mouth a hard line as he set his jaw. As soon as we made eye contact, he rushed forward. He fell beside me, his arms wrapping around my frame and bringing me against his chest. I wanted to fight against him, but I was too lethargic, too dazed, and too empty to care. If he wanted to play out this fantasy, at least I\u2019d die with a happy memory\u2014even if it was fictional.</p><p>His anger buzzed in the air like a downed power line. Reaching up, he clasped my restraints and tugged. The metal creaked, falling from the wall, my arms falling with it. Adam broke apart the manacles and freed my wrists. He still hadn\u2019t said a word, just watched me as he rescued me from my prison. Once out of my chains, Adam scooped me into his arms, hugging me against his chest and whispering soft words I chose to ignore. I could lose myself in his embrace, even pretend he was the man I thought he was, but I could not listen to his lies. I tuned him out and inhaled a lungful of his scent. It\u2019d been so intoxicating to me before, comforting me when I needed it, and seducing me when my body yearned for him. It still touched me, hitting that spot in my chest that fell for him. I hated it and loved it at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAnna.\u201d My name was a soft whisper on his lips, a declaration of passion that didn\u2019t belong. I closed my eyes and devoured the sound of his voice, imagining that I made this hell up and when I woke, I\u2019d be in my bedroom lying next to the real Adam.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry, so sorry,\u201d Adam was saying, his voice pained and full of anguish I didn\u2019t understand. Another round of loud snarling and cracks sounded. Adam set me down, pulling his T-shirt over his head, and helping me into it. As soon as I was covered, he lifted me again and we were moving.</p><p>I hid my face against his chest, not caring about the chaos around me. Adam\u2019s arms offered a peaceful cocoon where I could lose myself in his scent and the warmth of his body.</p><p>A gun fired, its blast ringing in my ears disturbing my peacefulness. Something that sounded like a body dropped in front of us, and Adam stepped over, continuing our quick escape. Peeking through one eye, I looked up at him. His face was serious, hard, and full of worry. As if he could feel my eyes on him, he looked down, his blue eyes tinged with gold.</p><p>Adam looked away, focused on moving. Within minutes, he burst through another door and sunshine flooded my face, causing me to wince. Was the sun always this bright?</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d a man\u2019s voice called behind us. Adam turned, his fingers digging into my thighs as he held me tighter.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, brother. This has just begun,\u201d Adam replied icily.</p><p>Brother? Who was he talking to? Adam turned again, and out of curiosity, I peeked over his shoulder. My mouth fell open as I stared at a man who looked eerily similar to the man holding me. I doubled checked the face of the guy carrying me and then looked back at the man who stood off in the distance. They had the same blond hair and build. Adam called that man \u201cbrother\u201d. Reaching a hand up, I cupped the side of Adam\u2019s face, his eyes full of fury.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Chante. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found me,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI told you that I\u2019d always find you, Anna,\u201d Adam said, repeating words he\u2019d once told me. They were more than words, they were a promise, a declaration\u2014a vow. Whatever predicament I found myself in, Adam would be the light at the end of the tunnel, guiding me home.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat more,\u201d Elle snapped, eyeing my still full plate.</p><p>I\u2019d been back home for a day, but had only been awake for three hours. Elle fixed me something to eat as soon as she knew my eyes were open. Her mothering ways were sweet, but annoying.</p><p>\u201cI need to eat a little bit at a time, otherwise I\u2019ll vomit,\u201d I told her for the third time. I learned when I woke up I\u2019d been gone for six days. The pack assumed I was dead, but Adam forced them to continue searching the mountain. From the looks of my friends, they hadn\u2019t gotten much sleep in my absence.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve dropped ten pounds,\u201d Elle commented, closing her mouth when I frowned.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t talked about my time as a prisoner. Speculations circled, I\u2019m sure, but I wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to correct them.</p><p>Elle and I glanced over when footsteps squeaked against the wood floors. Sawyer stood in the entry of the kitchen, a huge bouquet of colorful Gerbera daisies, carnations, lilies and greenery with a \u201cGet Well Soon\u201d Mylar balloon rising from the top.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think...\u201d Sawyer whispered, his voice barely audible over the catch in his throat.</p><p>I bit my bottom lip to keep the sorrow off my face. I needed to be strong so they\u2019d know I was fine...even if I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Sawyer walked over, holding out the flowers. I grabbed them and smiled at him. \u201cThank you. They\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Sawyer\u2019s eyes were wide, his mouth open, and his hands shook the tiniest bit. Without a word, he sat down at the kitchen table and stared at me in awe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I told him. I had quite a few visitors and was good at lying. I sniffed the flowers, straining to keep the smile on my lips. It felt mechanical but I hoped it looked genuine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...damn, Anna,\u201d Sawyer said inarticulately, clearing his throat. \u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that already,\u201d Elle reminded me.</p><p>I glanced at her and then back at Sawyer. They watched me, observing me with concern and embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to lie down,\u201d I told them, using the excuse to escape the heaviness of their stares. \u201cI really appreciate the flowers, Sawyer.\u201d He smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything? Tea?\u201d Elle asked as I got up.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, fine?\u201d Elle provided.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Walking down the hall, I slipped inside my bedroom and closed the door. A couple vases of flowers rested on my dresser, accompanied by cards, and other various items. Joe got me a stuffed pig with a biker jacket that read \u201cBorn Wild\u201d. I suspected it was the only presentable gift they had at the gas station. It made me laugh\u2014at least internally. Walking over to my bed, I curled into the fetal position, hugging my pillow to my chest. I stared at the wall as thoughts occupied my mind, too many to sort through. Instead, I focused on the white noise of my inner, inquisitive voice, the questions fading into nothingness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t know how long I laid there before my bedroom door opened. Adam sat on the edge of my bed, his fingers brushing over my forehead and down my cheek in a gentle caress. It was still difficult to look at him, to believe in him, but I was getting better. When I first woke up, he\u2019d been there, sitting in a chair beside my bed. It freaked me out, and I\u2019m sure it freaked him out when I screamed at the sight of him. After calming me down, he gave me some space and said he\u2019d be back.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...okay. Still a little weak,\u201d I told him.</p> <p>\u201cHow about we get you a bath?\u201d Adam leaned over and kissed the top of my head, his powerful scent enveloping me.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was bathed when I got home?\u201d I asked, mild fear in my voice. Was I still a bloody, dirty mess? Is that why everyone stared me with worried eyes?</p><p>Adam brushed his hand over my head in a soothing motion. \u201cYou were out of it when I brought you home. I didn\u2019t want to give you a bath while you were passed out, so I cleaned your face, arms, and legs with a wash cloth.\u201d</p><p>Adam gave me sponge bath? My heart softened towards him a little bit, but my mind was still wary of the feeling.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d I sat up, bringing my knees around to face him. I focused on his chest then slowly moved my eyes up his throat to his nose and then his eyes. We regarded each other for a few seconds before Adam stood, leaned over, and lifted me into his arms.</p> <p>\u201cI can walk,\u201d I mumbled, hating the weakness in my voice. I didn\u2019t even recognize it anymore. Amazing what six days of torture could do.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Adam said softly, \u201cbut I like holding you.\u201d He paused. \u201cWould you rather walk?\u201d</p><p>I glanced up. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Once in the bathroom, Adam set me down in front of the mirror. I hadn\u2019t looked at myself since I\u2019d gotten back. I didn\u2019t want to see the evidence of my capture.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d Adam asked, resting his hands on my shoulders. His presence was dominating and comforting. But can I trust those feelings? I looked up, my eyes finding the reflecting glass. My blonde hair was stringy, clinging to my head in a matted mess. My brown eyes had dark circles around them, sunken and afraid. My body\u2014Elle had been right\u2014 was thinner and fragile. A three inch gash that started from my hairline and traveled down over my forehead was half-healed. Purple and yellow bruises dotted my face, arms, and chest, contrasting against my fading tan.</p><p>When I didn\u2019t respond to Adam\u2019s question, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to undress you.\u201d</p> <p>I watched in the mirror as his fingers curled underneath the large T-shirt he\u2019d clothed me in when he found me. With gentle hands, he lifted it up and over my head, setting it on the counter. More bruises decorated my stomach and legs. My eyes found Adam\u2019s before I looked away. I couldn\u2019t bear to see the sympathy on his face. I wanted him to scowl, to argue, to show other emotion than empathy. I need to get my head together and find my strength, find my voice.</p><p>Guiding me over to the tub, that was already full, Adam stepped inside and sat down, outstretching a hand for me to join him. I eyed him, not expecting him to join me. Finally, I stepped into the tub and sat down between his legs. His arms surrounded my waist, resting on my stomach. Out of curiosity, I flipped his hand over. The raised scar was in the same place as mine. I trailed a finger over it, unsure if it was real or not.</p><p>\u201cWho was he?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYour captor?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Adam was silent, his hands fisting against my skin. \u201cMy brother, Anthony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looked just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy twin brother,\u201d he hesitated, his hands relaxing. \u201cYou thought he was me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t miss the offence in his voice.</p><p>\u201cHe looked just like you,\u201d I repeated. \u201cHe pretended he was you.\u201d</p><p>Adam released an annoyed breath, rising to a sitting position and reaching for the washrag. He squeezed a dollop of soap into the cloth and trailed it over my shoulders and down my arms.</p><p>\u201cYou really think I\u2019d be capable of treating you like that?\u201d The edge of his voice awakened something within me, making me feel more alive than I had since coming home. I needed to test this theory of mine.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I told him and waited for his response in hopes I\u2019d get the right one.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Adam said, his tone clipped and cold. \u201cSo everything I\u2019ve told you, admitted to you, shown you, meant nothing? You were able to forget it that easily?\u201d His voice grew angrier, but still controlled enough that it didn\u2019t raise in pitch.</p><p>A spark ignited within me, that fire that\u2019d always been between me and him. The one I used to push him away all those times before. I grasped it, clutched it with dear life and smiled when more of my former self pushed through the gloomy fog. If it took arguing with Adam to escape the dark place in my head, I\u2019d start world war three. I thought about what to say, testing the words in my head before speaking. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, I fled from the house because you were keeping something from me. You knew all along, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I accused him.</p><p>A growl vibrated through his throat. \u201cYou will not blame this on me. I tried to explain, tried to get you to stop. If you weren\u2019t so stubborn and had listened to me, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d He threw the accusations right back at me.</p><p>I smiled, biting down on my lip to hide it from Adam. This was normal, me and Adam going back and forth. He didn\u2019t watch his words around me or treat me like a fragile piece of glass. His defenses were up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ignoring my question,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cIf I answer your question, it\u2019ll be the last we speak of it. I can\u2019t talk until I\u2019m blue in the face to make you believe me. At some point you\u2019re going to have to have as much faith in me as I do you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, I had a feeling it was Eve who was killing the humans,\u201d he started. \u201cIt was only a feeling though. I didn\u2019t have any proof and to accuse one\u2019s mate of murder is a serious offence against their nature.\u201d</p><p>I flinched at hearing him called her his mate.</p><p>\u201cAs for the dream, it was not me with her when she attacked you, it was Anthony. My brother went rogue when I took my father\u2019s place as alpha. He always thought packs should be made up of purebreds. That\u2019s why my father didn\u2019t choose him to rule. When we were in our early twenties, before I was alpha, Anthony and Eve hooked up from time to time at our semiannual summits. Of course I didn\u2019t know this until my father named me his successor and announced that Eve would be my mate. Anthony held that against me, even more than taking the position of alpha,\u201d He stopped talking to reach for a cup. He filled it with water and poured it over my hair, his fingers caressing my scalp as he massaged shampoo into my dirty locks.</p><p>\u201cHe loved her and love can make you accept things about another person that you thought you never could. Eve was always a little more aggressive than normal. She and my brother shared the same frame of mind when it came to purebred packs. I suspected they still met up from time to time, but all I had were speculations. And in all honesty, I didn\u2019t mind. I didn\u2019t love her and my brother did. I guess it was my way of giving him something he wanted.\u201d</p><p>It was a lot to take in. I never heard him, or anyone else in the pack, talk about a brother. Part of me understood Anthony\u2019s fury. He\u2019d wanted to become alpha, but it\u2019d been giving to his brother. He loved Eve, but she was given to Adam. I could see how his resentment could grow from disappointment and heartache to something more bitter and dangerous. Did that mean I had sympathy towards the man who held me prisoner and treated me like something he\u2019d stepped in? No, I still hated him, but I understood him better.</p><p>\u201cBut you acted like you knew something when I asked about Eve killing humans,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you think that. I didn\u2019t know for sure, that\u2019s why I wanted you to come back and tell me what happened. Maybe we could have formed a coherent piece of evidence between the two of us,\u201d Adam said, his voice calmer. \u201cAnthony once told me Eve had a dark side, a side he wasn\u2019t sure he could tolerate. He didn\u2019t tell me what it was, but I think I know now. When everyone thought you were killing humans, I asked myself the same question: could I handle that darkness within you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be hard to refuse you, Anna.\u201d</p><p>Silence settled between us as Adam washed my body and hair. I felt more like myself in his presence and better now that I knew Adam wasn\u2019t involved with Eve and the killing of humans.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like talking about it?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>I owed him the details of my stay with Anthony and Eve. If it were him who\u2019d gone through it, I\u2019d want to know what happened. I told him about everything, starting with the car crash and how I thought it was him in the middle of the road to Anthony fooling me into thinking he melted the scar off of his hand. I also told him about the torture of hearing him and Eve having sex. By the time I finished, Adam\u2019s body was rigid and made of stone.</p><p>\u201cHow about we get out and get you something to eat,\u201d Adam said, standing and helping me up.</p><p>He tried very hard to rein in his temper and stay calm around me, and I hated it. I needed the fiery passion of his words and anger. That spark ignited something within me and helped me react.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch yourself around me,\u201d I told him as he slipped a robe around my shoulders. \u201cEveryone\u2019s walking on eggshells, treating me like I\u2019ll crack under the pressure. I need normalcy and you holding your tongue and smiling is not normal.\u201d I caught his gaze in the mirror.</p><p>His body relaxed a little. \u201cYou\u2019re damn frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that truth enough for you?\u201d</p><p>I smiled and nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow, let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>As we made our way out of the bathroom, I stopped. The house was loud.

Walking over to my bed, he turned down the covers and pointed. \u201cYou need to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Adam. I\u2019m not a little girl. If something is going on, don\u2019t shield me from it.\u201d</p> <p>Adam\u2019s jaw set, and his teeth clenched as he stared daggers at me. It may have been the wrong timing, but he was sexy as hell when he tried to be the oh-so-powerful-alpha.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going on. They\u2019re here to show their support. You don\u2019t need to entertain them. We planned to play cards tonight anyway,\u201d Adam said, resting his hands on his hips and arching an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cSee, why do I think you\u2019re lying to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Anna, and get into bed,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Inside I was doing cartwheels. Though my body was still weak, I felt like myself. I was so happy to be away from the dark place in my head I couldn\u2019t help but goad Adam a little.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d I turned, reaching for the door when Adam\u2019s arms wrapped around my waist. He lifted me into the air with ease, turned around, and deposited me on the bed.</p><p>\u201cIf you move an inch, I\u2019ll strap you to that damn thing, understand?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Adam\u2019s stony face softened, his lips lifting into a grin, and his eyes lighting with an emotion I came to recognize as want. As delicious as he was, my body wasn\u2019t up for any frisky business. Leaning down, he pressed a kiss to me, his lips velvety smooth. His warm breath blew against my mouth, a seductive caress that promised more. All of my resolve disappeared as my focus settled on the delectable tightening in my stomach. Would Adam always affect me this way? I hoped so.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Adam spoke against my lips, \u201cgo to sleep and dream of me. I\u2019ll see you in the morning. If you need anything, ring the bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBell?\u201d</p><p>Adam picked up a small, brass bell from my nightstand and shook it back and forth. \u201cI\u2019ll hear it.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t doubt it; our hearing was very sensitive, even in a house full of rowdy werewolves. I nodded and settled down, but frowned a little so he\u2019d know that even though I was doing what he wanted, I wasn\u2019t happy about it.</p><p>A smirk lifted one side of his mouth. Reaching towards me, he pressed another soft kiss to my mouth. I curled my upper lip inward to hide my smile.</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep.\u201d</p><p>I watched him leave, closing the door behind him. I half-hoped he\u2019d come back in and lay beside me. After staring for five minutes, I yawned and flipped over, hugging the blankets. I didn\u2019t want to admit it, but I was very tired. It didn\u2019t take long for the plush comfort of my mattress to ease me to sleep.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>The loud chattering of voices stirred me from my sleep. Rolling over, I glanced at my alarm clock\u20141:00 a.m. Yawning, my mouth was dryer than a desert; I swung my legs over the edge of my bed. Stumbling, still half asleep, I opened my door and headed toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAnna is not to know about this,\u201d Adam said, stopping me in my tracks. I was awake now. I pressed against the side of the wall, making sure I wasn\u2019t visible by the men sitting at the table.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019ll figure it out?\u201d Wade replied with a snort.</p> <p>\u201cIf she does, it better not be from one of you,\u201d Adam warned.</p><p>What the hell are they talking about?</p><p>\u201cYou forget your place, alpha,\u201d Nicholas snapped back.</p><p>The rest of the house was still abuzz with a few members of the pack, far less than before.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean any disrespect,\u201d Adam started, \u201cbut I\u2019ll do whatever I have to do to keep her safe. They\u2019ll use her against me to get their way. I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d</p><p>There was silence and then Jeff spoke. \u201cIt was a surprise to see how quickly they gathered a following.\u201d</p><p>Grunts of agreement circled around the table. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to call surrounding packs to assist with the take down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem, isn\u2019t it? We don\u2019t know who they have on their side,\u201d Jeff commented.</p><p>\u201cAnna, did you need something?\u201d Joe asked, coming around the corner and arching a knowing brow at me.</p><p>I gave him my best please-don\u2019t-rat-me-out face, and he nodded, a shallow movement but relief washed through me.</p><p>The talking at the table ceased, a chair squeaked and Adam walked up behind Joe.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out of bed?\u201d Adam asked, coming around Joe and gripping my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI was thirsty and\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I explain what the bell was for?\u201d Adam said incredulous.</p><p>\u201cI also needed to go to the bathroom,\u201d I added. \u201cAre you going to do that for me too?\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled, a sexy glint lighting his eyes. Ignoring him, I slipped into the bathroom and shut the door. Walking over to the mirror, I gawked at my reflection. My hair was all kinds of chaos, and Joe and Adam had seen it. That\u2019ll teach me to go to bed with it wet again. Fishing a brush out of the drawer, I ran it through my frizzy locks a few times. When enough time had passed, I walked over to the toilet and flushed, hoping I\u2019d fooled Adam. His conversation with the leaders nagged my mind. What were they talking about? I hadn\u2019t asked him what happened to Eve and Anthony. I hadn\u2019t questioned him about that day at all. Would he even tell me? There seemed to be secret plan underway and he was doing his damnest to exclude me from it.</p><p>Opening the bathroom door, I came face to face with the man in question. Adam leaned against the wall, a glass of water in his hand. As I watched him, I noticed how pale his face was and how bloodshot his eyes were.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you slept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said with genuine confusion. I took the glass; clasping his hand I led him to my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re planning something,\u201d I told him, straightening the blankets.</p><p>He scowled, realizing I heard at least part of his conversation.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to work if our pack has a sleep deprived alpha leading them.\u201d I smiled, finding it funny that Adam and I had reversed roles and now he needed to be persuaded to rest.</p><p>\u201cYou need to sleep.\u201d I nodded toward the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep,\u201d Adam said, dragging his T-shirt over his head. My eyes soaked up the beauty of his chest and abs. \u201cBut lay with me. You still need to rest too.\u201d</p><p>I flicked a glance to the door, anxious to snoop into Adam\u2019s secret plan.</p><p>\u201cNothing out there concerns you, Anna,\u201d Adam said, catching onto my idea. He shuffled into bed, inching over so there was room for me. Propping himself up on his elbow, he stabbed the mattress with his finger, and his I-mean-business stare pinned me in my place.</p><p>\u201cGet. Into. Bed.\u201d</p><p>I spared one more look at the door. If I disobeyed him, he\u2019d be out of that bed and hauling my ass back before I made it down the hallway. Declaring defeat, I climbed into bed. Adam slung an arm around my waist, guiding me against the hard plains of his body. He was so warm, my muscles immediately relaxed against him. Being held prisoner had taken a lot out of me. It could have been worse. Eve and Anthony could have really tortured me.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Adam mumbled, his nose buried within my hair.</p><p>\u201cAt the place where you found me,\u201d I paused, a new question occurring to me. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tracked you,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>It was a bit surprising, but not all that out of the ordinary for a werewolf. \u201cAnd?\u201d I fished.</p><p>\u201cAnd nothing. You\u2019re home, you\u2019re safe, and you\u2019re in my arms. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>His dodging knew no bounds. Frustration and anger overthrew my nonchalance. Where did he get off keeping things from me? Especially when those things involved me.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Eve and Anthony?\u201d I asked through clenched teeth.</p><p>Adam released a breath through his nose, a subtle sign he was just as annoyed and frustrated with me as I was with him.</p><p>\u201cThey fled,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut they won\u2019t hurt you again. Now close your eyes and go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>When I opened my eyes and saw my bedroom, I frowned. I planned on sneaking out of bed after Adam fell asleep and doing a little recon. I guess becoming a spy was not in my future. Still, I vowed that I\u2019d find out what Adam was hiding.</p><p>Sitting up in bed, I looked over my shoulder. Adam was gone, and because he thought he was clever, he sat the brass bell on top of his pillow. Did he expect me to stay cooped up in my room all day? Week? I\u2019d spent six days being held against my will, and I wasn\u2019t going to become a prisoner in my own home. Getting dressed for the day, I slipped out of my room and headed, with purpose, to find Adam. Though still weak, I was stronger than before. I wasn\u2019t 100%, but I was sure after eating some more I\u2019d feel even better. Adam wouldn\u2019t be able to use my frailty against me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Anna,\u201d Wade said, looking over the top of the newspaper. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. I think the twenty hours of sleep helped.\u201d I smiled. I swiveled my head, looking around the house. The pack was still here. Some were sleeping, their bodies strewn all over the living room floor. I guess with the leaders each having a spare bedroom, the floor was the only option for them.</p><p>\u201cIs Adam around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I think he ran into town,\u201d Wade said, his eyes traveling back to the print in front of him.</p><p>I sat down at the table across from him and glared at the newspaper that hid his face. \u201cYou know, you could say congratulations,\u201d I snapped, annoyed not just with Adam\u2019s absence, but with Wade\u2019s evasiveness. I knew damn well Adam wasn\u2019t in town, and if he was, it wasn\u2019t for shopping.</p><p>Wade bent the newspaper down so he could see my face. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d he asked, arching a brow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell you guys spent all that time trying to convict me of murder, and it turns out I\u2019m innocent.\u201d I smiled smugly.</p><p>Wade\u2019s lips turned up, setting the paper down and resting his arms on the table. His dark hair looked like he\u2019d just gotten out of the shower.</p><p>\u201cDo you have proof that Eve and Anthony killed anyone?\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped to the floor, my heart stopped, and the air in my lungs thinned. They were still accusing me?</p> <p>Wade chuckled. \u201cKidding, Anna, geez. Did you lose your sense of humor while you were away?\u201d</p><p>I frowned, not in the mood to make light out of my latest near death experience. If Adam hadn\u2019t rushed in like a white knight and saved me, my body would\u2019ve been delivered on his doorstep.</p><p>Wade had the decency to look ashamed. \u201cThe fact is, you\u2019re off the hook, but now we have an entirely bigger mess to deal with\u2014one that you may be able to help with.\u201d</p><p>I sat up straighter, my eyes widening and a smile growing on my lips. Adam wouldn\u2019t be happy about it, but could he do anything if my orders came from a leader?</p><p>\u201cHave you had anymore visions?\u201d</p> <p>I pursed my lips and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI see. Would you be up for some experimenting?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI guess, but I still don\u2019t think they\u2019re visions. Maybe they\u2019re just relapses of the dreams. Being accused of murder takes a toll on a girl, maybe the stress made me bonkers.\u201d</p><p>Wade laughed, a smooth rumbling coming from his chest. \u201cPerhaps, but I\u2019d still like to test the theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there a lot of psychic werewolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said seer, not psychic.\u201d Wade took a sip from his coffee cup.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d I stood up, deciding I should eat something before Wade ran tests on me. I needed all the energy I could get. Opting for a microwavable breakfast sandwich, I opened the film and heated it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much difference, most believe they mean the same thing. But the term I used\u2014seer\u2014means a person capable of reading a person\u2019s history. They\u2019re able to see the past, not the future.\u201d</p><p>The microwave dinged, and I removed my plate. \u201cThe past?\u201d I asked with skepticism as I sat down. That didn\u2019t sound as cool as predicting the future. \u201cHow\u2019s that helpful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a lot of ways, all of which you don\u2019t need to worry about until we prove you are in fact one. Eat up. We should leave before your alpha gets back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d Wade ordered.</p><p>We snuck into Adam\u2019s house, and Wade handed me Eve\u2019s stuff, hoping I\u2019d be able to discern something useful from the items. I was starting to believe Wade was a wackadoo and all this hoodoo malarkey was just that\u2014malarkey. I kept my opinions to myself though, it was better than being locked up at the house.</p><p>I closed my eyes, per Wade\u2019s instructions, and hummed the theme song from The Twilight Zone.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you feel?\u201d</p> <p>Like you\u2019re using me for entertainment and laughing at my expense. \u201cNothing,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cAre you concentrating?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYes,\u201d I lied.</p><p>A rumbling sound came from Wade\u2019s chest. Snatching the shirt out of my hand, he said, \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He stomped out of the room, disappearing around the corner. I eyed the king size bed against the wall, a vision of Adam and Eve\u2019s naked bodies twisted in passion popped into my head. I so did not want to be in here. My eyes traveled around the room past the log walls, wood plank floors, the oak dressers, and then stopped at a corner shelf that held pictures. Walking over, I bent down and studied the photographs. Some were of Adam holding up impressive sized fish, teeth gleaming in his smile as he showed the photographer his catch. Another one was of Adam in wolf form, pitch dark except for his citrine eyes, perched atop a rocky cliff looking out onto the horizon. Even in the picture you could tell how powerful he was. His alpha status exuded from him, demanding respect. The last frame was on the bottom shelf, hidden and covered in a layer of dust. Adam, Eve, and Anthony stood with their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders in front of a building that looked like a ski lodge. Upon closer inspection, I noticed Anthony\u2019s hand was wrapped around Eve\u2019s waist, his fingers gripping her hip.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d Wade called, scaring me.</p><p>I placed the frame back on the shelf and set out to see what other ridiculous items he wanted me to \u201cread\u201d. I thought about the picture as I made my way through the house. Most families have baggage, it\u2019s just life, but I couldn\u2019t imagine being in Adam and Anthony\u2019s position, of course I didn\u2019t have siblings to rival with. But I couldn\u2019t imagine allowing my mate to sleep with my brother. Sadness filled my chest as I thought about how lonely Adam must have been, pretending to be united as the alpha couple when he was miserable behind closed doors. Eve had Anthony. I hated her, and I didn\u2019t understand him. Anthony looked like Adam. What did she find in one brother that she hadn\u2019t in the other? I guess I should\u2019ve been happy. If Eve and Adam were in love, then I\u2019d be the pathetic loser admiring him from the sidelines. I smiled because that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d I called. I\u2019d been lost in my thoughts and wandering aimlessly around Adam\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Hiking up the knobby wood staircase, I headed down the hallway, peering into rooms and stopping when I found Wade. He held a hairbrush, Eve\u2019s if the hot pink color was any indication.</p><p>\u201cHold out your hand,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>Outstretching my arm, palm side up, Wade pulled the hair from the bristles and dropped them into my hand. I frowned, but my mouth went slack when pins-and-needles prickled through my skin.</p><p>\u201cYou feel something?\u201d Wade asked expectant.</p><p>\u201cIt feels like my hand\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering something,\u201d Wade said, so quiet I wasn\u2019t sure if he was talking to himself or me. He looked up, meeting my eyes and said, \u201cAll along I assumed you could be a seer, but what if because Eve made you a werewolf, you\u2019re just attune to all things that include her?\u201d He leaned against the sink counter, wrapping one arm around his waist while the other bent at the elbow. He ticked off theories to support his idea.</p><p>\u201cYou dreamt of the murders, and we\u2019re pretty sure it was Eve who\u2019d kill the humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know exactly?\u201d I interjected. I figured I\u2019d take advantage of Wade\u2019s willingness to talk.</p><p>Wade hesitated. I leaned my head forward, brows arching in my best out-with-it-already stare.</p><p>\u201cWe found bodies at their compound. It looked like they\u2019d stuck a bunch of humans in a room and let their wolves go to town.\u201d</p><p>I shivered, closing my eyes at what that must have been like, what those people went through in their last moments alive. There was a part of my brain that couldn\u2019t fathom anyone being that monstrous, but I\u2019d seen the gleam in Eve\u2019s eye, and it spoke volumes to who she was.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s their compound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh,\u201d Wade said, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem telling you the details, but I\u2019m not going to draw you a map so you can get yourself in trouble again.\u201d</p><p>I ground my teeth together, pressing my lips into a hard line. \u201cCan I let go of this now?\u201d I nodded towards the clump of auburn hair in my palm, changing the subject. I\u2019d gotten more information out of Wade than I would have Adam. I\u2019d celebrate small victories for now.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Wade stood up straight and walked in front of me. \u201cClose your eyes and concentrate.\u201d He was silent for a moment. \u201cDo you still feel something?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, the sensation getting more and more annoying.</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. Now think about Eve. Picture her face, her voice, the way she walks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you think I\u2019m connected to Eve again?\u201d I asked, annoyed I was being forced to think of a woman I loathed.</p><p>\u201cBecause she turned you. Sires and their children share a bond, linking them together.\u201d</p><p>My skin itched thinking about being linked to a woman like Eve. The only gratitude I had was that if she hadn\u2019t attacked me, I never would have met Adam. Or, if the myths were true, I still would\u2019ve met Adam since he was my chante. The book said the earth guided the two halves towards each other. No matter, I didn\u2019t want any type of connection with her.</p><p>\u201cAre you concentrating?\u201d Wade asked like a teacher disciplining an unruly student.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I told him exasperated. At the moment I imagined introducing her pretty face to my fist\u2014over and over and over. As my imagination ran wild, inventing cool new ways to inflict pain on my ex-alpha female, the picture in my head wavered. I furrowed my brows, confused by the sudden change. I saw Eve walk down the hall and disappear into the third door on the right. Once inside, she walked over to the closet, opened it, and slid some boxes aside. Removing a piece that was cut out from the wall, she reached inside and pulled out a scroll of paper. She stood up, turned around, and smiled directly at me, a cold devious smirk that promised awful things.</p><p>My eyes snapped open, my body jumping back. I dropped the clump of hair and instantly felt at peace. It had been the most bizarre episode I\u2019d had, and I still didn\u2019t know what to make out of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you see?\u201d Wade questioned, bending down and retrieving the hair I\u2019d dropped. I repeated everything I saw, squeezing my hands into tight fists.</p><p>\u201cIt was like she saw me, like I\u2019d been caught spying on her,\u201d I explained a little flabbergasted.</p><p>\u201cYou saw the past. There\u2019s no way she could\u2019ve seen you. Someone probably came in while she was in the room and that\u2019s who she was smiling at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was still creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go check that room out,\u201d Wade said, leaving the bathroom. \u201cYou said it was the third door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>We went into the third bedroom. It looked like what I\u2019d seen, though I\u2019d never been in there before. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about being a seer. It was both creepy and fascinating. If it helped take down Eve and Anthony, I couldn\u2019t hate the gift too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wade opened the closet, bent down, and removed the boxes that rested on the floor. A clear cut was visible on the wall once the boxes were out of the way. Wade tapped the top so the bottom part would kick out. Grabbing ahold of it, he removed the piece and reached a hand inside. A smile spread onto his lips. He\u2019d found it.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p> <p>I stepped through the door and Adam\u2019s interrogation started. He eyed Wade with derision, and then his piercing eyes fell back to my face.</p><p>\u201cI feel a lot better, thanks for asking,\u201d I replied, just as snappy.</p><p>Adam\u2019s face softened the tiniest bit, but not enough to say he still didn\u2019t expect answers. \u201cI need a minute with Anna,\u201d Adam told Wade, wrapping an arm around my shoulders and leading me upstairs.</p><p>I knew where he was taking me\u2014the office. It was the only spot that wasn\u2019t inhabited with our house guests. Once the door was closed, he walked over to the desk and leaned against it, crossing his arms and trapping me with his stare. His blond hair fell carelessly over his forehead, a piece dropping over his sapphire eye. I loved how beautiful he was and that this alpha male was mine. Warmth spread through my body, my stomach tightening. My wolf perked up, purring in delight as she watched her chante. Now was not the time to let my lust overthrow my strength. I needed to stand up to Adam, show him that I could handle whatever he had planned.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going to tell me what you and Wade were doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what you and the leaders were talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s for your protection,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cThen I plead the fifth.\u201d I pretended to zip my lips.</p><p>\u201cThere have many times I wished I could silence those lips,\u201d Adam said, his eyes focusing on my mouth. That delicious warmth spread through my body and headed south.</p><p>\u201cNow isn\u2019t one of those times.\u201d Adam smiled. \u201cI need to know if Wade betrayed me and put you into more danger. What has he told you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, keeping my lips sealed. Adam pushed off the desk. Stepping around me, he brushed my hair to one side, his fingers lightly touching my skin. I closed my eyes against the feel of his hard body at my back; his hands rubbed my shoulders and a bulge pressed against my behind.</p> <p>\u201cI have my ways of extracting information, Anna.\u201d His breath tickled my neck, sending goosebumps to pebble my skin. Pressing his mouth to my throat, his tongue darted out and licked a trail all the way up to my earlobe. My legs tingled. My wolf howled. My resolve slipped.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Adam questioned again. He was a predator at my back, dominating and demanding. His fingers gripped my arms, indenting the flesh almost painfully.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d I said, my voice cracking. Clearing my throat I continued, \u201cWhy do we need to call surrounding packs for enforcement?\u201d</p><p>Adam growled, annoyed I heard that part of his conversation last night. His fingers dug deeper, but not so hard that I couldn\u2019t stand the pressure. With a quick, jarring tug, he turned me around to face him. His blue eyes were fire and ice as he stared down at me. Even when he was pissed, I wanted him. We watched each other for a few moments, the silence grew and the air thickened with our mutual obstinacy. Adam closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. I smiled, knowing I\u2019d won.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going after Anthony and Eve. They have gathered wolves of their own. The leaders think we should have backup in case things get out of control.\u201d</p><p>When I was about to respond, Adam pressed his index finger to my lips.</p><p>\u201cI have booked you and Elle a flight to California. You will not be anywhere near this place when the takedown starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shrieked. \u201cI want to fight with my pack.\u201d</p> <p>Adam\u2019s arms wrapped around my waist, and he rested his forehead against mine. \u201cThey know what you mean to me, Anna. They know you\u2019re my chante and they could bring me to my knees by killing you. I\u2019m not going to allow that.\u201d</p><p>My breathing became shallow as I thought about flying away like a coward while Adam, and the rest of the pack, went to battle. What if something happened to him? Ugly scenarios swam through my mind. I fisted my hands into his shirt, clinging onto him for fear of losing him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave,\u201d I said through trembling lips. It\u2019d be torture to be a thousand miles away while he fought for his life and there wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it.</p><p>\u201cYou will leave, Anna,\u201d Adam said in warning.</p><p>The man knew me entirely too well. The thought of pretending to leave and doubling back to help fight had already crossed my mind.</p><p>\u201cThink about what you\u2019re asking me to do,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhat if something happens and I\u2019m not here? I can\u2019t handle that so please don\u2019t make me.\u201d</p><p>Adam stood up straight, his hands roaming up and down my arms in a motion that was meant to be soothing but did nothing to dissipate my worry.</p><p>\u201cThink about what it\u2019d do to me if you, an untrained wolf when it comes to fighting, were in the middle of a battle. I\u2019d be too worried about your safety to concentrate on protecting myself or the others. I can\u2019t have that kind of distraction. We only have one shot at this.\u201d</p><p>I knew it was illogical, but my mind focused on the word distraction. It wasn\u2019t a word I wanted associated with me, even if it was true. I knew diddly squat when it came to fighting as a werewolf and I understood Adam would go out of his way to make sure I was safe\u2014to the point of neglecting his role as alpha to the rest of the pack. As I ran the argument through my mind a few times, my temper settled. I couldn\u2019t put the lives of my pack in danger because I wanted to make sure Adam was okay.</p><p>The words I was about to say went against everything within me. I didn\u2019t believe in them and I didn\u2019t want to say them, but I knew it was for the best.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to California.\u201d</p><p>I packed the last piece of clothing when Elle stepped into my bedroom carrying a red duffle bag. I wondered how she felt about being forced into leaving the state to watch the alpha\u2019s mate.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Elle asked, sweeping her hair over her shoulder. She was dressed in skinny blue jeans, a green top with ruffled cap sleeves, and a pair of black pumps that made her legs look even longer. Next to her I looked frumpy in khaki capris, blue polo shirt, and brown sandals. If Elle had taught me anything, it was that my wardrobe was in serious need of a makeover.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I need to say goodbye to Adam,\u201d I told her as I zipped the suitcase.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you in the office,\u201d Elle said, reaching for the handle of my luggage.</p><p>Nodding, I shouldered past her in search of the man who was making me leave. With each step I thought of what things would be like when I returned. My eyes traveled over my brethren, all ready to risk their lives for their alpha\u2019s cause. How many would be here when I got back? Climbing the stairs, my heart thudded in my chest the closer I got to the office door. It felt like this was goodbye for good. My parents didn\u2019t know that when they left for their trip it\u2019d be their last. The memory weighed heavy on my heart as I geared up to leave Adam behind.</p><p>I pushed the door open and closed it behind me. Adam sat in the high back leather chair behind the desk, his focus on the papers in front of him. His eyes trailed up slowly meeting mine. His stare was serious\u2014full of all the worry I felt.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Anna.\u201d</p><p>Without a word I sat in the chair, tucking my hands between my knees to hide their trembling. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was the connection I shared with Adam, or I just didn\u2019t want to leave, but every fiber within me wanted to stay beside him. The emotion would have annoyed me with any other man, but I learned when it came to Adam none of my previous relationship reservations held up.</p><p>\u201cHere are your plane tickets,\u201d Adam said, sliding a manila envelope across the desk.</p><p>I eyed the package, reaching out an unsteady hand to grab it. Adam\u2019s eyes flickered to my quivering fingers, but he didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cInside you\u2019ll also find a map, a rental car agreement, and a Discover card. You\u2019re free to spend whatever you want. Perhaps you and Elle can check out Rodeo Drive. I\u2019ve heard a lot of woman dream of shopping there.\u201d Adam smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes.</p><p>I kept a straight face, not impressed with the first class tickets or unlimited credit card. None of that mattered if Adam wouldn\u2019t be here when I returned. He was trying to make this trip easier on me, but it wasn\u2019t working. It didn\u2019t matter what fun and exciting activities California held, my mind would be too focused on Wyoming to care.</p><p>\u201cTry to have fun, Anna,\u201d Adam said softly.</p><p>I drew my head up, my attention locked on Adam\u2019s pretend happy face. He wasn\u2019t fooling me. I could tell his insides were tied in knots just like mine. \u201cWhat if I stayed here at the house? I\u2019d be safe here, and I promise I won\u2019t follow you guys to wherever you\u2019re going. Just let me stay,\u201d I begged.</p><p>Adam closed his eyes and released a heavy breath. When he looked at me again something changed. His face was hard as if it\u2019d been carved from marble. His sapphire eyes held steady as he glared at me with determination. His lips pressed into a hard line and his hands fisted atop the desk.</p><p>\u201cYou will leave, Anna. I don\u2019t want to hear another word about it. I won\u2019t put you in harm\u2019s way. You can hate me if you want, be pissed, but it\u2019ll be from a thousand miles away and until I say it\u2019s safe to return. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in my eyes, threating to spill over my cheeks. I was defeated by his resolve. When I buried my parents I was sure I\u2019d never have to do something as hard again. Leaving Adam was proving to be almost as hard. Knowing he wouldn\u2019t discuss this any further, I stood and stomped toward the door. I opened the door when Adam\u2019s large hand slammed it shut. I kept my back to him, not wanting to look at him in fear I\u2019d turn into a blubbering fool.</p><p>With gentle hands, Adam turned me around, his arms encircling my waist and guiding me into the hard plains of his chest. He hugged me wordlessly. I inhaled a lungful of his scent, needing it to comfort me, and filed it into my memory just in case I never saw him again. Against my will, my tears fell and soaked Adam\u2019s gray T-shirt. Adam embraced me tighter, his arms keeping me together. As soon as I was away from him, I\u2019d break into a million pieces. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverything will be fine, Anna. This isn\u2019t my first battle, and it won\u2019t be the last. It comes with being an alpha. I\u2019m fighting for you...for us. The days will go by quick and then we\u2019ll be together.\u201d Adam tipped my chin up, studying my face. A smile spread across his lips. \u201cNot too long ago you did everything you could to push me away. Now you\u2019re begging to remain by my side. Wearing you down will be my biggest victory.\u201d</p><p>I laughed awkwardly, wiping my eyes and nose. \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined me,\u201d I joked.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Adam said, pressing a kiss to my forehead. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta go. Your flight takes off in a couple hours, and you have a long drive ahead of you.\u201d</p> <p>Just like that my smile fell from my lips. Reaching up, I clasped my hands around his neck and kissed him more fervently than I ever had before, tasting every inch of his mouth and claiming his attention. I trailed my hands up his neck and through his hair, inventorying the feel of it between my fingers. I paid closer attention to his taste, smell, and the feel of him. If tomorrow didn\u2019t come for us, then I wanted to remember yesterday.</p><p>After a quickie with Adam, we made our way downstairs. The house was full of my pack and wolves I didn\u2019t recognize, but assumed were reinforcements. I identified the large, bald man lounging on the couch. Puck caught my eye and bobbed his head in acknowledgement, a sickening smile forming on his lips. Taking a closer look at the new wolves, a few of them were at Wild Things that night.</p><p>\u201cHow many packs are in Wyoming?\u201d I asked Adam over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThree, but most of these people are rogues. They\u2019re here as a favor to me and most don\u2019t mind getting their hands a little dirty.\u201d</p><p>I felt a little easier knowing the shady side of our kind were on our team. Even Ruth was here, her lady-of-the-night costume replaced with jeans and a fitted T-shirt. She winked when our eyes met.</p> <p>\u201cShould I even ask how you know those two?\u201d Adam asked as we walked through the living room and into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWade took me to Wild Things. Ruth is a...um, hooker,\u201d I whispered the word. \u201cAnd Puck is the bouncer, I think.\u201d</p><p>Adam laughed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask him how he knew. I had too much to deal with without worrying whether or not he\u2019d been one of Ruth\u2019s clients. The leaders were circled around the table, leaning forward as they looked over a large piece of paper. Adam leaned down and whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cWade told me what he had you do. Finding their blueprints of their territory has been very helpful.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten I never told Adam what he wanted to know. I was so worried over his news that mine slipped my notice.</p> <p>\u201cWe ready?\u201d Elle said, coming to stand by me.</p><p>I glanced up at Adam and then at the leaders as they strategized. All of it was out of my control and I hated it. I hated not knowing what would happen.</p><p>With a deep breath I said, \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>\u201cAdam\u2019s a tough cookie, he\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Elle said.</p><p>I\u2019d been staring out the window for twenty minutes, too zoned out to hear half of what she said. Elle didn\u2019t share my disappointment with missing the fight. She talked about what stores she wanted to go into.</p><p>\u201cAnna, are you even listening?\u201d</p><p>I looked over at my optimistic friend, my eyes swollen from the tears that hadn\u2019t stopped since I got in the car and watched Adam disappear in the rearview mirror.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, shopping...fun fun!\u201d My mock enthusiasm got me a nasty look from Elle.</p><p>\u201cNo, I said your phone beeped.\u201d</p><p>I opened my purse and rummaged through gum wrappers, pens, and all the other junk that shouldn\u2019t have been there to find my phone. Pressing the ON button, the LCD screen lit up and read: 1 new message.</p><p>If you want to save Chelsea, meet me at Crazy Woman Canyon.</p><p>Come alone or she becomes wolfy chow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Who\u2019s it from?\u201d Elle asked panicky.</p><p>I stared at the screen, rereading the message three times. I didn\u2019t recognize the number, but I didn\u2019t have to. It was from either Eve or Anthony.</p><p>\u201cWe have to turn around,\u201d I told Elle, dread overthrowing any logical thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What for? Who was it from?\u201d</p><p>In that moment I was angry with my friend: angry that I had to waste the time explaining and angry that she kept driving when she needed to head back to Buffalo. Taking a moment to rein in my anger, I said, \u201cThey\u2019ve got my friend Chelsea. I saw her at Wal-Mart when Wade was doing his experiment to build up my tolerance to humans. They must have had spies watching us.\u201d</p><p>Elle pulled onto the shoulder of the road instead of trying to talk me out of rescuing my friend. \u201cEve has her? What did she say?\u201d</p><p>I handed the phone to Elle and she grimaced. \u201cCall Adam. He\u2019ll send someone to get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you not read the part about \u2018coming alone\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bad guy 101. Of course they want you to come alone. The mistake people make in the movies is listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a movie, Elle!\u201d</p><p>Elle held up a finger in the universal sign to \u201chold on\u201d while she punched a number into her cell phone. Elle relayed the message to whoever was on the other end. She\u2019d just sealed the coffin for Chelsea. The only hope I had at saving her was if I got there before the cavalry. Elle looked out the window, too focused on her conversation to watch what I was doing. Curling my fingers around the door handle, I pushed it open and leaped out. Elle cursed, but I didn\u2019t stop. I took off in a sprint, calling my wolf forward. My skin prickled and my muscles stretched as she took over. One minute I was running on two legs and then I was on four. Normal wolves can run up to 45mph. Werewolves can run at least 65mph. In this form, it\u2019d take me about twenty minutes to reach Crazy Woman Canyon.</p><p>My claws dug into the asphalt as I fled as far away from Elle\u2019s car as my legs would carry me. I pushed my wolf hard, urging her faster, ignoring the car honking behind me. I knew it was Elle, and there was no way she was going to talk me out of what I had to do. Adam\u2019s orders be damned.</p><p>There were many legends about how Crazy Woman Canyon got its name. The one I heard was of an Indian woman who\u2019d been left behind after her village was pillaged. Driven to insanity, she lived out her life alone in the canyon. The setting was fitting\u2014Eve was one crazy woman.</p><p>Mountains rose up from the earth on either side of the dirt road. A roaring creek traveled through the rocky place, echoing against the large boulders that\u2019d fallen against the road. It used to be my favorite area. I\u2019d gone there countless times to hike and jog, but the day Eve attacked me ruined its beauty. It would not be Chelsea\u2019s final resting place.</p><p>I padded up the road with caution. She didn\u2019t tell me where to meet her, and she wouldn\u2019t be waiting in the middle of the street. Eve liked theatrics. I didn\u2019t see any of our wolves present, and I didn\u2019t hear any type of fighting which meant they weren\u2019t here yet. The road got steeper the longer I traveled it. Thunder rumbled in the distance, the night darker with the clouds blocking out the stars and moon. It was like the weather mimicked my mood\u2014angry and ready to let loose.</p><p>A branch snapped five feet away, followed by the sounds of whimpering. My ears perked up trying to catch any other telling sounds. My hackles raised, my lip curled over my sharp canine teeth as Eve stepped out of the tree line with Chelsea in tow. Her wavy brown hair was soaking wet, hanging against her slumped shoulders. Her almond-shaped blue eyes shot wider at seeing a large white wolf. She didn\u2019t know I was her savor and the real monster was the one holding her wrist.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come,\u201d Eve said with a sardonic smile.</p><p>I growled in response, and Chelsea\u2019s entire body shook. If I remembered right, she\u2019d been attacked by a dog when she was twelve and hated canines ever since. The poor girl was frightened beyond belief.</p><p>\u201cHow about we end this once and for all?\u201d</p><p>I stepped forward, snapping and growling in agreement. Eve was the first person I\u2019d ever wanted to kill, literally kill. I didn\u2019t worry about her being an alpha or purebred. My hatred was so strong all I saw was red.</p><p>\u201cBut first,\u201d Eve said cheerfully. \u201cHow about we have some fun?\u201d</p><p>A man I didn\u2019t recognize stepped out of the brush. He stood around five-foot-eleven and had jet black hair and golden eyes. Eve shoved Chelsea into his arms and he tied her against a tree, wrapping rope around her abdomen. Chelsea sobbed, tears flowing freely against her red cheeks as the man restrained her. Eve kept eye contact with me the entire time, her smile never faltering. Once Chelsea was secure, the man stepped off to the side and transformed into a large brown wolf. Chelsea screamed, her pleas bouncing off of the canyon walls and haunting my ears.</p><p>\u201cI told you we would have it out one way or another,\u201d Eve said. \u201cFor every blow I give you, Jeremy here will bite the human. I wonder how many it\u2019ll take before she dies.\u201d</p><p>Anna, don\u2019t do it. Adam\u2019s voice penetrated my red haze. I needed to ignore him as best as I could. I wouldn\u2019t be able to concentrate if he was speaking to me through telepathy. There was no way I was backing down.</p><p>Eve shifted and sauntered over to Chelsea. She growled, snapping just inches from her legs. Chelsea screamed as she tried to kick at Eve to no avail. I couldn\u2019t watch Eve\u2019s games anymore. Charging forward, I leaped for Eve\u2019s back, but was thrown back when Jeremy jumped into the air, his body crashing with mine and knocking the wind out of my lungs. I should\u2019ve known Eve wouldn\u2019t play fair.</p><p>Getting to my feet, I was hit again, this time by Eve. We rolled a few feet before she jumped off and skittered backwards. I lunged forward, gnashing my teeth and looking for my opening. As Eve sprang at me, I stepped to the side, burying my teeth into her shoulder. She let out a deep growl and shook her body from side to side to break the hold. Rolling on her back, she took me down with her and I released my bite.</p><p>Jumping up quicker than me, Eve stood over me ready to strike. As her canines sunk into my hind leg, I yelped, kicking out violently. Releasing her grip, Eve took a few steps backward and looked to Jeremy. Leaning his head forward, he clasped Chelsea\u2019s leg and bit down. A bloodcurdling scream echoed through the mountain. Blood seeped through Chelsea\u2019s jeans, trailing down her leg and dripping onto the ground. She cried so hard that she coughed to catch her breath. I couldn\u2019t allow this to happen again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m coming for you, Anna. Adam\u2019s voice sounded again. He\u2019d tried talking to me multiple times, but I\u2019d been so focused on Eve I couldn\u2019t remember what he\u2019d said. Panic mixed with anger rushed through my veins. Charging forward again, I caught Eve by surprise and sunk my teeth into the back of her neck. Thrashing my head back and forth, I tore a chunk of skin away from her body, spitting it out. Eve roared and she and Jeremy rushed me. One of them, I couldn\u2019t be sure which, sprang onto my back, while the other gripped my leg between their teeth, causing me to lose my balance. My body fell to the road, the weight of the wolf on my back slammed me down that much harder.</p><p>Suddenly the weight on my back was gone. Scrambling to my feet, limping from two strikes to my hind legs, Adam had taken over with Jeremy. Adam was two times the size of his opponent, but that didn\u2019t stop the na\u00efve wolf from thinking he could best an alpha. Eve\u2019s citrine eyes widened, not expecting Adam to show up. Her panic changed her demeanor. Before, she\u2019d been playing with me, having some fun. Now her murderous intent was as clear as day, and I was her sole focus.</p><p>Racing toward me, Eve was all growls, snarled teeth, and focus. She barreled into me like a freight train. Our bodies were intertwined in paws kicking forward and mouths snapping. I bit any semblance of gray fur I could reach. Eve yelped but bit me back.</p> <p>I got my teeth around her muzzle when her body was torn away from my grasp. I was in a fury of vengeance, sprinting after her. It wasn\u2019t until I was yanked back that I realized there were more than ten of our wolves in the middle of the road. Looking over my shoulder, Joe held me by the tail. I bobbed my head up and down, and he released me. Some of my fiery anger died and I searched for Adam. He had Jeremy by the scruff and with one powerful tug, Jeremy\u2019s body was slammed against the road and his throat was ripped out.</p><p>My eyes traveled to the left. Asher held Eve by the throat, waiting for Adam\u2019s command. As Adam walked over to them, he flicked his eyes toward me, staring until he had to look away. Clasping Eve\u2019s throat, Adam yanked his head to the side and Eve\u2019s body collapsed. It was amazing how quick he\u2019d ended their lives when I\u2019d had trouble just keeping up with them. I guess that\u2019s why he was an alpha.</p><p>Shifting, I rushed toward Chelsea. I examined her legs. There were three bites, two on one leg and the third on her hip.</p><p>\u201cChelsea...Che lsea wake up.\u201d I tapped my friend\u2019s face. Worrying when she didn\u2019t respond, I checked her pulse. It was steady and strong. I released a relieved breath that she passed out. Untying the rope, I lay her body down, hating that she went through this because of me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Adam said from behind me.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t turn around, ashamed he had to rescue me and abandon the wolves who\u2019d volunteered their time to fight on his behalf.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Anna.\u201d</p><p>When I didn\u2019t turn, Adam stepped in front of me, tipping my chin up. He studied me for a while, emotions running wild across his face. I expected him to yell, scream, and tell me how stupid I\u2019d been to disobey his orders. I braced myself for his wrath, fully intending to tuck my tail between my legs and accept his verbal lashing.</p><p>No harsh words came though; Adam\u2019s arms encompassed my waist as he lifted me up and kissed me until I forgot who I was and what had just happened. The surrounding wolves released celebratory howls, their excitement piercing through the night and filling my heart with pride. For the first time in my life, I didn\u2019t fear the future or the man I planned to share it with.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Four days passed after the battle. Eve and Anthony had ambushed the main house not thirty minutes after Elle and I left for the airport. They found out we had their blueprints and decided a surprise attack was their best option. Adam thought the fight at the house was a distraction so that Eve could trick me into meeting her and finally kill me. Adam and the other wolves had their hands full which is why I made it to Chelsea before they did. I\u2019m sure Eve thought that once I was dead the Everwood\u2019s alpha would be defeated, making taking over the pack easier.</p> <p>When I\u2019d complained that I had Eve and could have killed her myself, if for no other reason than to save face, Joe happily reminded me I had to walk before I could run with the big dogs, or wolves rather. I may not have liked it, but I agreed with him. As much as I would\u2019ve loved to be the one to kill Eve, the important thing was she was now dead and wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt anyone else.</p><p>The main house suffered some damage from the battle. A couple fights had broken out inside and ruined some furniture, walls, and electronics. Adam had one of his construction crews working on it non-stop. The leaders all apologized, even Nicholas, about almost shipping me off to Idaho and convicting me of murder. It\u2019d take me awhile to put my trust in that group again, leaders or not. All but Wade left a couple days ago.</p><p>Anthony fled and though Adam didn\u2019t seem worried about him coming back, I wasn\u2019t so sure. He did love Eve after all and his brother had killed her.</p><p>As for me and my dislike for humans, Wade had taken me to town to test a theory of his. I\u2019m happy to say that I didn\u2019t growl or bite one person that day. The humans didn\u2019t even bother me anymore. When I asked Wade why, he\u2019d replied, \u201cIt was Eve\u2019s hatred bleeding through your link the entire time.\u201d Since Eve had turned me we were bonded. Somehow I felt her emotions and thought of them as my own. Yet another reason to celebrate her death.</p><p>Chelsea received some nasty bites, but she survived and now shared the same affinity for the moon as the rest of us. I suspected she was the reason Wade hung back. He\u2019d been pretty affected by her at their first meeting. I still felt horrible that I was the reason for her turning hairy every full moon, but she took it a lot better than I expected. In time she\u2019d come to love being part of our pack just as much as I had. </p> </body></html>"]
