The elegant establishment with its crystal chandeliers and red velvet upholstery catered to the more civilized members of the demon-world. Jagr was anything but civilized.</p><p>He was a six-foot-three vampire who had once been a Visigoth chief. But it wasn\u2019t his braided, pale gold hair that fell nearly to his waist, or the ice-blue eyes that missed nothing and sent creatures with any claim to intelligence scurrying from his path. It wasn\u2019t even the leather duster that flared about his hard body.</p><p>No, it was the cold perfection of his stark features, and the hint of feral fury that smoldered about him.</p> <p>Three hundred years of relentless torture had stripped away any hint of civility.</p><p>Ignoring the assorted demons who tumbled over chairs and tables in an effort to avoid his long strides, Jagr concentrated on the two Ravens guarding the door to the back office. The hushed air of sophistication was giving him a rash.</p><p>He was a vampire who preferred the solitude of his lair hidden beneath the streets of Chicago, surrounded by his vast library, secure in the knowledge that not a human, beast, or demon possessed the ability to enter.</p><p>Not that he was the total recluse that his vampire brothers assumed.</p><p>No matter how powerful or skilled or intelligent he might be, he understood that his survival depended on understanding the ever changing technology of the modern world. And beyond that was the necessity of being able to blend in with current society.</p> <p>Even a recluse had to feed.</p><p>Tucked in the very back of his lair was a plasma TV with every channel known to humankind, and the sort of nondescript clothing that allowed him to cruise through the seedier neighborhoods without causing a riot.</p><p>The most lethal hunters knew how to camouflage themselves while on the prowl.</p><p>But this place...</p><p>He\u2019d rather be staked than mince and prance around like a jackass.</p><p>Damn Styx. The ancient vampire had known that only a royal command could force him to enter a crowded nightclub. Jagr made no secret of his disdain for the companionship of others.</p> <p>Which begged the question of why the Anasso would choose such a setting to meet.</p><p>In a mood foul enough to fill the vast club with an icy chill, Jagr ignored the two Ravens who stood on sentry duty near the back office, and lifting his hand, allowed his power to blow the heavy oak door off its hinges.</p><p>The looming Ravens growled in warning, dropping their heavy capes, which hid the numerous swords, daggers, and guns attached to various parts of their bodies.</p><p>Jagr\u2019s step never faltered. Styx wouldn\u2019t let his pet vampires hurt an invited guest. At least not until he had what he needed from Jagr.</p><p>And even if Styx didn\u2019t call off the guards...well, hell, he\u2019d been waiting centuries to be taken out in battle. It was a warrior\u2019s destiny.</p><p>There was a low murmur from inside the room, and the two Ravens grudgingly allowed him to pass with nothing more painful than a heated glare.</p><p>Stepping over the shattered door, Jagr paused to cast a wary glance about the pale blue and ivory room. As expected, Styx, a towering Aztec who was the current king of vampires, was consuming more than his fair share of space behind a heavy walnut desk, his bronzed features unreadable. Viper, clan chief of Chicago, who, with his silver hair and dark eyes looked more like an angel than lethal warrior, stood by his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d Styx leaned back in the leather chair, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. \u201cThank you for coming so promptly.\u201d</p> <p>Jagr narrowed his frigid gaze. \u201cDid I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, Jagr,\u201d Viper warned. \u201cThis is your Anasso.\u201d</p><p>Jagr curled his lips, but he was wise enough to keep his angry words to himself. Even presuming he could match Styx\u2019s renowned power, he would be dead before ever leaving the club if he challenged the Anasso.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI have a task for you.\u201d</p><p>Jagr clenched his teeth. For the past century he\u2019d managed to keep away from the clan who called him brother, never bothering others and expecting the same in return. Since he\u2019d been foolish enough to allow Cezar to enter his lair, it seemed he couldn\u2019t get rid of the damn vampires.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of task?\u201d he demanded, his tone making it clear he didn\u2019t appreciate playing the role of toady.</p><p>Styx smiled as he waved a slender hand toward a nearby sofa. It was a smile that sent a chill of alarm down Jagr\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, my friend,\u201d the Anasso drawled. \u201cThis might take a while.\u201d</p><p>For an insane moment, Jagr considered refusing the order. Before being turned into a vampire, he had been a leader of thousands. While he had no memory of those days, he had retained all his arrogance. Not to mention his issue with authority.</p><p>Thankfully, he had also kept the larger portion of his intelligence.</p><p>\u201cVery well, Anasso, I have rushed to obey your royal command.\u201d He lowered his hard bulk onto a delicate brocade sofa, inwardly swearing to kill the designer if it broke. \u201cWhat do you demand of your dutiful subject?\u201d</p><p>Viper growled deep in his throat, the air tingling with his power. Jagr never blinked, although his muscles coiled in preparation.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should see to your guests, Viper,\u201d Styx smoothly commanded. \u201cJagr\u2019s...dramatic entrance has disrupted your charming entertainment, and attracted more attention than I desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not be far.\u201d Viper flashed Jagr a warning glare before disappearing through the busted door.</p><p>\u201cIs he auditioning for a place among your Ravens?\u201d Jagr mocked.</p><p>Pinpricks of pain bit into his skin as Styx released a small thread of his power.</p><p>\u201cSo long as you remain in Chicago, Viper is your clan chief. Do not make the mistake of forgetting his position.\u201d</p><p>Jagr shrugged. He wasn\u2019t indifferent to the debt and loyalty owed to Viper. The truth was he was in a pissy mood, and being stuck in the chichi nightclub where there wasn\u2019t a damned thing to kill beyond a bunch of dew fairies wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly forget when I am forever being commanded to involve myself in affairs that do not concern me, and more importantly, do not interest me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does interest you, Jagr?\u201d He held Styx\u2019s searching gaze with a flat stare. At last the king grimaced. \u201cLike it or not, you offered your sword when Viper accepted you into his clan.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it, but he couldn\u2019t argue. Being taken into a clan was the only means of survival among the vampires.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have of me?\u201d</p><p>Styx rose to his feet to round the desk, perching on a corner. The wood groaned beneath the considerable weight, but didn\u2019t crack. Jagr could only assume Viper had had all the furniture reinforced.</p><p>Smart vampire.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of my mate?\u201d Styx abruptly demanded.</p><p>Jagr stilled. \u201cIs this a trap?\u201d</p><p>A wry smile touched the Anasso\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not a subtle vampire, Jagr. Unlike the previous Anasso, I have no talent for manipulating and deceiving others. If there comes a day when I feel the need to challenge you, it will be done face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you asking me about your mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first met Darcy, she knew nothing of her heritage. She had been fostered by humans from the time she was a babe, and it wasn\u2019t until Salvatore Giuliani, the current king of the Weres, arrived in Chicago that we discovered she was a pureblood who had been genetically altered.\u201d</p><p>Jagr flicked a brow upward. That was a little tidbit that the king had kept secret.</p><p>\u201cGenetically altered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Weres are increasingly desperate to produce healthy offspring. The pureblood females have lost their ability to control their shifts during the full moon, which makes it all but impossible to carry a litter to full term. The Weres altered Darcy and her sisters so they would be incapable of shifting.\u201d</p><p>Jagr folded his arms over his chest. He didn\u2019t give a damn about the worthless dogs.</p><p>\u201cI presume you will tell me why you have summoned me, before the sun rises?\u201d</p><p>Styx narrowed his golden eyes. \u201cThat depends entirely on your cooperation, my brother. I can make this meeting last as long as I desire.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s lips twitched. The one thing he respected was power. \u201cPlease continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy\u2019s mother gave birth to a litter of four daughters, all genetically altered, and all stolen from the Weres shortly after their births.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were they stolen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat remains a mystery Salvatore has never fully explained.\u201d There was an edge in the Anasso\u2019s voice that warned he wasn\u2019t pleased by the lack of information. \u201cWhat we do know is that one of Darcy\u2019s sisters was discovered in St. Louis, being held captive by an imp named Culligan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fortunate that she\u2019s incapable of shifting. A pureblood could rip out the throat of an imp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what Salvatore could discover, the imp managed to get his hands on Regan when she was just a child, and kept her locked in a cage coated with silver. That is when he wasn\u2019t torturing her for a quick buck.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Torture.</p><p>The Dutch masterpieces hanging on the walls crashed to the floor at Jagr\u2019s flare of fury.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish the Were rescued?\u201d</p> <p>Styx grimaced. \u201cSalvatore already freed her from Culligan, although the damned imp managed to slip away before Salvatore could eat him for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s brief flare of hope that the night wasn\u2019t a total waste was brought to a sharp end. Slaughtering bastards who tormented the weak was one of his few pleasures.</p><p>\u201cIf the woman was rescued, why do you need me?\u201d</p><p>Styx straightened, his bulk consuming a considerable amount of the office space.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore\u2019s only interest in Regan was installing her as his queen and primary breeder. He is determined to secure his power base by providing a mate who is capable of restoring the purebloods\u2019 dwindling population. Unfortunately, once he freed Regan, he discovered she was infertile.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo she was of no use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d The towering Aztec was careful to keep his composure, but even an idiot could sense he wouldn\u2019t mind making a snack of the Were king. \u201cThat is why he contacted Darcy. He intended to send Regan to Chicago so she could be under my protection until he established her in the St. Louis Were pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she managed to escape while he was conferring with the local pack master.\u201d</p><p>Jagr grunted in disgust. \u201cThis Salvatore is pathetically inefficient. First he allows the imp to escape, and then the woman. It\u2019s little wonder the Weres are declining in number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us hope you are more efficient.\u201d</p> <p>Jagr rose to his feet, his expression cold. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy is concerned for her sister. I want her found and brought to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman has made it fairly obvious she doesn\u2019t want to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it will be your job to convince her.\u201d</p><p>Jagr narrowed his gaze. He wasn\u2019t a damned Mary Poppins. Hell, he would eat Mary Poppins for breakfast.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already sent several of my best trackers to St. Louis, but you\u2019re my finest warrior. If Regan has managed to run into trouble, you will be needed to help rescue her.\u201d</p><p>There were no doubt worse things than chasing after a genetically altered Were who clearly didn\u2019t want to be found, but he couldn\u2019t think of one off the top of his head.</p> <p>In the outer room, the sounds of a string quartet resumed, along with soft \u201cohhs\u201d and \u201cahhs\u201d from the audience as the dew fairies continued their delicate dance. Jagr could suddenly think of one thing worse than chasing after the Were.</p><p>Remaining trapped in this hellhole.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I do this?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cBecause what makes Darcy happy makes me happy.\u201d Styx moved until they were nose to nose, his power digging into Jagr\u2019s flesh. \u201cClear enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPainfully clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Styx stepped back and released his power. Slipping his hand beneath his leather coat, he pulled out a cell phone and tossed it to Jagr. \u201cHere. The phone has the numbers of the brothers who are searching for Regan, as well as contacts in St. Louis. It also has my private line. Contact me when you find Regan.\u201d</p><p>Jagr pocketed the phone and headed for the door. There was no point in arguing. Styx was struggling to force the vampires out of their barbaric past, but it wasn\u2019t a freaking democracy.</p><p>Not even close.</p><p>\u201cI will leave within the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d</p><p>Halting at the door, Jagr turned with a searing fury. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Styx didn\u2019t so much as flinch. \u201cDo not forget for one moment that Regan is precious cargo. If I discover you have left so much as a bruise on her pretty skin, you won\u2019t be pleased with the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m to track down a rabid Were who doesn\u2019t want to be found, and haul her to Chicago without leaving a mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously the rumors of your extraordinary intelligence were not exaggerated, my brother.\u201d</p><p>With a hiss, Jagr turned and stormed through the shattered opening. \u201cI\u2019m not your brother.\u201d</p><p>Viper monitored Jagr\u2019s furious exit with a wary gaze.</p><p>Actually it hadn\u2019t gone as bad as he had feared. No death or mutilation. Not even a maiming.</p><p>Always a plus.</p><p>Still, he knew Jagr too well. Of all his clansmen, he had always known that the ancient Visigoth was the most feral. Understandable after what he\u2019d endured, but no less dangerous. He was beginning to regret having brought the tortured vampire to Styx\u2019s attention.</p><p>Slipping past the seated demons who were once again enthralled with the dew fairies, Viper returned to the office, finding Styx staring out the window.</p><p>\u201cI have a bad feeling about this,\u201d he muttered, his gaze taking in his priceless paintings, lying shattered on the floor.</p><p>Styx turned, his arms folded over his chest. \u201cA premonition? Shall I contact the Commission and inform them they have a potential Oracle?\u201d</p><p>Viper arched a warning brow. \u201cOnly if you want me to lock you in a cell with Levet for the next century.\u201d</p><p>Styx gave a sharp bark of laughter. \u201cA nice bluff, but Levet has decided that he is the only one capable of tracking Darcy\u2019s missing sister. He left for St. Louis as soon as Salvatore informed me that Regan had slipped from his grasp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, now we have two loose cannons charging about Missouri. I\u2019m not sure the natives will survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe Jagr is a loose cannon?\u201d</p><p>Viper grimaced, recalling the night that Jagr had appeared at his lair requesting asylum. He had encountered any number of lethal demons, most of whom wanted nothing more than to kill him. He\u2019d never, however, until that night, looked into the eyes of another and seen only death.</p><p>\u201cI think beneath all that grim control, he\u2019s a step from slipping into madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you allowed him to become a clansman.\u201d</p><p>Viper shrugged. \u201cWhen he petitioned, my first inclination was to refuse. I could sense he was not only dangerously close to the edge, but that he was powerful and aggressive enough to challenge me as clan chief. He\u2019s a leader by nature, not a follower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why allow him into Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he swore an oath to disappear into his lair and not offer any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Styx prodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd I knew he wouldn\u2019t survive if he were without the protection of a clan,\u201d Viper grudgingly admitted. \u201cWe both know that despite your attempts to civilize the vampires, some habits are too deeply ingrained to be easily changed. A rogue vampire with that much power would be seen as a threat to any chief. He would be destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you took mercy.\u201d</p><p>Viper frowned. He didn\u2019t like being thought of as anything but a ruthless bastard. He hadn\u2019t become clan chief because of any sensitivity bullshit. He was leader because the other vampires were scared he\u2019d rip out their undead hearts.</p><p>\u201cNot mercy\u2014it was a calculated decision,\u201d he growled. \u201cI knew if the need ever arose, he would prove an invaluable ally. Of course, I assumed that I would need him as a warrior, not as a babysitter for a young, vulnerable Were. I\u2019m not entirely comfortable sending him on such a mission.\u201d</p><p>Styx grasped the medallion that always hung about his neck, revealing he was not nearly as confident in his decision as he would have Viper believe.</p><p>\u201cI need Regan found, and Jagr has the intelligence and skills that are best suited to track her and keep her safe. And he possesses an even more important quality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be his sparkling personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s his intimate knowledge of the anguish Regan has suffered.\u201d Styx regarded him with a somber expression. \u201cHe, better than any of us, will understand what Regan needs now that she has been freed from her tormentor.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>The campground a few miles south of Hannibal, Missouri, was like any other campground.</p><p>Oversized RVs parked on the barren ground, a row of portable potties in the back, and a small shack near the front entrance where the humans paid for the privilege of being crammed next to people they wanted to throttle by the end of their vacation.</p><p>Regan Garrett knew all about the throttling thing firsthand.</p><p>Granted, she wasn\u2019t human, but she had spent the majority of her life in one campground or another. They were breeding grounds for homicide.</p><p>Indifferent to the threat of impending mass murder, Regan swiftly jogged through the neat columns of RVs. She had deliberately waited until it was late enough that the old folks would have their dentures in a glass and their wrinkled asses in bed, while the younger parents would be comatose after a day of unrelieved suffering at the hands of their children.</p><p>Midnight in Hannibal, and not a creature was stirring.</p><p>Reluctantly, she turned to jog back toward the shack that had its door closed against the late March air. The chill didn\u2019t trouble Regan, despite the fact she was wearing nothing more than a pair of jeans and a sleeveless knit top. She might not possess the ability to shift or procreate, but she did have most of the werewolf\u2019s talents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was faster and stronger than humans, temperatures didn\u2019t trouble her, she could see perfectly in the dark, and she had a remarkable ability to heal any wound not inflicted with silver.</p><p>Her feet briefly faltered. It was that ability to heal that had...</p><p>No. Not now.</p> <p>She had to focus. She would grieve the past once Culligan was dead.</p><p>For the past ten hours she\u2019d been on the imp\u2019s trail, following his scent from St. Louis to the edge of Hannibal. She could almost taste her revenge when his trail mysteriously vanished on the outskirts of town. She didn\u2019t know how the son of a bitch had managed to disappear into thin air, but it wasn\u2019t going to stop her.</p><p>One way or another, she was finding the man who had held her captive for the past thirty years, and paying him back a hundredfold.</p><p>Not bothering to knock, Regan shoved open the door to the shack and stepped in. It was a cramped space, the walls covered with glossy pamphlets proclaiming all the wondrous sights to see in Hannibal, and one narrow window that overlooked the park.</p><p>At first glance the place looked empty, but Regan didn\u2019t miss the cigarette smoke that hung in the air. Moving to the Formica counter at the far end of the room, she banged on the small silver bell.</p> <p>There was the muffled sound of cursing, then a door behind the counter was shoved open, and a shaggy head poked out.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d The boy, who couldn\u2019t have been more than eighteen, with a nose too big for his narrow face, stiffened as his pale eyes skimmed over Darcy\u2019s long, golden blond hair and down her slender body. Slowly they lifted to study the green eyes that dominated her pale heart-shaped face. A goofy smile curved his lips as he stepped into the room and leaned against the counter. \u201cHelloooo. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just found him, doll. Give me ten minutes to lock up, and I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>As if.</p><p>Regan resisted the urge to smash the overlarge nose, barely. Instead, she pulled out the folded page she had ripped from a magazine before leaving St. Louis.</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen an RV that looks like this?\u201d</p><p>The kid barely glanced at the picture. \u201cDo I look like that freak from Monk? I take the money, I give them a card to put on their dash, and that\u2019s the end of it. I don\u2019t give a shit what their RV looks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have noticed this one. The driver has long red hair and eyes like a cat. He\u2019s very...distinctive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one here who doesn\u2019t have gray hair and dentures.\u201d The boy shuddered. \u201cI have nightmares that one day I\u2019ll look out there and nothing will be left but corpses and rotting RVs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming.\u201d</p><p>The goofy smile widened. \u201cYou could take my mind off the nasty geriatrics and their imminent death. I have a cot in the back.\u201d</p><p>Regan once again eyed the protruding beak. Targets didn\u2019t come more tempting. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t afford to attract attention. Humans always made such a fuss over bit of blood and a few broken bones.</p><p>\u201cNot even if you came giftwrapped,\u201d she muttered, turning to leave.</p> <p>\u201cHey...\u201d</p><p>Whatever he had to say was cut off as Regan slammed the door and jogged toward the nearby road leading into Hannibal.</p><p>This was the last RV park in the area. Her only hope now was that she could pick up Culligan\u2019s trail somewhere in town.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have just vanished.</p><p>Not only was Culligan a greedy sadist, but he was also a pathetic imp. Unlike many of his kind, he didn\u2019t have the skill to create portals to travel. Hell, he could barely form a hex.</p><p>Which meant he was either in his RV, or on foot.</p><p>Five hours later, she\u2019d jogged through every street in town, finding nothing more than the usual drunken humans and a handful of sprites dancing in the gathering fog.</p><p>Damn. She was hungry, weary to the bone, and in no condition to battle Culligan, even if she did run across him. As much as it ticked her off, it was time to call it a night.</p><p>Angling back toward the main highway that snaked through town, Regan ignored the scent of food that wafted from the few fast-food restaurants that remained open. She had stolen money from Salvatore before leaving St. Louis, but it would only last so long. For now she preferred the protection of four walls and a locked door while she slept to easing the empty ache in her belly.</p><p>She returned to the hotel that she\u2019d booked earlier (one of a dozen that had Mark Twain emblazoned in the name), in the hopes she would need a place to stash a beaten and bloody imp. That hope was shot to hell for the moment, but at least she could look forward to a hot shower and clean bed.</p><p>Keeping her head lowered, she limped across the nondescript lobby, nodding toward the nondescript front desk clerk, and climbing the nondescript stairs. No matter how tired she might be, she wasn\u2019t willing to enter the elevator. She\u2019d been trapped the majority of her life in a tiny silver cell. Not an act of God, or a promised date with the Jonas Brothers could haul her back into one.</p><p>She reached the fifth floor, absently rubbing her arms as a chill crawled over her. Strange. She never felt the cold. Obviously, she was even more tired than she thought.</p><p>Halting at her door, she slid her card into the lock and pressed it open. It wasn\u2019t until steely arms wrapped about her that she realized the danger.</p><p>Shit. The cold prickling over her skin wasn\u2019t from the temperature, it was from a damned vampire. And she had waltzed into his arms as if she didn\u2019t have any more sense than a freaking human.</p><p>Momentarily frozen with shock, Regan was abruptly catapulted into action as the vampire kicked shut the door and attempted to drag her further into the dark room.</p><p>Calling upon her waning strength, Regan pretended to slump in her attacker\u2019s arms, pulling them far enough downward so that when she abruptly slammed her head backward, she managed to hit him flush in the face.</p><p>There was a muffled curse, but the arms holding her hostage didn\u2019t loosen. In fact, they tightened with a brutal force, hiking her closer as the heavy body slammed her to the carpeted floor, landing on top of her and knocking the air from her lungs.</p><p>She was well and truly trapped, but that didn\u2019t stop her from struggling. Okay, it was more like a fish futilely flopping on the bank of a river. Still, it made her feel like she was doing something. Just like she used to taunt and mock Culligan, despite the fact that he was bound to beat the hell out of her for it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she gritted. \u201cTell me now or I swear I\u2019ll stake you.\u201d</p><p>A dark, utterly male chuckle whispered over her face. \u201cAnd they claim I have no social skills.\u201d There was a pause, and Regan sensed the vampire\u2019s mind reach out to brush against hers. \u201cHold still.\u201d</p><p>She tried to free a leg so she could knee him in the nuts. \u201cThat shit doesn\u2019t work on me, vampire.\u201d</p><p>He growled low in his throat. \u201cRegan, stop this. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Regan stilled in shock. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d</p><p>There was a prickle of power, and suddenly the lamp beside the bed flared with light.</p><p>\u201cI was sent by Darcy to bring you to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Regan barely heard the low, slightly raspy words. Holy...crap.</p><p>She was a woman who\u2019d spent her life surrounded by demons, many who could make GQ models weep with envy, but none could compare to the vampire currently lodged on top of her.</p><p>A delicious, heart-stopping, edible hunk of eye candy.</p><p>His body was hard and chiseled with more muscles than any man had a right to possess. His long hair, two shades a paler gold than hers, was pulled into a tight braid, emphasizing the ice-blue eyes. His features appeared to be carved from the finest marble, the lines and angles so perfect they could only have been formed by the hand of a master. His nose was aquiline, his cheekbones angular beneath the smooth ivory skin, his brow wide, and his lips...they were hard, but precisely chiseled. The sort of lips that made a woman wonder what they would feel like exploring hot, intimate places.</p><p>A shocking heat clenched her lower muscles, infuriating Regan. Christ, the demon was here at the bidding of her interfering sister, not to offer relief to a lonely, sex-starved Were.</p><p>Not that she would spread her legs, even if this was just a random encounter, she sternly told herself. Okay, he was hot enough to make her bones melt, and the scent of raw male power was making her head dizzy, but...</p><p>Stop it, you idiot. This wasn\u2019t a man. He was a lethal vampire who could drain her dry in a heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cDarcy sent you?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>The frozen blue eyes narrowed, his nose flaring as if catching scent of her stupid awareness. Which was ridiculous. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who died and made her queen?\u201d she mocked.</p><p>\u201cThe Anasso.\u201d</p><p>Regan blinked in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His gaze briefly swept over her pale face before lifting to clash with her uneasy glare.</p><p>\u201cYou asked who died to make Darcy queen,\u201d he retorted. \u201cHer mate Styx killed the previous King of Vampires, which made him the current leader, and your sister queen.\u201d</p><p>Well, of course she was a freaking queen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d never met Darcy, or any of her three sisters for that matter, but she\u2019d learned from Salvatore that Darcy was currently mated to a vampire who not only adored her, but had just purchased a flipping mansion on the outskirts of Chicago for her. No doubt she was also drenched in diamonds, and attended the opera on a regular basis.</p><p>Not that Regan wanted all that froufrou crap. She\u2019d rather be stabbed in the eye than put on a dress. Still, her sister\u2019s cushy lifestyle was a thorn in Regan\u2019s side.</p><p>Her family had abandoned her to the hands of a psychotic imp who had relentlessly abused her for thirty years. As far as she was concerned, the entire bunch of them could go screw themselves.</p> <p>\u201cAwesome, my sister is married to a genocidal maniac,\u201d she drawled. \u201cAnd people wonder why I\u2019m not leaping at the chance to get to know my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyx is no more genocidal than any other vampire. Or Were, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>She snorted at the flat, emotionless tone. \u201cAre you trying to reassure me? If so, you suck at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy only duty is to escort you to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Freaking perfect. This gorgeous hunk of man was nothing more than a flunky for her sister.</p><p>She pressed her hands against the unyielding wall of his chest. \u201cWell, consider yourself officially off duty, because I have no intention of going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister is concerned. She only desires to protect you.\u201d</p><p>His low, hypnotizing voice tingled down her spine even as his words pissed her off.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and where was all that sisterly concern when I was being held captive by a monster?\u201d</p> <p>His stark, beautiful face was without mercy. \u201cYou\u2019re free now, aren\u2019t you? Be grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be grateful, and I sure as hell don\u2019t want to have my supposed sister pretending she gives a damn after all these years. Tell her to take her concern and shove it up her...\u201d</p><p>His head swooped down, his lips claiming her mouth in a kiss that was raw and demanding, and shocking as hell.</p><p>Regan had braced herself for the familiar blow. Even a savage bite to her neck. She wasn\u2019t prepared for the sensation of cool, skillful lips parting her mouth, or the oddly erotic press of fangs.</p><p>The treacherous heat returned with a vengeance, flowing through her trembling body and tightening her muscles with the promise of beckoning pleasure.</p><p>He tasted of brandy and temptation, his hard body pressed against her most intimate places. She wanted to rip off the black T-shirt that looked spray-painted to his muscled bulk, and rub against the wide chest.</p><p>She wanted...</p><p>God, she just wanted.</p> <p>With a groan, she allowed his tongue to slip between her lips, sucking it gently as her hips instinctively arched upward. Never in her life had she ever felt the touch of a man\u2019s hand. Not unless it was to dole out punishment. Now her body was changing, altering as his kiss deepened.</p><p>Her lips softened, her nipples hardened to tight points, nearly begging to be stroked, her fingers spread across the chiseled muscles of his chest.</p><p>Then, as swiftly as he\u2019d kissed her, the vampire pulled back to regard her with a strange expression of wariness. As if he was as caught off guard by her volatile reaction as she was.</p><p>Embarrassed, Regan smacked her hands against his chest. Damn the bastard. She\u2019d just made a fool of herself, and it was entirely his fault.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>His features smoothed into an unreadable expression. \u201cDarcy is my queen. You\u2019re not allowed to insult her without consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou consider rape a consequence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a kiss, nothing more, and the only means to stop your childish whining without leaving a bruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bastard.\u201d Smack, smack, smack. \u201cI have every right to whine after what I\u2019ve suffered. You have no idea...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid enough to believe that you\u2019re the only one who has ever suffered,\u201d he said, overriding her words, his voice edged with ice. \u201cIt\u2019s done. Move on.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw clenched. Damn the cold bastard. It was bad enough he had gotten her all hot and bothered while he remained Mr. Freeze, but now he was dismissing her years of torture as if she were nothing but a sulky child.</p><p>\u201cI would love to move on, but it\u2019s a little difficult with freaking Hulk Hogan squashing me. Get off.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do you know of vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re evil, soulless bastards who care about nothing but yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re also stronger, faster, and far more lethal than Weres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to release you, but know that if you annoy me, I won\u2019t hesitate to tie you to the bed and shove a gag in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t doubt the threat. Not even for a minute. Of course, in her life, being tied and gagged didn\u2019t rate high on the fright-o-meter.</p><p>\u201cCharming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that someday I\u2019m going to shove a stake up your ass.\u201d</p><p>A golden brow flicked upward. \u201cThat would not kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019ll be funny as hell.\u201d</p><p>Something that could have almost been a smile touched his mouth before swiftly disappearing.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as amusing as seeing you try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackass.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her for a long, silent moment, almost as if he was searching past her defensive aggression to the terrified woman beneath.</p><p>It was unnerving as hell.</p><p>\u201cWill you behave yourself?\u201d he at last demanded.</p><p>She blew out a sigh, knowing she would never get the aggravating man off her until she agreed. And she really needed him off.</p><p>Her mind might be contemplating the best means of kicking some vampire ass, but her body was still enjoying the sensations of his hard parts pressing against her soft parts.</p><p>\u201cFine, just get off,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>With one smooth, fluid motion, the vampire was on his feet, looming over her. She had a brief moment to appreciate the faded jeans that molded to his powerful legs, and the motorcycle boots that covered his Shaq-sized feet, before he reached down to grasp her hand and jerk her upright.</p><p>With a gasp at the electric charge that jolted up her arm, Regan wrenched her hand from his grasp and backed away. She didn\u2019t give a damn if it made her look weak. She needed space.</p><p>And maybe a wooden stake.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest, appearing even more dangerously beautiful now that he was upright.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t difficult.\u201d His low, mesmerizing voice filled the room. \u201cOnce I reached St. Louis, I simply followed the trail of the imp, knowing you wouldn\u2019t be far behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would you know that?\u201d</p><p>The ice-blue gaze regarded her steadily. \u201cAs I said, you aren\u2019t the only one familiar with suffering. And I know when a demon, no matter how tiny, is released from captivity, the only thought on their mind is revenge. You want the imp dead.\u201d</p><p>Her chin tilted. What the hell would this vampire know of suffering? He lived smack-dab on top of the food chain.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so smart, then you know I have no intention of allowing Culligan to escape. You can go back to Chicago and tell my sister thanks, but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing that would please me more than to return to my lair and leave you to your business. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s an option. Just turn around and walk out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was commanded to bring you to Chicago, and that means I\u2019m not allowed to leave here without you. Not unless I\u2019m willing to face the wrath of my king. Which\u2014\u201d His gaze seared a path down her tightly clenched body, lingering a terrifying moment on the pulse fluttering at the base of her throat, before returning to her wide eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Great. Her Knight in Shining Armor had not only showed up thirty years too late, but he was only there under threat of some horrible retribution.</p><p>It was enough to make a woman feel all warm and fuzzy.</p><p>Not.</p><p>\u201cThen we have a serious problem, Hulk freaking Hogan, because I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?</p><p>\u201cMy name is Jagr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d she muttered. The name was just as hard, dangerous, and beautiful as the rest of him.</p><p>\u201cI could force you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body.\u201d</p><p>That hit-and-run smile touched his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.\u201d</p><p>Regan stomped her foot, at the end of her patience. \u201cDammit, would you just go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She marched across the tiny room that had been decorated in the seventies, all hideous swirling blues and greens, with cheap furniture and fading prints of flowers on the walls. Reaching the door to the connecting bathroom, she wrenched it open.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to stab the intruder with a frustrated glare. \u201cYou\u2019ve managed to turn a perfectly rotten day into a masterpiece of misery, so either you truss me up and haul me to Chicago, or I\u2019m taking a hot shower.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jagr stood perfectly still as Regan stepped into the bathroom and slammed the door.</p><p>For the first time in centuries, he found himself...conflicted.</p><p>The grim logic\u2014that was the only means of keeping his lethal fury in check\u2014warned him to toss the Were over his shoulder and return her to Chicago. It was not only what he\u2019d been commanded to do, but the sooner he was done with this stupid mission, the sooner he could return to his peaceful existence.</p> <p>But another part, a part he hadn\u2019t experienced in years and was not at all pleased to discover he still possessed, was reluctant to take such an irrevocable step.</p><p>It was nothing more than common sense, he was swift to excuse his odd hesitation. What was the point of hauling her to Chicago when she was bound to flee at the first opportunity?</p><p>The gods knew he wasn\u2019t lucky enough for Styx to pick someone else to hunt her down.</p><p>Perfectly reasonable. Unfortunately, Jagr was too intelligent to entirely dismiss his chaotic reaction to the beautiful woman.</p><p>He was a vampire who preferred his life, his battles, and his sex uncomplicated.</p> <p>Regan was anything but uncomplicated.</p><p>She was a tangled mess of fury, aggression, vulnerability, wry humor, and frustrated sensuality.</p><p>A sensuality that wakened a hunger that now roared through him with brutal force.</p><p>He wanted her. And he sure as hell wasn\u2019t turning her over to Styx until he\u2019d had a taste.</p><p>Or two.</p><p>Counting to a hundred, Jagr was prepared when Regan cracked open the door and peered back into the room. He hadn\u2019t believed for a moment she intended to strip naked and take a shower while a lethal predator stood just a few feet away. She was furious, not stupid.</p> <p>Yanking open the door, she glared at him with impotent anger.</p><p>\u201cChrist, are you still here?\u201d</p><p>He regarded her in silence. He\u2019d discovered over the centuries that it rarely took more to rattle an opponent. For a crazed moment she tried to match him stare for stare, then with a muttered curse, she marched forward to stand directly before him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is it going to take to get rid of you? Money? Blood? Sex?\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted down to her small, perfectly rounded breasts. \u201cWhich are you offering?\u201d</p><p>She took a hasty step back. \u201cNone of the above.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pity.\u201d He lifted his gaze. \u201cThen it would seem that I am staying. Tell me of the imp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said, tell-me-of-the-imp.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at his slow, deliberate words.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou obviously won\u2019t leave until he\u2019s dead, so I intend to put an end to this farce so I can return to the peace of my lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cNo one kills Culligan except me.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cYou expect him to stroll into your hotel room so you can beat him to death with a pillow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to rip out his throat with my bare hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned. \u201cI lost the scent of the damned bastard at the edge of Hannibal.\u201d There was a beat, then without warning, she stepped forward to grasp his arm. \u201cWait. You said you tracked Culligan to find me. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s expression never altered, but his entire body tensed as a scalding heat rushed through him at her urgent touch.</p><p>Regan wasn\u2019t the first woman he\u2019d desired. Far from it. But never had his need been so ruthless, so raw, so primitive.</p><p>\u201cSo now you want my help?\u201d he demanded, his voice as cool and controlled as ever. It was the ability to keep his emotions hidden that had allowed him to survive centuries of torture.</p><p>\u201cIf it leads me to Culligan.\u201d Her fingers tightened, revealing she possessed all the strength of a pureblood. \u201cDo you know where he is hiding, or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you, I lost his trail at the edge of town. That\u2019s where I picked up your scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d She dropped her hand and stepped back. Jagr swallowed his low growl of disappointment. \u201cHow could his trail just disappear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost imps can create portals to move through long distances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Culligan.\u201d Her lips twisted with a grim satisfaction. \u201cHe\u2019s a weak, pathetic bully who can barely cast a hex.\u201d</p><p>Jagr shrugged. \u201cThen he could be dead, although it\u2019s far more likely he had assistance in covering his presence.\u201d</p><p>He watched the frustration ripple over Regan\u2019s delicate features. They weren\u2019t an exact replica of Darcy\u2019s. Her eyes were a darker emerald, her brows more gold than blond, and her expression was hardened by years of abuse. But overall, she shared Darcy\u2019s fragile, heartrending beauty.</p><p>The sort of fragility that made even a scarred recluse want to toss her over his shoulder and take her somewhere he could keep her safe.</p><p>Unaware of his shocking thoughts, Regan furrowed her brow. \u201cHow would he cover his presence? A witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA witch would have the power. But, of course, so would any number of demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d The green eyes flashed with irritation. \u201cYou\u2019re a butt-load of help. So glad you showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was because the imp\u2019s trail ended that I asked you to tell me of him. I need to know more before I can decide how best to lure him from the shadows.\u201d He lifted his brows as she regarded him with a stubborn expression. \u201cRegan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your help.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his gaze, knowing he had to take a stand. This woman was so blinded by her need for revenge, she couldn\u2019t think clearly. If she wasn\u2019t to end up back in Culligan\u2019s power, or dead, he would have to find some means to keep her distracted while he considered the best means of flushing the imp into the open.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be trapped playing nanny to a pint-sized Were with even less charm than myself.\u201d His voice was sheer ice. \u201cUnfortunately we\u2019re stuck with one another until I hand you over to Darcy, and you can devote yourself to making her life a misery.\u201d</p><p>She quivered with rage. \u201cPint-sized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that\u2019s the current term used to describe a smaller than usual object.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you son of a...\u201d</p><p>The crack of gunshots interrupted the angry tirade, the sound so unexpected that the bullets smashed though the window before Jagr was able to launch forward and force Regan to the floor. His teeth clenched in pain, his thoughts dark with fury.</p><p>He had protected the more delicate Were, but three of the bullets had lodged in his back, the fourth slicing through his arm to create a nasty gash.</p><p>Not life-threatening injuries, but they left him too weak to battle whoever was attacking them.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>If he survived this, Styx was going to kill him.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Shocked by the sudden attack, not to mention the six-foot-plus vampire that had just landed on top of her, Regan struggled to clear the fog from her mind.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>She knew enough to realize someone had shot through the window. And that Jagr had quite likely saved her from a nasty injury.</p><p>What she didn\u2019t know was why.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been Culligan. The few times the imp had tried to use a gun, he hadn\u2019t been able to hit the broadside of a barn. Besides, if he\u2019d come gunning for her, he would have brought a rocket launcher. The son of a bitch knew he had one chance, and one chance only, to kill her before she ripped out his throat.</p><p>Jagr\u2019s groan jolted her out of her inane thoughts, and Regan wriggled from beneath his heavy body. He was too weak to protest, lying face-down on the carpet to reveal the brutal injuries that were even now oozing with a frightening amount of blood.</p><p>A flare of terror raced through her.</p><p>Jagr might be an annoying ass, but he\u2019d just taken a number of bullets for her. She didn\u2019t want the guilt of his wounds on her conscience.</p><p>Besides, whoever was shooting at them was probably still out there. Or else headed up to the room to finish them off.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t just run off and leave the damned vamp to be murdered while he was injured. Which meant she needed him healed, and healed fast.</p><p>Struggling to recall what little she knew of vampires, she tensed at the sound of approaching footsteps, her heart stopping as the door to the room was suddenly thrown open.</p><p>Prepared for battle, Regan was caught off guard by the strange creature who waddled into the room. The thing possessed the grotesque features of a gargoyle\u2014thick gray skin, reptilian eyes, horns, and cloven hooves. He even had a long tail that trailed behind him. But while Regan had never actually seen a gargoyle, she\u2019d always presumed they were more than three feet tall, and that their wings were leather, not delicate bits of gossamer that were far too pretty for a ruthless savage.</p><p>Still, you didn\u2019t have to be a nine-foot fire-breathing demon to pull a trigger. The miniature creature might very well be the one taking potshots at them.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d she rasped, instinctively crawling to place herself between the intruder and the wounded Jagr.</p><p>Ignoring her command, the...thing moved forward to peer down at the vampire, and then, of all things, spoke with a lilting French accent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happened, mon ami?\u201d</p><p>Jagr groaned. \u201cDamn Styx. If I live through this, I\u2019m going to make him pay.\u201d</p><p>Somewhat reassured that the two seemed to know one another, Regan frowned at the stranger.</p> <p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA masterpiece of misery,\u201d Jagr muttered, echoing her earlier words.</p><p>Shockingly, the creature blew a raspberry toward the vampire who could squash him without a thought.</p><p>\u201cI am the demon who is about to save you and your Gothic friend\u2019s ass,\u201d he announced grandly. \u201cJust lay there and bleed, Jagr, while I work my mojo.\u201d</p><p>Regan watched Jagr\u2019s eyes snap open with genuine horror, his hand reaching out to weakly grab at the creature. The tiny beast was too quick, and with a flick of his tail, he was hurrying to scramble onto the window ledge, his tiny arms outstretched.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jagr moaned, and then without warning, his arm snaked around her waist and she found herself yanked down beside him. \u201cStay down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Regan glared at the vampire. \u201cDammit, Jagr, you\u2019re hurt...\u201d Her lecture was once again interrupted as a brilliant flash of light filled the room, swiftly followed by a deafening boom. \u201cChrist,\u201d she breathed, wondering if the Air Force had arrived and decided Hannibal needed bombing. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>She heard the patter of footsteps, and the gray creature returned to stand beside them.</p><p>\u201cThat was salvation, ma petite,\u201d he assured her, leaning over Jagr. \u201cHow bad is it, vampire?\u201d</p><p>Jagr reached up to grab the beast\u2019s arm. \u201cDid you kill them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re most certainly toasty, if not dead. They will not be troubling us for a while.\u201d</p> <p>A hint of relief touched Jagr\u2019s tight features. \u201cDid you see them?\u201d</p><p>The creature gave a flap of his wings. \u201cNo, but I smelled them. Yuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCur.\u201d</p><p>Jagr frowned. \u201cCur, not Were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas your brain dribbled away with your blood, mon ami? I am a gargoyle with exquisite skills. I know the difference between a Were and a cur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would a cur be shooting at us?\u201d Jagr muttered.</p><p>\u201cThe better question is: who wouldn\u2019t want to shoot you?\u201d</p> <p>Regan barely noted the sharp exchange, regarding the stranger with a disbelieving frown.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really a...gargoyle?\u201d</p><p>The gargoyle performed a small bow, his wings fluttering to create a dazzling rainbow of red and blue and gold.</p><p>\u201cLevet, at your service, my beauty. I was sent by your sister to escort you to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Regan struggled to a sitting position. \u201cJesus, was there anyone in Chicago she didn\u2019t send?\u201d</p><p>Levet shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s concerned for you.\u201d</p><p>Before Regan could respond, Jagr hissed with impatience. \u201cWe can discuss Darcy and her evil sense of humor later. For now we must concentrate on leaving this hotel before the humans call the police.\u201d</p><p>Levet snorted. \u201cWhile I would be perfectly content to sign off on your death warrant, Jagr, there\u2019s the teeniest tiniest chance I might need you to help keep Regan safe. You can\u2019t be moved in your condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood...\u201d Jagr rasped.</p><p>Levet held up his hands and stepped hastily back. \u201cSorry, fresh out.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s eyes fluttered shut, as if he were on the verge of losing consciousness.</p><p>\u201cThe hospital...blood bank...\u201d he murmured weakly.</p><p>Regan gritted her teeth. Damn. Jagr was right about the humans calling for the cops. And the last thing they needed right now was another battle with guns blazing.</p><p>\u201cScrew that, we don\u2019t have time.\u201d Blowing out an aggravated sigh, Regan pressed her wrist to Jagr\u2019s mouth. As much as she hated to admit it, she owed the damned vampire. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>His lids lifted to reveal those stunning ice-blue eyes. \u201cRegan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it before I decide to leave your ass here for the cops to haul off to the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d With a flutter of his wings, the gargoyle hurried toward the door leading to the hallway. \u201cI\u2019ll go keep watch and make sure your dinner isn\u2019t interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan, you are certain?\u201d Jagr demanded, his voice thicker, with an odd accent and strange speech pattern.</p><p>Certain? Christ, no. She didn\u2019t have clue what was about to happen. Well, nothing beyond a great deal of pain when those huge fangs sank into her flesh.</p><p>Thankfully, she was no coward, and if Jagr needed blood to get him up and moving, then by God, he was going to get blood.</p><p>\u201cDo you need an engraved invitation?\u201d she taunted, not at all surprised when his mouth widened and his fangs slid smoothly into her wrist. Jagr was not a vampire to back down from a direct challenge. Regrettably, her plan had neglected one small detail.</p><p>She was braced for pain. She was even braced for the necessity of ripping him forcibly from her flesh if he lost his head and tried to take more than she was willing to offer.</p><p>What she wasn\u2019t prepared for was the realization that far from painful, the sensation that jolted through her was one of intense, relentless pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d Her eyes drifted shut as she felt him suck deeply of her blood, every pull tightening the coiling bliss that was lodged in the pit of her stomach. \u201cShit...\u201d</p><p>Her entire body trembled, the same excitement that had set her on fire when he\u2019d kissed her blazing through her body. Only this time it was more powerful, more driving, more...explosive. Her free hand landed flat on the floor as her body bent forward, nearly toppling her onto Jagr\u2019s prostrate form. She was drowning, lost in the dark, intoxicating desire.</p><p>In a distant corner of her mind, she heard Jagr\u2019s low moan of satisfaction, or perhaps it was pleasure. At the moment, she didn\u2019t care which it was. She was too caught in the sweet building tension that gripped her with breathtaking force.</p><p>He sucked again and again, forcing the pleasure to near pain. God almighty. She couldn\u2019t stand any more. There had to be something...something...</p><p>And then it happened. The pleasure reached a critical mass, and exploded with enough force to wrench a low scream from her throat.</p><p>Toppling forward, her face landed squarely on Jagr\u2019s hard chest, the rich scent of his male power mingling with the lingering convulsions that rocked her body.</p><p>Boneless and floating on a tide of sweet lethargy, Regan battled to regain command of her shaken body. Holy crap. She sucked in a deep, rasping breath. Then with an effort, she lifted her head and wrenched open her heavy lids.</p><p>Only to encounter Jagr\u2019s ice-blue gaze.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she husked, her heartbeat still thundering in her ear.</p><p>With a deliberate motion, the vampire gently licked the two pinpricks of blood staining her wrist before allowing her to jerk her arm from his grasp.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had the bite of a vampire?\u201d</p><p>Still too weak to stand, Regan contented herself with scooting backward on her knees, rubbing her already healed wrist on her jeans, as if she could rub away the memories of her raw pleasure.</p><p>Fat chance.</p><p>She knew beyond all doubt that the sensations would be seared into her brain for all eternity.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered. \u201cCulligan refused to share torturing me with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>He remained stretched on the floor, his fiercely beautiful features unreadable.</p><p>\u201cDo you want an apology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least. Your blood is far more potent than that of a human, and better yet\u201d\u2014his gaze swept down her tense body\u2014\u201cI now know the sweet cries you make when...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up before I make sure you need another transfusion.\u201d</p><p>The distant sounds of sirens shattered through the thick tension in the air. In the blink of an eye, Jagr was on his feet, reaching down to jerk her upward in one smooth motion.</p><p>\u201cThe police. We must get out of here.\u201d Stunned by the vampire\u2019s remarkable recovery, Regan found herself being hauled toward the broken window. \u201cCan you jump from here?\u201d Jagr demanded.</p><p>She flashed him a glare at his ridiculous question, then careful to avoid the jagged shards of glass still stuck in the frame, she climbed through the window and leaped to the sidewalk below.</p><p>Slinking into the nearby shadows of the alley, Regan tested the air for any nearby dangers.</p><p>There was the usual stench of trash that filled the nearby Dumpsters, the scent of humans stirring to prepare for their early morning shifts, and the unmistakable tang of burnt flesh and blood.</p><p>A part of her knew she should cross the street and discover if any of the curs had survived the attack. She needed to know why they attacked. And if they had any connection to Culligan.</p><p>Another part, however, realized that she was too weakened by her hours of searching for the imp, not to mention her recent blood donation, to face her enemies alone. Especially not when they carried guns.</p><p>Even a cur could shoot her dead if his bullets were silver.</p><p>Cursing her current sense of impotence, Regan gave a small jerk when Jagr simply appeared beside her. One minute he wasn\u2019t there, and then he was. No sound, no stir of the air, not even a trace of his scent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was unnerving.</p><p>And maddening.</p><p>And...a whole host of other things that made her temper snap and snarl.</p> <p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d she hissed.</p><p>He tossed a heavy leather bag over his shoulder, indifferent to her foul mood.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for her agreement, Jagr grasped her arm and steered her back to the street and headed east. The wolf in Regan growled in protest at being manhandled, but she ignored her instinct to bite.</p><p>Not only was she smart enough to know she would need the aggravating vampire to fight off any attackers until she regained her strength, but there was a dark (frighteningly seductive) fear that he would bite back.</p> <p>They had barely managed to reach the end of the block when there was the sound of flapping wings, and the tiny gargoyle landed directly in front of them. Regan halted, surprised to realize she was pleased to see the strange little beast. He was...endearing in his own way.</p><p>\u201cHey, did you think to trench me?\u201d he demanded, his wings obviously ruffled.</p><p>\u201cTrench me?\u201d Regan demanded in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI believe he means \u2018ditch me,\u2019\u201d Jagr translated, stabbing Levet with a cold stare. \u201cYou deceive yourself, gargoyle, if you think that you can play with me as you do with Styx or Viper. I don\u2019t fear any punishment the Anasso could inflict if I decided to put an end to you.\u201d</p><p>Far from wilting beneath the frigid warning, Levet puffed out his chest, managing to appear almost dignified as he met Jagr\u2019s terrifying gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou need my help, whether you like it or not, vampire. Perhaps you will recall I was the one who frightened off those attacking curs.\u201d He cleared his throat as Jagr regarded him with that unnerving silence. \u201cI can lead you to a cave. I can protect Regan. I have magic...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Jagr\u2019s clipped voice brought the litany of talents to an abrupt end. \u201cI\u2019m going to regret this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegret what?\u201d Regan demanded warily.</p><p>Jagr never allowed his gaze to stray from Levet. \u201cWait here with Regan. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>The gargoyle saluted. \u201cYes, sir, Mr. Terminator, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevet,\u201d Jagr breathed.</p><p>\u201cOui?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaunt me again and I\u2019ll rip off those wings and shove them down your throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have hostility issues, you know that, vampire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust keep her safe.\u201d And with that, Jagr turned and melted into the shadows.</p><p>Regan leaned against the brick front of a local antique shop, too weary to be angered at Jagr\u2019s mysterious disappearance, or even at being passed off like a used car. Once she had the opportunity to gather her strength, she would rid herself of her intrusive guardians. Until then...</p><p>Well, she\u2019d endured worse.</p><p>Worse in an epic way.</p><p>Her heavy lids drifted downward as she relaxed against the wall, trusting her keen sense of smell to warn of any approaching danger. Five minutes passed, and then another five. At last Levet, who clearly possessed the attention span of a gnat, could stand the silence no longer.</p><p>\u201cSooo...you\u2019re Darcy\u2019s sister,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe resemblance is remarkable.\u201d</p><p>Regan lifted her heavy lids, ignoring the biting anger that flared through her heart at the mention of her sister. Family issues? Nah. Not her.</p><p>\u201cI thought gargoyles were bigger?\u201d she said, more to change the subject than to be insulting.</p><p>Levet\u2019s tail twitched. \u201cI might be vertically challenged, but I assure you that I\u2019m a highly respected warrior among the vampires. Indeed, I\u2019m something of a Knight in Shining Armor. I can\u2019t count the number of damsels I\u2019ve rescued from imminent death and dismemberment, which, of course, is why I was sent to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>A reluctant smile touched her lips. He looked more like a lawn ornament than a Knight in Shining Armor.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you help the vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a way to pass the time until I land my dream position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDream position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve given up on the whole Vanna thing since Darcy pointed out that I\u2019m not quite tall enough to reach the letters of the puzzle, so I\u2019ve decided to take over Deal Or No Deal. Now that would be a sweet gig.\u201d</p><p>Regan choked back a laugh. Culligan had been a television junkie, rarely turning off the thing when he was in the RV. Not that Regan complained. It at least offered her a glimpse of the world beyond her silver cage.</p><p>\u201cDoes Howie Mandel know he\u2019s about to become unemployed?\u201d she demanded, shaking off the savage memories.</p><p>\u201cI thought I would keep it on the down-low for now. No need for him to go all Britney Spears before I\u2019ve actually been offered the job.\u201d</p><p>This time Regan couldn\u2019t stop her chuckle. \u201cVery thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me, a heart of gold. It\u2019s both a blessing...\u201d Dramatic pause. \u201cAnd a curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can imagine.\u201d</p><p>A silence descended, broken only by the song of crickets and distant frogs. It was a comfortable silence. So comfortable that Regan was astonished to discover she didn\u2019t mind the gargoyle\u2019s company. In fact...</p><p>No. She swiftly squashed the treacherous thoughts. She didn\u2019t want or need a companion. Not Levet, who could make her laugh, and certainly not Jagr, who could piss her off one moment, and the next, wreak sensual havoc with a single bite.</p><p>Against her will, Regan found her gaze searching through the darkness, her senses seeking some sign of the MIA vampire. She told herself she didn\u2019t give a damn if Jagr had run off and gotten himself killed. One less vampire in the world couldn\u2019t be a bad thing. Her only concern was...was...finding a place to sleep before the humans began filling the streets.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>\u201cYou can trust him, you know.\u201d</p><p>Levet\u2019s lilting voice interrupted her dark broodings. She turned to find him regarding her with knowing gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d His tiny face twisted in a grimace. \u201cI might not like the coldhearted bastard, but he\u2019s a lethal warrior and he has made a pledge to return you safely to Chicago. He will give his own life before he will let you be hurt.\u201d</p><p>Her fur (metaphorically speaking) was instantly ruffled. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for anyone\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>Levet snorted. \u201cAs if that ever stopped the pushy bastards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Darcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacrebleu, no.\u201d The gargoyle was shocked by the mere suggestion. \u201cI was speaking of the vampires. Darcy possesses the most gentle, most beautiful soul I have ever encountered. There\u2019s no one who doesn\u2019t love her.\u201d</p><p>Regan ignored the pang of envy that struck her heart.</p><p>\u201cGentle soul? How the hell did we come from the same womb?\u201d</p><p>Levet shrugged. \u201cLife has given you a hardened shell, but your soul is just as pure. Which is no doubt what has Mr. Cold as Ice so on edge. And of course, the fact that you\u2019re hot as hell does not hurt.\u201d</p><p>Regan choked at the ridiculous claims. \u201cYou are...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery peculiar.\u201d</p><p>The demon flapped his wings. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a fine thing to say to the demon who helped save your life.\u201d</p><p>Regan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m peculiar myself. It\u2019s not all bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well you\u2019d never call Brad Pitt or McDreamy peculiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom Cruise.\u201d</p><p>Levet considered, then nodded. \u201cValid point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you going to lead us to some caves, gargoyle?\u201d an icy male voice demanded, the only warning that Jagr had silently appeared from the shadows.</p><p>The gargoyle squeaked, clapping a hand to his chest. \u201cHoly mother of God, you nearly gave me a heart attack, and not in a good way.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThe caves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought Styx was a grump.\u201d With a flick of his tail, Levet turned and waddled down the street in an obvious snit. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>Regan hurried to follow Levet. The last thing she wanted was to be alone with the grim-faced vampire.</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t exactly true.</p><p>The last thing she wanted was for him to sense the rapid pounding of her heart and the flare of awareness that stained her stupid cheeks with a blush.</p><p>What was wrong with her?</p><p>Okay, she\u2019d reacted to his bite. And (as much as it griped her to admit it) to his kiss.</p><p>Jagr was a vampire. Everyone knew they used sex to lure their prey. And that even the most powerful of demons were susceptible. The only shocker would have been if she didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>So why was she acting like a freaking preteen with a crush on her teacher?</p><p>Pathetic.</p><p>Sensing Jagr move to walk by her side, Regan gave herself a mental shake and squared her shoulders. Time to start acting like a mature pureblood.</p><p>Whatever the hell that meant.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>His cool glance slashed in her direction. \u201cI disposed of the bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLevet was right,\u201d he continued smoothly. \u201cThey were curs. Three of them. Two were caught in Levet\u2019s blast and one managed to escape.\u201d</p><p>Her steps faltered. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we following his trail? Culligan might have sent him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI followed the trail. It disappeared four blocks north of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like Culligan\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d The frosty blue gaze swept over her face. \u201cDid the imp have a lot of contact with the curs during your imprisonment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn occasion.\u201d Regan grimaced. \u201cNo more than any other of the lowlife demons we encountered during our travels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCulligan never remained in one place more than a few nights. We crisscrossed the country a hundred times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Hannibal? Did you stay here often?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Regan shook her head. She\u2019d heard of Hannibal, of course. Built on the edge of the mighty Mississippi River, it was the home of Samuel Clemons (Mark Twain), and the setting for many of his most famous novels. There was also some cave or another that had been the hiding spot for Jesse James (the History Channel was a wonderful thing). A charming town, but hardly a hot spot for demons. \u201cHe never even mentioned this place.\u201d</p><p>Jagr considered her words as they crossed through an empty parking lot built close to the river. In the darkness, Regan could hear the waters that swirled and eddied around the tethered steamboat tied to the nearby dock.</p><p>\u201cThen we can\u2019t be certain that Culligan was behind the attack,\u201d he at last concluded.</p><p>Great. New, mysterious enemies. Just what she needed.</p><p>\u201cWhy would the curs want to kill me?\u201d she growled, as annoyed by Jagr\u2019s cool reaction to her obvious danger as being shot at in the first place. Wasn\u2019t he freaking sent to keep her safe? \u201cI thought they worshipped pureblooded Weres?\u201d</p><p>A golden brow arched at her churlish tone. \u201cIf there\u2019s a local Were pack, they might think you\u2019re a rogue. Weres are as territorial as vampires.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what about the trail disappearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a connection, but for all we know the curs slaughtered Culligan and covered his death with the same magic that hides their scent. We don\u2019t know enough to jump to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Only a fool would ignore the possibility that there were other dangers beyond Culligan.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s icy expression softened at her weary concession. Never breaking stride, he thrust a paper bag into her hand and led her from the parking lot to the tangle of undergrowth that lined the river.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Regan frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood.\u201d His gaze drifted down to her wrist. \u201cYou\u2019ll need it to replenish the blood I took.\u201d</p> <p>White-hot heat flared through her, squeezing the air from her lungs. She could almost feel his fangs sinking into her flesh, and the sensuous tugs as he took her blood.</p><p>Ducking her head down, she ripped open the bag to discover two still warm bagels and a container of orange juice.</p><p>Her stomach rumbled in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she muttered, keeping her face hidden behind the thick curtain of her hair as she rapidly worked her way through the bagels.</p><p>Jagr retreated to his familiar silence, wise enough not to offer help when they reached a narrow path that led to the high bluff overlooking the river. Her nerves were already on edge. It wouldn\u2019t take much to have her striking out, regardless of the consequence.</p><p>They climbed without speaking, and reaching the top of the bluff, Regan paused to throw away the empty bag, covertly leaning against the plastic trash can. The path had been a steep one, perilously sapping her waning energy.</p><p>In less than a heartbeat Jagr was at her side, his arm wrapping about her waist to haul her against the erotic power of his body.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask for help?\u201d he demanded, his dark voice sliding down her spine, sending ripples of pleasure through her.</p><p>Oh...hell.</p><p>She wanted to lean into all that male hardness. To close her eyes and drown in his ruthless strength.</p><p>The need was as intense and unwelcome as the awareness that hummed through her body with tiny, electric jolts.</p><p>Placing her palms against his chest, she shoved. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He frowned down at her, refusing to loosen his grip. \u201cYou might be dizzy...\u201d</p><p>She shoved again. \u201cI said I\u2019m fine. Just stop talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d His hard lips twitched. \u201cMy feeding, or your reaction?\u201d</p><p>Lifting her foot, she kicked him as hard as she could in the knee.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have hurt. Even at her full power, it would be difficult to injure such an ancient demon. Still, it was enough to catch him off guard. Using the nanosecond of distraction, Regan ducked beneath his arms and rushed toward the gargoyle, who was disappearing into the thick tangle of brush and trees that ran along the bluff.</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, one day...\u201d she muttered beneath her breath.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what she was going to do.</p><p>But it was going to be evil.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>The cave that tunneled through the bluff was not large. The main chamber was the size of a human living room, and low enough that Jagr was in constant danger of banging his head. On the plus side, the entrance was narrow enough to prevent more than one attacker from entering at a time, and there was a smaller chamber in the back that had a shallow stream of water that emptied into a basin.</p><p>It was not the fact that it was easily defensible, or that there was a ready supply of fresh water, however, that made the cave seemed like a paradise, Jagr decided.</p><p>It was the armful of warm Were he had tucked close to his body as he lay on the hard floor.</p><p>Leaning on his elbow, Jagr studied Regan\u2019s finely carved features. In sleep they appeared even more unbearably fragile. Her skin was a flawless ivory stretched over the perfectly formed brow and tiny nose. Her lips were lush, when not tightened with anger, and her lashes a thick curtain as they lay against her cheeks.</p><p>So lovely.</p><p>So breathtaking.</p><p>And so terrifying in her ability to fascinate him.</p><p>Jagr shook his head. He\u2019d lived for centuries. Beautiful women had drifted in and out of his life with predictable regularity. But none had possessed the golden innocence of her soul. An innocence that the tortured darkness in him craved. As if her purity could soothe away the festering shadows.</p><p>And of course, there was the fierce, relentless courage that had allowed her to survive her years of torture.</p><p>Culligan had wounded her, but he had never broken her.</p><p>He was one of the few who could truly appreciate what it had cost her.</p><p>She was completely and utterly unique. A creature like no other he had ever encountered.</p><p>A strange hint of warning whispered to his heart. An instinctive awareness that his behavior since arriving in Hannibal was...uncharacteristic. The grim control and cool logic that had ruled him for centuries was being undermined by the tiny, ferocious Were currently snuggled against him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure whether he should be furious or terrified.</p><p>Certainly he shouldn\u2019t have been...smug. As if he\u2019d found a treasure that he hadn\u2019t expected and didn\u2019t even know he desired.</p><p>Perhaps sensing his inner conflict, Regan stirred against his chest. Jagr tightened his grip.</p><p>They had barely arrived at the cave when Regan had collapsed in exhaustion. For all her power and stubborn determination, she\u2019d pushed herself too hard for too long and her body had simply shut down.</p><p>Without hesitation, Jagr had carried her to the back of the cave, placing her against the wall and lying down so he was between her unconscious form and the distant entrance. Nothing would be allowed to get to her without coming through him first.</p><p>At the time he\u2019d told himself it was for her protection. He had made a pledge to keep her safe, and by the gods, that\u2019s what he would do.</p><p>But no matter how he tried to twist logic, he knew it wasn\u2019t a mere need to protect that led him to tenderly cradle her in his arms, or to awaken well before sunset just so he could study her pale, perfect face.</p><p>With a flutter, she lifted her thick tangle of lashes, revealing the emerald eyes that were still clouded by sleep.</p><p>There was a moment as she struggled to recall why she was lying in a strange cave in the arms of a vampire, a renegade hint of sensual awareness darkening her gaze before reality crashed through her fog, and she was angrily shoving her hands against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell...let me go.\u201d</p><p>Jagr was caught off guard by the force of her blow, nearly losing his grip before he could roll on top of her and use his considerable weight to control her attempts to escape.</p><p>Her strength had returned with a vengeance.</p><p>Along with her temper.</p><p>A pity, since he could think of far better means of passing the next few minutes than fighting with the beautiful Were.</p><p>Ignoring the stirring of his body, Jagr met Regan\u2019s furious glare with a stoic determination.</p><p>\u201cNot until the sun has completely set. I won\u2019t allow you to leave the cave until I can accompany you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cYou let me sleep the entire day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mind is too strong. I can\u2019t control your sleep patterns. You were obviously in need of the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d She wriggled beneath him. Jagr swallowed a groan at the delicious friction. \u201cLet me go. Culligan could be miles away by now.\u201d</p><p>It took his endless years of self-discipline and restraint to ignore the firm, deliciously female body beneath him. For now his biting need was secondary to keeping Regan safe.</p> <p>Something he couldn\u2019t ensure if she bolted from the cave and into the lingering sunset.</p><p>\u201cThen a few minutes won\u2019t matter,\u201d he pointed out with the cool tones that seemed to set Regan\u2019s teeth on edge. So long as she was contemplating the best means to stick a stake in his heart, she wasn\u2019t plotting the means to escape him.</p><p>Predictably her face flushed with fury. \u201cI\u2019ll never forgive my sister for inflicting you on me. I bet she sent you to get you out of her...\u201d</p><p>Before he could leash the impulse, his head was dipping down to capture her mouth in a silencing kiss. How else could he halt the angry tirade without physical harm? A noble goal that was swiftly undermined by the intoxicating heat that flared through his body.</p><p>This kiss had nothing to do with silencing Regan, and everything to do with the ravenous hunger that flared through him with a painful force.</p> <p>He wanted this woman.</p><p>He wanted to stroke his lips over every inch of her pure, ivory skin. He wanted to kiss and lick and nibble over every delectable curve. He wanted to be buried deep inside her as he sank his fangs into her neck and drank of her potent blood.</p><p>More than anything, he wanted to hear those low, husky cries as she reached her climax.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his chest as he deepened the kiss, her lips softening. The scent of arousal bloomed on her skin, lengthening his fangs and making his heavy erection twitch in anticipation.</p><p>This was...right.</p><p>She fit perfectly beneath him, her feminine body soft and yet strong enough to handle an ancient vampire\u2019s passion. Her scent was exactly blended to stir his deepest hungers. And her blood. Hell, his body still trembled with the power from his feeding.</p> <p>Shifting his hands, Jagr tangled his fingers in the satin smoothness of her hair, drowning in sensations that were familiar, and yet completely unknown in their intensity.</p><p>After an eternity of hell, this was...paradise. There was no other word.</p><p>He teased at her lips, lightly nipping and stroking before exploring the stubborn line of her jaw. Her nails dug through the thin T-shirt, causing sharp darts of delicious pain, but his senses were too keen to miss the tiny moan of distress that was wrenched from her throat.</p><p>Regan\u2019s body might respond with intoxicating urgency to his touch, but her mind didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>At this point, he doubted she was capable of trusting anyone.</p><p>Jagr lifted his head to regard her with a cool composure that disguised the frustration howling through his body.</p><p>\u201cI did warn you not to insult my queen,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her face was flushed with a combination of embarrassment and anger at having responded so readily to his touch.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t insulting my sister, I was insulting you.\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile touched his lips. \u201cMy mistake.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him for a long moment, infuriated at her inability to toss aside his large body and flee as she desired. Then, with obvious effort, she wrapped herself in a brittle dignity.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the gargoyle?\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s smile faded at the mention of the tiny demon. He hadn\u2019t been pleased when he\u2019d returned from disposing of the curs\u2019 bodies to discover Regan and Levet chatting as if they were old friends. He wasn\u2019t certain why he was angered by the sight of the two of them together. Not even a reclusive vampire who spent more time with books than other demons would believe that Regan could be sexually attracted to the ugly little beast.</p><p>It was only now that he could acknowledge the truth. He\u2019d been jealous that the stupid gargoyle had made Regan smile.</p><p>\u201cStill in statue form,\u201d he muttered. \u201cLuckily for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did find us these caves,\u201d she countered, managing to keep her expression aloof, as if she were lying on the hard cave floor by choice, rather than being pinned by his heavy body.</p><p>Jagr felt a stirring deep inside him. He\u2019d never encountered a woman with such extraordinary courage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a vampire. There isn\u2019t a cave I can\u2019t sense.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThen why did you allow him to come with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my clansmen have several mates who are pecu-lairly attached to the pest.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, caught off guard by his blunt confession.</p><p>\u201cSurely big bad Jagr is not afraid of a few women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wise enough to fear a goddess, a Shalott demon, an Oracle, and even a pureblooded Were when she is enraged,\u201d he said dryly, his gaze lowering to the lush temptation of her mouth. \u201cBesides, there are few creatures more dangerous in the world than a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound as if you have personal experience. Did some vamp babe break your heart?\u201d she mocked.</p><p>With one fluid motion Jagr was on his feet, his features cold and unreadable. Regan couldn\u2019t know his past, or the female vampire who had tortured him for centuries, but her taunt released the flood of nightmares that never truly left him in peace.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly dark. Do you need to feed?\u201d</p><p>Regan scrambled to her feet, warily backing away as his icy power swirled through the cave.</p><p>\u201cWhat I need is a shower and clean clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. Give me a moment.\u201d</p><p>Jagr headed toward the back of the cave, cursing as he caught the scent of Regan\u2019s unease. Dammit, Styx had been a fool to send him after the Were. He was a volatile warrior who was feared by his own brothers, not a nanny. What the hell did he know about wounded, overly proud, vengeance-obsessed women? Jack shit, that\u2019s what.</p><p>So why wasn\u2019t he hauling Regan back to Chicago and washing his hands of the ridiculous situation?</p><p>Bending downward, he unzipped the leather satchel he had brought with him from Chicago.</p><p>He heard Regan impatiently shuffle her feet behind him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Jagr pulled out two finely crafted silver daggers and tucked them into his boots. There were few things that could best an ancient vampire, but he hadn\u2019t lived so long by being stupid. If there were curs around, there were most certainly Weres. He would need the silver if they were attacked by an entire pack.</p><p>Straightening, he headed for the narrow entrance. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Regan ground her teeth as the vampire disappeared through the entrance of the cave. Did he think she would scurry behind him like a well trained dog?</p><p>Heel, Regan. Sit, Regan. Roll over, Regan.</p><p>Arrogant bloodsucker.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it enough that he\u2019d pinned her to the floor and kissed her until she\u2019d melted into an embarrassing puddle of willing flesh? And then topped it off by going into his Mr. Freeze act, one that would terrify any rational creature?</p><p>She hadn\u2019t asked for his interference. And she most certainly hadn\u2019t asked for his damned toe-curling, stomach-churning kisses.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t he just go back to Chicago and leave her alone?</p><p>Stomping across the cave, Regan slipped through the entrance and charged after Jagr\u2019s retreating form. As much as she wanted to plant a fat wooden stake in his heart, she was smart enough to realize that she wasn\u2019t strong enough to tangle with a vampire. Especially not when that vampire also happened to be a hulking freak of nature like Jagr. Christ, did the vampire tap the veins of steroid junkies?</p><p>No, if she were going to escape her current pain in the ass, it would only be with patience and a constant eye on opportunity.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t be tough. She had thirty years of practice.</p><p>Muttering curses beneath her breath, Regan lengthened her strides, catching up with Jagr as he reached the bottom of the high bluff.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Levet?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d never be so lucky as to lose him. He will find our trail soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur trail? Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>Jagr turned his head, his eyes capturing and reflecting the stars that sprinkled the velvet black sky overhead. Regan\u2019s heart gave an odd twist. She\u2019d never seen anything quite so beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted a shower and clothes.\u201d</p><p>Her brows shot upward. He\u2019d actually listened to her? And remembered the words that came out of her mouth?</p><p>Unnerved by the realization, Regan turned her attention to the street that lay just beyond the empty parking lot. There were the usual stores expected in a tourist town. Arts and crafts, souvenirs, antiques, a quaint coffee shop and bakery. All charmingly rustic, with large windows to display their wares.</p><p>Jagr led her past them without a word, thankfully missing her wistful gaze that lingered on a pretty necklace. She\u2019d never possessed anything in her life but a few cheap clothes that Culligan tossed through the bars of her cage. Despite being a wolf by nature, she was still a woman at heart, and she couldn\u2019t deny an instinctive urge to browse and gather and...well, frankly just buy a bunch of junk that she could call her own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lost in her thoughts, Regan was caught off guard when Jagr came to an abrupt halt before a red brick building. Barreling into his massive form, she hastily stepped back and glared into his impassive face.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, warn a girl, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A golden brow flicked upward. \u201cWill this do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She licked her suddenly dry lips as she glanced toward the elegant clothes displayed in the large window. \u201cI...I don\u2019t think it\u2019s open.\u201d</p><p>Stepping forward, Jagr pressed his hand against the door. For a moment nothing happened, then with a low squeak, the door swung inward.</p><p>\u201cIt is now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the alarms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been disarmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecurity cameras?\u201d He regarded her with that flat stare. At last she threw her hands up in defeat. \u201cFine, but if you get shot again, I\u2019m not offering a vein,\u201d she muttered, marching forward.</p><p>She had barely reached the door when Jagr wrapped an arm about her waist to haul her against his hard chest, whispering directly into her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to mind while I was feeding.\u201d</p><p>Regan wasn\u2019t sure what infuriated her more. Being manhandled by the brute, or the delicious heat that licked through her body at being manhandled.</p> <p>\u201cOne more word about that...feeding, and you\u2019re going to get a lot more up close and personal with those daggers you\u2019re carrying,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>His lips brushed over the curve of ear, making her pulse leap and proving his complete lack of fear at her threat. She shuddered as his fangs lightly scraped down the curve of her neck, swallowing a moan as a thousand pinpricks of excitement tingled through her.</p><p>\u201cYou can get up close and personal with anything you want, little one,\u201d he murmured, his lips teasing at her skin.</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>Wrenching free of his grasp, Regan stormed into the dark interior of the store, heading toward the back racks that held the expensive designer jeans and T-shirts.</p><p>What was wrong with her? Jagr was nothing more than an oversized, over-smug, obnoxiously gorgeous pain in her ass. So why did she keep letting him get under her skin?</p><p>Because she was an idiot.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, Regan forced herself to ignore his large form leaning against the doorjamb watching her every move with that too perceptive gaze. By God, this was her first, and perhaps only, opportunity to actually enjoy what most women took for granted. She\u2019d be damned if the guardian from hell was going to ruin the moment.</p> <p>Flicking the hangers around the circular stand, Regan occasionally paused to pull out whatever happened to catch her eye. Any of them would do, of course. The jeans were all faded and looked like they had been put through a meat slicer, while the shirts were cropped to show more than they covered.</p><p>Ah, the wacky world of fashion.</p><p>Still, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from fingering the various materials and imagining how each would feel against her skin.</p><p>Studying a tiny pink sweater with a metallic star stitched on the front, Regan stiffened as she felt the cool brush of Jagr\u2019s power as he stepped behind her.</p><p>\u201cDo they not have your size?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Regan deliberately replaced the pink sweater and selected a tiny white T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cOf course they have my size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the clothing isn\u2019t appropriate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep searching?\u201d</p><p>Heaving a sigh, she turned to glare over her shoulder. \u201cGive me a break, will you? I\u2019ve never been shopping before. I want to...savor it.\u201d</p><p>He stilled at her confession. \u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>She shoved the shirt back onto the rack. \u201cIn case you missed the news flash, Jagr, Culligan and I weren\u2019t exactly BFF. I was kept locked in a cage for the past thirty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been let out on occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when the bastard needed me to convince an audience he was a genuine faith healer.\u201d</p><p>Before she could react, Jagr turned her to face him, his features oddly tight.</p><p>\u201cHow did you convince them?\u201d</p><p>Regan shifted beneath the intensity of his icy gaze. Dammit, she felt freakish enough without Jagr eyeballing her as if she\u2019d grown a second head.</p><p>\u201cWhenever we reached a town, he would set up a big tent in a field and start handing out flyers.\u201d She ground her teeth until they ached, refusing to acknowledge the brutal pain that twisted her gut at the mere thought of Culligan. She\u2019d made a promise to herself a long time ago: she would never, ever give the damned imp the satisfaction of making her cry. Not one tear. Not ever. Regaining command of her emotions, she met Jagr\u2019s fierce gaze. \u201cBefore the show started, he would slice me open with his knife, or break a leg, and I would stumble into the tent he\u2019d set up. Once I had the audience\u2019s attention, he would rush over to put his hands over me and start praying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you would heal,\u201d he hissed softly.</p><p>\u201cRight before their very eyes. The humans thought they were watching a miracle. They couldn\u2019t get their wallets out fast enough.\u201d Her lips twisted with disgust. \u201cChumps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans believe what they see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still chumps.\u201d</p><p>His hands lifted, lightly cupping her face and forcing her to meet his gaze. Regan\u2019s heart stuttered to a halt. Christ, she\u2019d thought his frigid composure was unnerving, but now his eyes had lost their ice and smoldered with a savage, near feral fury. It was a forcible reminder that while this vampire had been sent to rescue her, he was still a dangerous predator.</p><p>\u201cJagr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll skin him alive and feed his heart to the vultures,\u201d he rasped. \u201cOr perhaps I\u2019ll chain him in the sewers near my lair for the rats to devour\u2014slowly.\u201d</p><p>Regan didn\u2019t doubt his threat. Or his ability to carry it out.</p><p>What she didn\u2019t understand was the strange thrill that pulsed through her heart at his harsh words. As if she was...pleased by his arrogant assumption that he could interfere in her business.</p><p>Which was even more terrifying than his perilous fury.</p><p>Jerking from his touch, Regan glared at him in frustration. \u201cI told you, Culligan is mine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Jagr\u2019s anger eased as he watched Regan hastily back away from him. Oh, he still intended to slaughter the imp. Slowly, painfully, and with exquisite skill. But he couldn\u2019t deny a hint of amusement at Regan\u2019s skittish unease at his grim announcement.</p><p>She\u2019d spent the past thirty years being brutally taught that she could depend on no one but herself. Trust no one. Now her prickly independence resented the mere hint that someone else might fight her battles.</p><p>Just as she resented the thought she possessed a sister and pack who cared for her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he murmured, turning to grab two armfuls of clothes off the rack. \u201cThis should do.\u201d</p><p>As he\u2019d hoped, Regan was instantly distracted. He wasn\u2019t a particularly perceptive vampire. Unlike Viper, he couldn\u2019t sense other\u2019s most intimate thoughts. But not even an idiot could miss her covetous expression or longing sighs as she had searched through the racks.</p><p>She wanted the clothes, she would have them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take all that,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cThen I will.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Jagr searched until he found the large bags stashed behind the counter and filled them with his bounty. He even included several bras and panties that were piled in a large bin, refusing to consider what the bits of lace of would look like against her ivory skin.</p><p>Reaching into the pocket of his jeans, he pulled out a wad of cash and tossed it near the register, then headed out the door and into the dark street.</p><p>He knew better than to ask, or worse yet, demand that Regan accompany him. She needed to feel as if she were in control. He was willing to give her a sense of freedom so long as she didn\u2019t put herself in danger.</p><p>There was a tense pause before he heard Regan\u2019s soft curse, and soon she was hurrying to match his long strides.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave money?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou have a moral issue with stealing?\u201d</p><p>Jagr allowed his powers to flow through the dark street, searching for any hint of danger.</p><p>\u201cNo, just a dislike for attracting unwanted attention. I left enough money to keep the owner from calling the cops and risk losing her sudden windfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shower.\u201d</p><p>Confident there was nothing more threatening than the usual humans and a few water sprites that sang their siren song from the river, Jagr turned the corner and headed toward the main highway that cut through town.</p><p>Despite his swift pace, Regan easily kept at his side, her gaze warily searching the shadows, her body tense, ready for any unexpected attack.</p><p>Jagr should have been pleased. The woman was obviously smart enough to keep up her guard, despite the seeming lack of danger.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t pleased.</p><p>In fact, he was downright pissy. As if some latent, primitive part of his nature was offended she would question his right and ability to keep her safe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alarm trickled down his spine like ice, but Jagr grimly ignored the warning. Regan had been setting off alarms since he first caught sight of her. Instead, he slowed before the cheap chain motel with the blinking vacancy sign.</p><p>Regan frowned as he headed toward the far end of the building. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the nearest shower.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re checking into a hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight I prefer to skip the paperwork. The desk clerk is no doubt busy sharpening his skills at Guitar Hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, what is it with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She regarded him with a sour expression. \u201cOne minute you sound like you just crawled out of a medieval crypt and the next, you sound like you\u2019re a full-fledged member of Gen X.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged, hiding his smile at her fierce need to keep him at a distance. And people called him antisocial.</p><p>\u201cI watch TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. You\u2019re addicted to Dexter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I prefer Gossip Girl.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>He moved toward the last door. \u201cThis one\u2019s empty.\u201d Placing his hand against the door, Jagr waited until he heard the click of the lock and pressed it open. Standing aside, he waited for Regan to march past him, her head high, her spine stiff.</p> <p>Shutting the door, he held the bags toward the wary woman.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn on the light until you\u2019ve closed the bathroom door. We don\u2019t want to alarm the staff.\u201d</p><p>She inched forward, clearly suspicious of his motives in bringing her to the hotel room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to be doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping guard.\u201d His brief amusement faded as the jasmine scent of her wrapped around him, stoking the hunger that smoldered deep inside him. The mere thought of her naked in the shower, with only a flimsy door between them...gods. Heat blasted through him, swirling through the air and making his voice thick. \u201cUnless you have need of me?\u201d</p><p>Snatching the bags, Regan backed toward the open door across the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Her tone was sharp, but Jagr didn\u2019t miss the darkening of her eyes or the rapid beat of her pulse. He pushed from the door, the flames licking through his blood.</p> <p>\u201cMy assistance would save time. I could scrub your back.\u201d His gaze swept down the delicate curves. \u201cOr your front, if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even in your dreams, Jagr.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she was definitely going to be in his dreams. The only question was for how many nights.</p><p>Or centuries.</p><p>\u201cYou did say you were in a hurry to get on the trail of Culligan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Do I look stupid?\u201d</p><p>The sweet, enticing scent of her arousal perfumed the air, but Jagr didn\u2019t miss the hint of panic that flared through her emerald eyes. She desired him, but she feared that desire as much as she feared any emotion that wasn\u2019t hate or revenge.</p><p>Damn. He moved forward, forcing himself to halt when a tremor shook through her body. She was going to bolt. He sensed it as clearly as if she\u2019d tattooed it across her forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a woman who has been knocked around enough to assume everyone is your enemy.\u201d His voice was deliberately cool, his hunger firmly leashed. \u201cI will not hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed heavily, then predictably channeled her unease into anger.</p><p>\u201cBecause precious Darcy would be mad?\u201d she sneered.</p><p>\u201cBecause I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Just keep watch, Hulkster,\u201d she growled, her wolf prowling beneath her skin. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare come anywhere near this door.\u201d</p><p>The door in question was slammed with enough force to split one of the wooden panels. Jagr remained in the center of the room, pretending that the image of Regan stripping off her clothes and stepping beneath the pelting water wasn\u2019t searing through his brain. Then, confident she was actually taking the opportunity to bathe, he slowly backed out of the room and made a swift sweep of the neighborhood to make sure they hadn\u2019t been followed.</p><p>Finding nothing out of the ordinary, he slipped to the back of the building and pressed himself against the worn bricks.</p><p>Nearly half an hour passed when the window next to him was shoved open, and a number of large bags were tossed onto the pavement. His lips twitched at the realization that Regan couldn\u2019t leave behind her new clothes, even in her desperation to escape him.</p><p>Scooping the bags beneath one arm, Jagr straightened and turned, waiting for Regan to swing her legs (attired in a new pair of jeans), through the window. With a motion so fast not even a Were could follow, he scooped her off the ledge.</p><p>\u201cThe window, Regan?\u201d he mocked softly. \u201cYou disappoint me. I thought you would be more creative.\u201d</p><p>Regan gave a squeak and then a shriek as he easily tossed her over his shoulder and headed swiftly back toward the cave.</p><p>\u201cJackass.\u201d Her fist slammed into his back with jarring force, reminding him that she was all pureblood, despite her inability to shift. \u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, you\u2019re wasting my time with these stupid vampire games.\u201d</p><p>Moving with a speed that would defy human eyes, Jagr rapidly neared their temporary lair. He\u2019d been a fool to believe that giving into her demands for clean clothing and a shower would ease her distrust.</p><p>He was still one of the bad guys.</p><p>She was determined to play the Lone Ranger (sans Tonto). And now he was once again forced to hold her close enough to torment him with the scent of her freshly scrubbed skin and hot blood.</p><p>His arms tightened around her legs as she continued to struggle. \u201cThis is no game, little one. I was commanded by my Anasso to bring you to Chicago, and that\u2019s exactly what I intend to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought my sister was the one who sent you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy wants you in Chicago, and Styx wants Darcy happy. It\u2019s the way of mates.\u201d</p><p>The blows to his back abruptly halted. \u201cAnd what about your mate? I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019s thrilled with this little road trip of yours.\u201d</p><p>Jagr halted before the entrance to the cave, abruptly setting the aggravating demon on her feet.</p><p>\u201cI have no mate.\u201d</p><p>Something flashed through her eyes. Relief? Uncertainty? Indigestion?</p><p>Whatever it was, she was swift to squash it as she shoved her fingers through her damp hair.</p><p>\u201cNo mate? What a shocker.\u201d Her smile was taunting. \u201cWith your stunning lack of charm and habit of treating women like you\u2019re a Neanderthal, I would have thought the demon babes would be crawling all over you.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s fangs throbbed, his heavy erection ached, and his mood was taking a southward dip toward foul.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the lack of females that has prevented me from taking a mate,\u201d he icily denied.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lack of interest in those females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if. Men like you...\u201d</p><p>Jagr was bending down his head and sealing her lips with a brief, searing kiss before he could halt the impulse. Perhaps because for the first time in centuries, his brutal self-control was being undermined by a tiny wisp of a Were with the tongue of a drunken harpy and the manners of rabid badger.</p><p>Abruptly lifting his head, he met her stunned gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell do you keep doing that?\u201d she muttered, her cheeks flushed with a heat she couldn\u2019t hide.</p><p>Jagr growled deep in his throat. \u201cIf I knew, I would no doubt be falling on the nearest stake.\u201d</p><p>The emerald eyes flashed. \u201cThat can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are.\u201d Stomping from the cave, Levet regarded them with a jaundiced frown, his wings twitching in aggravation. \u201cI thought you\u2019d abandoned me. Again.\u201d</p><p>Jagr swallowed a snarl, resisting the urge to toss the gargoyle into the river below. His body might howl at the interruption, but the pea-sized part of his brain that was still functioning realized that he was allowing himself to be perilously distracted by his strange fascination with Regan.</p><p>Gods, he was going to get them both killed.</p><p>\u201cLevet, I need your help,\u201d he commanded in frigid tones, allowing his warrior instincts to drown his seething frustration.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d Levet smirked. \u201cYou run off and do whatever vampires do, and I will be happy to keep Regan safe.\u201d</p><p>As if Jagr would allow Regan out of his sight for a second. Stupid demon.</p><p>\u201cI need you to track down the local cur pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Levet narrowed his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m to do the grunt work while you get to stay with the beautiful woman. Typical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect that the curs have a demon or witch who is helping to keep them hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does that have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one capable of sensing magic.\u201d</p><p>Levet sputtered, wanting to argue but unable to deny the truth. At last he threw up his hands in defeat.</p><p>\u201cSacrebleu. Fine, I will do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you find the pack, do not approach them,\u201d Jagr warned. \u201cI don\u2019t want them spooked before I discover why they were shooting at us, and what connection they have to the imp.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine, but I expect payment for trailing after a bunch of stinking curs.\u201d</p><p>Jagr grasped one of the stunted horns and hauled Levet up to glare into his wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour payment is that you get to keep your wings. Understood?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, let go.\u201d</p><p>Jagr dropped the demon back to the ground. \u201cDon\u2019t return until you\u2019ve found the curs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoth bully.\u201d With a flick of his tail, Levet turned to waddle away.</p><p>Jagr grimaced. No doubt both Darcy and Shay would rake him over the coals when he returned to Chicago. They possessed a bizarre fondness for the gargoyle. But for the moment, all he cared about was finding the curs and ending their threat to Regan.</p><p>At his side, Regan raked a glance over his large body. \u201cWhy does he keep calling you a Goth? I\u2019d say you\u2019re more...ghetto chic.\u201d</p> <p>Ghetto chic?</p><p>\u201cI was once a Visigoth chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Her eyes widened in shock. \u201cExactly when did you get changed into a vampire?\u201d</p><p>With a flinch, Jagr turned to enter the cave, the bags of clothing banging against his legs. The night of his turning was something he never discussed.</p><p>Not with anyone.</p><p>With a snort of disgust at his retreat, Regan followed on his heels.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Mr. Freeze. What the hell are you doing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>The elegant bedroom in the St. Louis mansion was a decadent feast for the senses. Gold-veined marble walls reflected the glow of the priceless chandelier, the lacquer furniture was designed for accommodating the most adventurous sexual fantasies, and even the high ceiling was painted with naughty satyrs seducing Rubenesque angels.</p><p>Lying in the middle of the Olympic-sized bed drenched in gold satin and black velvet, Salvatore Giuliani was jerked from his fleeting pleasure by the persistent buzz of his private cell phone.</p><p>His hand reached for the phone even as the woman straddling his naked body prepared to impale herself on his stiff erection.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer it,\u201d the beautiful cur with long crimson hair and pale green eyes moaned, her lips trailing over his chest. \u201cPlease, lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off, Jenna,\u201d he growled, his golden brown eyes glowing as the wolf inside him stirred with anger.</p><p>\u201cCall them back later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet the hell off.\u201d</p><p>With a sweep of his arm, Salvatore knocked the cur aside, rising from the bed in one smooth motion.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Jenna rasped, sprawled spread-eagle across the rumpled sheets, her eyes sparkling with excitement at his rough treatment.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Salvatore drawled.</p><p>Turning his back on the woman, he reached for the phone, his brows drawing together at the unfamiliar number. Only a handful of people were allowed to dial his private line. Those who called without permission usually found themselves missing their throat. And occasionally their spleen. Flipping open the phone, he held it to his ear. \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d The cold, dark voice was edged with the revolting arrogance that was as much a part of a vampire as his fangs. Filthy leeches. \u201cI was sent by Styx to retrieve the Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019re in Hannibal.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore curled his lips at the smug response. Cristo. He hated vampires.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to know why your curs tried to kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurs.\u201d With quick strides, Salvatore was standing beside the heavy desk across the room, clicking through the files on his laptop. \u201cThere is no Were pack near Hannibal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have some strays taking potshots at the tourists.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore clenched his fist, his eyes glowing with fury. As King of the Weres, he kept his rules simple. Obey or die. No room for confusion.</p><p>\u201cA problem easily corrected. I will be there tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we locate them, I need at least one left alive to question.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore clenched his teeth at the cool command. One day soon...</p><p>\u201cI make no guarantees.\u201d</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, he snapped shut the phone and headed toward the door.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you coming back to bed?\u201d Jenna whined.</p><p>Salvatore didn\u2019t bother to glance in her direction. \u201cGet your clothes on, and get out.\u201d Reaching the door, he jerked it open to gesture toward the massive, shaven-headed cur that stood guard in the hallway. \u201cHess.\u201d</p><p>Dropping to his knees, the cur pressed his forehead to the crimson carpet in proper deference. \u201cYes, sire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem in Hannibal. I want you to gather up three of our best soldiers, and pack the Humvee with enough arsenal to clean out a pack of rogue curs. We leave after my lunch with the mayor.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Regan watched as Jagr slipped the cell phone into the pocket of his jeans. Jeans that hung low on his hips and clung to his powerful legs with yummy determination...</p><p>Crap.</p><p>Tilting her chin, Regan tried to ignore the constant awareness that buzzed through her like an electric shock. Okay, the damned vamp was the most beautiful creature she\u2019d ever seen. And he oozed sex from the top of his golden head to the tips of his shit-kicker boots. And his kisses were making her so randy she thought she might scream if she didn\u2019t have relief soon.</p><p>But he was still the most obnoxious, arrogant, unpredictable, pig-headed brute it was ever her misfortune to encounter.</p><p>\u201cIf you intended to call Salvatore, then why did you send Levet to look for the curs?\u201d she demanded, her voice sharp with...hell, she\u2019d might as well admit it, if only to herself. Sharp with frustration.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSalvatore has no greater ability to sense magic than I do. A gargoyle is a creature of magic. There\u2019s no spell, no matter how powerful the demon or witch, that he won\u2019t be able to track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not just waiting in this cave for Levet to return.\u201d She folded her arms over her chest, ready (no, aching) for a fight. \u201cAs you pointed out, we don\u2019t even know if Culligan is with the curs.\u201d</p><p>He flicked a golden brow upward, tossing her bags of clothing into a far corner. Clothes he\u2019d bought for her just because he knew she wanted them. Her frustration became downright painful. Damn the vampire.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is your plan?\u201d he mocked. \u201cTo roam the streets, and hope you stumble over the imp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a better idea, chief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I think we should find the RV. The curs might be capable of hiding an imp, but they wouldn\u2019t expend the magic to hide his vehicle.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cWhat does it matter if he isn\u2019t in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCulligan was no doubt in a hurry to disappear. He might have left something behind that will reveal why he chose Hannibal.\u201d</p><p>Against her will, Regan recalled those chaotic hours after her rescue. She\u2019d been certain Salvatore Giuliani must be some sort of gorgeous guardian angel sent to free her from Culligan\u2019s clutches. It was exactly what she\u2019d dreamed of for years.</p><p>Until, of course, the freaking Were had allowed Culligan to escape, followed by her being informed that she had an extended family who obviously hadn\u2019t given a damn that she was being used and abused, and then topped it off with the news she was worthless to him since he could smell her infertility.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Culligan be in a hurry?\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to hide her bitterness. \u201cSalvatore made it clear he wasn\u2019t going to waste his time tracking down a mere imp to punish him. Not when I\u2019m barren and worthless.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. \u201cCulligan wasn\u2019t afraid of the damned King of Weres. He was afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>His artic gaze flicked over her tense body. \u201cDo you need to feed before we begin?\u201d</p><p>She was starving, but she wasn\u2019t about to admit as much. Allowing this vampire to take care of her needs was...disturbing.</p><p>\u201cI will later.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed with annoyance. \u201cThat\u2019s no answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, too bad, because that\u2019s all you\u2019re getting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need to feed, then you\u2019ll do it now. You\u2019re no good to me weak.\u201d</p><p>Regan snapped. There was no other word for it.</p><p>One moment she was standing near the entrance of the cave, and the next she was flying through the air to tackle the six-foot-three, two-hundred-fifty-pound vampire.</p><p>When they tumbled to the hard ground, Regan wasn\u2019t certain who was the more astonished, her or Jagr.</p><p>She did know who recovered first.</p><p>She\u2019d barely managed a smirk at the realization she\u2019d landed on top when Jagr gave a low growl, and with one smooth motion had rolled her beneath him, his body pinning her to the hard dirt.</p><p>Regan felt her breath being squeezed from her lungs. Of course, who wouldn\u2019t suffocate with a massive vampire squashing them?</p><p>It didn\u2019t have anything to do with the thick hair that had loosened from its braid to tumble about them like a curtain of gold satin. Or the scent of raw power flooding her senses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nope. No way in hell.</p><p>So why were those blue eyes thawing as if Jagr could sense the hot rush of her blood, and the renegade softening of her limbs?</p><p>\u201cWe both know I could force you to Chicago if I wanted,\u201d he husked, his hand cupping her face in a gesture of pure possession. \u201cUnfortunately I understand your thirst for revenge and I\u2019m willing to indulge you for a day or two. But not if this is a death wish. You take one unnecessary risk or try to sneak away from me again, and I will stuff you in a bag and carry you to your sister.\u201d</p><p>Regan hissed, her body trembling with the need to rub against the hard thrust of his arousal.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re really pissing me off.\u201d</p><p>His gaze lowered to her lips. \u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you.\u201d</p><p>Muttering words she didn\u2019t understand, Jagr buried his face in the curve of her neck, the sensation of his fangs scraping her sensitive skin sending a shocking rash of pleasure through her body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire, little one.\u201d</p> <p>Regan\u2019s lips parted, her fingers digging into his upper arms as his tongue lightly traced the line of her collarbone revealed by her new pink T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cJagr,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cYou smell of hot nights and jasmine.\u201d His mouth brushed her skin as he spoke, the cool stroke of his lips branding her flesh. \u201cExquisite.\u201d</p><p>Regan squeezed her eyes shut, desperately trying to halt the dark tide of need. Okay, her body wanted Jagr. Wanted him with a force that was close to going nuclear.</p><p>But it was just lust. The reaction of a woman who had been denied sex her entire life.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you could kiss me,\u201d she muttered, jerking with pleasure as his lips traveled up her neck to tease the hollow just below her ear.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>Stop? Hell, no. She wanted him to rip off her clothes and lick her from head to toe. She wanted him to taste and nibble and bite until she screamed in pleasure. She wanted to wrap her fingers around his thickening cock and guide him into the aching void that refused to leave her in peace. She wanted...</p><p>She wanted.</p><p>And that was the problem.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jagr.\u201d</p><p>He nipped the lobe of her ear. \u201cPlease what, little one? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Calling upon the considerable strength of her heritage, along with a good dose of panic, Regan slammed her hands against the steel width of his chest, managing to gain enough space to wriggle from beneath his body. Scrambling to her feet, she brushed the dirt from her new clothes and glared at the vampire who gained his feet with a sinuous grace. \u201cWhat is it with you? One minute you\u2019re giving me frostbite, and the next you have your tongue down my throat. Are you psychotic, or just a garden-variety wing nut?\u201d</p><p>With a cold smile, Jagr prowled toward the entrance of the cave. \u201cI think the better question is why a woman who is so obviously desperate for my touch would be so terrified of her own desire.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 6</p><p>The high ridge overlooking the Mississippi River south of Hannibal was perfectly suited to hide a pack of renegade curs. The abandoned wooden cabin was miles from its nearest neighbor, and the thick tangle of trees deterred all but the most determined hikers. But it was not only the isolation that had lured Sadie and her pack to the remote peak.</p><p>No, it was the echoing magic that lingered in the rich black earth, and the power of the churning waters below. In long-ago times, this land had belonged to the native Indians, and residue of their devotion to nature lingered with potent force, resonating through Sadie like a tuning fork.</p><p>Not that she wouldn\u2019t have preferred an elegant mansion, complete with acres of marble and priceless works of art. She might be an animal at heart, but she lusted for the finer things in life. Just as she had when she was turning tricks in the nasty alleys of St. Louis nearly thirty years ago.</p><p>That\u2019s where she had first encountered Caine, the cur who had promised to make her a queen before he\u2019d bit her and changed her world forever.</p><p>She was still waiting on the whole queen thing, she acknowledged wryly, moving through the main room of the cabin shrouded in the gathering gloom. It offered nothing more than a ratty couch, two overstuffed chairs, and a stone fireplace. There wasn\u2019t even a picture hung on the rough wooden walls.</p><p>It was about as far away from the palace she dreamed of as the squalid boardinghouse she\u2019d once shared with three other whores.</p><p>But then, revolutions were rarely without sacrifice.</p><p>Or blood, she was reminded as a hoarse scream reverberated from the attached shed.</p><p>A small smile touched her thin, some would claim cruel, features. Not that many men minded the hint of malicious fire that burned deep inside her. Humans might be attracted to her pale, still-smooth skin that contrasted with her waist-length raven hair and smoldering black eyes, but curs were brought to their knees by the hard muscles of her slender body and air of coiled violence that promised sweet pain.</p><p>Running her hands over the black leather pants that hung low on her hips and matched the barely-there halter top, Sadie was debating between returning to the shed and enjoying some quality torture with her captive, or going on the hunt, when a familiar scent had her rushing across the room.</p><p>Jerking open the door, she frowned as the tall, slender cur stepped from the thick shadows of the trees.</p><p>He was a tasty toy with dark hair he parted in the middle and allowed to brush past the line of his firm jaw. His eyes were indigo blue and surrounded by a tangle of thick lashes, and his features were carved with bad-boy perfection. An image only enhanced by his precisely trimmed goatee.</p><p>Black Irish.</p><p>Delectable.</p><p>Tonight, however, her first thought was not mounting him like a mechanical bull. It was pure fury that he\u2019d obviously failed at his mission.</p><p>Stepping aside, Sadie waited for Duncan to enter the cabin before slamming the door and leaning against the wooden panels.</p><p>Outside, half a dozen curs and her personal witch roamed the woods, keeping constant guard on the area. She could catch the occasional rustle of underbrush as they circled the cabin. None would intrude without her permission.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the bitch?\u201d Sadie growled. She\u2019d never been one for pleasantries. Why use a scalpel when a sledgehammer was so much more fun?</p><p>With the familiarity of a longtime lover, Duncan strolled across the room to grab a bottle of whiskey from the mantel, taking a deep swig before turning to meet her glowing gaze.</p><p>\u201cThere were...complications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I give a shit about complications? I told you to bring me the Were.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grimaced. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>Sadie hissed as she straightened from the door. \u201cSalvatore followed her to Hannibal?\u201d</p><p>Another swig of the whiskey. \u201cWorse. She had a vampire with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell would she be doing with a bloodsucker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just any bloodsucker.\u201d Duncan\u2019s sharp laugh ricocheted uneasily through the room. \u201cI\u2019d bet my ass it was the reclusive, legendary Jagr. I caught a glimpse of him once when I was in Chicago, but he\u2019s not a demon you forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr? I thought he was a myth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTooth fairies are a myth. Jagr is a force of nature that even other vampires fear.\u201d</p><p>Sadie stormed across the room, yanking the bottle of whiskey from Duncan\u2019s hand and swallowing the remaining dregs.</p><p>Perfect. Absolutely freaking perfect.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t bad enough that Regan had slipped from her grasp, now she was being protected by the Hannibal Lecter of vampires?</p><p>Shit, Caine was going to skin her alive.</p><p>Literally, not figuratively.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he protect the Were?\u201d</p><p>Duncan leaned against the stone mantel, folding his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he drawled. \u201cPerhaps it has something to do with the fact her sister is the current Queen of Vampires?\u201d</p><p>The thought of Darcy being discovered after so many years, only to be snatched away by the King of the Living Dead, sent another wave of fury through Sadie, forcing her to battle the instinctive urge to shift.</p><p>\u201cInterfering leeches. I warned Caine that leaving that ditzy Were in the hands of the vamps was trouble.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s lips twisted as his gaze skimmed down her tense body, lingering on the tattoo of a striking snake that coiled about her waist.</p><p>\u201cI heard your complaints, but I noticed you didn\u2019t offer yourself to become fodder in the skirmish between the vampires and purebloods, Sadie, luv.\u201d</p><p>Sadie stepped back from Duncan\u2019s pulsing heat. Now was not the time to be distracted.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>Sadie whirled to hurl the empty bottle of booze into the fireplace. The shatter of glass was satisfying, but it did nothing to soothe her scalding fury.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she gave a crap about the dead curs. They were nothing more than renewable resources. But the fact they had failed in their duty made her want to rip their corpses apart piece by piece.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire?\u201d</p><p>Duncan rubbed his side as if remembering a painful blow. \u201cNo, we were hit by a spell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sadie sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cThey have a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot human. Some sort of demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. What kind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t wait around for DNA testing.\u201d</p><p>Sadie grabbed the front of Duncan\u2019s blue cashmere sweater he\u2019d matched with black chinos. The male was addicted to Project Runway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain you weren\u2019t followed?\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s jaw tightened, but he was smart enough not to struggle. \u201cI still have the amulet the witch gave me, and just to be certain I headed straight south before doubling back. If there was anyone on my trail, they\u2019re in St. Louis by now.\u201d</p><p>Sadie briefly considered crushing her fist into the cur\u2019s face, if only to relieve the frustration that curdled in the pit of her stomach. A pity she still had need of the incompetent fool.</p> <p>Tossing the cur away, Sadie paced the narrow room. \u201cWe have to get the Were before Caine returns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look my way, luv.\u201d Duncan smoothed his sweater, his natural arrogance back in full force. \u201cI\u2019ve already had my near-death experience for the week.\u201d</p><p>Sadie curled her lips. \u201cBe careful, Duncan. Your balls get any smaller, they might disappear altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019ll still have them intact.\u201d He cupped his impressive package. \u201cYou want the Were? Go get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I intend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the vampire?\u201d</p> <p>Sadie shrugged, her cunning mind already plotting her next move. \u201cBeneath all that fang and fury, he\u2019s just a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over yourself, Sadie,\u201d Duncan drawled. \u201cYou might be a cur\u2019s wet dream, but you\u2019re way out of your league when it comes to vamps. Every demon knows they accept nothing less than perfection.\u201d</p><p>Sadie merely smiled. Her years as a whore had taught her that any man could be controlled. It was all a matter of finding what buttons to push.</p><p>\u201cI could have the vampire on his knees if I wanted,\u201d she purred, \u201cbut men have more weaknesses beyond just an inability to think with anything besides their cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd those would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverblown ego, and an insatiable need to flex their testosterone.\u201d Sadie tossed her raven curls. \u201cI set the trap, and he walks in. Bringing the sweet little Were with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in over your head, luv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike you, Duncan, I have a spine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUntil Jagr rips it out.\u201d</p><p>Sadie\u2019s smile faded, a ruthless chill of unease inching down her still-attached spine. With a low growl, she thrust away the stupid sensation.</p><p>The years of her being a feeble victim were long gone. She was the hunter now, not the prey.</p><p>Shoving her hand into the front pocket of her leather pants, she pulled out a set of keys and tossed them to the startled Duncan.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted. \u201cBabe, you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. The keys are to the imp\u2019s RV.\u201d</p><p>His teeth flashed white in the thickening darkness. \u201cI\u2019m more a Lamborghini man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaine wants the RV torched before it\u2019s discovered by the humans.\u201d</p><p>An eerie glow came and went in Duncan\u2019s gaze. He was alpha enough to resent Caine\u2019s superior position in the pack.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s below my pay grade. Get one of the grunts to play pyro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared, Duncan?\u201d Sadie taunted, turning to stroll toward the side door. She was itching to hurt something. And she had a tasty toy already tied up and waiting for her attention. How fortunate. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll send Silk with you. Her magic will keep the big bad vampire away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>With a low chuckle, Sadie stepped through the door that connected the small shed. The bald lightbulb hanging from the open rafters by an electric cord swayed at her entrance, filling the cramp space with harsh light and revealing the broken shovels, axes, hammers, and coffee cans filled with nails left to rust in the corners.</p><p>Sadie had no interest in the abandoned tools or the thick dust that blanketed the interior of the shed. Her entire attention was focused on the imp with long red hair and green eyes who was stripped naked and chained to the wall.</p><p>A smile of anticipation curled her lips as her gaze ran over the tall, muscular body. Except for a few flecks of dried blood, Culligan\u2019s ivory skin had healed to smooth perfection. It made her hands twitch with anticipation. Slicing through unmarred flesh was just like dipping her finger into a new jar of peanut butter.</p><p>And speaking of peanut butter...</p><p>Her smile widened as she crossed to the overturned barrel where she\u2019d left her favorite peanut butter fudge, wrapped in foil. She popped a large bite into her mouth before retrieving a silver dagger hanging on the wall and approaching the cowering imp.</p><p>He looked like an ancient sacrifice with his arms and legs spread wide, his flame hair flowing over his naked body. And, ah...his scent. Rich, plum-spiced, with a heady edge of stark, raving terror.</p><p>It was enough to make Sadie\u2019s heart pitty-pat with delight.</p><p>Halting directly before the quivering demon, Sadie slowly leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a very naughty boy, Culligan,\u201d she purred, skimming the tip of the dagger down the center of his chest. \u201cFirst you allow Salvatore to track you down and discover the girl, then you lead one of the most lethal vampires to ever walk the earth to my doorstep.\u201d</p><p>The green eyes rolled like he was a wild horse being bridled. \u201cPlease...mistress...\u201d</p><p>She dug in the dagger until a bead of blood marred the ivory skin. \u201cYou wish to plead for your life, spineless worm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what was asked of me.\u201d Culligan licked his lips, his voice rough from his hours of screaming. \u201cI was told to keep the woman alive, and not to allow her to escape. No one warned me that the pissed-off King of Weres was searching for the bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were told what you needed to know.\u201d Sadie sliced a shallow cut from the imp\u2019s breastbone to his belly button, her ears singing from Culligan\u2019s cries of pain. Such a pathetic wretch. He couldn\u2019t even manage a proper hex, the simplest of imp magic. Still, he did make the loveliest sounds when he was being carved like a Thanksgiving turkey. \u201cDid you think you could deal with the devil and not pay in blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, your pain will do. A pity I\u2019ve been warned we might need you as bait. I can\u2019t permanently damage you, but I\u2019m creative enough to keep you in one piece.\u201d With a smile she withdrew the dagger, only to plunge it back into his stomach, all the way to the hilt. \u201cWell, perhaps not one piece, but a large enough piece to keep your heart beating.\u201d</p><p>When he was done screaming, Culligan struggled to speak. \u201cBait? What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Reminded that the imp had not only lost the Were, but had dropped a butt-load of trouble in her lap, Sadie twisted the blade.</p><p>\u201cYou, my pet, have managed to make an enemy of both the vamps and Weres,\u201d she hissed. \u201cThey would follow your scent to the gates of hell to have the pleasure of killing you.\u201d</p><p>His head sagged, the hair falling forward like a crimson river. \u201cWhat does anyone care about the stupid girl? She\u2019s nothing but damaged goods. She can\u2019t even shift, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an idiot you are, Culligan. The girl\u2019s worth is beyond price. And you\u2019d better hope your bumbling hasn\u2019t endangered my master\u2019s experiments, or you\u2019re going to be praying the Weres get you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s worth so much, then why did you sell her to me?\u201d</p><p>Pulling out the dagger, Sadie placed the bloody tip beneath his chin and forced his face upward. She leaned forward until their noses were nearly touching.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsurance for what?\u201d</p><p>Sadie chuckled. \u201cThe ruling elite in the demon-world is about undergo a change in management, imp. A pity you won\u2019t be around to enjoy the transformation.\u201d</p><p>With a smooth thrust, the dagger slid through the soft under skin of Culligan\u2019s chin, moving through flesh to pierce his tongue to the roof of his mouth.</p><p>The shriek of agony was muffled, but no less sweet.</p><p>The land south and west of Hannibal smoothed from high bluffs to rolling fields and heavily wooded acres. Squatting down to study the narrow dirt path, Jagr could hear the rustle of raccoons and opossums, as well as native deer. Precisely the wild game that would attract a pack of hungry curs.</p><p>Too bad there wasn\u2019t a hint of cur in the air. Not a scent, not a track, not even a stray hair.</p><p>There was a rustle beside him and the scent of midnight jasmine teased at his senses.</p><p>Regan.</p><p>His jaw clenched as his body painfully reacted to her proximity.</p><p>Gods, he thought his days of torture were behind him. He\u2019d slaughtered his enemies and retreated to the barricaded safety of his lair. His life was supposed to be one of peace and quiet contemplation.</p><p>Yeah...right.</p><p>There was nothing peaceful in the way his body burned for a Were who couldn\u2019t decide if she wanted to rip off his clothes or stick a stake in his heart. Or in the knowledge he was risking a death sentence by ignoring Styx\u2019s order to return Regan to Chicago so the revenge-crazed woman could kill her enemy. Or even in having his hard-earned distrust for others slowly, relentlessly undermined. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was no wonder he was in the mood to bite something.</p><p>Or, more particularly, someone.</p><p>Smoothly rising to his feet, Jagr turned his head to study the female at his side.</p> <p>As if by magic, his fury and frustration eased to a rueful resignation.</p><p>Perhaps Regan had cast a spell upon him. Or perhaps the brutal barriers he\u2019d built around himself were simply no match for the powerful attraction that roared through him.</p><p>Whatever the case, he knew he wasn\u2019t nearly as desperate to return to the dark solitude of his lair as he should be.</p><p>Shuffling her feet, Regan at last cleared her throat. Since leaving the cave, she\u2019d grimly refused to utter a word. No doubt assuming her silence was some sort of punishment.</p><p>He hated to tell her that before the days of technology, he\u2019d gone decades without a sound to disturb his studies. Besides, he\u2019d known her silence wouldn\u2019t last. She was not the type of woman who could keep her emotions bottled inside.</p> <p>She was more a spit-in-your-face, kick-your-ass type of gal.</p><p>Just the way he liked them.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Jagr hid a smile at her sharp tone. \u201cThis is where I lost the imp\u2019s trail. What of you?\u201d</p><p>She glanced around the empty field, her brow furrowed. \u201cIt was around here. Maybe closer to those trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s where we\u2019ll begin our search.\u201d</p> <p>Before he could take a step, Regan had stubbornly folded her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cThis would go faster if we split up.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his brows at the suggestion. \u201cSo I can waste the rest of the night chasing you down? I don\u2019t think so. You stay at my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Her eyes shimmered in the moonlight, not the glow of a Were on the point of shifting, but one of a pissed-off woman. Just as dangerous. \u201cWasn\u2019t it enough that I was imprisoned for the past thirty years? Do I have to go from one hell to another?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cMy only purpose is to keep you safe, Regan, not to imprison you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it feels remarkably the same.\u201d</p><p>With a hiss, Jagr grabbed her arms and regarded her with a flare of anger. He would endure many things, but not being compared to a spineless coward who would harm a young female.</p><p>\u201cTake care, little one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo to hell, big chief.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly he dropped his hands and stepped back. Just the feel of her soft skin beneath his fingers was making his body clench with hunger.</p><p>\u201cYou want to be rid of me, then let me take you to Chicago,\u201d he challenged with a cool control he was far from feeling. \u201cYou\u2019ll never have to set eyes on me again.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened as she absently rubbed her arms where he\u2019d touched her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until I\u2019ve skinned Culligan and fed his heart to the fishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it would seem we\u2019re stuck with one another.\u201d Turning on his heel, Jagr led the way toward the line of trees.</p><p>Regan fell into step behind him, muttering vile threats that included chopping off his more precious body parts, as well as a gruesome decapitation.</p><p>Jagr ignored her threats. Despite her unique ability to annoy the hell out of him, he understood her frustration. She\u2019d just escaped from Culligan\u2019s clutches\u2014she didn\u2019t want to depend on anyone. Even if his presence meant keeping her alive.</p><p>Nearing the tree line, Jagr abruptly halted, his senses flaring with life.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Regan flowed to his side, her body coiled to attack. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smell blood.\u201d He pointed toward the trees. \u201cIn there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImp.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath. \u201cIs he still in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Jagr bit back his instinctive protest. Regan had earned the right to battle Culligan. So long as he was near to prevent disaster.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>Without speaking, they entered the thick woods, their steps barely stirring a leaf as they moved in silence. In the distance, Jagr could hear the rustle of nocturnal animals and babble of a shallow creek, but there was no sense of human or demon in the darkness.</p><p>Following the intoxicating scent of blood, Jagr angled to the west. There was nothing but trees for several feet, then without warning they ended, revealing a wide path that had been carved through the very heart of the woods.</p><p>It was clearly a road for the local farmer to transfer his equipment from one field to another, but Jagr\u2019s only interest was in the long RV that was distinctly out of place.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Coming to a halt, Jagr was sharply aware of the savage emotions that assaulted the woman at his side.</p><p>\u201cRegan?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her arms wrapped protectively around her waist. \u201cI can\u2019t. I...I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Before he realized he was moving, Jagr had gathered Regan in his arms. Strange. He\u2019d never before felt the urge to comfort another, not even those of his clan, but in this moment there was nothing more vital.</p><p>Smoothing a hand down the knotted muscles of her back, he lowered his head to whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cStay here and keep guard. Can you do that, little one?\u201d</p><p>There was a tense pause, then she gave a jerky nod. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the irrational reluctance to leave her alone, Jagr loosened his grip and stepped back. This possessive sense of protection toward Regan was not only dangerous, it was distracting.</p><p>A warrior needed to be cold and logical, a master of his emotions.</p><p>This fermenting fear for Regan\u2019s safety could make him sloppy.</p><p>And sloppy meant death.</p><p>Ignoring his unwelcome instincts, Jagr stepped onto the rough path and approached the RV. Nearing the door, he withdrew a dagger from his boot. His senses might tell him the vehicle was empty, but he knew better than to walk in blindly. The curs had already proven they could hide their presence behind a spell. He wasn\u2019t taking chances.</p><p>Circling the long motor home, he cautiously peered through the windows. Empty. Unless the curs also managed to become invisible.</p><p>At last, Jagr approached the door, wrapping himself in shadows as he threw it open and flowed silently inside. He crouched low, prepared for attack. When one didn\u2019t occur, he straightened and allowed his gaze to slide over the built-in kitchen and living room that were crammed into the small space.</p><p>It all looked...</p><p>Human.</p><p>Not at all the lavish lifestyle preferred by imps.</p><p>Of course, Regan had claimed that Culligan was weak. If he couldn\u2019t produce hexes or portals, then he would have to depend on other means to acquire his wealth.</p><p>Such as abusing a vulnerable young Were in his sick sideshow.</p><p>With a low growl, Jagr moved toward the back of the RV, already knowing what he would discover when he yanked open the door to the bedroom.</p><p>Knowing, however, and seeing were two very different things.</p><p>The small room was surrounded by pure silver bars. The walls, the ceiling, the windows, and even the inside of the door. Even worse, there were silver shackles and chains tossed on a narrow cot that was the only piece of furniture, beyond a tiny TV and shelf of worn books.</p><p>This is where Regan had lived for the past thirty years. Where she\u2019d been raised by a brutal master, and abused on a regular basis.</p><p>Had she been forced to wear the shackles whenever she was in this room?</p><p>The corrosive burn would have been near unbearable, and would have weakened her to the point where she could barely function.</p><p>Cold, lethal fury seared through him.</p><p>Someone would pay for this.</p><p>In blood.</p><p>Lost in his dark thoughts, it was the scent of jasmine that had him abruptly turning and heading back to the front of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cRegan. Do not,\u201d he rasped, his voice thickening with his native accent as he watched her climb through the door.</p><p>Sick fear swirled about her, filling the narrow space, but her beautiful face was hard with determination.</p><p>\u201cI have to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything to discover, I will find it. There\u2019s no need for you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s every need, Jagr,\u201d she interrupted, her voice low and ragged.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo prove that I can.\u201d</p><p>Stepping forward, Jagr cupped her chilled face in his hand. \u201cYou have nothing to prove, Regan.

There was nothing more arousing than a powerful woman.</p> <p>\u201cNot that I don\u2019t approve of wholesale destruction, but there are more satisfying means of exorcising your frustration,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cCulligan kept his money and private papers in a safe...ah.\u201d Tossing him a smug smile, Regan tugged out a small metal box from the hole she\u2019d just made in the panel. A smile that faded as she struggled to wrench the thing open. \u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow me.\u201d Without asking for permission, Jagr pulled the box from her grasp and wrenched the heavy lid off.</p><p>Not surprisingly, he was rewarded with a nasty glare. \u201cAm I supposed to be impressed with your bulging muscles and mindless brute strength?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be impressed by anything you want, little one, although most women prefer my bulging...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBleck.\u201d She held up a hand. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p> <p>Jagr might have been offended if he didn\u2019t catch the unmistakable scent of her desire whenever he was near.</p><p>Glancing in the box, Jagr grimaced and shoved it toward Regan. \u201cI think you\u2019ve earned this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d she breathed, her eyes widening at the stash of jewels and watches and neatly stacked money. \u201cHumans. You would think thousands of years of evolution would finally give them the talent of recognizing a blatant swindle.\u201d Regan shuddered, staring at the box as if it were contaminated. \u201cI don\u2019t want this. It\u2019s tainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give it to a charity or throw it in the river. Just so long as Culligan or his friends can\u2019t get their hands on it.\u201d</p><p>Regan grimaced. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right?\u201d Jagr pressed a hand to his heart in mock astonishment. \u201cBlessed saints, did the sky fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart ass...\u201d</p><p>Regan\u2019s eyes widened as Jagr flowed forward to press a hand to her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s approaching,\u201d he whispered close to her ear. She tugged his hand from her mouth, but was careful to keep her voice soft.</p><p>\u201cCulligan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell. They must be cloaked by a spell to cover their scent.\u201d</p><p>On the point of turning the hunter into his personal prey, Jagr stiffened. He had less than a beat to catch the scent of smoke before a bottle crashed through the window of the RV and exploded in flames. Instinctively, Jagr backed away. Fire was one enemy a vampire couldn\u2019t battle.</p><p>\u201cTime for you to go, Regan.\u201d He shoved her toward the flames that were spreading with lethal speed. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>Digging in her heels she whirled to glare at him. \u201cAre you mental?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire isn\u2019t magical, you\u2019ll heal from the burns,\u201d he rasped, his body quivering with the need to rush her to safety.</p><p>\u201cYeah, only to be killed by the freaking King of Vamps when he discovers I bolted like a wuss and left his favorite pet to become toast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyx would never harm you, and I am not the Anasso\u2019s favorite anything, let alone his pet. Now get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>The smoke thickened, the heat already bringing beads of sweat to Regan\u2019s face, but the woman stubbornly refused to flee.</p><p>\u201cForget it, chief. It\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Muttering ancient curses and more than a few derogatory comments on the brains of Weres in general, and one in particular, Jagr wrapped his arms around his personal thorn in his side, and with one mighty surge smashed through the side of the RV.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Even buffered by Jagr\u2019s huge body, Regan\u2019s breath was wrenched from her lungs as they crashed through the side of the motor home and landed on the pathway with a hard jolt.</p><p>Before she\u2019d managed to suck in the much needed air, Jagr had jerked her to her feet and turned to face the two attackers that appeared frozen in horror by their abrupt appearance.</p><p>There was a slender human woman with a mop of blond curls and innocuous blue eyes, as well as a tall, leanly handsome man that Regan instantly recognized as a cur, with dark hair and a goatee that somehow seemed perfect for his wicked features.</p><p>Regan had barely regained her balance when a cold blast of power filled the air, and Jagr had launched himself into battle.</p><p>The female screamed in terror, but rather than fleeing as any intelligent creature should have done, she threw out her hands, as if trying to shoo away the massive predator. Regan might have found it funny if there wasn\u2019t a brilliant flash of light that smacked Jagr in the center of his chest, sending him flying backwards.</p><p>Witch.</p><p>Regan rushed toward the vampire, who was sprawled on the hard ground, the front of his sweater charred and still smoking. Damn the witch to hell. No one was allowed to harm Jagr.</p><p>No one but her.</p><p>She was less than a half step away from the injured vampire when the hair on the back of her neck stood on end.</p><p>Allowing instinct to guide her, Regan crouched low as she whirled around, her leg striking out to trip the attacking cur.</p><p>Her dip allowed her to avoid a painful blow to her jaw as the attacker\u2019s fist swung over the top of her head, but he managed to leap over her kicking leg, his eyes glowing with the eerie light of a wolf. Spinning to face her, the cur held up his hands in a gesture of peace.</p><p>\u201cEasy, luv,\u201d he soothed, his voice hinting at Irish origins. \u201cI have no wish to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Regan gritted her teeth, too furious to be properly terrified.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Her sharp laugh echoed through the trees. \u201cI suppose you also have a bridge you\u2019re trying to unload?\u201d</p><p>His lips curved in a well rehearsed smile. \u201cI swear on my sweet mother\u2019s grave that I\u2019ve been ordered to bring you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me where?\u201d</p><p>He held out a slender hand. \u201cCome with me, and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Did she have stupid tattooed on her forehead?</p><p>Regan attempted to inch around the cur, plagued by a desperate need to reach Jagr.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing more than to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe? You tried to shoot me in that hotel room, not to mention nearly roasting me alive just a minute ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were trying to kill the vampire in that hotel room, not you. We thought he was attacking you.\u201d His gaze slowly roamed down her body, his arrogant expression revealing he believed women enjoyed being checked over like used cars. Schmuck. \u201cWeres and vampires don\u2019t usually mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tonight?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea anyone was in the RV. I was sent to get rid of it, not to harm you.\u201d</p><p>Regan stiffened. She\u2019d assumed that they had been followed by the cur to this remote spot. But if he was telling the truth, then he\u2019d known about the RV.</p><p>And Culligan.</p><p>\u201cWho sent you?\u201d she hissed. \u201cCulligan?\u201d</p><p>The man snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t be daft. As if I would take orders from a filthy imp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know where he is?\u201d</p><p>He confidently stepped closer, his voice low and seductive. \u201cNot only do I know, but I have him all tied up like a birthday present, just waiting for you to come and punish him.\u201d</p><p>Regan\u2019s thoughts churned. There wasn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of her actually going with the cur. Her every instinct shrieked in warning. Besides, she wouldn\u2019t leave Jagr. (Why she felt the need to protect an ancient vampire who was currently holding her hostage, not to mention driving her nuts, was something she wasn\u2019t about to consider.)</p><p>But if she could keep him talking, then he might give some clue as to where he was hiding Culligan...and why the hell he wanted to get his hands on her.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know Culligan?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The cur shrugged. \u201cNever met him before he arrived in Hannibal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, is there a demon who comes through town who you don\u2019t try to kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t try to kill the imp.\u201d The man stepped closer, as if hoping his potent heat would befuddle her mind. \u201cIt was a simple snatch and grab.\u201d</p><p>She continued inching toward Jagr. Her heart twisted. Why wouldn\u2019t he wake up? He would poof if he was dead, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cHardly simple,\u201d she accused. \u201cCulligan didn\u2019t go willingly.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled into a snarl. \u201cThere might have been some blood involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy take him at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond the pleasure of listening to him squeal?\u201d The cur chuckled. \u201cWe discovered that he\u2019d held a fellow wolf captive. That can\u2019t go unpunished.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was lying. Regan had never been so certain of anything in her life.</p><p>\u201cFantastic. Where the hell were you when I actually needed your help?\u201d she mocked, still circling the dangerous cur.</p><p>Suddenly, she was close enough to sense Jagr\u2019s power, though it was faint. Sheer relief crashed through her.</p> <p>He was still alive.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why, but it felt as if a truck had abruptly been lifted from her chest.</p><p>Unaware of Regan\u2019s distraction, the man smoothed a hand over the rippling muscles of his chest, his smile edged with a wicked smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now. Ready and prepared to help with whatever you might need.\u201d</p><p>Ick, ick, ick.</p> <p>Regan didn\u2019t feel any of the tingling excitement that she felt when Jagr regarded her with that heated awareness. All she felt was...revulsion.</p><p>Struggling to hide her less than flattering response, Regan was distracted as the witch grabbed the cur\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed, her eyes wide with panic. \u201cThe vamp won\u2019t be down forever. We have to go.\u201d</p><p>Regan growled, itching to knock the woman to the ground and beat the crap out of her. The witch squeaked, but before Regan could get her hands on her, the cur was shoving the terrified woman behind his back.</p><p>\u201cNot without my pretty little wolf.\u201d He held out a slender hand. \u201cCome with me, Regan. That\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll ever get your hands on Culligan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me where he is and I\u2019ll join you later,\u201d she countered.</p> <p>\u201cNo deal. You either let me take you to him now, or you\u2019ll never find him.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her hands. \u201cHow do I...\u201d</p><p>There was a rustle as Jagr stirred on the hard ground, clearly shaking off whatever spell had hit him.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Without warning, the cur reached out to grasp her arm, his charming expression hardening to one of ugly anger. \u201cYou just ran out of time, bitch. You\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime,\u201d Regan hissed, yanking her arm free and taking a swing at the arrogant cur.</p><p>The man ducked, his fist hitting her in the center of the stomach before she could react. Regan grunted as the air was knocked from her lungs, but rather than battling against the painful momentum, she allowed it to take her to the ground, falling next to Jagr\u2019s legs.</p><p>She\u2019d barely hit the dirt when the cur was on top of her, one fist catching her on the side of the head, the other grabbing her hair as he tried to yank her back on her feet.</p><p>Blinking back the wave of dizziness, Regan grimly reached out for Jagr\u2019s leg. She\u2019d been battered enough times not to be distracted by a bit of pain. Not even when her hair was being pulled out by the roots.</p> <p>Hissing in fury, the cur wrapped his hand around Regan\u2019s throat, squeezing her windpipe as he tried to force her to her feet. Regan gritted her teeth, aiming a kick at his knee as she ran her hand down Jagr\u2019s leg to his boot.</p><p>The attacker howled in pain as her heel connected with his kneecap with a sickening crack, but his fingers only tightened on her throat.</p><p>Regan struggled to breathe, her fingers at last closing around the dagger Jagr had tucked into his boot. Jerking it from the hidden sheath, she slashed at the arm holding her captive.</p><p>The silver blade slid easily through flesh and muscle, scraping against the bone as the cur abruptly leaped backward, loosening his crushing grip on her throat.</p><p>Holding his arm, the man glared at her with a murderous fury before a shimmer of energy swirled about his muscular body, and he shifted. An echo of power tingled through Regan\u2019s blood as she watched the handsome face elongate, his clothes shredding as his body twisted and altered, at last becoming the shape of a huge wolflike creature with dark fur and gleaming red eyes.</p><p>Regan flowed to her feet, prepared for the imminent attack.</p><p>An attack that never came.</p><p>Even as Regan planted her feet and held the dagger at the ready, there was a low growl from beside her and Jagr was suddenly looming like an avenging angel behind her shoulder.</p><p>The cur snarled, snapping his teeth, but he wasn\u2019t so far gone as to believe he could battle a massive, infuriated vampire. Even one who\u2019d been so recently wounded.</p><p>For just a moment they were frozen in a strange tableau, the violence trembling in the air, prepared to explode at the first movement.</p><p>Regan ridiculously found herself holding her breath, her gaze glued on the cur who remained poised to pounce. A mistake in the end. While the cur flashed his considerable fangs and rumbled deep in his throat, it was the witch who took matters into her own hands.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>Raising her arms, she muttered a low chant. Jagr cursed, and with a sharp motion knocked Regan to the side. A split second too late as the bright light flared, and a savage pain exploded inside Regan\u2019s head.</p><p>Jagr carried his slender burden through the silent streets and up the bluff to the hidden cave. Consumed with worry, he made no effort to control his icy power that flowed through the darkness and sent a feeling of cold dread through the hapless citizens of Hannibal.</p><p>What did he care? Let the humans stir uneasily in their beds, and the lesser demons flee the area in terror. His only concern was finding the gargoyle, and reviving Regan.</p><p>Easily sensing the tiny demon, Jagr slipped through the opening of the cave, already braced for Levet\u2019s shriek of horror as he settled Regan\u2019s unconscious form in the center of the hard floor.</p><p>\u201cRegan.\u201d Wings flapping and tail twitching, Levet hurried to Regan\u2019s side. \u201cWhat did you do to her, you undead reptile?\u201d</p><p>Moving to the back of the cave, Jagr retrieved his long leather duster to carefully drape over Regan\u2019s too-still form. Then, kneeling on the dirt floor, he grasped one of her slender hands.</p><p>\u201cShe was hit by a spell.\u201d He stabbed his companion with a fierce glare. \u201cRemove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...\u201d Levet swallowed his question as he was nearly tumbled backward by a blast of Jagr\u2019s icy power. Instead, he closed his eyes and touched a gnarled finger to Regan\u2019s forehead. \u201cHuman witch. A defensive spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for CSI bullshit,\u201d Jagr snarled. \u201cGet rid of the spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacrebleu.\u201d Levet snapped open his eyes. \u201cI have to know what magic was used to reverse it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, it was a human witch. Now get on with it.\u201d Jagr pointed a warning finger in the gargoyle\u2019s ugly face. \u201cAnd Levet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep in mind that if you make a mistake, it\u2019ll be your last.\u201d</p><p>Levet narrowed his gaze, the fierce pride of his ancestors suddenly shimmering in the gray depths.</p><p>\u201cI would stick a dagger in my own heart before I would harm Darcy\u2019s sister,\u201d he swore. \u201cNow shut up, and let me take care of her.\u201d</p><p>Jagr clenched his jaw against the fury that battered through him with brutal force.</p><p>The night had been a disaster.</p><p>Being trapped in the burning RV. Allowing himself to be knocked unconscious by a witch, a human witch, so Regan was forced to battle their attackers on her own. And being too slow to protect her against the spell that now held her in its grip.</p><p>A major screw-up from start to finish.</p><p>And it was Regan who was suffering for his failure.</p><p>Keeping his gaze trained on Regan\u2019s pale face, he paid scant attention as Levet muttered beneath his breath and occasionally waved his hands, but he recognized the moment the spell was broken.</p><p>It was in the easing of her body, and the soft sigh that fluttered through her parted lips. Levet rocked back on his heels, his wings drooping with weariness.</p><p>\u201cI have removed the spell, but she will need a considerable amount of sleep to heal from the damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019ll heal? Completely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>The tightness constricting his unbeating heart lessened, but it didn\u2019t disappear. Regan would heal, but those who wanted to hurt her remained alive.</p><p>For now.</p><p>Pressing her fingers to his lips, Jagr gently settled her hand on her chest that rose and fell with assuring regularity. Then ignoring the pain that lingered from the witch\u2019s blast, Jagr surged to his feet.</p><p>A voice of reason whispered in the back of his mind that he should be returning to the charred RV. Not only was there the hope that the wounds Regan had managed to inflict on the cur would overcome the witch\u2019s ability to mask his scent, but he needed to make sure that his own trail back to the cave was properly covered.</p><p>Reason, however, didn\u2019t mean squat while his protective instincts were in full roar. There was no way he was leaving Regan while she was unconscious and completely vulnerable.</p><p>No way in hell.</p><p>\u201cLevet.\u201d With a narrowed gaze, he motioned toward the wary gargoyle. \u201cI have a little task for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>Regan wasn\u2019t certain how long she waged her battle with the clinging darkness. The thick shroud was nothing if not tenacious. But then again, so was she. (Some, especially a gorgeous Visigoth chief, might even claim she was stubborn as hell.)</p><p>Refusing to admit defeat, she shredded through the unconsciousness that held her captive, her senses slowly tingling back to life, though her lids remained too heavy to lift. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was lying on a hard dirt floor. The cave, no doubt. She could smell cool, damp air and only a trace of gargoyle, as if Levet were no longer near. And overall, the cool, exotic scent of power that could only belong to Jagr.</p><p>He was near. Keeping watch over her.</p><p>Warmth flowed through her, banishing the lingering pain and bringing an odd sense of peace.</p> <p>Peace?</p><p>From an arrogant vampire who thought he could put a leash on her?</p><p>Christ, she was mental.</p><p>Wrenching her eyes open, Regan glanced around the torch-lit chamber, assuring herself that she was safely tucked in the cave and not in the hands of the curs. Or worse, back in that damned silver cage.</p><p>Always assuming that the hideous thing survived the fire.</p> <p>Confident she was in no immediate danger, Regan pushed herself to her feet, relieved when she didn\u2019t fall flat on her face. Or even stumble\u2014much.</p><p>Running her fingers through her hair, she glanced around the deepening shadows. The cool wash of power that charged the air assured her that Jagr was near, but his considerable bulk was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>So either he\u2019d used his vampire tricks to wrap himself in darkness, or he was in one of the attached caverns.</p><p>She briefly hesitated.</p><p>Pride told her that there was nothing keeping her in the cave. She could walk out the front entrance and continue her search for Culligan. Or if she were truly smart, she could hop on the nearest bus and simply disappear.</p><p>No imps, no Weres, no annoyingly gorgeous vampires...</p> <p>Pride, however, wasn\u2019t in control of her feet. Instead of leading her out of the cave, they headed toward the openings at the back.</p><p>Ducking her head to avoid the low archway, she slipped into the cramped space that offered a natural cistern. As she straightened, she was prepared to find Jagr. His power was tangible this close. What she hadn\u2019t expected was to find him stark naked as he rose from the shallow water, tossing his wet hair over his massive shoulders.</p><p>The world stopped.</p><p>Or at least the little corner where Regan was standing.</p><p>Christ. She\u2019d already accepted he was a magnificent specimen. The glorious mane of golden hair. The proud, masculine beauty of features. The relentless intelligence in the ice-blue eyes.</p><p>But stripped of his clothing, he was...holy moly.</p><p>Raw power molded into thick muscles and sinew were the only words that came to mind. Enough to halt the heart of any woman.</p><p>Briefly lost in the sheer perfection of his body, it took a moment before Regan\u2019s avid gaze focused enough to realize that the smooth beauty of his ivory skin had been cruelly marred by a series of crisscrossing scars that ran from his chest to his groin.</p> <p>Shocked as much by the pain that savaged her heart as by the sight of his gruesome injuries, Regan slowly lifted her eyes, clashing with the ice-blue gaze.</p><p>As always, his expression was impossible to read, but Regan wasn\u2019t stupid. Jagr would have sensed the moment she awakened. Which meant he could easily have covered himself before she stumbled across him.</p><p>Vampires weren\u2019t modest, but they abhorred any deformity. The scars would be a source of humiliation for such a demon.</p><p>So why had he revealed them to her?</p><p>And why now?</p><p>Struggling to clear her tangled thoughts, Regan forced a breath past her tight throat, her gaze shifting to the rippling water.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to hang some sort of sign if you intend to shower in a coed cave?\u201d</p><p>There was a rustle, and covertly glancing out the corner of her eye, Regan watched Jagr tug on a pair of faded jeans, pulling up the zipper but leaving the button undone.</p><p>Yow.</p><p>Her mouth went dry. And it had nothing to do with his scars.</p><p>Did all men have such large...man parts?</p><p>And were they supposed to make a woman pant like a hound in heat?</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he demanded, prowling until he stood directly before her.</p><p>\u201cHeadache, dry mouth, hair from hell.\u201d With effort, she lifted her head to meet his guarded gaze. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost a day.\u201d</p><p>Frustration simmered deep in her gut. At this rate she would be signed up for AARP by the time she managed to track down Culligan.</p><p>\u201cCrap. I remember crashing out of the RV and being attacked by that cur...then everything\u2019s a blank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe human.\u201d His tone was clipped, icy. \u201cShe hit you with a spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch. Is she dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You managed to injure the cur, but they both escaped.\u201d</p><p>Regan grimaced. She didn\u2019t have to ask to know that Jagr had chosen to carry her to safety rather than slaughter the cur and witch. Or even to capture them so they could be questioned.</p><p>The knowledge should have infuriated her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need his protection. She certainly hadn\u2019t asked for it.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t infuriated.</p><p>She was stupidly pleased. As if she wanted to have someone concerned for her welfare.</p><p>Dangerous, Regan. Very, very dangerous.</p><p>As dangerous as wanting to run her hands over the scarred skin of his chest to prove they did nothing to lessen his fierce beauty.</p><p>Her tongue had touched her dry lips when she abruptly realized she had been staring at that wide, delicious chest for far too long. Wrenching her gaze back to his eyes, she felt a blush stain her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI...wonder what a witch would be doing with a pack of curs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he rudely interrupted, stepping close enough so that she was forced to tilt back her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what you\u2019re wondering. Is it?\u201d His voice was cool, detached. \u201cIf you want to know, just ask.\u201d</p><p>With a start of astonishment, Regan realized that Jagr had mistakenly assumed her preoccupation with his scars was crass curiosity. Not...fascination.</p><p>Two very different things.</p><p>Of course, curiosity seemed the wiser course when she was alone in a cave with a half-naked vampire she suddenly wanted to lick from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that vampires could scar,\u201d she muttered the most obvious question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a natural process.\u201d His eyes darkened with an ancient fury. \u201cIt takes savage effort and twisted perseverance to permanently mar a vampire\u2019s skin. It\u2019s certainly not for the faint of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would...\u201d Her hand lifted to press against her heart. \u201cOh, my God, you were tortured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTortured and then starved so my body could not heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree centuries.\u201d</p><p>Her gut twisted in horrified sympathy. Three hundred years of endless torture? How had he survived? And more importantly, how had he survived with his sanity intact?</p><p>Christ, she couldn\u2019t even comprehend the strength it must have taken.</p><p>And she had bitched at him for swinging from hot to cold?</p><p>He should have been a raving lunatic.</p><p>\u201cWas it a demon?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>His lips twisted in a humorless smile. \u201cA vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez.\u201d She slowly shook her head. \u201cSo the rumors are true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCulligan was twitchy as hell whenever he had to approach the local vampire clan and pay tribute for doing business in their territory.\u201d Her gaze skimmed over the thick scars. \u201cHe claimed that vampires are vicious beasts who will slaughter anyone, even each other.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, and Regan wished he hadn\u2019t. The ripple of muscles beneath that ivory skin made things twitch and tingle in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cAny creature can be vicious, especially Weres, but vampires have a particularly exquisite talent for terror and pain.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze was jerked upward at the implication in his cold words.</p><p>\u201cThey tortured you for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly hearing my screams provided entertainment for my captors, but I was tortured for revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Jagr watched the predictable astonishment ripple over Regan\u2019s beautiful features. Ah, if only his own emotions were so easy to analyze.</p><p>For centuries, he\u2019d refused to speak of his endless torture. Most of his brothers sensed the violence of his past, and Viper knew that Jagr\u2019s torturer had been a vampire, but nothing more. And none were stupid enough to ask questions.</p><p>So why had he deliberately forced this confrontation?</p><p>And it had been deliberate.</p><p>He could easily have covered his scars before she entered the back cavern. There had been no need for her to ever suspect the truth.</p><p>And even now he left them exposed, as if daring her to react to the ugly testament to his past.</p><p>So...why?</p><p>Thankfully Regan managed to recover her voice before he could consider his motives too deeply. They no doubt were something that should remain a mystery.</p><p>\u201cYou were tortured for three centuries, and you don\u2019t remember why?\u201d she husked, the sympathy shimmering in her beautiful eyes not nearly so repulsive as it should have been.</p><p>\u201cWhen a human is turned into a vampire, they have no memory of their previous life. My sins were committed while I was still a Visigoth chief.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey must have been doozies.\u201d</p><p>Jagr shuddered. It didn\u2019t matter how many centuries passed, he would never forget the vampire who had held him captive.</p><p>Kesi had been a member of the Egyptian royalty before being turned, and she had retained all the proud beauty of her ancestors. The dark almond-shaped eyes, the smoothly burnished skin, the sleek black hair that had flowed like a curtain of satin down her slender back.</p> <p>Ah, yes, she had been lovely.</p><p>And as poisonous as an asp.</p><p>She might have captured him in the name of revenge, but she had kept him out of a twisted, obsessive need to inflict pain. He hadn\u2019t been her only victim in her private pits of hell.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire who turned me claimed that I led my clan into the local lair and slaughtered a dozen vampires, including her mate,\u201d he explained, pleased as always by the thought that he had dealt Kesi a painful blow, even if he couldn\u2019t remember it. \u201cUnfortunately, I was captured during the raid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t just kill you. Why make you a vampire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously you missed the Saw movies. Humans are far too fragile to survive more than the vanilla brand of torture. To be truly creative, you need a creature that can endure pain. And, of course, there\u2019s always the bonus of making me immortal, so my punishment could last an eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d She sucked in a sharp breath, her eyes shimmering with tears. \u201cHow did you escape?\u201d</p><p>The memory of blood-soaked tunnels filled with vampires and demons he\u2019d ripped apart with his bare hands was washed away by the glitter of tears trickling down her cheeks.</p><p>Bemused by the odd phenomenon, Jagr cupped her face in his hands and wiped the dampness with his thumbs.</p><p>\u201cI killed them,\u201d he murmured, his voice thickening with something other than ancient anger.</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cThey weren\u2019t nearly so pleased.\u201d</p><p>A silence descended as Regan studied him with a searching gaze. Jagr didn\u2019t flinch. He\u2019d always feared that confessing the truth would make him feel vulnerable, exposed. Instead, he felt...cleansed.</p><p>Perhaps it was Regan\u2019s sweet tears that washed away a portion of the bitterness that festered in his soul.</p><p>At last, she sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t believe you when you said you understood. You do.\u201d Her lips curved in a watery smile. \u201cMore than anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t forced me to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Jagr hid his flare of wry amusement. If she wanted to believe that was the only reason he hadn\u2019t tossed her over his shoulder and hauled her to Chicago, then so be it.</p><p>\u201cThe thirst for revenge is a powerful force,\u201d he agreed. \u201cNothing will keep you in Chicago while Culligan lives. I would just have to come hunting you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunting?\u201d The emerald eyes darkened, then shockingly, she lifted a hand to lightly trace one of the scars that marred his skin. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m your prey?\u201d</p><p>With a hiss, Jagr jerked from the searing temptation of her touch. By the fires of hell, what was she doing? Even a complete virgin should be able to sense that his legendary control wasn\u2019t so legendary. Not when it came to this emerald-eyed Were.</p><p>\u201cRegan,\u201d he warned softly.</p><p>Deliberately she followed his retreat, her hand once again boldly stroking over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He grasped her wrist, his fangs lengthening as scalding pleasure poured through him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t toy with me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to tug her wrist from his grim grip. Instead, she simply lifted her free hand and continued to torment him with light, searching fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you show me your scars?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Jagr shivered, his body swiftly going up in flames. \u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game, little one.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze squarely, ignoring his warning as she stepped close enough to wrap him in midnight jasmine.</p><p>\u201cDid you think they would bother me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly what they represent.\u201d Leaning forward, she trailed her lips over a thick scar. \u201cThe fact that you were forced to endure such pain for so long.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s fingers loosened on her wrist, his thumb brushing the rapid beat of her pulse. Fine. Obviously she wanted to play. Already he could catch the scent of her arousal perfuming the air.</p><p>Who was he to be the voice of reason?</p><p>Soon enough she would discover you couldn\u2019t dance with the devil without getting burned.</p><p>Sliding his hand up the elegant sweep of her back, he grasped the tender nape of her neck.</p><p>\u201cLike you, little one, I survived,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd for the first time, in a very long time, I\u2019m very glad that I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she whispered, her head bending forward to brush her lips over his chest.</p><p>Convulsively, his arms wrapped about her, tugging her tight against his hard body.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand what you\u2019re starting, Regan?\u201d he rasped, his senses stirring with an intensity that was almost painful.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She trailed her tongue down the dip over his breastbone. \u201cBut I like it. Do you?\u201d</p><p>His soft groan rumbled through the cavern as his hands shifted to cup her hips, compulsively pressing her to his thickening cock.</p><p>\u201cShit, if I liked it any more I would go up in flames,\u201d he muttered, for the first time fully appreciating the powers that had become his when he\u2019d been reborn a vampire.</p><p>He could hear every beat of her heart, feel the finest of tremors that shook her slender body, smell the midnight jasmine of her skin...the temptation of her rich blood.</p><p>His fangs throbbed in concert with his aching erection.</p><p>\u201cI never knew...\u201d She arched back to meet his hungry gaze. \u201cDoes it always feel like this?\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist the sight of that slender neck arched in open invitation, Jagr lowered his head to nibble his way down the satin skin.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he rasped, his voice thick with need. \u201cNever like this.\u201d</p><p>She quivered as his tongue ran a searing path along the line of her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s happening?\u201d Her fingers dug into his upper arms, as if her knees had suddenly become too weak to support her. \u201cOne minute I want to punch you in the nose, or at the very least get a restraining order, and the next...\u201d</p><p>He nipped her earlobe, careful not to break the skin. One overwhelming lust was enough.</p><p>\u201cAnd the next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to strip off my clothes and feel your hands on my skin.\u201d</p><p>Before she could even guess his intention, Jagr grasped the hem of her shirt, and with one smooth jerk had it pulled over her head. She gasped as he tossed it aside and just as easily rid her of the tiny white bra.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d he rasped, his hands moving to cup her breasts with a reverent care.</p><p>By the gods of his mother, she was beautiful. Perfect. Edible.</p><p>His thumbs stroked the rosy tips of her nipples, rumbling in pleasure as the peaks hardened and she shivered with excitement.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cExactly like that.\u201d</p><p>His head lowered, his lips closing over the tip of her breast.</p><p>\u201cAnd like this?\u201d</p><p>Her head dropped back, her hair brushing over his arms that he had wrapped about her like a warm spill of satin.</p><p>\u201cOh...God, yes.\u201d</p><p>Grimly reminding himself of her innocence, Jagr leashed his desperate hunger. Falling on her like a ravaging beast probably wasn\u2019t the best seduction tactic. Not yet.</p><p>Continuing to torment her nipple with his tongue, Jagr deftly slid down the zipper of her jeans, longing for the sensation of her naked body pressed against his. When there was no protest from Regan, he slowly began to peel them downward, lowering himself to his knees as he efficiently tugged off her running shoes and socks before removing the jeans.</p><p>Then, still kneeling, he simply drank in the sight of her.</p><p>Her legs were long and slender. Her waist narrow enough he knew he could span it with his hands. But it was the firm muscles that rippled beneath her smooth skin that sent a jolt of excitement through him.</p><p>Well, that, and the tiny triangle of silk that was at his direct eye level.</p><p>His fangs were fully extended, ready and willing to cut through the delicate material to reveal the sweet treasure beneath.</p><p>Once again, however, he restrained his sharp-edged need.</p><p>Instead, he slowly worked his way back to his feet, trailing his lips up the curve of her stomach, the hollow between her breasts, and the frantic pulse at the base of her neck.</p><p>She groaned, her lips parting willingly as he at last claimed her mouth in a demanding kiss.</p><p>\u201cJagr,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cYou smell of midnight jasmine. I could drown in that scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smell of power,\u201d she whispered against his lips. \u201cLike a strike of lightning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes lightning have a scent?\u201d he teased, his hands compulsively caressing the curve of her back. He could have her in his arms for an eternity and still it would not be long enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because this is where she belongs.</p><p>Where she will always belong.</p><p>The disturbing words floated through his mind before he could halt them.</p> <p>\u201cRaw energy,\u201d she retorted, moaning as his tongue traced the edge of her lower lip. \u201cDangerous...unpredictable...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can be very predictable, little one,\u201d he corrected, grasping her hand to gently place it against his pulsing arousal.</p><p>Her breath caught as her fingers traced his hard cock straining against his zipper, her eyes darkening with awareness of her feminine power.</p><p>Desire clawed deep within him. He wanted to make this a slow, delicate seduction, but the thought of being buried deep within her was swiftly undermining his control. At heart, he was still a barbarian. A wild, pagan coupling was becoming a more viable option by the second.</p><p>Regan couldn\u2019t have missed the sudden heat that filled the cavern, or the tension that clenched his muscles, but as if deliberately seeking to push Jagr over the edge, her searching fingers slowly tugged down the zipper of his jeans, releasing the heavy thrust of his erection.</p> <p>\u201cGods,\u201d Jagr managed to croak, shuddering at the hot surge of desire.</p><p>\u201cDo you like this?\u201d she demanded, lightly skimming her fingers down his thick length.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he growled, his hands clutching her hips as he sought to remain in control of his building need.</p><p>\u201cAnd this?\u201d she whispered, her hand moving steadily lower.</p><p>\u201cRegan...\u201d He muttered a curse, his eyes clenching shut as he battled to hold off the surging climax. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She discovered his tender sack and lightly squeezed. \u201cAnd this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he choked, grasping her wrist to halt the exquisite torment.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Forcing his eyes open, he met the glittering emerald gaze. \u201cBecause just your touch is enough to make me explode.\u201d</p><p>The sweet scent of her arousal deepened at his blunt words. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad?\u201d His sharp laugh echoed through the darkness. \u201cBy the saints, I would walk through the fires of hell for the feel of your hands on my body.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved in a smile of pure temptation.</p><p>A natural born Eve.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you stopping me?\u201d</p> <p>Good question.</p><p>Oh, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for him to deny himself pleasure.</p><p>His lair was a cold, barren series of cement tunnels beneath an abandoned warehouse. It had none of the luxuries that most vampires craved. His only concession to comfort was his vast collection of books, his high-tech computer, and his plasma TVs.</p><p>And certainly he never allowed himself to wallow in the self-indulgent pursuit of physical pleasure that many demons craved.</p><p>He never questioned his monkish existence. What did it matter if it was an obsessive need to feel in control after years of being in the power of others? Or some obscure hatred for being turned into the same monster as those who\u2019d tortured him? Or even a boorish distaste for the company of others.</p><p>In this moment, he wanted to plunge into the swirling sensations that heated his blood to a fever pitch. He wanted to...feel. To melt the ice that had held him captive since he\u2019d left those blood-soaked caves.</p><p>He wanted Regan in any way she would have him.</p><p>It was obvious that despite her innocence, this Were possessed a playful curiosity. Why not allow her to explore her potent effect on his body?</p><p>They had an eternity to satisfy any number of fantasies.</p><p>Endless, decadent, wicked fantasies.</p><p>With a slow, deliberate motion, Jagr released her wrist at the same moment he branded her lips with a searing kiss. She readily opened her mouth to allow the invasion of his thrusting tongue, her hand moving on him with awkward but shockingly blissful strokes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d suddenly lowered her stiff barriers. Why she\u2019d accepted the passion that had pulsed between them since their first meeting. And to be honest, he didn\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>Fate was rarely kind to him. He intended to take advantage while it was willing to smile on him.</p><p>Dragging his lips over the heated skin of her cheeks, he nuzzled the hollow just below her ear, his fingers trailing a determined path down the sleek line of her waist. She shivered in response, her heart pounding so loudly that Jagr didn\u2019t need to be a vampire to hear it.</p><p>He used her telltale responses to guide his touch, intent on her pleasure even as his hips began to pump forward as her strokes became more assured, forceful.</p><p>Oh...hell.</p><p>In over a thousand years, nothing had ever felt so good.</p><p>Reaching the edge of her panties, Jagr ripped the fragile silk away, well beyond subtle.</p><p>He wanted to explore the damp heat he could already sense. He wanted to feel her tremble in need. He wanted to hear those tiny cries of pleasure as he made her come.</p><p>Allowing his hand to slide over the curve of her thigh, Jagr gently parted her legs to allow his fingers access to her most tender flesh.</p><p>Growling low in his throat, he parted her folds and discovered her moist and eager for his touch.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d she muttered, her fingers unwittingly tightening on his erection.</p><p>Not that he intended to protest. Instead, he muttered soft words of encouragement as he caressed her with a growing urgency.</p><p>His fangs ached, his hunger roaring through him, but Jagr ignored the burning need to take her blood. The blissful pressure clenching his lower body was swiftly reaching the point of no return. He was fiercely determined to ensure her pleasure before claiming his own.</p><p>Dipping his head lower, Jagr sucked the tip of her nipple in his mouth, using his tongue to tease and torment her as his finger dipped into her slick channel. She whimpered softly, her hand stroking him with greater speed in response to his persistent caress.</p><p>She was close.</p><p>So close.</p><p>Her breath halted, her back arching, and with a soft cry she shuddered in completion, her last lingering tug of his erection causing him to shout as the sensations gathered and the world exploded in pleasure.</p><p>Folding her close, Jagr had to smile.</p><p>Maybe Regan hadn\u2019t been wrong when she claimed she smelled lightning.</p><p>The gods knew he\u2019d just been struck.</p><p>Floating on a little cloud of paradise, Regan made no effort to struggle as Jagr swept her off her feet and waded into the chilled water that ran through the back of the cavern. Not even when he gently but thoroughly scrubbed her with the expensive soap and shampoo he\u2019d obviously brought from Chicago.</p><p>For the first time in her existence, she felt...deliciously pampered.</p><p>Just like a normal woman who was being spoiled by her current lover.</p><p>Lover.</p><p>Regan shivered. Yes...lovers.</p><p>Oh, she wasn\u2019t stupid (okay, that might be debatable), but she understood the basic principles of intercourse, and the fact she was still technically a virgin. Who could watch Pay Per View and not have waaaay too much info?</p><p>Still, it had been...</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Yeah, that about summed it up.</p><p>And while a part of her wanted to blame her bout of insanity on mere pity for a creature who had suffered such agony, she couldn\u2019t make it stick. Not when she\u2019d wanted to have her way with the gorgeous vamp since his orgasmic bite in that hotel room.</p><p>There, she\u2019d admitted it, if only to herself.</p><p>She might not understand why a vampire who was arrogant, aggravating, and only with her because he\u2019d been commanded by his mighty Anasso to protect her, could make her entire body quiver whenever he was near, but there it was.</p><p>And obviously the quiver factor didn\u2019t disappear even after a mind-blowing climax.</p><p>With every sweep of his hands, tiny jolts of awareness tingled through her, stirring the wondrous lethargy that held her captive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd no one\u2019s allowed to be the strong silent type except you?\u201d she demanded, keeping her eyes closed.

Then leaving her to dry off with his discarded shirt, he pulled on the faded jeans, a clean black T-shirt (that stretched with oh-my-God results over his wide chest), and a pair of heavy biker boots before disappearing into the outer cave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Regan had barely managed to wipe off the dampness and pull on her bra and panties when he returned, his brows pulled into a frown as he held out the bags of her new clothing.</p><p>\u201cI took half the store and there isn\u2019t one decent shirt in there.\u201d</p><p>Well, so much for the considerate lover who had bathed her with such tender care, she wryly acknowledged.</p> <p>Yanking the bags from his hands, Regan pulled on a pair of hip hugging jeans, then dug through the mound of shirts to pull out a pretty yellow knit top with a scooped neckline and lace about the hem that barely reached her belly button.</p><p>Pulling it over her head, she smoothed it down and regarded him with a challenging smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my shirts?\u201d</p><p>He scowled as his gaze studied the tiny top that clung to her curves.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve all been chopped off at the waist and cut so low you might as well not even bother with them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, the dark ages of keeping women covered from head to toe are long over, chief.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd what business is it of yours, anyway?\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest, appearing big and dangerous and...Christ, so heartstoppingly beautiful it made her mouth water.</p><p>Damn vampire.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d His words came to an abrupt halt at the same moment that Regan froze\u2014an unmistakable scent floating through the air. \u201cWere,\u201d he growled, turning with impossible grace to flow into the outer cave.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore,\u201d Regan clarified, her hackles rising as she followed with less grace and a great deal more stomping.</p><p>Stepping into the large cave, Regan ignored Jagr\u2019s attempt to keep her hidden behind his massive form, instead moving so she could have an uninterrupted view as Salvatore Giuliani boldly stepped through the entrance.</p> <p>As always, the King of Weres was elegantly attired in a designer suit, this one in a slate gray with a matching silk tie and pale ivory shirt. His thick black hair was pulled into a tail at the nape of his neck, and his sensuous Latin features were a polished bronze. It was his golden eyes, however, that caught and held attention. They were eyes that held a ruthless intelligence and lethal willingness to do whatever necessary to achieve his goal.</p><p>Including tossing her aside like a piece of non-recyclable trash.</p><p>Strolling arrogantly into the cave, Salvatore deliberately sniffed the air, the wicked glint in his eyes revealing his awareness of their earlier passion.</p><p>\u201cAm I intruding?\u201d he mocked, his voice accented with a hint of Italian. His lips twitched as Jagr regarded him in a frigid silence, his gaze shifting to Regan. \u201cAh, Regan. As exquisite as ever.\u201d</p><p>Regan didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d she rasped, launching herself across the cave with a speed that caught both men off guard. Slamming into the startled Were, she knocked him flat on his back and perched on top of his chest, glaring into the too handsome face. \u201cYou let Culligan get away.\u201d</p><p>The golden eyes glowed, but it was pure male arousal rather than anger that stirred his inner wolf.</p><p>\u201cCristo, you are magnificent. Such a pity you can\u2019t bear me an heir. You would have been a worthy mate.\u201d His smile was slow, seductive. \u201cOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean we couldn\u2019t enjoy each other\u2019s company. You haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve been bedded by a pureblood...\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes narrowed in disgust. \u201cEven think about it and I\u2019ll castrate you.\u201d</p><p>His husky laugh echoed through the cave as he gave a mighty shove and rolled Regan beneath him. Now on top, he smiled into her startled eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think about it long.</p><p>The cold blast of fury was the only warning before Jagr had Salvatore by the throat, and was shoving him against the wall of the cave.</p><p>\u201cTouch her again, dog, and they\u2019ll be finding your body parts from here to New Orleans,\u201d he informed Salvatore in artic tones.</p><p>The golden eyes blazed. \u201cRelease me, vampire, or you\u2019ll have a war on your hands Styx does not want.\u201d</p><p>Indifferent to the threat, Jagr leaned forward, whispering something too low for Regan to catch before abruptly stepping back and releasing his death-hold on the Were.</p><p>Salvatore growled low in his throat, but oddly didn\u2019t attack. Instead, he smoothed his hands down his Gucci suit and ensured his tie was still immaculate.</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned how much I hate vampires?\u201d he purred with sweet venom.</p><p>Regan rose to her feet, wondering what the hell Jagr had whispered in Salvatore\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Jagr demanded. \u201cI called you to Hannibal to take care of your rabid curs, not to socialize.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore met the ancient vampire\u2019s glare without flinching. \u201cI\u2019m here because there\u2019s no proof there are any curs in the area, despite the fact my men have searched for hours. A suspicious Were might begin to conjecture that this is a trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a trap to kill a Were, king or not.\u201d</p><p>Regan shivered, feeling as if she were standing in the middle of a brewing thunderstorm.</p><p>Not surprising.</p><p>Salvatore was throwing off the natural heat of a furious pureblood, while Jagr\u2019s power was a frigid blast.</p><p>Just like a hot- and cold-weather front clashing together.</p><p>\u201cChrist, I\u2019m choking on the testosterone in here,\u201d she muttered, shifting to stand between the two men. About as smart as stepping between a rabid wolf and feral tiger, but nothing would get done while the two played \u201cwho has the biggest balls\u201d game. She regarded Salvatore with an annoyed glare. \u201cYou didn\u2019t find the curs because they\u2019re being concealed by a witch\u2019s spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you actually seen any of them?\u201d the Were demanded, his gaze tracking Jagr as the vamp pressed his large body against Regan\u2019s back and wrapped a possessive arm about her waist.</p><p>Regan swallowed a sigh. It always looked so sexy in the movies to have two men snarling and snapping over a woman. Now she just wanted to punch them both in the nose.</p><p>\u201cOne attacked us last night,\u201d she said.</p><p>Salvatore stiffened in surprise. \u201cA moment.\u201d</p><p>Turning toward the entrance of the cave, the Were gave a low whistle. Immediately, two curs entered the cave. One a huge, hulking cur with a shaved head and pit bull face. The other smaller, leaner with short blond hair and a startling intelligent expression.</p><p>In tandem they fell to their knees and pressed their foreheads to the hard ground.</p><p>\u201cYes, your majesty?\u201d The bald-headed cur spoke for the groveling pair. \u201cHow may we serve?\u201d</p><p>Regan gagged as she turned toward Salvatore. \u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to be freaking kidding me. I thought Culligan was full of himself.\u201d</p><p>A smile curved the Were\u2019s lips. Smug bastard.</p><p>\u201cHess has lived among the hunting grounds north of here. It\u2019s possible he will recognize your attacker if you can describe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do better than that if you have a pencil and paper,\u201d she said.</p><p>Salvatore snapped his fingers. \u201cMax, go back down to the Humvee and find what the lady needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sire.\u201d</p><p>Jumping to his feet, the young man charged out of the cave at full speed. Regan shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou really get off on the whole royalty thing, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet.\u201d</p><p>His smile softened to a wicked invitation. \u201cBut not as good as it is to be the King\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>Jagr tightened his arm around Regan\u2019s waist, his power making the hair on the nape of her neck stand on end.</p><p>\u201cCareful, dog,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cFeeling a little territorial, vamp?\u201d Salvatore mocked.</p><p>\u201cRegicidal.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>A tense silence descended as the two predators huffed and puffed and did all the stupid things males did when they weren\u2019t allowed to kill one another.</p><p>Regan rubbed her hands over her arms, shivering at the painful prickles that brushed over her skin. Holy crap. Things could go nuclear in a hurry, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing she could do about it.</p><p>At last the gathering storm was broken by the return of Max, who had barely broken a sweat despite his swift run up and down the high bluff.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Regan muttered, struggling free of Jagr\u2019s arm to snatch the notebook and pencil from the cur.</p><p>Vividly aware of the tension sizzling between the males, Regan moved to perch on a flat rock. Christ, the air in the cave was so thick she could barely breathe. And it didn\u2019t help that the two curs had moved to flank Salvatore as if preparing for a battle. Why didn\u2019t they just wave a red flag in front of the ancient, lethal vampire?</p><p>Morons.</p><p>Clearing her mind, Regan forced herself to concentrate on the memory of the cur that had attacked them. What was the point in fretting over Jagr and Salvatore? If they wanted to rip each other apart, then so be it.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to play Super Nanny.</p><p>Sliding the pencil across the paper, Regan lost herself in her sketch. She was no Picasso (well, who was?), but over the years she\u2019d discovered the trick of capturing an image with the minimum of strokes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had completed the basic outline of the cur\u2019s face and was working on the narrow goatee when she felt Jagr move to stand at her side, his power carefully muted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect,\u201d he murmured, a hint of surprise in his voice. \u201cYou have a true talent.\u201d</p><p>Regan shrugged. \u201cNot talent, just practice. There\u2019s not a lot to do in a cramped cage besides watch TV, read, and sketch.\u201d With a few more strokes of her pencil, Regan was satisfied and held out the notebook toward Salvatore. \u201cHere.\u201d</p> <p>Salvatore moved forward with the hulking Hess at his side.</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize him?\u201d the Were demanded of his companion.</p><p>The cur snarled in recognition, his eyes glowing. \u201cDuncan.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore frowned. \u201cWhat do you know of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a disciple of Caine.\u201d</p> <p>Shock rippled over the Were\u2019s handsome face. \u201cCristo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this Caine?\u201d Jagr demanded.</p><p>Salvatore snapped his teeth, his thoughts obviously distracted. \u201cInternal Were business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt becomes my business when one of your hounds nearly barbeques me,\u201d Jagr snapped. \u201cWhy are they trying to kill Regan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jagr stepped toward Salvatore, his body coiled to attack, his fangs glinting in the dark.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t try me, Were.\u201d</p><p>Regan shivered, but Salvatore merely arched an arrogant brow. Courage or stupidity?</p><p>Impossible to say.</p><p>\u201cYou can flash all the fang you want, vamp, I have no explanation for why the curs would be in Hannibal, or why they would have an interest in Regan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell do you know?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore gritted his teeth, but obviously aware that Jagr was preparing to beat the truth out of him (with as much pain as possible), he abruptly turned to pace across the cave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had reports that a cur by the name of Caine has been gathering curs into a secret society.\u201d</p><p>Regan swallowed a ridiculous urge to laugh. \u201cLike the Masons?\u201d</p> <p>Salvatore continued to pace. \u201cFrom what little information I\u2019ve been able to gather, it\u2019s more like a fatwa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA holy war?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cA handful of curs have convinced themselves that the Weres are deliberately diluting their powers.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Being raised in a silver cage with only occasional encounters with other demons, she was remarkably ignorant of her people. Something that had never bothered her until a bunch of mangy curs decided to steal Culligan.</p><p>\u201cWhich powers?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Salvatore shrugged. \u201cTheir strength, their ability to control their shifts, their lack of immortality. Nonsense, of course. A cur might take on greater strength and a prolonged existence, but in the end they\u2019re merely a human infected by our bite. They are not resurrected to become a full demon as vampires are.\u201d</p><p>So the curs got a glimpse of glory, only to fall short. Kind of like her.</p><p>A mutant with no real place in the demon-world.</p><p>Who wouldn\u2019t want revenge? Especially if it meant dethroning the smug, overbearing, GQ-addicted King of Weres?</p><p>Of course, Caine of the curs couldn\u2019t be very smart if he thought for a moment a ragtag pack would have any chance against any pureblood, let alone one of Salvatore\u2019s power. And why Duncan would imply they were somehow interested in her...</p><p>Her breath tangled in her throat. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Jagr flowed to her side, as if sensing the outrageous suspicion that flowed through her mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, little one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d With a shake of her head, Regan turned to meet Salvatore\u2019s searching gaze. \u201cThe curs believe a Were could offer them the powers they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, a few idiots are convinced we are deliberately altering the amount of venom in our bites to lessen their abilities. Once I track down Caine, I intend to bring an end to his dangerous claims.\u201d His sensuous lips curved into a terrifying smile. \u201cA painful end.\u201d</p><p>Regan grimaced. \u201cVery Rambo of you, but have you considered the possibility that this Caine has decided to do more than just complain about the fate of curs?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore snorted. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t possess enough followers to strike against the Weres. He prefers to hide in shadows while stirring the seeds of revolution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, maybe the Benedict Arnold routine is just an act.\u201d</p><p>Jagr hissed, reading her mind with unnerving ease. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore frowned, thankfully not capable of rummaging around in her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Regan struggled to put her vague suspicion into words. \u201cIf this Caine truly believes he can transform himself into a Were, why would he bother plotting a fight he can never win? Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to spend his time finding the key to enhancing his gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already gone through the change...\u201d Salvatore bit off his words, his eyes glowing with that eerie fire. \u201cCristo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he believes that he can still get the powers he lacks, what would he need?\u201d Jagr rasped.</p><p>Salvatore toyed with the heavy signet ring on his finger. \u201cIf his theory wasn\u2019t completely illogical, completely unscientific, and completely crazy, I suppose he would need a pureblood.\u201d</p><p>Four pairs of male eyes turned to regard Regan as if she were a nasty bug beneath a microscope.</p><p>\u201cSurely they would need her alive?\u201d Jagr rasped, the edge of ice in his voice assuring Regan he wasn\u2019t nearly so calm as he appeared.</p><p>She was swiftly discovering the stronger his emotions, the deeper he coated them in permafrost.</p><p>\u201cActually, I think they have been trying to take me alive,\u201d Regan admitted, deliberately catching Jagr\u2019s fierce gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s you they want to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine that,\u201d Salvatore drawled.</p><p>Jagr\u2019s attention never wavered from Regan. \u201cHow can you be certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain, but Duncan was trying to convince me to come willingly with him while you were still unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe terrifying Jagr knocked unconscious by a cur?\u201d</p><p>This time Jagr flashed an icy glare toward the provoking Salvatore. \u201cA witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan said that he wanted to keep me safe.\u201d Regan hurriedly headed off yet another squabble between the two. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say what danger I was supposedly in, but it was obvious he was desperate to take me somewhere, no matter what he had to do get me there.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore snarled a low curse. \u201cI look forward to meeting this Duncan. We have a great deal to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Something that might have been frustration hardened Jagr\u2019s beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s all nothing more than speculation. Leaping to conclusions could put Regan in danger. For now, all that matters is that she remain protected.\u201d</p><p>She instinctively bristled at his possessive tone. Okay, she was ready, willing, and able to take advantage of his bodacious body. Why not? She\u2019d been forced into celibacy for too long. And he\u2019d already proven he possessed the sort of skills a woman in rampant lust could appreciate.</p><p>But the last thing she wanted was an overbearing keeper.</p><p>She already had one of those on her list to kill.</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself, thank you very much,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd the only thing I\u2019m interested in is the fact that Duncan claims they have Culligan.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s frustration became a tangible blast of frozen air. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at his flat accusation. \u201cYa think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think when it comes to the imp, you tend to act first and think of the consequences later.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s soft laugh replaced Jagr\u2019s chill with a brush of warm velvet.</p><p>\u201cI see he knows you in more than just the carnal sense, sweet Regan.\u201d</p><p>She tossed him an annoyed frown. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to speak to your king?\u201d he mocked.</p><p>She was about to inform her freaking king she\u2019d talk to him any way she pleased when the sudden entrance of Levet had everyone spinning toward him in shock.</p><p>Ignoring the various guns, daggers, and flashing fangs that were aimed in his direction, Levet waddled forward, his tiny snout twitching.</p><p>\u201cSacrebleu. What\u2019s that stench?\u201d He blatantly glanced toward Salvatore. \u201cOh. Dogs. I should have known.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore merely smiled, reaching out a hand to catch the bristling cur at his side.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Hess. Do you not recall the stunted gargoyle who so kindly led Darcy into our trap?\u201d The smile widened to reveal the white, white teeth. \u201cI never did have the opportunity to offer my thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much of a trap since Darcy is currently the Queen of Vampires, not Weres,\u201d Levet smoothly countered.</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s eyes flashed, but his expression remained mocking. \u201cHer loss.\u201d</p><p>The words had barely tumbled from his lips when there was the distant sound of shattering glass.</p><p>Within the cave everyone stilled, the very air shimmering with a sense of foreboding. Then with a movement that was too swift for Regan to follow, Jagr had launched himself forward, knocking her to the ground and covering her with his large body, as the concussion of an explosion far below rocked the bluff. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jagr ignored Regan\u2019s fists that pounded his chest, as well as her colorful descriptions of what should happen to oversized oafs who tackled hapless women, not willing to move until he was certain that the cave wasn\u2019t on the edge of collapse. Only then did he lift himself high enough to run a searching gaze over Regan\u2019s wriggling body, needing to be certain that she wasn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>Dodging a fist aimed directly at his chin, Jagr flowed to his feet, hiding his smile.</p><p>If she could throw a punch like that, she couldn\u2019t be badly injured.</p> <p>Sensing he might lose a hand if he offered to help her off the ground, Jagr turned to join Salvatore and his curs at the entrance to the cave. He would no doubt pay for his violent instinct to protect Regan, but there had been no choice. He could no more have halted his reaction than he could halt the sun from rising.</p><p>A knowledge he shoved to the back of his mind as he stepped beside Salvatore and studied the expensive Humvee that was now a ball of flame in the parking lot far below.</p><p>\u201cDio,\u201d the Were breathed. \u201cHess. Max. Bring me whoever is responsible.\u201d</p><p>Looking as if they\u2019d been shot from a cannon, the two curs bolted down the steep slope of the bluff, their low growls echoing through the darkness.</p><p>Jagr folded his arms over his chest, not entirely displeased to watch Salvatore\u2019s vehicle go up flames. Not just because of his overly intimate manner toward Regan (although that was reason enough to rip out his filthy heart), but because the Were had wounded Regan when she was at her most vulnerable.</p> <p>The bastard had freed her from the nightmare of Culligan, only to toss her aside when she couldn\u2019t provide him what he desired.</p><p>It was no wonder she found it impossible to trust.</p><p>\u201cYour curs have a peculiar means of welcoming their king.\u201d He studied the burning Humvee. \u201cUnless this is some ritual I\u2019m unaware of?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore ignored the taunt as power rippled beneath his skin. As a pureblood, he was capable of controlling his shifts, but the wolf was obviously struggling to break free.</p><p>\u201cI should have sensed them,\u201d the king rasped, his voice low and thick.</p><p>Jagr grimaced. \u201cThe witch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s starting to wear on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed, but being rid of her is easier said than done. Only the gargoyle can sense her magic, and he seems incapable of tracking her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d There was a snap of angry wings as Levet exited the cave, followed closely by Regan. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s been out tromping through the nasty boonies while you were playing splish-splash with our beautiful guest.\u201d</p><p>Jagr took a second to savor the sudden heat that stained Regan\u2019s cheeks before returning his attention to the gargoyle with a lift of his brow.</p><p>\u201cTromping that obviously led the curs straight back to this lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe they followed Mr. Lord and Master over there. Did you ever think about that?\u201d Levet challenged.</p><p>\u201cIn either case, they\u2019ve left warning that they know Salvatore is in Hannibal. And more importantly, they know this is our lair.\u201d This time he turned to directly meet Regan\u2019s guarded gaze. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer safe here.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore muttered a curse. \u201cI have no pack in the area. I will have to return to St. Louis for reinforcements.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just call them?\u201d Regan demanded.</p><p>\u201cI prefer to give my commands in person. It helps to avoid any confusion.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah, I bet.\u201d</p><p>Jagr frowned. \u201cDo you have a magic-user among them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can negotiate with the local coven.\u201d Salvatore toyed with his heavy signet ring, his expression hard. \u201cUnfortunately, it will take time. Witches are notoriously reluctant to offer their services to demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I?\u201d Levet threw his hands in the air. \u201cChopped gall bladder?\u201d</p><p>Jagr narrowed his gaze, in no mood for the annoying gargoyle. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he means liver,\u201d Regan wryly translated. \u201cChopped liver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGall bladder, liver...whatever.\u201d Levet puffed out his chest. \u201cI am a magic-user. What could a witch do that I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrack the curs? Weave an enchantment to hide our own presence? Ward this cave from intrusion?\u201d Jagr smoothly pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBah, I will find the curs, and if you want an enchantment...\u201d The tiny gargoyle lifted his hands.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jagr and Salvatore bellowed at the same time.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d With a twitch of his tail, Levet was marching down the steep bluff. \u201cYou want curs, I\u2019ll find you curs.\u201d</p><p>Regan spread her annoyed glare between both Jagr and Salvatore as she called out softly.</p><p>\u201cLevet.\u201d</p><p>With a stiff dignity, Levet turned to face her. \u201cOui?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, be careful.\u201d</p><p>The ugly features softened. \u201cFor you, ma cherie, I will take the greatest care. Be assured that I will return in magnificent, vigorous, and virile health.\u201d</p><p>Jagr swallowed his urge to snarl. \u201cYou can return any way you want, but we won\u2019t be here. We have to find a new lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not fear, I will find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my fear,\u201d Jagr muttered.</p><p>Levet blew a raspberry in Jagr\u2019s direction before continuing down the slope.</p><p>\u201cThat creature is an embarrassment to gargoyles everywhere,\u201d Salvatore said with a shake of his head.</p><p>For once, Jagr could actually agree with the Were.</p><p>Not that he was about to admit as much.</p><p>Especially not when he could smell Salvatore\u2019s henchmen approaching.</p><p>The two curs appeared from the woods behind the cave, a matching expression of frustration on their faces.</p><p>\u201cWe followed their footprints to the river, then they disappeared,\u201d the larger, bald-headed Hess grudgingly confessed. \u201cWe searched the area, but there was no sign of them.\u201d</p><p>Jagr clenched his fists in annoyance. He didn\u2019t like being taunted by a pack of worthless dogs.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t have gone far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but without a scent we\u2019re incapable of hunting them.\u201d Salvatore gestured toward his companions. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to be done here. I will return as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Jagr didn\u2019t attempt to halt Salvatore as he disappeared into the surrounding shadows. What good was the Were if he couldn\u2019t track the curs?</p><p>Besides, having two alpha predators in the same territory was never a good idea. Jagr doubted that Styx would be pleased to learn one of his vampires had the pelt of the King of Weres nailed to the wall of his lair.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is going just peachy,\u201d Regan muttered, her damp hair fluttering like strands of silver in the night breeze. \u201cChrist. All I wanted was to find Culligan and kill him, not get mixed up in some stupid war between the curs and the Weres.\u201d</p><p>Jagr reached out to capture one of the silky strands, his expression somber.</p><p>\u201cYou would be safe in Chicago, Regan. Not even this Caine and his renegade pack of curs would be suicidal enough to attack a vampire stronghold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA really stupendous idea if I wanted to be buried alive,\u201d she mocked. \u201cThanks, but no thanks. I\u2019m not exchanging one prison for another.\u201d</p><p>He gave a tug on her hair. \u201cYou would be an honored guest, never a prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure my cell would be something out of the latest episode of Cribs, and my guards would be oh so kind while they explained why it was too dangerous for me to go out alone, or spend a weekend in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted. \u201cYou have a particular desire to visit Las Vegas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a particular desire to go where I want, when I want, without asking for permission.\u201d</p><p>Jagr considered his words as his fingers shifted to brush down the seductive line of her throat. What could he say? There was no way in hell that Styx would allow Regan to come and go as she pleased. At least not as long as there was any threat to her.</p><p>Styx was by nature a control freak, and while Darcy had gone a long way to soften his rigid instincts, he couldn\u2019t change centuries of habit overnight.</p><p>\u201cEven if it puts you in danger?\u201d he at last demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndependence is one thing, Regan, and stubborn foolishness another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you live under the roof of the Anasso?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>His fingers lingered on the pulse at the base of her throat, the rush of her blood teasing his senses with sweet temptation.</p><p>\u201cI have a private lair, but I owe fealty to the Anasso, as well as Viper,\u201d he murmured, unwittingly lowering his head to drink in her intoxicating scent.</p><p>Her pulse leaped beneath his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cViper?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cClan chief of Chicago. When either commands my service, I must obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike coming to Hannibal to collect a dysfunctional Were?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a shuddering breath, as conscious as Jagr of the potent awareness that jolted between them.</p><p>\u201cWhy give them such power?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abruptly realizing his fingers had drifted to the distracting fullness of her lips, Jagr dropped his hand and stepped away.</p><p>What the devil was he doing? His highly honed senses might assure him that there were no dangers in the area, but that didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t sitting targets.</p><p>Where was his ruthless self-discipline? His icy logic? His barren disinterest in others?</p><p>When it came to Regan, he was as easily distracted as a dew fairy high on honey.</p> <p>\u201cA vampire without a clan is always seen as a threat,\u201d he retorted, taking her arm to steer back through the narrow entrance into the cave. \u201cMy only hope for a measure of peace was to find a chief who controlled a stable clan with no thirst for war. Nothing is without cost. Even freedom.\u201d</p><p>Shaking off his hand, Regan folded her arms over her chest and dug in her heels.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not willing to become a pampered hostage to my sister in exchange for safety. I\u2019d rather take my chances with the curs.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted at her predictable response. \u201cHardly a logical decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be logical. I want to find Culligan and kill him. Speaking of which...\u201d</p> <p>With a blur of speed, Jagr had moved to block the opening. \u201cWait, little one.\u201d</p><p>A frustration that Jagr fully appreciated tightened her beautiful features.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you want to leave behind your clothes, you will need to take them with us. We can\u2019t risk returning here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother finding a new lair? They\u2019ll just track us down again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p> <p>Emerald eyes sparked with irritation at his command for her blind faith, but astonishingly, she spun on her heel and marched toward the back of the cave rather than try to rip out his heart.</p><p>Jagr wasn\u2019t sure whether to be pleased or terrified as he followed in her stormy wake.</p><p>In silence, she gathered the bags that were so obviously precious to her, stoically ignoring Jagr as he placed his own belongings into the leather satchel he\u2019d brought from Chicago.</p><p>Tossing it over his shoulder, he moved to halt Regan as she reached for the rumpled clothes he\u2019d peeled from her delectable body such a short time ago.</p><p>\u201cLeave a few behind.\u201d</p><p>Her brows snapped together. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p> <p>I thought you were going to trust me...</p><p>Regan clutched the stuffed bags to her chest, her jaw clenched at Jagr\u2019s soft words.</p><p>She wanted to laugh at his words.</p><p>She\u2019d spent thirty years being tormented, betrayed, and abused by everyone she had ever known. Now, a lethal vampire she\u2019d met only days ago wanted her to blithely put her life in his hands?</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>So...why wasn\u2019t she laughing?</p><p>Maybe because her every instinct told her that Jagr would do everything in his power to keep her safe.</p><p>Whether out of fear his Anasso would mount him on the wall of his throne room or for some more personal reason was impossible to say.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Reading her conflicting emotions with annoying ease, Jagr moved forward, holding out a silver box in an obvious effort to distract her.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she took Culligan\u2019s private safe. \u201cI dropped this when you went juggernaut and launched us through the back of the RV.\u201d She met his searching gaze. \u201cHow\u2019d you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had Levet retrieve it. There are papers in the bottom we haven\u2019t looked through yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they might be important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can only hope.\u201d</p><p>Contemplating what papers Culligan could possibly have that he considered worth keeping, Regan lowered her guard. A stupid mistake. Before she could blink she found herself hauled off her feet and firmly cradled against his chest.</p><p>Damn vampire speed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed, cursing the bulky bags and metal safe that tangled her arms and made it impossible to struggle. \u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her command (big freaking surprise), moving with fluid ease across the cave.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be sure that the explosion wasn\u2019t a ruse to draw you out of the cave. We\u2019ll have to sneak out.\u201d</p><p>She held herself stiffly, vividly aware of the cool power washing over her skin. Dammit, she wanted to be furious, not...aroused.</p><p>\u201cAnd if the curs are out there?\u201d she snapped. \u201cWon\u2019t they sense us?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, the long hair he\u2019d left free to frame the haunting beauty of his lean face flowing down his back like liquid gold.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore was mocking, but Caine has reason to resent the Weres,\u201d he said softly. \u201cUnless a cur has fully shifted, their senses are not equal to most demons. Our scents are already spread through the area, so unless they actually see us leave the cave they won\u2019t know we\u2019ve slipped beneath their noses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She abruptly felt like an idiot. \u201cThat\u2019s why you made me leave the clothes behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should keep your scent lingering for days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, Mr. Smarty Pants...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Smarty Pants?\u201d</p><p>She ignored his interruption. \u201cIf they\u2019re actually watching the cave, then how are we supposed to leave without being seen? Unlike you, I can\u2019t wrap myself in shadows.\u201d</p><p>He paused at the entrance of the cave, an almost smile hovering around his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou can as long as you stay close to me. Hold still.\u201d</p><p>Regan frowned.</p><p>Well, hell.</p><p>Was there anything vampires couldn\u2019t do?</p><p>Walk on water? Unlock the secret of cold fusion?</p><p>Create world peace?</p><p>Her annoyance at the injustice of vampires\u2019 position at the top of the demon-world was forgotten as she suddenly felt like she\u2019d been dipped in an icy pool of water.</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the cool surge of Jagr\u2019s power.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, what are you doing?\u201d she demanded with a shiver. \u201cI\u2019m freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wrapped you in my shadows. They will hide us from prying eyes, but not from prying ears.\u201d Before she could guess his intention, he bent downward to place his lips against hers. \u201cNot a word, little one.\u201d</p><p>Sadie smiled as she watched the expensive Humvee being consumed by flames. Standing several blocks away on the roof of a restaurant that had once been a bordello, she had a perfect view to watch Salvatore leave the cave with his neutered curs scurrying behind him.</p><p>Sniffling, spineless dogs.</p><p>Their blind subservience to the self-proclaimed King of Weres sickened her. Why didn\u2019t they just put a leash around their neck, and be done with it?</p><p>Of course, they had managed to lead her to where Regan was hidden with the vamp, so perhaps they weren\u2019t entirely useless.</p><p>Her smile widened as she leaned against the decorative brick wall that lined the rooftop.</p><p>\u201cI do love a roaring bonfire. A pity I forgot to bring the marshmallows.\u201d</p><p>Standing at her side, Duncan growled with impatience. \u201cDid you also forget to bring a point for this little exercise in futility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, Duncan.\u201d Sophie slid her companion a warning frown. \u201cSo far you\u2019ve proven to be as incompetent as you are spineless. Twice now you\u2019ve allowed our quarry to slip through your fingers.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s jaw tightened, his pride obviously still pricked at having been bested by the young, untrained woman.</p><p>Again.</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019ve had her in my fingers. Which is more than you can say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I was stupid enough to assume my merry band of morons could manage to capture one little Were.\u201d Sadie shrugged. \u201cI won\u2019t make that mistake again.\u201d</p><p>An ugly smile twisted his lips. \u201cOh, no, you\u2019ve done much better. Now we not only have the most dangerous vampire in the entire world hunting our sorry hides, but you\u2019ve managed to piss off the King of Weres. A real bang-up job.\u201d</p><p>Sadie bit back her snarl. It had been an unpleasant shock when the unmistakable scent of Salvatore had invaded her territory. Caine had sworn that the king had no interest in Regan, and wouldn\u2019t so much as lift a finger to help her.</p><p>Easy for him to say when he was safely hidden miles away.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>And to top it off, she\u2019d followed the scent of the curs to the cave, only to discover that not only was Regan being guarded by a vampire, the King of Weres, and his curs, but there was a damned gargoyle in residence.</p><p>A lesser woman would have thrown in the towel. Sadie, however, had always been able to think on her feet, and it had taken only a moment to devise yet another brilliant plan.</p><p>\u201cPissed off or not, I\u2019ve managed to separate Regan from the Weres, as well as the gargoyle,\u201d she pointed out, her annoyance easing as she smugly turned her attention back to the fire below.</p><p>Duncan snorted. \u201cThat still leaves the vampire.\u201d</p><p>Fear skittered down her spine. God, she hated vampires. Bloodthirsty beasts.</p><p>\u201cHe can be dealt with,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s short, ugly laugh set her teeth on edge. \u201cSo you\u2019re not only arrogant, you\u2019re delusional?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat I am is smart enough to have a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did the wolf in the Three Little Pigs, and you know how that worked out.\u201d</p><p>Sophie curled her lips. \u201cWhat are you, twelve?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust tell me this brilliant plan.\u201d</p><p>Reaching into the pocket of her leather duster, Sophie pulled out a small flask and screwed off the lid.</p><p>\u201cCulligan was kind enough to donate his blood to our cause.\u201d</p><p>Never the sharpest tool in the shed, Duncan scowled in confusion.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m opposed to draining the nasty imp, but what good is his blood?\u201d</p> <p>Sophie waved the flask beneath his nose. \u201cSuch a poignant, fruity scent. Quite unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Calvin Klein should bottle it for his fall collection.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled in anticipation. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what the hell you\u2019re going to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve at last found a use for you outside my bed.\u201d With a casual motion, Sophie dumped half the blood onto the cur\u2019s silk shirt. \u201cCongratulations, Duncan, you\u2019ve just been promoted to bait.\u201d</p><p>Jumping back, Duncan stared at his stained shirt in fury. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p> <p>With an efficient motion, Sophie closed the flask and tucked it back into her pocket. She would need the rest of the blood to lure Regan into her trap.</p><p>\u201cCircle around the gargoyle and let him catch a scent of Culligan\u2019s blood. Once he\u2019s on your trail, lead him away from here,\u201d she commanded. \u201cWithout his ability to sense magic, the vamp and Regan will be powerless to find us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLead him where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit, you idiot. Just away from here.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s eyes glittered with fury. \u201cAnd what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>She turned back toward the bluff. She\u2019d ordered two of her curs to keep watch on the cave from the woods behind the entrance, but she needed to find a closer position to set her trap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to wait for the sun to rise.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Duncan was standing at her side, his head bent to whisper directly in her ear.</p> <p>\u201cA small warning, Sadie,\u201d he growled softly. \u201cThe early cur doesn\u2019t get the worm...she gets eaten by the big bad vampire.\u201d</p><p>A spike of unease tightened her stomach before she pushed him away with a violent burst of temper.</p><p>\u201cJust go, Duncan. And try not to screw this up.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the warning glow in her eyes, Duncan swaggered across the roof, and with one motion leaped over the low wall. She heard the faint scrape of his landing in the alley behind the building, followed by the fading sound of footsteps.</p><p>Waging war against the instinct to shift, Sadie clenched her teeth and dug her nails into the palms of her hands. It was a futile effort, of course.</p><p>Unlike purebloods, a cur was always at the mercy of their nature. Once they reached a critical point, there was no halting the transformation.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me, Caine,\u201d she swore on a low growl. \u201cYou owe me big.\u201d</p><p>With an effort that should earn her sainthood, Regan managed to hold her tongue as Jagr streaked through the darkness. His blinding speed (not to mention the icy shadows he\u2019d wrapped around them) made her eyes water and her lungs struggle to function properly.</p><p>It was impossible to believe that anything lacking jet propulsion could be capable of following them, but Jagr clearly wasn\u2019t in the mood to take any chances, and she wasn\u2019t overly anxious to distract him while he charged across the empty fields at sonic speed.</p><p>Still, her patience wasn\u2019t endless. As ten minutes became twenty, Regan had had enough.</p><p>They were miles from Hannibal.</p><p>Hell, they were miles from anything resembling civilization.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sacagawea, I didn\u2019t sign up for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Where are we going?\u201d she demanded, her teeth clenched to keep them from chattering.</p><p>\u201cNorth.\u201d</p><p>Smart ass.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that much.\u201d She forced her gaze from the empty fairgrounds they were passing to the austere beauty of his face. Her heart skipped a familiar beat. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just go back to one of the hotels? There\u2019re two of them that not only have our scent all over them, but come complete with a bed and hot shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hotel is too easily surrounded.\u201d Jagr slowed his pace, his eyes shimmering like sapphires in the darkness. \u201cAnd along with the bed and shower come very large windows that are perfect for allowing in the morning sunlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like a reasonable price to pay,\u201d she muttered, aggravated by the insistent, merciless awareness that refused to leave her in peace.</p><p>A ghost of a smile played about his lips. The bastard knew precisely the effect he had on her treacherous body.</p><p>\u201cYou would miss me if I were reduced to a tiny pile of ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I think you might look good in shades of gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarsh, little one,\u201d he chastised. \u201cYour manners leave a great deal to be desired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if yours are any better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, we deserve one another.\u201d</p><p>Her heart didn\u2019t skip this time. It came to a complete, perfect stop.</p><p>We deserve one another...</p><p>The words were harmless, nothing more than a casual joke. But there was nothing amusing in the poignant longing that flooded her heart.</p><p>\u201cNot freaking likely.\u201d She squirmed in his arms, suddenly more afraid of the sensations jolting through her body than being dropped. \u201cI\u2019m freezing. Put me down.\u201d</p><p>Miraculously, Jagr came to a halt and gently lowered her to her feet. Not that she believed for a moment he was actually following orders. She wasn\u2019t that stupid.</p><p>A rabid tiger would be more likely to dance the rumba.</p><p>Obviously it suited his purpose to stand in an empty field, staring at the large, abandoned building. A building that looked as if it could be some sort of creepy asylum.</p><p>A suspicion that became absolute certainty when Jagr tilted back his head as if testing the air.</p><p>\u201cRemain close to my side,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Regan rubbed her arms, as much from the brittle tension radiating from Jagr as from the chill still clinging to her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou think the curs are chasing us?\u201d</p><p>His gaze continued to scan the darkness. \u201cThere\u2019s always a possibility that we\u2019ve been followed, but I\u2019m more concerned with the vampire who has a lair in the area. I wouldn\u2019t want any misunderstandings by bringing a Were into his territory.\u201d</p><p>Regan stiffened in wariness. Another vampire? Just what she needed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a clan here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Tane has no connection to a clan, although he no doubt has a number of guards with him. He\u2019s a Charon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Charon.\u201d She shook her head, dredging up the little Greek mythology she\u2019d read. \u201cYou mean a ferryman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d His expression had settled into those cold, remote lines that always meant trouble. \u201cA vampire assassin.\u201d</p><p>Well, this just got better and better.</p><p>\u201cJust to clarify, does that mean he\u2019s a vampire who happens to be an assassin, or that he\u2019s an assassin who kills vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hunts vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s some sort of cannibal, and you intend to invade his territory? Are you nuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTane\u2019s not a cannibal. He\u2019s a part of an elite group of warriors that Styx founded long before he became the Anasso, their sole purpose being to destroy those vampires who have become unstable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnstable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare, but not unknown.\u201d</p><p>Regan shuddered. The thought of a powerful, predatory vampire becoming unhinged wasn\u2019t a pretty one.</p><p>Actually it was downright terrifying.</p><p>\u201cShould I ask?\u201d</p><p>His expression was grim. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Good enough for her.</p><p>\u201cSo this Tane hunts them down and kills them?\u201d she instead demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d With a grimace, her attention shifted toward the nearby building. At a distance it looked as if it had once been a handsome structure. Three stories, with a large verandah on the ground level and a balcony with a decorative railing running along the second floor, it boasted the type of high arched windows popular before air-conditioning, and six fluted columns that added an air of graceful dignity. The darkness, however, couldn\u2019t disguise the fact that the red bricks were crumbling into slow oblivion and the windows were missing most of their panes of glass. \u201cWhy does he live out here in the middle of nowhere? Does he give the other vampires the heebie-jeebies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Charon must always remain above the politics and loyalties of various clans,\u201d Jagr said, his tone distracted as he continued to remain on guard. \u201cThe killing of a vampire, even one who is beyond salvation, has started too many wars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he has to live in isolation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond his servants, yes. It helps avoid complications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez.\u201d Regan grimaced. \u201cWhat a crappy job.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTane took his position willingly. Many vampires prefer solitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVamps like you?\u201d</p><p>His head turned, his brilliant eyes narrowed as if her soft question had struck a nerve.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t deny that I\u2019ve spent the past centuries preferring the company of books to that of my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you blame them for leaving you in the hands of Kesi?\u201d</p><p>Jagr tensed, his fangs flashing as his features hardened with a frozen fury.</p><p>\u201cI blamed them for allowing me to be turned into the same sort of monster who tortured me in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...\u201d Regan was forced to halt and clear her throat. \u201cYou resent being a vampire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did.\u201d The cold bitterness slowly thawed as he studied her wary eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m beginning to discover being turned isn\u2019t without a few benefits.\u201d His finger brushed her cheek, the cool caress leaving a trail of fire in its wake. \u201cDo you want me to tell you some of those benefits, little one?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry.</p><p>She knew those benefits in intimate detail.</p><p>And she wanted more.</p><p>God almighty, did she want more.</p><p>\u201cDid Styx try to make you one of his Charons?\u201d she abruptly demanded, jerking away from his lingering finger. Holy crap, did all vamps possess the ability to seduce with a touch?</p> <p>\u201cJagr as a Charon?\u201d a dark, oddly hypnotic voice floated on the warm night breeze. \u201cOur Anasso is far too wise to send one feral vampire after another. The idea of a Charon is to prevent a bloodbath, not create one.\u201d</p><p>Jagr smoothly turned as Tane at last revealed his presence.</p><p>He\u2019d sensed the dangerous vampire lurking near the dilapidated building since they\u2019d crossed into his territory, but it was never wise to acknowledge a Charon unless they invited you to do so.</p><p>\u201cTane.\u201d</p><p>The assassin remained wrapped in shadows, keeping enough distance to warn he wasn\u2019t pleased at the unexpected intrusion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trespassing, Jagr. A dangerous mistake that has been a death sentence for more than one creature.\u201d</p><p>Jagr held out his hands in a gesture of peace. When he\u2019d traveled from Chicago to Hannibal, he\u2019d sensed Tane\u2019s lair was in the vicinity but he hadn\u2019t intended to drop by for a visit. He\u2019d met the assassin nearly a decade before and wasn\u2019t overly anxious to renew their acquaintance. All vampires were lethal, but Tane possessed an edgy, restless hunger that made even Jagr\u2019s skin crawl with warning.</p><p>Necessity, unfortunately, was a bitch, and for the moment Tane was the lesser of two evils.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t need to use his senses to detect the wards and traps that were woven around the assassin\u2019s lair. Although Charons were in theory under the protection of Styx, they weren\u2019t stupid. Any vampire living in such a remote spot would go to infinite lengths to ensure his own security.</p><p>\u201cMy presence is at the command of the Anasso,\u201d Jagr warned, knowing that any Charon was forced to take oaths that bound them tightly to Styx.</p><p>He could only hope that Tane was willing to honor those vows.</p><p>\u201cAnd the woman?\u201d Tane drawled. \u201cIs she a gift for disturbing my peace? I prefer my females with more curves and less tongue, but she\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you piece of...\u201d</p><p>Swiftly wrapping one arm around Regan\u2019s waist, Jagr placed his free hand over her mouth. Gods, the woman was going to get them both killed.</p><p>Leaning down, he spoke directly in her ear. \u201cRegan, remain here while I negotiate with my brother.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him until he dropped his hand from her mouth. \u201cNegotiate what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether you live or die,\u201d Tane taunted from the shadows.</p><p>Her emerald eyes flashed, and Jagr could sense the wolf in her snarling in fury.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me to trust you, and this is where you bring me?\u201d she hissed. \u201cIf I wanted to have my life threatened by a dirt-bag demon, I could have stayed in Hannibal.\u201d</p><p>His arm tightened around her waist in a silent warning. \u201cLittle one, you\u2019re only making this more complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it would save a great deal of trouble if you would allow me to speak with Tane in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m just supposed to stand here twiddling my thumbs while you parlay with Jack Sparrow?\u201d</p><p>Tane\u2019s dark laugh floated on the breeze. \u201cYou could join me in my lair and twiddle my...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Tane,\u201d Jagr growled in warning.</p><p>Regan muttered a foul curse. \u201cI really, really don\u2019t like this guy.\u201d</p><p>Pressing a brief kiss to her lips, Jagr released his hold on her tense body and turned. He needed Regan in the safety of a lair. The sooner the better.</p><p>\u201cStay here and trust me,\u201d he murmured, flowing toward the nearby building and waiting vampire.</p><p>\u201cSomeday, Jagr, I swear to God I\u2019m going to...\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched at her furious tirade, but wisely his attention swiftly moved to the assassin who waited on the wide terrace.</p><p>Approaching the steps, Jagr was brought to a sudden halt as a silver-tipped spear suddenly struck the ground a mere inch from the toe of his boot.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s close enough.\u201d</p><p>Jagr allowed his fangs to lengthen, his power dropping the temperature. Tane was a powerful vampire who\u2019d been trained by Styx\u2019s Ravens, but Jagr wasn\u2019t feared by demons far and wide because of his less-than-sparkling personality.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your enemy, Tane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither are you my friend.\u201d Allowing his shadows to drop, Tane stepped into a wash of silver moonlight.</p><p>Although smaller in bulk than Jagr, the vampire was smoothly muscular, with the golden skin of his Polynesian ancestors, his thick black hair shaved on the sides into a long Mohawk he braided to hang past his shoulders. His face was as lean and hard as the rest of him, with faintly slanted eyes the precise color of warm honey. Wearing nothing more than a pair of khaki shorts, Tane folded his arms over his bare chest and regarded Jagr with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? The last I heard you were in Chicago, cloistered in your lair and shunning your clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t shun them,\u201d Jagr denied with a grim smile. \u201cIt\u2019s more a mutual agreement that I shouldn\u2019t bother to join the clan bowling league.\u201d</p><p>Tane\u2019s short, startled laugh did nothing to ease the menace thickening the air.</p><p>\u201cHardly a surprise. You never did play well with others, Jagr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I serve the Anasso when I\u2019m called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, which is why I have come to you.\u201d Jagr casually plucked the spear from the ground. \u201cI assume you honor your pledge to Styx?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll decide if assisting you is included in my duty to the Anasso or not.\u201d</p><p>It was the best Jagr could hope for, and with stark precision, he revealed his purpose in coming to Hannibal and the events leading to seeking out this private lair.</p><p>Tane listened in silence, his gaze shifting toward Regan, who paced a small patch of ground, muttering her opinion of arrogant, ill-mannered, bloodsucking leeches.</p><p>\u201cA Were that doesn\u2019t shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe miracles of modern medicine.\u201d</p><p>Jagr was quite willing to believe that Regan was a miracle, but not because of any modern medicine.</p><p>\u201cThe genetic alterations might have halted Regan\u2019s ability to shift, but she possesses most of a Were\u2019s skills, and more than her fair share of a Were\u2019s nasty temper.\u201d</p><p>Tane turned back to study Jagr with a taunting smile. \u201cAnd she\u2019s twin to Styx\u2019s mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Styx must have been crazed with his grief at the loss of the previous Anasso when I learned he bound himself to a Were, but now I begin to understand his obsession. She\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff limits,\u201d Jagr interrupted, the spear snapping in two as his fist clenched.</p><p>Tane tested the air, his smile widening. \u201cYou haven\u2019t claimed her.\u201d</p><p>Jagr tossed the broken weapon aside, not bothering to hide the possessive fury that whipped through the air.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t stop me from ripping off your head if you so much as touch her.\u201d</p><p>Tane narrowed his eyes. \u201cThreatening my life isn\u2019t going to get you any favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it will avoid any nasty misunderstandings.\u201d</p><p>Proving that he wasn\u2019t easily intimidated, Tane stepped forward. \u201cIs Styx aware of your fascination with his sister-mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyx is only concerned with her safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re only concerned with keeping her away from her family and in your power?\u201d</p><p>Jagr jerked at the smooth taunt. \u201cCareful, Tane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you taken her to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have allowed her to remain in Hannibal because she won\u2019t be satisfied until she\u2019s killed the imp,\u201d he growled, refusing to consider the accusation he might be deliberately postponing the moment he would have to turn Regan over to the protection of her family. \u201cIf I force her to Chicago, she\u2019ll only escape at the first opportunity and take off on her own. The demon-world might not survive the havoc she\u2019d wreak before I could track her down again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd the Anasso has agreed to this plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe requested that I deal with Regan, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Jagr snapped, angered by the mere thought the Anasso had any say over Regan. A dangerous, perhaps fatal, sensation. \u201cNow, will you help us or not?\u201d</p><p>There was a beat as Tane weighed the pleasure of battling a vampire with Jagr\u2019s skill against the certain punishment of interfering in the Anasso\u2019s business. At last he shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cGet your woman and follow me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Regan wasn\u2019t happy as she allowed Jagr to lead her into the crumbling building.</p><p>Maybe it had something to do with the stench of rotting mattresses that had been piled into what once had been a front lobby. Or the plaster that crumbled from the ceiling as they headed down the narrow flight of stairs to a basement that, frankly, was creepy as hell.</p><p>The small, cramped rooms they passed by, as well as the broken canes and walkers shoved in a storage room, pointed toward an abandoned old folks\u2019 home, but whatever charm it once might have claimed had long ago faded into oblivion.</p> <p>Or maybe it had something to do with the large, edgy vampire who led them through the moldy darkness.</p><p>Oh, Tane was melt-worthy.</p><p>He was all smooth, golden planes, and honey eyes.</p><p>Yummy tropical heat in a pair of low-riding khaki shorts.</p><p>But the wolf in her wasn\u2019t fooled by Tane\u2019s promise of paradise. Like Jagr, the vampire carried the potent scent of danger. Unlike Jagr, however, Tane didn\u2019t try to disguise his lethal threat behind a wall of ice.</p><p>No, his menace was as blatant as a flashing neon sign.</p> <p>Moving through what looked like an empty laundry room, Tane halted to shove aside a heavy metal rack, revealing a narrow opening in the wall.</p><p>Regan swallowed a sigh as she followed in his wake, more resigned than surprised to discover the stairs that led deep underground. Vampires were nothing if not predictable in their love for the dark and dank.</p><p>Battling to keep her bulky bags from tangling her legs as she negotiated the steep steps and then the long passageway that ran beneath the surrounding fields, Regan only vaguely noticed when the tunnel transformed from dirt to stainless steel.</p><p>It was only when Tane slid open a heavy door blocking the path that she realized there was nothing dark or dank about the hidden lair.</p><p>Wide-eyed, she took in the banks of high-tech equipment that lined the long room. There were monitors with live feeds of at least a dozen cameras spread throughout the nearby countryside, sleek computers keeping track of God-only-knew what, and complex, sophisticated machines that Regan didn\u2019t even recognize.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d she breathed, instinctively edging closer to Jagr as the two large vampires scanning the complicated equipment sent her an impatient scowl. Even for a vampire, the over-the-top security system seemed a little paranoid. \u201cDo you have a space shuttle tucked in a nearby cornfield?\u201d</p><p>Tane glanced over his shoulder as he continued through a far door that led to yet another steel lined passage.</p><p>\u201cI have many things tucked in the cornfields. I\u2019ll be happy to show them to you once we get my elderly brother settled into his bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTane,\u201d Jagr growled, predictably rising to the bait.</p><p>The taunting vampire turned down yet another corridor, making Regan wonder just how extensive the tunnels were.</p><p>\u201cShe is yet unclaimed, and I\u2019m as capable as you to offer her protection. Actually it would appear I\u2019m more capable since it\u2019s my lair keeping her safe.\u201d</p><p>Regan rolled her eyes. Not again.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I thought Culligan was a jackass because he was an imp. Turns out that the whole jackass thing comes with being a male,\u201d she drawled in overly sweet tones. \u201cNow let me make one thing perfectly clear...\u201d She shared her annoyed glare between the two vampires. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be protected by Dumb or Dumber. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Halting next to a door set in the steel wall, Tane turned to regard Jagr with an unexpected amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Jagr, her temper is foul.\u201d</p><p>Regan hissed in annoyance. \u201cOh, it can get a whole lot worse than foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t exaggerating,\u201d Jagr added, the half smile playing about his lips. \u201cWise demons tremble when her wolf is on the prowl.\u201d</p><p>She clutched her bags to her chest. \u201cAre you done?\u201d</p><p>The two men shared a glance that would make any woman consider the pleasure of ridding the world of males, but wisely Tane shifted to open the door, waving a hand for them to enter the room beyond.</p><p>Regan stepped over the threshold, flipping the switch on the wall. It wasn\u2019t that she needed the soft light that spilled through the room, but it helped dismiss the sensation of being trapped underground.</p><p>She moved forward, then halted in shock. Good...Lord. It looked like it had been decorated by Hugh Hefner on crack.</p><p>Her brows lifted as she studied the rich crimson wallpaper and framed pictures of naked women. The ceiling was painted with satyrs in full arousal, dancing in the shimmering light of the large chandeliers. Even worse, there wasn\u2019t a stick of furniture, but instead a dozen large pillows spread over the acres of ivory carpeting, and an honest-to-God whirlpool humming and splashing in the center of the room.</p><p>\u201cThis is my guest apartment,\u201d Tane said from the doorway, the mocking amusement in his voice revealing he was thoroughly enjoying her appalled expression. \u201cYou should find what you need. However, if you decide to leave, don\u2019t stray from the path I\u2019ve shown you. There are any number of nasty surprises for the uninvited.\u201d</p><p>Jagr gently tugged the bags of clothing from her stiff fingers, tossing them into a corner along with his own leather satchel.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of uninvited, the Anasso sent his pet gargoyle to be a very persistent pain in my side,\u201d he warned Tane. \u201cIf he makes an appearance, you might want to avoid killing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors of the creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumors can\u2019t prepare you for the real thing,\u201d Jagr said dryly.</p><p>Tane made a sound of disgust. \u201cI will allow him to perch on the roof if he can behave himself, but if he tries to invade my lair I make no promises.\u201d</p><p>Jagr shrugged. \u201cYour funeral.\u201d</p><p>Appearing remarkably unconcerned, Tane stepped back into the corridor. \u201cI have business to attend to, but my guards will remain on duty. You won\u2019t be disturbed.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Jagr offered a bow of his head. \u201cI\u2019m in your debt, Tane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. Someday I\u2019ll collect.\u201d</p><p>His warning delivered, Tane shut the door, enclosing Regan and Jagr alone in the gaudy apartment.</p><p>For a minute, Regan simply enjoyed the absence of Tane\u2019s unnerving presence, but eventually the realization she was completely alone with Jagr, in a place custom-built for sex, made her...twitchy.</p><p>With jerky steps, she moved across the ivory carpet, peeking into the compact kitchen with its expensive appliances before moving through the connecting door to the bedroom beyond.</p><p>Not her smartest decision.</p><p>She\u2019d barely switched on the light when Jagr slipped past her, his brows lifting as he prowled toward the round bed draped in black satin that was reflected in the mirrors above it.</p><p>It was like one big bachelor pad clich\u00e9.</p><p>Her cheeks burned with a ridiculous heat. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why Tane would need guest chambers. Who the hell would want to visit?\u201d</p><p>Jagr tugged open a drawer of the lacquer nightstand. \u201cUnlike you, little one, most women find Tane inexplicably charming. Even among vampires, his reputation is that of a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the word I was looking for, but it\u2019ll do.\u201d Jagr plucked a pair of handcuffs from the drawer and dangled them from his finger. \u201cWell, well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief.\u201d She frowned as he studied her with an expectant expression. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>His soft, almost tangible chuckle feathered over her skin. \u201cI don\u2019t need toys to please a woman. Of course...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen enough.\u201d</p><p>Spinning on her heel, Regan marched into the kitchen, her back ramrod straight, even as all sorts of delicious sensations fluttered in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>No, Jagr most certainly didn\u2019t need toys.</p><p>Not when his touch was pure magic.</p><p>Only a step behind her, Jagr moved toward the built-in refrigerator and tugged open the side freezer.</p><p>\u201cYou should eat something. Do you have a preference?\u201d</p><p>Refusing to reveal her childish unease, Regan moved directly to his side and peered into the freezer. Her mouth instantly watered at the sight of the neatly stacked packages from some of the most famous restaurants in the world.</p><p>Chicago style pizza...New Orleans gumbo...Kansas City barbeque...Maine lobster...</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d she muttered, reaching to pluck a few of the top boxes from the freezer and handing them to Jagr to defrost in the microwave. \u201cTane at least knows how to feed his guests.\u201d</p><p>In a remarkably short amount of time, the small glass dining table was overflowing with pizza, bread sticks, minestrone soup, and a warm apple tart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taking a seat, Regan didn\u2019t even try to pretend she was one of those ridiculously skinny women she watched on TV.

Oh, man. She didn\u2019t want to think about how her skin suddenly seemed way too tight for her body, or how her heart was pounding against her chest, or the heat pooling in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She wanted...</p><p>Okay, that pretty much summed it up.</p><p>She wanted. She wanted bad.</p> <p>\u201cHow often do you need to feed?\u201d she demanded, her mushy brain unable to come up with anything better as a distraction.</p><p>\u201cIt depends on whether I\u2019m wounded, or if I\u2019ve gone without feeding for an extended period of time,\u201d he murmured, his voice low and husky. \u201cIt also depends on the potency of the blood. A Were\u2019s blood is prized for its rare power. Unfortunately, they prefer not to share with vampires.\u201d</p><p>Her Were blood abruptly warmed as it flowed through her veins, as if already anticipating the erotic tug of his fangs.</p><p>She instinctively bristled at the troublesome sensations. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s because the vamps have nearly made them extinct by keeping them caged in cramped hunting grounds that have stolen their ancient abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you drink Salvatore\u2019s Kool-Aid?\u201d he demanded, coolly.</p><p>It took a moment for her to realize he was accusing her of being brainwashed.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but he\u2019s very convincing that the vamps are at least partially to blame for the lack of pureblood children.\u201d</p><p>Jagr flowed forward, easily sensing her rising desire despite her best attempts to appear indifferent.</p><p>\u201cHis grievance has been brought to the Oracles,\u201d he murmured, halting close enough for her to be wrapped in the cool wash of his power. \u201cThey will determine the ultimate fate of the Weres.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry as her gaze was ruthlessly drawn to all those muscles rippling beneath his too-tight T-shirt. Christ. She should be given a medal for not having him down on the kitchen floor to have her way with him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how powerful the Oracles are, I won\u2019t be fenced into some sort of Were reservation,\u201d she muttered, referring to the years that the American Weres had been forced to live on land designated by the vampires.</p><p>Not that her thoughts were actually focused on the ancient feud between the two species. No, she was far more interested in the temptation of running her fingers through the long, golden hair.</p><p>Jagr seemed just as distracted, his eyes warming to a deep blue as his hand lifted to stroke down the curve of her throat.</p><p>\u201cThe hunting grounds were created as much for the protection of the Weres as for the humans,\u201d he said, his fingers wrecking a path of distraction as they followed the plunging neckline of her shirt. \u201cWithout a strong leader, the curs were out of control and attracting far too much attention. The demon-world was preparing for genocide before the previous Anasso stepped in and created the necessary boundaries. If Salvatore can prove he\u2019s capable of taking command of his people, then the Oracles will no doubt step aside and allow him to rule without interference.\u201d</p> <p>Regan had to remind herself to breathe.</p><p>Air in. Air out. Air in. Air out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s in charge as long as they leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>His fingers continued to tease and taunt, stroking over the curve of her breasts until her nipples hardened to painful peaks.</p><p>\u201cAlways supposing that\u2019s possible, what will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy my freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than just freedom.\u201d His hand lifted to cup the nape of her neck, gently messaging her tense muscles. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to survive in a world you know very little about.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to be annoyed by his patronizing words. Something that would be a hell of a lot easier if she weren\u2019t drowning in a flood of sensuous need.</p><p>\u201cI can learn. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re extraordinarily intelligent.\u201d His lips brushed her temple. \u201cIntelligent enough to know that a lone wolf is the most vulnerable. Why not accept the assistance of those who only want to help you?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed a groan of pleasure. Damn, that mouth was wicked.</p><p>\u201cMy beloved sister? Thanks, but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy is not your only option.\u201d He nipped the lobe of her ear. \u201cMy lair is well protected, although not nearly as elegant as Styx\u2019s estate.\u201d</p><p>Regan stilled. \u201cJagr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me to move in with you?\u201d</p><p>Jagr hesitated, then with a wary expression, he pulled back to meet her shocked gaze.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever shared your lair before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot willingly, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would you offer now?\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. \u201cCouldn\u2019t I just be a good guy with a generous heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot flipping likely.\u201d She shook her head, strangely disturbed by his unexpected offer. \u201cWhat do you get out of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His hand slid from her nape to the curve of her lower back, urging her against his stirring hardness. Regan sucked in a ragged breath as his thick cock pressed into the tender flesh of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI know I want you. Desperately,\u201d he said, a fierce hunger flaring through his eyes. \u201cI know that you fascinate me even when you\u2019re behaving like a lunatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t know is why the thought of watching you walk away is...\u201d He grimaced.</p><p>\u201cIs what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnacceptable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely and utterly unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, unnerved by the stark satisfaction that flared through her heart. Surely she couldn\u2019t be pleased by his blatant claim of possession?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also inevitable,\u201d she forced herself to mutter. \u201cOnce Culligan\u2019s dead, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched as he shifted to lightly scrape his fangs down the line of her throat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he husked, his clever hands grasping the hem of her shirt to pull it off in one smooth motion. Her bra swiftly followed, fluttering to the ceramic tiles. \u201cI can be very persuasive when I want something.\u201d</p><p>She made a choked sound as his thumbs brushed over her straining nipples. Holy...crap.</p><p>Persuasive?</p><p>He was downright mind-blowing.</p><p>Desperately trying to latch onto the reason this was a bad idea (and anything that felt so damned good had to be a bad idea), Regan sucked in a deep breath. Unfortunately, Jagr was one step ahead of her and, before she could form a coherent thought, his mouth was skating over the curve of her breast, closing over the tip, as his tongue teased her to near madness.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she muttered, her fingers shoving into the tempting silk of his hair. He kissed and nibbled his way down her body, peeling away her remaining clothes between caresses.</p><p>\u201cNo, not damned,\u201d he countered, straightening to meet her dazed gaze with an unreadable expression. \u201cRedeemed.\u201d</p><p>With a motion too swift for Regan to anticipate, Jagr swept her off her feet and was moving through the apartment. She barely managed to realize what was happening when she was tossed in the center of the Austin Powers bed, her arms and legs splayed like a sacrificial virgin.</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d</p><p>Kicking off his heavy boots, Jagr pulled the T-shirt over his head and dropped his jeans to reveal the breathtaking glory of his male form.</p><p>\u201cYes, little one?\u201d he demanded, lowering to cover her with the cool weight of his body.</p><p>She lifted her hands to push him away, only something went wrong. Instead of shoving against the hard planes of his chest, her fingers were stroking over the pale skin so ruthlessly marred by his scars.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be planning what we intend to do next?\u201d she demanded, her voice a husky rasp.</p><p>Lowering his head, Jagr nibbled at the corner of her mouth. \u201cI know exactly what I intend to do next.\u201d</p><p>An exquisite shudder shook her body. Oh, Lord, she hoped that his intentions included spreading her legs and finishing what he\u2019d started.</p><p>Suddenly, she no longer cared that Culligan was out there still alive and breathing...the bastard. Or that there was a pack of demented curs that might or might not be hunting her.</p><p>Or even that Jagr\u2019s determined seduction might very well be an elaborate scheme to lure her back to Chicago and into Darcy\u2019s trap.</p><p>Sometimes a woman had to have her priorities in order. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And at the moment, Regan\u2019s priority was satisfying the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume her.</p><p>As if sensing her capitulation, Jagr growled low in his throat, his hands skimming restlessly over her bare skin as he scattered tiny kisses over her face.</p><p>\u201cSweet midnight jasmine,\u201d he muttered, his tongue outlining her lips. \u201cYour scent drives me mad.\u201d</p> <p>Regan gave a small squeak as one roaming hand slid between her thighs to stroke through her growing dampness.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she protested, breathless. \u201cIf I smell of anything, it\u2019s damp cave and horseweeds.\u201d</p><p>He crushed her lips in a searing kiss. \u201cAlways arguing, little one.\u201d He moaned as his finger slid into her tight flesh. \u201cIs it a compulsive need to keep me at a distance, or are you just quarrelsome by nature?\u201d</p><p>Regan instinctively dug her heels into the black silk sheets as she arched her hips upward.</p><p>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t always wrong, I wouldn\u2019t have to...to...\u201d Oh, Christ, his finger was creating the most delicious friction as he dipped it in and out of her. \u201cTo argue.\u201d</p> <p>His lips brushed over her cheek, then down the line of her jaw. \u201cI\u2019m never wrong.\u201d He pressed a kiss to the pulse racing at the base of her throat. \u201cNever.\u201d His mouth trailed down her collarbone. \u201cNever.\u201d He covered the aching tip of her breast. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t playing fair. She couldn\u2019t think when her entire body was quivering with a near painful need. She didn\u2019t want to think.</p><p>She just wanted to once again feel that glorious release that hovered just out of reach.</p><p>Fisting her fingers in his thick hair, she instinctively wrapped her legs around his hips.</p><p>\u201cFine, you\u2019re always right. Now stop talking and do something.\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, he regarded her with an almost smile. \u201cQuarrelsome and demanding.\u201d</p> <p>She deliberately rubbed herself against the granite-hard length of his erection.</p><p>\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened, his fangs glinting bone white in the light spilling from the living room.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Bracing himself on his elbow, he shifted until the tip of his cock pressed against her entrance. \u201cNo problem at all.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth at his deliberate torture. Innocent or not, her body understood what it needed. And having it so close was making her crazy.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you still talking?\u201d she demanded, tugging his hair as he regarded her with an oddly watchful expression.</p><p>\u201cYou know, little one, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr, if you don\u2019t get on with it, I\u2019m going to...\u201d</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t entirely sure what she was going to do, and in the end it didn\u2019t matter. With a low hiss, Jagr tilted his hips forward, sliding into her with a slow, relentless thrust.</p><p>Shifting her hands, Regan clutched at Jagr\u2019s shoulders, her nails digging into his skin. There wasn\u2019t pain. Even with Jagr\u2019s considerable size, her body readily accommodated his entry. But there was a delicious sense of fullness, and a startling intimacy, that she hadn\u2019t been expecting.</p><p>In this moment, she was connected to Jagr. Connected in a way that seemed far more poignant than two bodies simply having sex.</p><p>It was...</p><p>Her mind instantly shied from pondering the dangerous sensations. No. She didn\u2019t want this to be more than a fleeting pleasure.</p><p>\u201cRegan,\u201d he whispered close to her ear. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, just don\u2019t stop,\u201d she muttered, burying her face in the curve of his neck.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell I could stop now,\u201d he muttered, withdrawing from her body before pushing back in with a growing urgency. \u201cYou are perfect.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Regan felt that instinctive urge to argue. She wasn\u2019t perfect. Far from it.</p><p>But before she could form the words, he was once again pulling out and thrusting forward with a rhythm that stole her breath. Yes. Oh, yes. This was what her body had longed for in the depths of the night. This was what she needed.</p><p>Squeezing her eyes shut, Regan raked her nails down his back, pleased when he growled in pleasure. She dug her nails deeper, rewarded as his lips found hers in a wild, demanding kiss.</p><p>His hips rocked faster, his hands tilting her hips upward to meet his deep, steady thrusts.</p><p>\u201cJagr...please,\u201d she muttered against his lips, her body clenched so tightly she felt as if she might shatter.</p><p>\u201cPatience, little one.\u201d Dipping his head downward, he teased her aching nipple with his lips and fangs, his hips pumping faster and faster as she arched off the bed to meet him.</p><p>Regan\u2019s breath rasped in the silent air, her world narrowing to the point where Jagr\u2019s body surged in and out of her.</p><p>She was so close. So exquisitely close.</p><p>And then...it happened.</p><p>With one last surge he tumbled her over the edge, sending her into a vortex of dizzying bliss.</p><p>He swallowed her scream of pleasure with a searing kiss, continuing to pump into her shuddering body until he stiffened with his own release. Then, as he arched beneath the force of his climax, the lewd pictures exploded from the walls and the crystal decanter shattered.</p><p>Wrenching open her eyes, she regarded him in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>It\u2019s not easy to vanquish a vampire who was as old as Jagr.</p><p>His powers were terrifying, his intelligence formidable, and the sheer force of his will could overcome the most fearsome adversaries.</p><p>But there was no getting away from the fact that he had been well and truly brought to his knees by a bad-tempered, unpredictable, aggravatingly beautiful werewolf.</p><p>Tucking Regan\u2019s head beneath his chin, Jagr wrapped her tightly in his arms, his gaze ruefully taking in the shards of glass and shattered pictures scattered over the rugs.</p><p>He never lost control. Certainly not during sex.</p><p>Not that what he\u2019d just shared with Regan was just sex.</p><p>It was...hell, he didn\u2019t even have a word for the astonishing sensations that continued to quake through his body.</p><p>A vampire would sacrifice everything (clan, sanity, his very soul), to claim such joy.</p><p>Unfortunately, Regan wasn\u2019t anxious to have anyone lay claim to her. Especially not an arrogant, overprotective vampire who had the social skills of a bad-tempered cobra.</p><p>\u201cRegan...\u201d</p><p>His soft words were cut short as Regan slapped her hand over his mouth, shifting so she could glare at him with an unexpected annoyance.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>So much for the tender, intimate cuddling he\u2019d envisioned.</p><p>Peeling her fingers from his lips, Jagr regarded her beautiful face surrounded by the tangle of golden curls. A smug pride stabbed through his heart at the lingering heat that darkened her eyes, and the flush of pleasure she couldn\u2019t disguise. She might never admit she\u2019d found satisfaction in his touch, but it was etched on her face.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a little late for no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to Dr. Phil what just happened.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted in amusement. \u201cDo I strike you as a Dr. Phil kind of vampire?\u201d</p><p>With a sudden motion, she jerked the black sheet over her slender body.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to discuss it.\u201d</p><p>Jagr wryly resisted the urge to press the issue. He might not understand the mysterious workings of the female mind, but he did know his stubborn Were. If she decided she didn\u2019t want to discuss what they\u2019d just shared, then there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it.</p><p>\u201cWhatever makes you happy, little one.\u201d Dropping a kiss on the top of her head, Jagr slid from the bed and pulled on a silk robe Tane had left draped over a nearby chair. \u201cDo you have Culligan\u2019s safe?\u201d</p><p>Regan pressed herself to a seated position, ridiculously keeping the sheet wrapped around her. As if he hadn\u2019t kissed every delectable inch of her body.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in my bags. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the moment it\u2019s the only connection we have to Culligan.\u201d</p><p>Returning to the living room, Jagr gathered Regan\u2019s precious bags along with his own satchel, then returning to the bedroom he tossed the bags on the bed and searched until he discovered the small safe tucked among her clothes.</p><p>Regan frowned. \u201cYou think we might have overlooked something?\u201d</p><p>Jagr turned the safe in his hands, running his fingers over the smooth metal. \u201cImps are notoriously paranoid when it comes to their treasures. There has to be at least one hidden compartment we haven\u2019t found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re what? Going to try and play Rubik\u2019s Cube with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer a more straightforward approach.\u201d With one smooth motion, Jagr ripped off the bottom of the safe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very destructive demon,\u201d she muttered, glancing toward the shattered glass spread across the floor before returning her attention to the smashed safe.</p><p>He wisely hid his smile. He\u2019d managed to slip past her fierce defenses, to stir her most intimate yearnings. Now she was desperate to push him away.</p><p>\u201cBut effective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reaching into the gaping hole, Jagr pulled out a thick envelope and tossed it into her lap.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve made my point.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, ripping open the envelope. \u201cFake IDs...credit cards...\u201d She paused as she unfolded a piece of paper. \u201cAh, now this is interesting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a message...\u201d</p><p>The Clemens Tea Shop. Saturday. Midnight.</p><p>Her head lifted, her eyes wide. \u201cCulligan left St. Louis on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember seeing a sign for the place. It\u2019s a restaurant west of town.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis might explain what brought Culligan to Hannibal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth investigating,\u201d Jagr slowly agreed.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d She scooted toward the edge of the bed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what I intend to do.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan, we can\u2019t be certain we weren\u2019t followed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sakes, your Jason Bourne wannabe friend has half of Missouri wired like the Pentagon. If there was anything out there, he would already have vaporized them with his ray gun.\u201d</p><p>His scowl deepened. He couldn\u2019t deny that Tane had gone above and beyond the usual defenses. Or that he would have easily discovered any stray cur in the area.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even argue the necessity of discovering who had sent the message to Culligan.</p><p>But his every instinct screamed to keep her safely tucked in the lair where nothing could reach her.</p><p>Almost as if sensing the refusal that trembled on his lips, Regan scooted off the bed, grabbing one of the bags and scurrying toward the bathroom. Jagr had only a brief glimpse of her tasty backside before the door shut behind her and he heard the sound of the shower kick on.</p><p>Left alone in the bedroom, Jagr wrenched off the robe and tugged on a pair of jeans and black sweater he pulled from his satchel. A lesser vampire might be offended by her desperate desire to pretend she hadn\u2019t just given him her innocence. Or her embarrassing haste to chase after shadows rather than linger alone with him in the secluded lair.</p><p>Thankfully he wasn\u2019t a lesser vampire.</p><p>Just one who was suddenly in the mood to finish destroying the porn-chic pictures that lined the walls.</p> <p>Braiding his hair, Jagr tied it off with a leather cord and tugged on his heavy boots. His weapons followed. The two daggers he slid into the sheaths in his boots, and the handgun he shoved into his waistband at the small of his back. The silver bullets would come in handy if they ran across a cur.</p><p>Then, desperate to ignore the tantalizing scent of soap and sweet jasmine filling the air, he returned to the kitchen and drained a bottle of the blood left in the refrigerator. He didn\u2019t particularly need to feed, but he didn\u2019t want to risk his hunger stirring while they were on the hunt.</p><p>Even if Regan were willing to donate a vein, he wasn\u2019t a masochist. The aggravating woman was a threat to more than just his sanity.</p><p>There was a very real danger Regan could be his true mate.</p><p>Cursing a fate that seemed determined to torture him, Jagr stiffened when she appeared in the doorway, her damp hair pulled into a ponytail, her slender curves covered in a pair of low-riding jeans and a too-tight knit top.</p><p>Heat, raw and primitive, flared through him. Damn. When he returned to Chicago, he intended to kick Styx\u2019s ass.</p><p>The ancient vampire had a great deal to answer for.</p><p>Thankfully unaware of his dark thoughts, Regan studied him with a guarded expression.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you get rid of the mess in the bedroom?\u201d</p><p>Jagr shrugged, turning to head for the door leading out of the apartment. Now wasn\u2019t the time to dwell on the intense pleasure that had caused his power to shatter Tane\u2019s repulsive works of art. Not when he needed his few remaining brain cells to make sure he didn\u2019t lead them into yet another disaster.</p><p>\u201cTane\u2019s servants can toss it into the trash. That\u2019s where the junk belonged in the first place,\u201d he muttered, opening the door and waiting for her to step past him before closing it and heading down the narrow hallway.</p><p>She walked at his side, her dry glance her only reaction to his surly mood.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have your own lair decorated with Hustler rejects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t bothered decorating at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t that surprise me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem necessary.\u201d Coming to an abrupt halt, Jagr cupped her face and stole a swift, frustrated kiss. Lifting his head, he met her startled gaze. \u201cUntil now.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted with a scathing remark, but before she could catch her breath, he was stepping into Command Central and speaking to the dark-haired vampire on guard.</p><p>\u201cWe need transportation.\u201d</p><p>The warrior with his dark hair shaved close to his head, and his large body covered with a variety of weapons, rose to his feet, clearly under orders to offer Jagr whatever he needed.</p><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>Wryly wondering what Tane would demand in repayment for his hospitality, Jagr followed the vampire across the room.</p><p>Waiting for the servant to push open a narrow door, he wasn\u2019t surprised to discover the vast underground garage that held a half dozen gleaming cars. Many vampires possessed a fascination with expensive automobiles. Regan, on the other hand, sucked in a shocked breath.</p><p>\u201cJeez. No Batmobile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s having its tires rotated.\u201d He led her across the paved garage toward a shadowed corner.</p><p>Her hand reached out to stroke over the elegant curves of a silver Mercedes they passed.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if Salvatore needs a Were assassin. I could use a pay grade that\u2019s obviously in the Donald Trump territory.\u201d</p><p>Jagr bristled. Salvatore might not be willing to take Regan as his queen, but he was more than interested in taking her to his bed. Jagr would see the king in hell first.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for Salvatore. The Anasso would willingly offer you whatever luxury you want.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cI can promise you that his pay grade is much higher than Donald Trump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need the Anasso\u2019s charity.\u201d She jerked her arm from his grasp. \u201cOr the strings attached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019d much rather cut off your nose to spite your face,\u201d he growled, ignoring her glare as he stopped next to a battered red truck. \u201cThis should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cAre you kidding me? There\u2019s a Lamborghini, a Porsche, an Aston Martin, and two Corvettes just begging to go for a drive, and you want to take this piece of junk?\u201d</p><p>Opening the passenger side door, he eyed her with a lift of his brows. \u201cI prefer not to attract any unwanted attention. How many Lamborghinis have you seen in Hannibal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She folded her arms over her chest. \u201cThen why don\u2019t we just go back the way we came? I\u2019d rather run than be jolted around in this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe curs won\u2019t be looking for a red truck,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd we might need it if either of us is injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilljoy,\u201d she muttered, grudgingly grabbing the handle of the door to vault into the high cab.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>Jagr waited until she was settled on the worn leather seat before closing the door and rounding the front of the truck to take his place behind the wheel. Ignoring the key in the ignition, he used his powers to start the powerful engine and headed toward the tunnel that led out of the underground complex.</p><p>They exited the tunnel in the middle of a thick tangle of trees and underbrush that hid the opening from prying eyes. Or at least from human eyes. Regan possessed enough wolf to spot the numerous cameras concealed among the branches, and the occasional vampire that slid through the dark shadows.</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d Her gaze lingered on the heat detectors hidden in a clump of wild daisies. \u201cWhat happens if someone accidentally stumbles into this little Area 51?\u201d</p><p>Jagr shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re removed and their memories altered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like the other Area 51.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cNot quite.\u201d</p><p>He took the narrow path through the surrounding fields, keeping the lights off until they reached a paved road heading south. Then ignoring any claim to intelligence, he gunned the engine and they hurtled their way toward Hannibal.</p><p>For long minutes they traveled in silence, Jagr brooding on his plunge into insanity and Regan watching the passing scenery with an odd sort of curiosity.</p><p>At last, Jagr chalked up his peculiar behavior to the onset of dementia and allowed his attention to return to the woman at his side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frighteningly quiet. Are you plotting general mayhem, or just my own demise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying the scenery.\u201d</p><p>His gaze lingered on the fields that would eventually be planted with corn and soy beans and the occasional patch of sorghum. The recently tilled fields were no doubt a lovely sight for the local farmers, but hardly one of the Seven Wonders of the World.</p><p>\u201cThe scenery?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved into a wistful smile. \u201cCulligan used to drive through the back roads when we traveled from town to town. I always envied the humans tucked safely in their beds with no idea of the monsters lurking in the dark.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jagr grimaced. He didn\u2019t have a memory of his time as a human, but the rumors of his brutal rampages were legendary. There hadn\u2019t been many tears shed when he\u2019d mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>\u201cHumans are not without their own share of monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but the countryside always seems so peaceful. Especially at night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously you haven\u2019t read In Cold Blood.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cSpoken like a true city vamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t always lived in cities, you know,\u201d he drawled. \u201cI\u2019ve spent centuries hidden in lairs so remote I had to travel hours to feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCenturies of solitude?\u201d She sucked in a deep breath. \u201cIt sounds like heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt times.\u201d He slowed the truck as he turned to study the smooth perfection of her profile. \u201cThere are also times when it\u2019s lonely and tedious and frightening.\u201d</p> <p>She turned to catch his intense gaze. \u201cFrightening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a connection to the world, it becomes far too easy to question the purpose in continuing to exist.\u201d</p><p>Even in the darkness he had no trouble seeing the shock, and something that might have been horror, that rippled over her face.</p><p>\u201cDid you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t discovered a passion for my research, I would not have struggled against the lure of ending it all,\u201d he readily confessed. \u201cIt\u2019s a temptation that all immortals must battle.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, she shivered, wrapping her arms around her waist as if warding off a sudden chill.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not do anything so stupid while I\u2019m around, chief,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI intend to be the only tragedy to befall you.\u201d</p><p>A stab of satisfaction rushed through him at her unmistakable distress. She didn\u2019t like the thought he had very nearly put an end to his empty existence.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, little one, you won\u2019t get rid of me that easily.\u201d</p><p>She deliberately turned her head to stare out the window, pretending an interest in clumps of houses and car lots and gas stations that replaced the fields as they skirted the edge of town. Jagr allowed her to wrestle with her emotions in silence, forcing himself to concentrate on where he\u2019d seen the sign for the tea shop.</p><p>Crawling through the sleeping residential streets, he nearly missed the refurbished three-storied house that was set behind two towering oaks.</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d he said, abruptly pulling the truck to a halt on the opposite side of the street. It was nearly two in the morning and, in the finer neighborhoods of Hannibal, the citizens were safely tucked in their beds.</p><p>Leaning forward, Regan studied the pretty white structure with pink trim, and all those curly doodads that Victorians were addicted to.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThis can\u2019t be right.\u201d</p> <p>He deliberately glanced at the gold letters painted in the bay window. \u201cIt claims to be the Clemons Tea Shop. Do you think there\u2019s more than one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s way too upscale for any of Culligan\u2019s friends,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHe hangs around with bottom-feeders like himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. We can return to the lair, and...\u201d</p><p>He hid his smile as she hastily shoved open her door and jumped out of the truck.</p><p>\u201cWe might as well have a look while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He caught up with her as she vaulted over the white picket fence, his senses assuring him that there was nothing in the house but a prowling cat. Of course, his senses were worthless when it came to the curs and their damned witch, he reminded himself, tugging the handgun from his waistband as they rounded the house and entered the tiny rose garden at the back.</p><p>Reaching the edge of the patio dotted with tables, they both came to a sharp halt.</p><p>\u201cDo you smell that?\u201d Regan demanded, her eyes glittering at the distinct scent of peach that had nothing to do with the tarts or scones served from the nearby kitchen.</p><p>Jagr nodded. It wasn\u2019t the distinct plum scent of Culligan, but definitely fey.</p><p>\u201cImp. And male.\u201d His fingers tightened on the handle of the gun. \u201cDo you recognize the scent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sucked in a deep breath, using her Were senses to test the air. \u201cI don\u2019t think Culligan was ever in contact with the imp while he held me captive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why would this mysterious imp contact him with an invitation to meet in Hannibal?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze widened. \u201cA trap?\u201d</p><p>It had been Jagr\u2019s first thought as well. \u201cAn imp would sell his own mother if he could get a profit.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled in anticipation. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to meet this imp.\u201d</p><p>Jagr scowled, rebelling at the mere thought of Regan hunting an imp that might possess all sorts of nasty skills.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll track him.\u201d He was careful to keep his words closer to a request than a demand. \u201cYou return to Tane\u2019s lair, and I\u2019ll...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even start with me.\u201d Her hands landed on her hips, her expression at its most stubborn.</p><p>\u201cRegan, we know nothing about this imp or how closely he\u2019s associated with the curs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve let you hang around because you\u2019re occasionally useful, but I don\u2019t take orders from you.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cGot it?\u201d</p><p>He muttered a low curse. \u201cSo you\u2019re willing to put yourself in danger to prove you can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to do what\u2019s necessary to track Culligan. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d Turning, she marched toward the back hedge, her back stiff as she followed the trail of the imp. \u201cIt\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Jagr held himself still, waging war with his predatory nature that was stirred to a fever pitch by Regan\u2019s brash challenge.</p><p>If he\u2019d already claimed her, then these skirmishes would be nothing more than the delicious games played between mates. But, without the bond...</p><p>Damn.</p><p>He\u2019d assumed Kesi was the expert on torture.</p><p>She was an amateur compared to Regan.</p><p>Levet kicked a stray rock as he wandered along the edge of the Mississippi River.</p><p>He\u2019d caught the plum scent of an imp two hours ago, and had eagerly been on the hunt since. Mon Dieu. He\u2019d been so certain that this was his opportunity to show that frozen Visigoth chief who was the better demon.</p><p>His mood of elation, however, was swiftly spiraling down to weary annoyance as the trail led him on a seeming goose chase through the mud and muck that Missouri produced in astonishing abundance.</p><p>Not for the first time, he considered washing his hands of this whole vampire-helping-business and retiring to a nice quiet church in Florida.</p><p>Or maybe Arizona.</p><p>The humidity did nothing for his skin.</p><p>After all, it wasn\u2019t like the cold-blooded bastards actually appreciated his spectacular skills. Sacrebleu, they barely acknowledged he was a full-blooded gargoyle, let alone treated him with the respect or dignity that was his due.</p><p>So why was he tromping through the nasty weeds, following an even nastier imp, when once again the damnable vampire was busy sweeping the beautiful damsel in distress off her feet?</p><p>Because he was an imbecile, that was why.</p><p>An imbecile with sore feet, an empty stomach, and a sinking certainty that he was doing nothing more than walking in circles.</p><p>He needed a pizza. An extra large, meat-lovers, double cheese, thick crust...</p><p>\u201cPsst.\u201d</p><p>Startled by the unexpected sound, Levet jerked his head to discover a woman swimming in the powerful waters of the river, her pure white skin, slanted blue eyes, and pale green hair revealing she was something other than human.</p><p>Water sprite.</p><p>And one that he\u2019d encountered before.</p><p>Cursing the hideous luck than had crossed his path with Bella, the-pain-in-the-ass sprite, Levet attempted to ignore the flighty fey.</p><p>\u201cHey. Hey, you.\u201d Swimming closer to the shore, she waved an arm, as if he were too stupid to notice a water sprite bobbing a stone\u2019s throw from him. \u201cOver here. Psst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop pssting me,\u201d he growled, continuing his path along the edge of the river.</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon, you do not,\u201d he denied.</p><p>\u201cI do. You\u2019re Levet, the stunted gargoyle.\u201d</p><p>He halted at the insult, spinning to point a gnarled claw at the stupid pest. \u201cI am not stunted. I am vertically challenged.\u201d</p><p>She batted her long lashes, her beauty near breathtaking in the silver moonlight. Of course, it was that beauty that had been leading sailors to their doom since the beginning of time.</p><p>Levet had learned his lesson when the sprite had crawled through his portal when he\u2019d been attempting to save Viper and Shay from the previous Anasso who\u2019d gone completely nuts.</p><p>\u201cI made you big before, when you fought that icky vampire,\u201d she whispered, reminding him of the pleasure he\u2019d felt in commanding the stature that most of his brethren took for granted. Mon Dieu. It had been such a lovely thing. \u201cDo you want me to make you big again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t summon you. Go away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go pester the fishes.\u201d He puffed out his chest. \u201cI am on important business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of business would a miniature gargoyle have? Are you hunting leprechauns?\u201d she mocked, her laughter tinkling through the night air. \u201cOh, I know, I know. You\u2019re hunting hobbits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery amusing...not.\u201d Clenching his claws, Levet resumed his trek through the mud. \u201cI happen to be hunting a very dangerous, very cunning imp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImp?\u201d She kept pace with his angry stride. \u201cThere\u2019s no imp around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs not.\u201d</p><p>Levet threw his hands in the air. \u201cI smell him, you annoying creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s gone past here besides a raccoon was a cur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cur.\u201d Levet halted in shock. \u201cYou are certain?\u201d</p><p>Pleased to have his full attention, Bella ran a tempting hand through her hair. \u201cI know a dog when I see one. He was far more handsome than you, but covered in blood.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cBleck.\u201d</p><p>A cur covered in blood?</p> <p>Had one of them been injured?</p><p>And why did they smell like an imp...</p><p>Levet smacked his forehead with his clenched claw.</p><p>\u201cSacrebleu.\u201d Smack, smack. \u201cI have been such a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your brain isn\u2019t very big,\u201d Bella sympathized.</p><p>Lifting his head, Levet glared at the water sprite. \u201cOne more word out of you and I\u2019m turning you into a carp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want a stupid imp?\u201d she pouted, blithely ignoring his threat. \u201cThey\u2019re nasty, tricky beasts. Sprites are much more fun. Don\u2019t you remember how you liked me rubbing your wings? Summon me and I\u2019ll make you the happiest gargoyle in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, you make my head hurt,\u201d Levet snapped.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that he wasn\u2019t tempted. Bella was lovely, and he was a healthy male who liked having his wings stroked as well as the next gargoyle. Still, he understood the dangers of playing with the fey.</p><p>They always ended up being more trouble than they were worth.</p><p>Squaring his shoulders, Levet concentrated on the fading scent of plums. The damned cur may have tricked him, but that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t use the situation to his advantage.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Breaking into his concentration, Bella swam closer to the shore. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>He muttered a curse at the interruption. \u201cI have a cur to capture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where the imp is.\u201d</p><p>Levet scowled. \u201cHow would you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee things? What could you possibly see? You cannot be in this world unless you\u2019re summoned...\u201d</p><p>He stumbled to silence as his words sank through his thick skull. She couldn\u2019t be here. Not unless she\u2019d already been summoned.</p><p>She was nothing more than another bit of bait. Just like the scent of imp that had led him to this precise spot.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d he breathed, whirling just in time to watch the tall cur step from behind a tree.</p><p>His hands lifted to conjure a hasty spell, but the words didn\u2019t have time to form before he was struck by a brilliant explosion.</p><p>The world went black.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Regan shivered, absently rubbing her hands over her bare arms. The chill in the air had nothing to do with the brisk spring breeze and everything to do with the very large, very annoyed vampire stalking silently behind her.</p><p>Not that she was about to apologize.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t asked for his interference, dammit. And she most certainly didn\u2019t ask to be treated like a helpless bimbo who had to be tucked away in a safe lair while Jagr played superhero.</p><p>She was the one who Culligan had tormented and tortured for three decades. She was the one who had dreamed night after night of ripping out the imp\u2019s throat. She was the one who\u2019d tracked the bastard to Hannibal.</p><p>This was her fight, and by God, she was going to see it to the bitter end.</p><p>And her stubborn reaction to his protective instincts had nothing at all to do with the fear that the stunning pleasure she\u2019d felt in Jagr\u2019s arms had given him a power over her that was as ruthless and eternal as Jagr himself.</p><p>She shivered again.</p><p>Christ. She needed a distraction.</p><p>And a freaking jacket.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d she demanded, gazing around the wide stretch of open land that was surrounded by a handful of large, elegant homes. \u201cA park?\u201d</p><p>Quickening his pace to walk beside her rather than glowering from behind, Jagr deliberately pulled back his power, easing the chill in the air.</p><p>\u201cA golf course,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Her lips twisted. No wonder she didn\u2019t recognize the place. Culligan had never spent much time around the country club set. \u201cThat would explain the lack of teeter-totters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the manicured greens with holes cut in them.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a startled glance. \u201cYou golf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are few things I haven\u2019t tried over the centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can imagine,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>Heat flared through his eyes, burning away the lingering ice. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to demonstrate a few of them later.\u201d</p><p>Regan hastily turned her head, following the peach-scented trail that led toward a line of woods at the back of the golf course. Not that she hoped for a minute the damned vampire couldn\u2019t see the blush staining her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat would an imp be doing out here?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Half-expecting Jagr to pounce on her obvious vulnerability, Regan breathed a sigh of relief when he instead turned his attention toward the thicker shadows gathered ahead.</p><p>\u201cMy first guess would be that he\u2019s hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom us?\u201d</p><p>Jagr tilted back his head as if sensing the night air. \u201cHis trail is fresh. And he\u2019s near.\u201d</p><p>Regan abruptly halted, realizing the scent of peach had grown considerably stronger. She pointed toward the line of trees along a barbed wire fence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll circle to the right,\u201d she whispered so softly only a vampire could catch the words. \u201cI\u2019d rather not have to chase him through the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, sensing his grim frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He muttered a low curse. \u201cJust be careful.\u201d</p><p>Regan lifted her brows.</p><p>No grim pronouncement that it was too dangerous?</p><p>No squawking that he was the only one capable of dealing with the hidden demon?</p><p>No growling, hissing, or chest thumping?</p><p>Not willing to press her luck, Regan slipped silently down a cement path she assumed was for the golf carts.</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe for a moment that an ancient vampire could actually learn new tricks. At least not this ancient vampire.</p><p>So either he didn\u2019t believe the imp posed enough of a threat to make a fuss over, or more likely, he was confident he could protect her even if she was stubborn enough to charge into danger.</p><p>The rueful thoughts had barely skimmed through her mind when there was a rustle of noise and a slender form darted across the closely mowed green, heading directly for the nearby bushes.</p><p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t,\u201d Regan muttered, launching forward to tackle the fleeing imp.</p><p>She had a brief impression of reddish blond hair that was cut short and styled to emphasize the narrow, handsome face and pale green eyes. His thin body was hidden beneath an elegant blue suit that made him look like a banker.</p><p>Or a gigolo.</p><p>No doubt the old ladies at the tea shop fluttered over him like a clutch of infatuated hens.</p><p>Tackling the imp from behind, Regan drove him to the ground, intending to land on his back. Of course, the best laid plans of mice and men...yadda, yadda...</p><p>The impact was enough to knock her to the side, and the imp struck out desperately, his fist hitting her square in the stomach. The breath was wrenched from her lungs and before she could move, the imp landed a blow that would have broken her jaw if she\u2019d been human. Thankfully Regan wasn\u2019t a human. She was a pissed-off pureblood who\u2019d just been sucker-punched.</p><p>The imp swung his arm again, but this time Regan was prepared. Grabbing his fist, she squeezed until he was squealing like a...well, pretty much like an imp in pain. Then wrenching his arm behind his back, she rolled him face-first into the ground.</p><p>He kicked out, connecting painfully with her knee as she climbed to straddle his lower back. Regan cursed, jacking his arm even higher up his back as she grabbed a fistful of his hair and smacked his face into the dirt.</p><p>There was a cool brush of air, and suddenly Jagr was crouched at her side, his gaze on the imp whimpering beneath her.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s subdued, little one.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to spit the blood from her mouth. Damn, the freaking idiot had made her bite her tongue. She hated that.</p><p>\u201cYou could have helped,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Jagr arched a golden brow. \u201cAnd be accused of overstepping my place as your meaningless sidekick?

We\u2019ll ask the questions, and you\u2019ll answer them,\u201d Jagr warned. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d</p><p>Regan tightened her grip on his hair. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll give us the truth if you want to keep your head attached.\u201d</p><p>The imp hissed in pain. \u201cWhat is this? The demon version of good cop, bad cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that Regan has a few issues with imps,\u201d Jagr drawled.</p><p>The imp stiffened beneath her. \u201cRegan?\u201d he breathed.</p> <p>Jagr narrowed his gaze. \u201cYou recognize the name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d His denial was cut short as Regan banged his head on the ground. \u201cWait, dammit. All I know is that Culligan had a pet Were called Regan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPet?\u201d Her temper snapped as she banged his head over and over. Christ, she hated imps.</p><p>Jagr gently touched her arm. \u201cCareful, little one, we need him alive if he\u2019s going to answer our questions.\u201d</p><p>Regan forced herself to halt, sucking in a deep, calming breath as she met Jagr\u2019s steady gaze.</p><p>\u201cCan you sense if he\u2019s speaking the truth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Regan leaned forward, deliberately twisting his arm higher. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you, I...arrg...Gaynor. My name is Gaynor.\u201d</p><p>She eased the pressure. \u201cHow do you know Culligan?\u201d</p><p>Gaynor licked his thin lips, the scent of peach thick in the air. \u201cWe both lived in New Orleans during the Civil War. Culligan never had much magic, but the looting was easy, and the humans were ripe to be plucked of what few valuables they had left.\u201d</p><p>Jagr growled deep in his throat. Even Regan shivered at the sound.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain how you knew about Regan.\u201d</p><p>Despite the chill of Jagr\u2019s power, the imp began to sweat. \u201cWe crossed paths in Chicago thirty years ago. He told me he\u2019d fallen into a sweet deal with a baby Were that he intended to take on the road in some sort of freak show. Lucky idiot.\u201d</p> <p>Regan sucked in a startled breath.</p><p>Chicago?</p><p>Culligan had always claimed he\u2019d found her abandoned in a ditch near Dallas.</p><p>Of course, Salvatore had tried to convince her that Culligan had lied, and that her family would never have willingly abandoned her.</p><p>Still...the suspicion had continued to rankle deep in her heart.</p><p>\u201cWho offered him this sweet deal?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cA cur. I think Culligan said his name was Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d She gave a stunned shake of her head, her stomach twisting with a sick sensation. \u201cThis is nuts. How did the curs get a hold of me? And why would they give me to Culligan?\u201d</p><p>Easily sensing her distress, Jagr stroked her arm in a comforting motion.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discover the truth, little one. That I promise.\u201d Jagr turned his attention to the imp, his eyes glittering like frozen chips of sapphire in the dark. \u201cDidn\u2019t you think the Weres might want to know about a missing child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCulligan swore the dogs were the ones who gave him the baby in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly be stupid enough to believe any Were would willingly hand over a pureblood child to an imp,\u201d Jagr accused.</p><p>Gaynor tried to cringe from Jagr, obviously more afraid of the looming vampire than the angry Were perched on top of him.</p><p>Smart imp.</p><p>\u201cHe said she was damaged, that she couldn\u2019t even shift,\u201d he desperately tried to excuse his betrayal. \u201cBesides, he had to make a blood oath that he wouldn\u2019t allow her to suffer any permanent harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blood oath?\u201d Regan directed her question to Jagr. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cA promise bound in blood and magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Culligan had failed to protect you from serious damage, he would have dropped dead in a New York minute,\u201d Gaynor swiftly added, as if hoping for brownie points.</p><p>Regan ground her teeth, recalling how obsessive Culligan had been to keep the occasional demon visitors from wandering too near the back of the RV. At the time she\u2019d thought he was protecting his cash cow. Now it was obvious he was simply terrified for his own life. \u201cSo that\u2019s why he was so careful to keep his disgusting friends away from my cage. Pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t seen or heard from him in thirty years?\u201d Jagr charged.</p><p>\u201cNo, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did you know he was in St. Louis?\u201d</p><p>Gaynor licked his lips. \u201cThe word was already buzzing in the chat rooms that an imp had been busted by the King of Weres for holding a pureblood captive, and that he was hiding in St. Louis. I suspected it might be Culligan, so I sent a hellhound to track him down with a message to meet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImps have chat rooms?\u201d Regan mocked, envisioning a bunch of imps huddled over their keyboards.</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019re more tech-savvy than most demons.\u201d</p><p>Regan\u2019s lips twisted. Clearly the imp hadn\u2019t been into Tane\u2019s version of the Death Star.</p><p>\u201cSo the chat rooms were buzzing about an imp being in trouble, and you decided to contact Culligan out of the goodness of your heart?\u201d she demanded. \u201cGive me a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought if it was Culligan, he might be willing to pay for my help.\u201d He shuddered beneath her. \u201cDo you think I like peddling tea and cake to fat old ladies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lying,\u201d Jagr breathed softly.</p><p>Regan smacked the imp on the back of the head, hard. \u201cWell, I believe he hates peddling cakes to old ladies, so he must be lying about his reason for contacting Culligan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw...I\u2019m not a Whack-a-Mole,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re a breath away from being dinner,\u201d Regan informed him, not above using the imp\u2019s instinctive fear of vampires. \u201cDid I forget to mention Jagr didn\u2019t have time to eat before we came looking for you?\u201d</p><p>Jagr readily fell into his role as enforcer, his fangs suddenly shimmering in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not hungry for cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll kill me if I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re screwed, Gaynor, because we\u2019ll kill you if you don\u2019t,\u201d Regan assured him.</p><p>There was a pause, then straining his neck, Gaynor attempted to turn his head to speak directly to Regan.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can make a deal? The information has to be worth something to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a deal? Fine.\u201d She grabbed his face to turn it directly toward Jagr. \u201cYou tell me everything you know about Culligan, and I won\u2019t feed you to the hungry vampire.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed heavily. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you send a message to Culligan?\u201d Jagr pressed.</p><p>\u201cCan I at least sit up?\u201d he whined. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me a cramp.\u201d</p><p>She shoved his arm high enough that it threatened to snap out of its socket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you up, but I\u2019ll give you more than a cramp if you try anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>Releasing his arm, Regan slipped off his back to kneel next to Jagr. Gaynor muttered a curse and scrambled to sit upright, straightening his silk tie even as he studied the grass stains on his jacket.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch. Do you know how much this suit cost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much I don\u2019t care?\u201d Regan snapped. \u201cStart talking.\u201d</p><p>Giving up on his tie, the imp threw his hands in the air. \u201cFine. I did hear about Culligan in the chat rooms like I said, but I didn\u2019t send the message because I thought he could pay me. The worthless slug never did have the talent or intelligence to earn more than a few bucks. Even when he was handed a windfall like you.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s powers whipped painfully around the imp, making the short strands of his hair stand upright.</p><p>\u201cSo, why?\u201d</p><p>Gaynor shivered. \u201cA week ago a cur came into the tea shop and asked for me to invite Culligan to Hannibal.\u201d</p><p>Jagr beat her to the obvious question. \u201cWho was this cur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called herself Sadie.\u201d His lips curled. \u201cDamn, she was hot. Tall and dark with the kind of body that makes a man think about whips and chains. Very tasty.\u201d</p><p>Regan frowned. She\u2019d assumed the cur would be Duncan or perhaps the mysterious Caine. Who the hell was this Sadie?</p><p>\u201cHad you ever seen her before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and she wasn\u2019t a woman a man would forget. Not ever.\u201d A leer touched the imp\u2019s too-pretty features. \u201cMaybe her rack was a bit small, but...\u201d His disgusting words were cut short as Regan threw a rock at him with enough force to snap his head back. He glared at her as he raised a hand to the bleeding lump on his forehead. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy suggestion would be to stop digging your own grave, imp,\u201d Jagr said dryly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe asked.\u201d</p><p>Regan regarded the imp in disgust. \u201cYou sold out your friend because you thought the cur was hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I sold him out because the cur handed over a butt load of money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Culligan would have done the same in my position.\u201d</p><p>Regan couldn\u2019t argue with his logic. Culligan was an amoral, spineless turd who would sell his soul for a buck.</p><p>\u201cDid the cur say what she wanted with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said he\u2019d failed in his duty to the curs, and that he needed to be punished.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all she said, is it?\u201d Jagr abruptly insisted.</p><p>\u201cShe might have mentioned using him as bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo lure Regan to Hannibal?\u201d</p><p>Gaynor flinched at the ice edging the vampire\u2019s voice. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say. I\u2019m not precisely her confidant. More like her stooge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Regan demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it must be near the river.\u201d</p> <p>Jagr frowned. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could smell it on her.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cHer scent wasn\u2019t masked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMasked?\u201d Gaynor widened his pale green eyes. \u201cHow does a cur mask her scent?\u201d</p><p>Regan didn\u2019t need to be a mind reader to know the imp was lying. Casting a covert glance toward Jagr, she held her tongue as he gave a faint shake of his head. For whatever reason, he didn\u2019t want to challenge Gaynor.</p><p>\u201cDid she come alone to meet you?\u201d he instead asked.</p><p>\u201cShe came inside alone, but there were a half dozen curs surrounding the shop.\u201d There was no pretense in the flash of anger that rippled over his face. \u201cThe dolts completely ruined my daffodils. Oh, and the bitch took off with an entire batch of my peanut butter fudge.\u201d</p><p>Regan blinked. Okay, that was...weird.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would she take your fudge?\u201d</p><p>Gaynor stiffened, as if offended by the question. \u201cBecause it just happens to be the most famous fudge in the state. Perhaps in all of America.\u201d</p><p>Jagr snorted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hexed to compel the unwary to crave it like a drug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t prove that,\u201d Gaynor hissed.</p><p>Regan glanced toward Jagr. \u201cCan curs be hexed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re more susceptible than pure demons,\u201d he answered before turning back to the imp. \u201cHas she been back for more?\u201d</p><p>Gaynor shifted nervously closer to the bushes. Idiot. Did he actually think he could outrun a vampire?</p><p>\u201cWhen I opened the shop two days ago, she was waiting for me,\u201d he grudgingly confessed.</p><p>\u201cFor fudge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fudge, and to make another offer,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>Regan gave a lift of her brows. \u201cAn offer for what?\u201d</p><p>There was an odd pause, then with a movement so swift that it caught both Jagr and Regan off guard, Gaynor knocked aside a pile of branches to reveal a shimmering, swirling mist that seemed to hang in the darkness.</p><p>Although Culligan had never had the power necessary to create a portal, Regan had witnessed other imps weave a doorway in thin air. She\u2019d always been fascinated by the magical gateways when they\u2019d been at a distance. She wasn\u2019t nearly so delighted to have one close enough to tumble through.</p><p>\u201cThe offer is for you, Regan,\u201d the imp admitted, reaching to grasp her arm.</p><p>More astonished than frightened, Regan felt herself being yanked toward the swirling portal. She instinctively struggled, but the imp was unexpectedly strong as he planted his feet and scooted backward, inching her closer and closer to the opening.</p><p>Intent on their private battle, neither heard the warning growl from the furious vampire, not until he was lunging forward.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he roared, shoving Gaynor with enough force that it wrenched Regan\u2019s arm from his grasp.</p><p>It also tumbled both of them backward.</p><p>Straight into the waiting portal.</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d</p><p>Crawling on her hands and knees, Regan watched in horror as Gaynor disappeared into the shimmering mist, still entangled with the furious vampire. Oh, God, no. She reached out, her fingertips brushing the tip of Jagr\u2019s heavy boot just as the portal pulsed, flared, and then disappeared with an audible snap.</p><p>Suddenly alone in the darkness, Regan stared at the spot where Jagr had disappeared, as if stupidly waiting for him to jump out of thin air.</p><p>Christ. He was gone. He was really, really gone.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t have a chance in hell of following him.</p><p>\u201cShit, shit, shit.\u201d</p><p>Regan jumped to her feet, running through the night at full speed. Culligan had never shared the secrets of imp magic, but there had to be someone who knew how to trail a person through a portal.</p><p>Indifferent to the dangers that might lurk in the shadows, Regan returned to the truck still parked in front of the tea shop. Hopping into the driver\u2019s seat, she switched on the key that Jagr had left in the ignition, and struggled to force it into gear.</p><p>She\u2019d never actually driven before, but how hard could it be?</p><p>The thought had barely passed through her mind when she stomped on the long pedal that made the car go forward (at least it did on TV), and with a squeal of tires she slammed straight into one of the lovely dogwoods that lined the quiet street.</p><p>Well, crap...maybe it wasn\u2019t as easy as she\u2019d thought.</p><p>Turning off the engine, she tumbled out of the truck and sprinted between the nearest houses, heading directly north. Her head throbbed from where it had banged into the windshield and the neighborhood dogs were already howling at her presence, but at least she wasn\u2019t in danger of massacring any more innocent trees.</p><p>Leaping a wooden fence, she briefly considered Jagr\u2019s annoyance when he\u2019d discovered she was running like a maniac through the streets without a care to any curs that might be lurking nearby. No doubt she\u2019d have to listen to his furious lecture on her lack of brains if he...</p><p>A sharp pain ripped through her heart.</p><p>No, there were no ifs.</p><p>She would find him.</p><p>And he would be okay.</p><p>Nothing else was acceptable.</p><p>Refusing to contemplate the panic that churned through her stomach, Regan weaved her way through town. She caught the distant scent of a dew fairy and the even more distant scent of a hellhound prowling through a Dumpster, but nothing leaped out to eat her, so putting down her head, she called upon her considerable powers and plunged through the fields and meadows with a speed only a vampire could match.</p><p>The scenery was no more than a blur as she concentrated on retracing the path back to Tane\u2019s isolated lair.</p><p>At last she could see the crumbling red brick chimney in the distance, and ignoring the growing stitch in her side, she dodged past an abandoned barn and leaped over a small creek.</p><p>It never occurred to Regan that she might not be welcomed at the vampire stronghold without Jagr at her side. At least not until Tane\u2019s massive form abruptly vaulted from the second-storied balcony to block her path to the door.</p><p>Skidding to a halt, Regan barely avoided colliding into the very broad, very bare chest.</p><p>\u201cTane.\u201d She pressed a hand to her thundering heart. \u201cGod, you scared me.\u201d</p><p>Pinpricks of pain stabbed into her flesh as Tane allowed his power to be released into the night.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jagr?\u201d</p><p>She was smart enough to feel a jolt of fear at the fierce expression on Tane\u2019s beautiful face, but she was too concerned for Jagr to truly appreciate just how dangerous her position might be.</p><p>\u201cHe was taken through a portal by an imp,\u201d she said in a rush, too rattled to spell out more than the most pertinent information. \u201cI can\u2019t find him.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, Tane didn\u2019t press for details. It was enough to know a brother was in trouble.</p><p>His long, lethal fangs emerged, along with a dagger he pulled from the waistband of his khakis.</p><p>\u201cStay here. I\u2019ll try to pick up his trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, I want to go...\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her urgent demand to be taken with him, Tane slid past her and silently disappeared into the dark.</p><p>Regan clenched her teeth, knowing she\u2019d never catch him.</p><p>\u201cDamned vampires.\u201d</p><p>Briefly considering her limited options, Regan at last heaved a sigh and climbed the steps to the wide verandah.</p><p>She could return to the golf course and hope to stumble across a means to follow Jagr, but she wasn\u2019t so full of herself to believe that she would have better luck than a trained vampire assassin, who no doubt had had several hundred years to perfect his skills. The painful truth was she would likely be more a burden than help.</p><p>There was also the option of simply walking away and washing her hands of Jagr and everyone else determined to force her into a family she didn\u2019t want or need.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if she owed them anything.</p><p>Okay, Jagr had come in handy a time or two. Hell, he\u2019d just saved her from being pulled into the damned portal.</p><p>And no woman, no matter how innocent, could deny that he was a world-class lover who\u2019d made her first experience one she would remember for all eternity.</p><p>Still, he was possessive and bossy and ruthlessly worming his way into her heart. That alone should be enough to send her screaming into flight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t...of course.</p><p>Mere logic couldn\u2019t overcome the desperate need to rescue the aggravating beast.</p><p>Even if that meant doing the one thing she\u2019d sworn she would never, ever do.</p> <p>Squaring her shoulders, Regan entered the abandoned building, easily finding her way down to the basement where she was met by a military looking vampire guarding the opening to the lair.</p><p>Since he didn\u2019t attack at her approach, Regan could only assume that Tane hadn\u2019t left standing orders to kill on sight. In fact, the vampire actually bowed, making Regan halt in shock.</p><p>Was she supposed to bow back?</p><p>Curtsey?</p><p>She shook away the inane thoughts as the vampire straightened and regarded her with a stoic expression.</p> <p>\u201cMay I be of service?\u201d</p><p>Regan briefly struggled against the bitterness she\u2019d nurtured for thirty years. It was an ugly battle filled with less than admirable emotions.</p><p>Pride, envy, festering resentment.</p><p>Yeah, ugly. But thankfully short.</p><p>Less than a heartbeat passed before she was sucking in a deep breath and taking the irrevocable plunge.</p><p>\u201cI need to contact the Anasso,\u201d she said, relieved when the words came out almost steady.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d Without hesitation, the vampire pulled a cell phone from the pocket of his camouflage pants. He flipped it open and scrolled through his contacts before handing it to her. \u201cIt\u2019s a direct line.\u201d</p><p>Regan took the phone and, not giving herself time to consider the consequences, punched the send button.</p><p>There was a buzz on the other end, then before Regan was entirely prepared, a low, commanding voice came on the line.</p><p>\u201cTane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Regan was forced to stop and clear the lump from her throat. It had to be Styx. Who else would have a voice even more arrogant than Jagr? \u201cNo, this is...Regan.\u201d</p><p>There was a shocked pause, then the leader of all vampires softened his tone.</p><p>\u201cRegan, I cannot tell you how good it is to hear your voice,\u201d he murmured. \u201cDarcy has been most anxious to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw clenched, but she refused to be distracted. \u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p> <p>She could sense the moment he realized that this was not a social call.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Jagr hated magic.</p><p>As a vampire, he\u2019d become accustomed to being firmly on top of the food chain.</p><p>He was the bump in the night that scared all the other creatures.</p><p>For all his powers, however, he had no defense as Gaynor plunged the two of them into the portal, and he was surrounded by the relentless sting of the strange mist that seemed to bite into his skin with malicious glee. He had a brief moment to savor the knowledge he\u2019d managed to keep the imp\u2019s filthy hands off Regan before he was flung out of the portal with enough force to slam his head into a cement wall.</p><p>Briefly disoriented, he didn\u2019t realize that magic wasn\u2019t the only danger. Not until he heard the slam of a heavy metal door and he turned to discover he\u2019d been locked in a cell that was custom-made to hold demons.</p><p>Any demon.</p><p>Including vampires.</p><p>Furiously wiping the blood from his forehead, he slowly turned, allowing his senses to flow outward.</p><p>His first realization was that they were deep below ground (which at least meant no early morning sunrise), and that the cement walls and ceiling were several feet thick. His next realization was that there were a number of hexes etched on the walls, and thick steel doors that were specifically created to drain the strength of any demon stupid enough to become trapped.</p><p>A dark, vicious dread curled through him.</p><p>It had been centuries since he\u2019d been locked in a cage, but the memory was still vivid.</p><p>Starkly, painfully vivid.</p><p>He clenched his jaw, curling his hands into fists. Madness threatened to consume him. The same madness that had led to the bloody slaughter of his previous captors.</p><p>For a perilous moment he teetered on the edge, his ancient torment surging through him like a destructive wave. Then without warning, the image of Regan flashed through his mind and the panic receded.</p><p>Grasping onto the thought of the beautiful Were, Jagr pulled back from the darkness.</p><p>By the gods, he would not allow himself to lose control when Regan needed him. Nothing mattered but finding a means to escape so he could protect her.</p><p>His thoughts cleared until he was once again in command, although that didn\u2019t keep him from being seriously pissed off.</p><p>Trapped by a worthless imp.</p><p>He\u2019d never live it down. With a hiss of frustration, he moved to swing his arm against the door, belatedly discovering there\u2019d been enough silver mixed with the metal to make his forearm smolder.</p><p>\u201cGaynor, let me out,\u201d he roared, able to smell the imp on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, vampire,\u201d the imp\u2019s muffled voice echoed through the air. \u201cWhy did you have to interfere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have just signed your death warrant, imp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Jagr could pick up the sound of Gaynor\u2019s anxious pacing. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask to get involved in this mess. I wish that stupid cur had never come into my shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour regrets are just beginning,\u201d Jagr growled, his frustration deepening as he sensed his powers beginning to weaken. Dammit. Regan was out there alone. He had to get free. \u201cLet me out and I might just consider letting you live.\u201d</p><p>Gaynor laughed bitterly. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid? I may be a pathetic imp living in a podunk town, but even I\u2019ve heard of Jagr, the crazed Visigoth chief who slaughtered an entire clan of vampires. If I let you out, I\u2019ll be dead before I can blink.\u201d</p><p>The imp wasn\u2019t entirely wrong. On any other night, Jagr would be foaming at the mouth and unable to consider anything but the need to rip the imp into a hundred pieces.</p><p>Tonight, however, his only concern was Regan.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to leave here unharmed, and I swear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it, vamp. I\u2019m not opening that door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you intend to do. Kill me?\u201d he challenged.</p><p>\u201cAnd have a rabid posse of vampires out for my head? No, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Jagr was forced to take a step from the door as the burn of silver seeped through his clothing.</p><p>\u201cYou think my clan is not already on the hunt?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Even through the thick door, Jagr could hear the imp\u2019s rapid heartbeat. His fear was tangible.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t track me through a portal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, the world isn\u2019t big enough for you to hide,\u201d Jagr deliberately taunted.</p><p>\u201cHoly freaking hell.\u201d There was more pacing. \u201cNone of this is my fault.\u201d</p><p>Jagr hissed. \u201cYou endanger a pureblooded Were and kidnap a vampire, and you claim it\u2019s not your fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I did was invite Culligan to Hannibal,\u201d he whined. \u201cI didn\u2019t force the damned Were to follow. And for your information, I didn\u2019t have any intention of trying to capture Regan, no matter how much money Sadie offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spineless liar.\u201d Jagr\u2019s fangs ached with the need to sink deep in the imp\u2019s throat. \u201cYou deliberately led us to that spot where you had a portal waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly after you tracked me to the tea shop,\u201d he desperately argued. \u201cYou came after me\u2014I didn\u2019t go looking for trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were swift to try and take advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break, vampire,\u201d Gaynor muttered. \u201cI\u2019m an imp. What did you expect when you dropped the Were into my lap like an overripe plum? The curs are offering a damned fortune to get their hands on her.\u201d</p><p>The curs. Always the curs.</p><p>Someday soon he intended to rid the world of the mangy dogs.</p><p>Someday very soon.</p><p>\u201cAnd instead of a fortune, all you\u2019ve earned is a death sentence.\u201d</p><p>Gaynor\u2019s heartbeat raced to the point where Jagr wondered if it might burst. Then, without warning, the imp was moving swiftly away from Jagr\u2019s cell.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not taking the fall for this,\u201d he swore as he left. \u201cSadie got me into this, she can damned well get me out.\u201d</p><p>Left alone in the darkness, Jagr tilted back his head and screamed in fury.</p><p>Standing in the middle of the empty cave, Sadie viciously kicked the young male cur curled into a tight ball of misery on the ground.</p><p>She\u2019d crouched for hours in the darkness, watching for some sign of Regan and the vamp to emerge from the cave. Or at least to make some indication that they were preparing for the coming dawn.</p><p>At last she\u2019d grown bored with the waiting.</p><p>Patience was for losers, not for curs destined to make their mark in the world.</p><p>Creeping up the steep bluff, Sadie motioned for the cur she\u2019d commanded to keep guard to join her. She didn\u2019t have an actual plan in mind. She only knew that she was tired of hiding and plotting with nothing to show for her efforts.</p><p>Despite the lingering scent of vamp and Were, Sadie didn\u2019t have to reach the entrance of the cave to realize that it was empty. Infuriated, she realized that not only had her prey escaped, but she\u2019d been well and truly fooled by a few scraps of clothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a sharp motion, she\u2019d knocked her companion to the ground. Someone was going to pay for this latest disaster.</p><p>\u201cYou worthless piece of crap. How dare you let the Were escape.\u201d She punctuated her words with kicks, readily ignoring the fact that she was equally responsible for allowing the two to disappear. Shit rolled downhill. It was never her fault if there was someone else to blame. \u201cI told you not to take your eyes off this cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, I swear.\u201d The cur grunted as her foot connected with his cheek. \u201cThe vampire must have used his shadows to hide behind.\u201d</p> <p>Sadie clenched her fists. She didn\u2019t like being reminded that there were demons out there who possessed skills far beyond a mere cur.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your lame excuses. It was only luck that we stumbled across the Were\u2019s trail that led to this lair in the first place. How the hell are we supposed to find them now?\u201d</p><p>The cur tried to dig deeper in the dirt, as if that would protect him from the brutal kicks.</p><p>\u201cI thought you intended to lure her to the cabin with the imp.\u201d</p><p>Sadie growled. For God\u2019s sake, was the cur suicidal? He was pushing every kill-me button she possessed.</p> <p>\u201cAnd just what do you expect me to do with her pet vampire while I\u2019m busy capturing her?\u201d she gritted, her skin crawling with the need to shift. \u201cPolitely ask him not to kill me? Maybe I should invite Salvatore along as well?\u201d</p><p>Belatedly sensing Sadie was at the edge of her control, the cur wisely resorted to shameless pleading.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, mistress, I beg of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgiveness is not in my nature, stupid bastard.\u201d Preparing for another kick, Sadie was interrupted by the buzz of the phone she\u2019d stuck in her pocket. \u201cSaved by the bell, worm. Or should I say, the vibration?\u201d Ignoring the useless cur cowering on the ground, Sadie pulled out the phone and lifted her brows as she read the name flashing across the screen. Snapping open the phone, she pressed it to her ear. \u201cGaynor, tell me you have good news.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Her already strained temper threatened to combust as she listened to his stumbling, bumbling confession of capturing Jagr by mistake.</p> <p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m surrounded by morons,\u201d she gritted, her mind already sifting through the implications of this latest mess. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d He offered hesitant directions, clearly not overly anxious for their impending meeting. Which proved he wasn\u2019t entirely stupid. \u201cYou\u2019d better hope I can use this to my advantage, imp, or I\u2019ll eat your heart for breakfast,\u201d she warned before cutting the connection and shoving the phone back into her pocket. Reaching down, she grasped the cringing cur by the hair and yanked him to a kneeling position. \u201cI have a new task for you.\u201d</p><p>He nervously licked his lips. \u201cHow may I serve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan is separated from her vamp. I want you to take the remaining curs and find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>She tossed him backward, watching as he slammed into the wall and slid to the ground.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t screw this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, mistress,\u201d he managed to croak.</p><p>Regan\u2019s conversation with Styx was nothing if not to the point. She revealed no more than the fact that Jagr had been taken by an imp and, in turn, he promised he would be at Tane\u2019s lair within twenty-four hours.</p> <p>Short and sweet.</p><p>But Regan wasn\u2019t gullible enough to believe that it was a simple phone call.</p><p>Or that it wouldn\u2019t have long-term consequences.</p><p>Having accomplished all she could, Regan returned to the rooms Tane had offered them, and over the next few hours she learned every inch of them.</p><p>She clocked in a dozen miles pacing from one end to the other. She rearranged the small kitchen, she folded her new clothes, and placed them neatly back in the bags. At last she lay down on the bed, desperately hoping to catch the lingering scent of Jagr, only to discover whoever had come in to clean the lair had changed the sheets.</p><p>Not that a change of sheets could erase the memories of Jagr\u2019s tender touch, or the icy-fire of his kisses.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a power in the world that could accomplish that feat.</p><p>Ignoring the clang and whistle and outright screams of alarm that sounded in the back of her mind, Regan snuggled deeper into the mattress, allowing the image of Jagr poised above her, his expression one of fierce bliss as he thrust in and out of her body, to fill her thoughts.</p><p>Once he was safe, she would return to her futile battle of pretending she could walk away from him and all his unwanted complications without a twinge of remorse.</p><p>For now she simply needed to hang on to the ruthless certainty he would be rescued.</p><p>Time passed until Regan could feel the heavy sensation of the approaching dawn. Although she didn\u2019t fear the sun like the vampires, she possessed the blood of Were. She was by nature called to the night.</p><p>She shoved herself off the bed, a horrible dread lodged in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>Christ, if Jagr didn\u2019t return soon, he would be trapped until sunset.</p><p>Always assuming he wasn\u2019t being held somewhere that the sun could...</p><p>No.</p><p>Enough of this waiting. She might not possess the skills of an ancient vampire, but at least she could function during the day.</p><p>Storming into the hideous living room, Regan skirted past the whirlpool and was a mere step from the door when it flung open to reveal Tane\u2019s massive form.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded, knowing the answer before he even shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI could find nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>The golden features tightened. \u201cAs soon as the sun sets, I will return to the hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called Styx,\u201d she absently muttered, her thoughts centered on Jagr and the overriding need to be doing...something. Anything. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here tonight with the cavalry.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, Tane reached out to touch her cheek, his touch almost gentle.</p><p>\u201cJagr will be found, Regan.\u201d</p><p>Frustration flooded through her at the flat certainty in his voice. \u201cYeah, but before he\u2019s been staked or beheaded or tossed into the sun?\u201d</p><p>The vampire shrugged. \u201cThe curs want you. They\u2019ll keep him alive if they think they can use him to lure you into a trap.\u201d</p><p>She clung to that hope, but it didn\u2019t ease the desperate need to find and rescue Jagr.</p><p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s true, he\u2019ll be kept locked up. Maybe even tortured.\u201d She held the dark gaze, willing him to understand. \u201cTane, he can\u2019t go through that again. It might break him.\u201d</p><p>Only the lengthening of his terrifying fangs revealed that Tane not only understood, but was infuriated by the thought of his brother being harmed.</p><p>\u201cEven if he could be found, there\u2019s no way to rescue him now. The sun\u2019s already rising.\u201d His tone indicated his opinion of the sun. It wasn\u2019t good. His fingers brushed down her cheek, before he dropped his hand and stepped back. \u201cI know you\u2019re concerned, but our hands are tied until darkness falls.\u201d</p><p>She made a restless motion, her inner wolf at the end of its patience. \u201cI can\u2019t just wait.\u201d</p><p>The dark, faintly slanted eyes narrowed. \u201cYou do know that Jagr will decapitate me if anything happens to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to keep me from leaving?\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted, no doubt sensing the impending battle. \u201cNo, pretty wolf, I suspect that Jagr isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s had enough of prisons.\u201d His voice hardened with warning. \u201cJust don\u2019t get yourself killed. My health depends on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d she dryly promised.</p><p>Stepping back into the hall, Tane paused to send her a speaking glance.</p><p>\u201cIf you decide to drive, wolf, take one of the Hummers. It at least has a chance of surviving.\u201d</p><p>Regan ignored the slur to her driving ability. She had, after all, trashed his truck. Instead, she turned to make her way back to the bedroom.</p><p>Moving directly to a distant corner, she knelt before Jagr\u2019s heavy satchel.</p><p>Just for a moment, she hesitated.</p><p>After thirty years of being denied even the pretense of privacy, she possessed an intense dislike for the thought of invading anyone else\u2019s. Especially Jagr\u2019s, who had shared her endless humiliations.</p><p>Still, she wasn\u2019t so foolish as to go in search of him without some sort of weapon. Unlike other purebloods, she couldn\u2019t depend on shifting to fight her battles. She needed something sharp. And big.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, she forced herself to open the satchel, her fingers stilling as they encountered smooth leather instead of the cold, hard steel she\u2019d been expecting. With a rueful smile she pulled out the heavy book that was written in a language she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>She wistfully trailed her fingers over the aged leather of the cover. She\u2019d encountered various demons and warriors and even powerful leaders during her travels with Culligan, but none had offered such a fascinating mixture of contrasts.</p><p>Icily aloof and yet so terribly vulnerable. Strong and yet tender. Raw, ruthless power with the soul of a scholar.</p><p>With a shake of her head, Regan set the book on the floor and returned her attention to the satchel. This time, she had no trouble finding one of the numerous daggers that were stacked in the bottom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Careful to choose one without silver (with her current luck, she\u2019d probably stab herself), and big enough to put a nice-sized hole in an enemy, she tightly gripped the handle and headed out of the private rooms.</p><p>She half-expected to be halted as she retraced her steps out of the lair, but while the vampires watched her pass in creepy silence, not one leaped out to try and block her exit.</p><p>Thank God. She didn\u2019t think her dagger, no matter how big or shiny, was going to do much good against them.</p> <p>Regan jogged across the open fields, keeping her senses alert for any scent of Jagr.</p><p>If the imp had a brain, he would have taken his hostage halfway across the world, but Culligan had taught her that the flighty demons were content to leap first and consider later. If ever.</p><p>Of course, hoping she might stumble across Jagr was something like hoping she might find a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Still, she had to...</p><p>Regan halted, suddenly struck by a crazed thought.</p><p>Why search for a needle in the proverbial haystack when she could go directly to the source of her troubles?</p> <p>If she could track down the cur that had ordered Gaynor to capture her in the first place, then eventually the imp would make an appearance. The one thing that Regan was certain of was that the imp wouldn\u2019t want to be stuck with a furious vampire for long.</p><p>And she suddenly realized that she might actually possess the means to find the bitch.</p><p>Ignoring the urge to race as fast as possible back to Hannibal, Regan forced herself to maintain a steady pace that allowed her to continue her search for Jagr, as well as to keep guard for any lurking danger.</p><p>There was no use getting herself killed for what might very well turn out to be a wild-goose chase.</p><p>As she jogged, the sun crested the horizon, bathing the landscape in a soft haze of pale peach and rose. The light glittered off the dew clinging to the grass, fragmenting until it appeared the world was drenched in pastel.</p><p>Regan barely noticed the dazzling display. Or the dampness clinging to the hem of her jeans. She was on a mission, and nothing was going to distract her.</p> <p>Choosing a more direct route back to the tea shop, Regan hid in the bushes and studied the pretty structure for long minutes.</p><p>There was a gradual stirring in the quiet neighborhood. A woman dressed in a power suit climbed into her Lexus and roared down the street. An elder man swept his front porch. A child pressed his eager face against the window.</p><p>All mundanely human, without a beastie to be seen.</p><p>Regan straightened and dashed across the street, knowing it was now or never.</p><p>Skirting the house with all its froufrou trellises and cheesy birdbaths, she allowed her nose to lead her to the kitchen window, using her considerable strength to shove up the sash a few inches and breathe in the various scents.</p><p>She grimaced at the intoxicating aromas. Holy crap. Jagr hadn\u2019t been wrong when he accused Gaynor of hexing his food. Even with her immunity to the magic, she could feel her mouth watering in response.</p><p>Damn imps.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she concentrated on sorting through the various teas, pastries, and candies. At last, she caught and held the scent of peanut butter fudge.</p> <p>As she had hoped, the smell was distinctive. Rich, creamy peanut butter with a hefty dose of imp magic.</p><p>Which meant that she wouldn\u2019t mistake it for any other fudge that seemed to be one of the basic food groups in Hannibal.</p><p>Circling the tea shop one last time, even knowing it was a futile effort to discover some hint of Jagr or the damned imp, she at last turned on her heel and began jogging toward the east.</p><p>Gaynor had admitted that he\u2019d smelled the river on Sadie, and since Jagr hadn\u2019t detected a lie, she was going with the hope the cur would still be near it.</p><p>Refusing to consider the knowledge that the Mississippi River ran over two thousand miles, she jogged through the near empty streets, ignoring the howling dogs and occasional car that whizzed past.</p><p>Briefly, she wondered if Levet found a safe place to turn into stone. Although she\u2019d heard over the years that gargoyles were close to indestructible, she didn\u2019t know if that was true for miniature ones, and unlike Jagr, she found the tiny demon oddly charming. She would hate for him to be injured trying to help her.</p><p>Thoughts of Levet were driven from her mind as she reached the quaint, historic section of town. She turned right at the steps that led to the lighthouse on top of the bluff, and hurried past the antique and gift shops that now filled the old buildings. Thank God she\u2019d taken the time to sniff out Gaynor\u2019s particular recipe for fudge. The entire area reeked of the stuff.</p><p>Turning again she passed by the bed-and-breakfast that had once catered to the passing steamboats, and climbed the levee behind it. From there it was an easy jog down to the edge of the river.</p><p>She briefly hesitated before she turned south, grimly refusing to glance toward the bluff where she\u2019d shared the cave with Jagr. The curs would want a place outside of town where they could easily hunt away from prying eyes.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t find some sign of them within a few hours, she would backtrack and try her luck north of town.</p><p>Not much of a plan, but it was better than sitting in Tane\u2019s lair and pacing holes in the carpet.</p><p>Well, at least marginally better, she acknowledged three hours later, tugging her jeans free of yet another thornbush from hell. Scouring the banks and steep bluffs along the river was not only time-consuming, but it was wearisome work, even for a pureblooded Were. Clearly the whole Huck Finn lifestyle was far more romantic in books than real life.</p><p>With a sigh, she leaned against a rock that jetted from the river. She was only a handful of miles south of Hannibal, but she might as well have been in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>There was no sound of traffic, no laughter of children, no barking dogs. In fact, there wasn\u2019t even the call of a bird...</p><p>Regan shoved herself upright.</p><p>She might be in the middle of nowhere, but there should have been the usual wildlife scurrying through the dense trees. A bird, a squirrel, a curious raccoon.</p><p>The fact that there wasn\u2019t could only mean that there was something dangerous in the area. Something that had been around long enough to drive them away.</p><p>Feeling her strength return, along with a flood of hope, Regan grimly headed up the steeply angled bank, using the dagger to hack through the thicker foliage. At least the damned thing was going to come in handy for something.</p><p>Regan reached the top of the bluff and slowed her pace to a mere crawl. If she were right (not at all a certainty), there was a pack of curs roaming these woods and they had the witch\u2019s spell to keep then hidden from her senses.</p><p>It seemed a good idea to try to avoid tripping over one.</p><p>Slipping silently from tree to tree, she listened carefully, depending on her superior sight and hearing to warn her of any danger. The sun slowly moved overhead, warning that time was passing, but Regan ignored the urge to rush. This was supposed to be a...what did they call it? A recon mission. A search and get-out-alive sort of deal.</p><p>On the point of accepting she was wasting her time, again, she was hit by the unmistakable scent of peanut butter fudge. Yes! She continued forward and at last caught sight of a tin roof through the trees.</p><p>A cabin. It had to be.</p><p>Her heart lodged in her throat as she edged cautiously closer. Yep. Definitely a cabin. Peering through the trees, she studied the wooden structure. It wasn\u2019t much. Just a few unpainted boards slapped together with a door and two windows. The attached shed wasn\u2019t much better, only without the windows, and leaning to the point it threatened to become detached from the rusty tin roof.</p><p>A place that had gone past charming, straight to rustic.</p><p>And not at all the setting she would have pictured for a pack of curs with authority issues.</p><p>Of course, that\u2019s what usually made a good hiding place a good hiding place.</p><p>Crouching behind yet another bush, Regan kept a watch on the building, her nerves stretched tight by the uncanny silence. The place appeared deserted, but she wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>Isolated cabin. Seemingly abandoned.</p><p>It was a trap waiting to happen.</p><p>It was also the closest thing to a clue she\u2019d found all day.</p><p>Gathering her courage, Regan slipped silently toward the cabin, her heart pounding so loudly she feared it would give her away. Astonishingly, nothing attacked (wonders of wonders), and pressed against the rough planks, she carefully inched up high enough to peer into the window.</p><p>A battered chair, a heavy dresser, a fireplace that looked like it had been recently used.</p><p>No howling curs. No magic-wielding witch.</p><p>No Sophie. No Gaynor.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, too stubborn, or maybe it was too stupid, to concede defeat.</p><p>Straightening, she inched her way toward the attached shed, keeping herself pressed against the cabin, as if that somehow made her invisible. Hey, it was how they did it in the movies. Then pausing only a moment to lean her ear against the door, she pushed it open.</p><p>Preparing to bolt at the first hint of danger, Regan scanned the shadowed interior, not surprised to find a handful of rusting tools collecting cobwebs in the corners, or the wooden barrel that had been overturned to play table for a kerosene lamp.</p><p>The whip and numerous daggers, swords, and handguns placed on a rickety shelf were a bit more unexpected.</p><p>It was the bedraggled, nearly unrecognizable imp chained to the wall, however, that was the real showstopper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Culligan.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Just for a moment, Regan remained frozen in the doorway.</p> <p>After days of endless, grueling, relentless searching, she\u2019d stumbled over her damned prey when she wasn\u2019t even looking for him.</p><p>How was that for irony?</p><p>She clenched the dagger, studying the imp who\u2019d made her life a living hell.</p><p>He looked...ghastly.</p><p>Blindfolded and leaning heavily against the chains, as if he couldn\u2019t hold his own weight, his red hair was matted into disgusting clumps, and his white skin was marred with dirt and dried blood.</p> <p>Gone was the brash, conceited demon who had taken such delight in tormenting her, and in its place was a sad, pathetic waste of a creature wearing nothing more than a red thong.</p><p>A smile of absolute pleasure curled her lips as he weakly attempted to lift his head, clearly sensing someone had entered the shed, but too disoriented to recognize her scent.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he croaked. \u201cPlease, help me. I\u2019m being held against my will. Please...\u201d His plea was cut short as she crossed the narrow space to rip off the blindfold. He blinked against the sunlight that spilled into the room, then his eyes widened in horror as he recognized his rescuer. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Culligan,\u201d she purred, her gaze lowering to the small medallion tied around his neck. The witch\u2019s amulet. And the reason she hadn\u2019t sensed the bastard when she\u2019d first approached the cabin.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he rasped, struggling against the heavy chains that held him.</p><p>\u201cSurprise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that you couldn\u2019t escape me.\u201d Reaching out, Regan ripped the amulet from the leather thong around Culligan\u2019s neck and tucked it into her pocket. Immediately the shed was filled with the overpowering smell of plums, while her scent disappeared. Well, well. Wasn\u2019t that convenient? Her smile widened with wicked pleasure. \u201cOf course, at the time I didn\u2019t expect the curs to be so rude as to steal my toy and hide him from me. I hope they didn\u2019t break you.\u201d</p><p>Sweat bloomed on his forehead, visions of his death dancing in his head.</p><p>\u201cThere are curs crawling all over the place,\u201d he desperately attempted to frighten her away. \u201cAre you trying to get caught?\u201d</p><p>He did have a point.</p><p>A smart Were would cut out Culligan\u2019s heart and escape before the curs returned.</p><p>Unfortunately, her mission was no longer one of simple revenge. Jagr needed her. And if it meant keeping this bastard alive and risking her neck...then so be it.</p><p>Of course, that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t have some fun with the jackass.</p> <p>Lifting the dagger, she drew a thin line over his heart, watching the blood drip down his chest.</p><p>\u201cActually, there\u2019s not a cur to be found,\u201d she mocked.</p><p>He shuddered, although she hadn\u2019t truly hurt him. Yet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trap. They\u2019ll be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>She pressed the dagger deeper. \u201cNot in time to keep me from carving out your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He struggled to breathe, his eyes wild with delicious fear. \u201cLet\u2019s not be hasty, Regan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasty?\u201d Fury made her blood boil. \u201cI\u2019ve waited thirty years to kill you. It\u2019s all I dreamed of night after night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? I\u2019ve been like a father to you.\u201d He squealed as the dagger slid deeper. \u201cOkay, maybe not a father, but don\u2019t forget I saved you from that ditch. You could have died if it weren\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cDitch, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was more of a culvert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worthless piece of shit, I\u2019ve talked to Gaynor,\u201d she hissed. \u201cI know the curs gave me to you in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Terror flashed through the pale green eyes before Culligan was frantically attempting to cover his ass.</p><p>\u201cGaynor? You can\u2019t believe a word he says. He deliberately tricked me into coming to Hannibal.\u201d His face tightened. \u201cTreacherous bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d believe that treacherous bastard if he told me the sky was green before I would believe a word that came from your filthy mouth.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the dagger stuck directly over his heart, licking his lips.</p><p>\u201cRight, I get it. You\u2019re angry. I didn\u2019t treat you as well as I should have. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t come to an...understanding.\u201d</p><p>Her sharp laugh echoed through the small shed. \u201cUnderstanding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. Just tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>A few days ago what she wanted was this imp dead. Slowly, painfully, and by her hand.</p><p>Now she had to accept that there were more important things.</p><p>Jagr.</p><p>And the truth of her past.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is answers,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me how you got your nasty hands on me when I was a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I found you in a...\u201d He screamed as Regan pushed the dagger a hair\u2019s breadth from his heart. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more lie, and you\u2019re dead,\u201d she warned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t find me in a ditch.\u201d</p><p>Cowering with a fear that warmed Regan\u2019s vengeful soul, Culligan gave up on his lame story.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d He sucked in a careful breath. \u201cI was in Chicago, minding my own business, I might add, when I was approached by a cur who claimed he had some hot cargo he needed to unload in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the hot cargo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your sisters,\u201d he clarified. \u201cThe curs had blundered and attracted the attention of the local social services agency. The humans had already taken one of the babies, but the curs managed to slip away with the other three.\u201d</p><p>Regan stiffened. Well, that little tidbit would please Darcy. According to Salvatore, her sister had never been able to discover how she\u2019d ended up in the hands of humans. And of course, she now knew how Culligan had managed to get a pureblooded Were in his power, if not how the curs had gotten a hold of her and her sisters in the first place.</p><p>\u201cThey tried to hush it all up, but the rumors hit the streets, and the curs were afraid that the word might reach the ears of the Weres. They needed to get rid of the evidence before they were caught red-handed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to my sisters?\u201d she demanded, astonished to discover that the answer actually mattered.</p><p>What happened to the lone wolf who didn\u2019t give a crap about her family? The one who would rather have her eyes clawed out than be invited to Thanksgiving dinner?</p><p>Jagr happened, a soft voice whispered in the back of her mind.</p><p>He\u2019d made her...soft. Damn him.</p><p>Unaware of her inner conflict, Culligan gave another glance at the knife stuck in his chest.</p><p>\u201cOne stayed with the humans, and one they smuggled to curs out of state. They gave you to me, and the other...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth clenched. \u201cThe curs have one of my sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her, but they claim to have one. They\u2019re supposedly doing some kind of experiments on her.\u201d</p><p>The air was squeezed from her lungs. \u201cWhat kind of experiments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a scientist?\u201d The petulant words became a screech of agony as she twisted the knife. \u201cOw. Damn you, it\u2019s something about making the curs more powerful. That\u2019s all I know, I swear.\u201d</p><p>So the suspicion that the mysterious Caine was obsessed with creating the cur version of Frankenstein wasn\u2019t as farfetched as it seemed. Christ. Was the man a nut job? Who knew what could happen if he started screwing with the ancient magic that turned a human to a cur.</p><p>Of course, had Salvatore been any different? He\u2019d deliberately altered the DNA of her and her sisters to produce females who wouldn\u2019t shift. And he did it so they could become some sort of broodmares to resurrect the fading Weres.</p><p>Damn arrogant men and their God complexes.</p><p>In a perfect world, women would be in charge.</p><p>\u201cIf the curs have my sister, then what do they want with me?\u201d she gritted.</p><p>\u201cMy only guess is that you\u2019re the backup in case your sister kicks the bucket before they\u2019re done experimenting with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastards.\u201d</p><p>Culligan shivered. \u201cYou have no idea. Release me, Regan, and I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where they\u2019re holding my sister captive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d His ready lie faltered on his lips as her eyes narrowed in warning. \u201cNo, not...exactly, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorthless,\u201d she muttered, abruptly realizing that was the perfect word to describe this sorry excuse for a demon.</p><p>Culligan was a weak, greedy fool who offered nothing to the world.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even make a decent villain.</p><p>Her grip tightened on the handle of the dagger, her bitter, choking thirst for revenge somehow lessened by the thought. It was as if she\u2019d just hauled the boogeyman out of the closet, and discovered he was nothing more than a spineless slug.</p><p>Culligan quivered as she unwittingly dug the knife deeper. \u201cDammit, watch that thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In answer, Regan leaned forward, her expression ruthless. She\u2019d pressed her luck far enough. It was time to get the information she\u2019d come for.</p><p>\u201cThis is my last question. And believe me when I tell you, your life depends on your answer.\u201d The tip of the blade rested against his throbbing heart. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jagr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe vampire who...who Darcy sent to Hannibal.\u201d She struggled to hide her aching dread. Culligan would only try to use it to his advantage. \u201cGaynor took him through a portal. Where would he go?\u201d</p><p>Culligan glared, although he was smart enough not to struggle. \u201cHow the hell would I know? In case you missed the memo, I\u2019ve been a little tied up since coming to Hannibal.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Regan yanked the knife from the imp\u2019s chest and pressed it to his most precious jewels.</p><p>\u201cGaynor\u2019s been your friend for centuries. You have to know something.\u201d</p><p>Panic flashed through the green eyes. As expected, the idiot was far more afraid of being castrated than killed.</p> <p>\u201cAre you a complete psycho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what thirty years of torture will do to a perfectly nice girl.\u201d Her voice could have rivaled Jagr\u2019s for ice. \u201cNow start talking, or lose it.\u201d</p><p>Sweat poured down his body as he struggled to find his voice. \u201cAll I can tell you is that in the past, Gaynor always had an underground lair with a cell he could use to trap lesser demons.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy would he trap demons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can make a fortune in ransom if you find demons with clans or families who are willing to pay to get them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d She shook her head in disgust. There should be an open season on imps. \u201cWould this cell be strong enough to hold a vampire?\u201d</p> <p>Culligan shrugged. \u201cIf he has it properly hexed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would it be?\u201d</p><p>A cunning expression slid over the lean features. The jackass intended to try and con her. Or at least he intended to until she dug the knife into one of his danglies.</p><p>\u201cArrg.\u201d</p><p>His eyes crossed, and Regan waited to see if he would pass out. When he didn\u2019t, she leaned close enough to touch nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cWhere would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be close to his business...\u201d The words came out in small, pained gasps. \u201cThat tea shop he\u2019s running.\u201d</p><p>Regan froze, a sick sensation clutching her stomach. \u201cHow can you be certain?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGaynor might be able to conjure a portal, but he barely has any more strength than I do. He can\u2019t travel over a few hundred feet if he has a passenger. If he took your vampire, he couldn\u2019t have gone far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was there, why wouldn\u2019t I sense him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hexes would block any scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Regan straightened abruptly, stepping away from Culligan as she cursed her stupidity. What an idiot she was. If she hadn\u2019t been in such a panic to find Jagr, then maybe she wouldn\u2019t have overlooked the most obvious.</p><p>God, he might have been right beneath her feet while she was creeping around the tea shop...</p><p>She gave a sharp shake of her head.</p><p>Dammit, she\u2019d wasted enough time.</p><p>She had to get to Jagr.</p><p>Whirling on her heel, she headed for the door, intent on returning to the tea shop. Even if she couldn\u2019t move Jagr until night fell, she needed to find him.</p><p>To be near him.</p><p>How frightening was that?</p><p>Regan was stepping from the shed when a voice behind her abruptly reminded her that Culligan was still chained to the wall.</p><p>\u201cHey, wait, where are you going? You can\u2019t leave me here.\u201d</p><p>Turning, she regarded him with a hint of surprise. In her hurry to reach Jagr, she\u2019d simply forgotten him.</p><p>The imp who\u2019d made her life a misery for thirty years.</p><p>The imp who she\u2019d pledged to torture and kill.</p><p>It no doubt revealed some deep, earth-shattering change in her psyche, but she didn\u2019t have time to care.</p><p>\u201cActually, I can,\u201d she retorted, consoling whatever thirst for revenge that might linger with the knowledge the curs seemed to be doing a bang-up job of making Culligan miserable.</p><p>As if reading her mind, Culligan struggled frantically against the shackles that held him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll kill me. Do you want that on your conscience?\u201d</p><p>She slowly lifted her brows. \u201cFrankly, Culligan, I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d</p><p>As exit lines went, it was pretty damned excellent, and Regan couldn\u2019t halt a smug smile as she stepped out of the shed and slammed the door behind her.</p><p>Later she might regret not slicing him open and using his entrails as fish bait, but for now she was content to leave his torture in the hands of the curs.</p><p>The smile and contentment lasted all of two seconds.</p><p>Just long enough for the familiar male cur to step from the trees.</p><p>Duncan.</p><p>For an odd, timeless moment they simply stared at one another in shock. Then without warning, he lifted his arm to throw something directly at her face.</p><p>Regan instinctively ducked, expecting a knife or sword to lodge itself in the door behind her.</p><p>Instead, there was a brilliant explosion, and she had only a second to acknowledge that she\u2019d failed Jagr when the world went black.</p><p>The sun was painting the horizon with its last fading rays when Regan struggled to shake the painful cobwebs out of her head.</p><p>Freaking hell. She felt as if she\u2019d been hit by a cement truck.</p><p>At last, ignoring the bursts of agony in the back of her head, she forced open her reluctant eyes. Well...shit. She should have kept them closed.</p><p>Not that pretending this was all a horrible nightmare would change the fact that she was currently tied to a tree with chains that held enough silver to sap her strength and leave raw burns on her skin. Or that she\u2019d been moved from the cabin to one of the small islands covered in trees and underbrush that dotted the middle of the river.</p><p>Still fuzzy, Regan watched as Duncan stepped out of the canvas tent stuck in the center of the small clearing.</p><p>She swallowed her instinctive growl.</p><p>Damn the bastard. It was bad enough he\u2019d given her a headache from hell and tied her to a tree like some sort of animal, but she\u2019d been in la-la land the entire afternoon.</p><p>She was never going to get to Jagr at this rate.</p><p>The handsome cur came to a halt directly before her, looking considerably worse for the wear with his long hair hanging in tangles around his lean face and his black pants marred with dirt. His shirt was missing altogether.</p><p>She scowled in frustration, ridiculously pleased when he took a wary step backward.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>With an effort, the cur managed a brittle hint of his former arrogance.</p><p>\u201cJust a little spell bomb I borrowed from Sadie\u2019s pet witch before I ripped out her throat.\u201d</p><p>Regan blinked, strangely shocked by the blunt confession. \u201cYou killed the witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe amulets hold a spell to mask the scent of anyone wearing it.\u201d Duncan grimaced. \u201cUnfortunately, it also holds an added spell, so the witch can track it from anywhere in the world. Sadie\u2019s nasty way of keeping control of her pack. No witch, no GPS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, you couldn\u2019t just take it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd announce my scent to every Were and vampire who has flocked to Hannibal? Not bloody likely. Without the witch, I have all the benefits of the amulet, without any of the unpleasant side effects.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted. \u201cWho says there\u2019s no honor among thieves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be thanking me, luv.\u201d His gaze deliberately dropped to the pocket where she had hidden the amulet she\u2019d stolen from Culligan. Obviously he\u2019d searched her before tying her up. \u201cBesides, I lost any claim to honor when I threw my lot in with Caine thirty years ago. I should have known better, but the man does have a way with words. He\u2019s kissed the blarney stone, as my mum would say, and he convinced me that his crazy ideas were actually possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaine.\u201d Her eyes narrowed in fury as she futilely struggled against the burning chains. \u201cYou were with the cur who stole us. You bastard. How did he get his hands on four pureblooded children?\u201d</p><p>Shock rippled over his face. \u201cHow did you...\u201d He cut off his words as he shoved his hands through his tangled hair. \u201cNever mind. Caine has never been willing to admit how he got a hold of you and your sisters. All I know is that he showed up at the Illinois hunting grounds with the four of you, claiming that he\u2019d been given a prophecy that the blood of the Weres would make us whole.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes, the cornerstone of every great cult. Some mysterious prophecy...the promise of greatness...yadda yadda.</p><p>\u201cA prophecy from whom?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Duncan shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s one of those questions no one had the balls to ask. Or maybe we just didn\u2019t want to ask. He promised power, immortality. The opportunity to go from the bottom of the dung heap to the top.\u201d The cur snorted in self-disgust. \u201cBlimey, I should have known he was full of shit when he took us to Chicago and nearly got us arrested.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His story confirmed what she\u2019d learned from Gaynor and Culligan, but it didn\u2019t explain how or why the cur had managed to steal four pureblooded Weres.</p><p>Regan turned her mind away from the past. She might never discover how Caine had gotten his filthy hands on her, and for the moment it didn\u2019t really matter. All she truly cared about was finding some means of getting free so she could get to Jagr.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s so full of shit, then why have you kidnapped me?\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>His expression tightened with annoyance. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to kidnap you. I went back to the cabin to capture Sadie. Of course, the bitch is never around when I actually need her.\u201d</p><p>Capture Sadie?</p><p>Okay, that made about zero sense.</p><p>\u201cI thought the two of you were packmates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s as psychotic as Caine, and I\u2019m not taking the fall for either of them.\u201d</p> <p>Regan shook her head. Obviously the spell bomb had left her as thick as a stump. She didn\u2019t have a clue what he was yammering about.</p><p>And in truth, she didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>Within minutes the sun would disappear. She had to get to Jagr.</p><p>\u201cSo if you wanted Sadie, why did you kidnap me?\u201d</p><p>Yanking his hands through his hair yet again, Duncan paced the small clearing.</p><p>\u201cI have to hope you\u2019ll do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo for what?\u201d</p><p>The cur halted, sucking in a deep breath before slowly turning to stab her with a hard, ruthless gaze.</p><p>\u201cI want to negotiate a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA deal with Caine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>Yep. Definitely thick as a stump.</p><p>\u201cYou...want to negotiate with Salvatore?\u201d she at last managed to sputter. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Resignation chased away the brittle arrogance, offering the first genuine glimpse of the cur.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m weary of this suicide mission. Not to mention being Sadie\u2019s whipping boy,\u201d he confessed, his voice harsh. \u201cI\u2019m willing to trade everything I know about Caine and his plot against the lair if I can get a promise the Weres will offer me protection.\u201d</p><p>Regan suddenly didn\u2019t doubt his sincerity, just his sanity.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever met Salvatore?\u201d she demanded. \u201cHe\u2019s not the forgive and forget type. I doubt a bit of gossip about Caine is going to change that.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s eyes snapped with fury. \u201cFine, if he doesn\u2019t care about Caine, then what about your sister?\u201d</p><p>Against her will, Regan\u2019s heart halted, easily revealing to the cur\u2019s sensitive ears just how much the information about her sister meant to her. Damn, she knew that the unwelcome emotions would be a pain in the ass.</p><p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cYou know where Caine\u2019s holding her?\u201d</p><p>He paused, as if considering a lie, then with obvious reluctance, confessed the truth.</p><p>\u201cHe moves her around a lot, but I know where most of his labs are hidden. It would only be a matter of time before you could corner him.\u201d</p><p>Regan frowned. The information was just the sort of vague, unreliable crap that anyone could make up. Still, she couldn\u2019t dismiss even a remote possibility of rescuing her sister.</p><p>She, of all people, understood that miracles could occasionally occur.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean, however, that the arrogant King of Weres would be willing to make a deal with the treacherous cur.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Salvatore trust you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ve already proven to be a traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to capture Sadie,\u201d he growled in frustration. \u201cI intended to hand her over as a gesture of goodwill, but you came out of the cabin instead of her. Now I have no choice but to hope that by not handing you over to Caine when I could have, I\u2019ve proven my intentions are pure.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. If Duncan\u2019s intentions were pure then she was the freaking Queen of England.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOkay, my intentions are completely self-serving, but if you want your sister back, I\u2019m your best hope.\u201d</p><p>Regan gritted her teeth. It might piss her off to give into blatant blackmail, but at the moment she\u2019d do anything, including selling her soul, to gain her freedom and get to Jagr.</p><p>Besides, if there was even a remote chance that her sister could be rescued, then surely she should take it.</p><p>\u201cFine, let me go, and I\u2019ll contact Salvatore...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he rudely interrupted, his expression hard.</p><p>She struggled against the chains, ignoring the searing pain that jolted through her body. She\u2019d endured far worse over the years.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this crap,\u201d she hissed. \u201cRelease me or I swear to God Salvatore will be the least of your concern.\u201d</p><p>He paled at the stark threat in her voice, but stubbornly held his ground.</p><p>\u201cI need his word that he\u2019ll give me his protection before I release you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how the hell is he supposed to give you his word?\u201d Regan narrowed her gaze. \u201cDid you kidnap him, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next best thing.\u201d With two long strides, Duncan was reaching to yank aside a blanket that had been draped over a nearby bush.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t a bush.</p><p>Her eyes widened in horror as she recognized the tiny gargoyle currently encased in stone.</p><p>\u201cLevet,\u201d she breathed, her gaze shifting to stab Duncan with fury. \u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not hurt. In a few minutes he\u2019ll awake and he can contact Salvatore directly.\u201d</p><p>Her brows snapped together. \u201cHe\u2019s a gargoyle, not a cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll gargoyles, no matter how tiny, can open a portal in another\u2019s mind.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced at the thought of that strange rip in space that Gaynor had conjured opening in someone\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d</p><p>Duncan regarded her with a hint of surprise, as if startled she could be so clueless.</p><p>\u201cNot a physical portal. More like a...wireless connection. Which means it can\u2019t be overheard or traced even by magical means.\u201d His hand absently lifted to stroke the amulet hung about his neck. \u201cNo one will know about this call except the three of us and Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParanoid much?\u201d she muttered, feeling stupid she hadn\u2019t known about Levet\u2019s skill.</p><p>He glared at her taunting, his expression tight in the thickening shadows.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t met Caine. He might be a mystical freak, but he\u2019s smart as hell and he has his personal spies everywhere. There\u2019s never been anyone who\u2019s tried to double-cross him who\u2019s lived to tell the tale.\u201d</p><p>About to inform the cur that Caine couldn\u2019t begin to compete with Salvatore when it came to ruthless cunning, Regan was distracted by the unmistakable crack of stone.</p><p>Turning her head, she watched in awe as the granite crumbled from the statue image of Levet to reveal the gargoyle beneath.</p><p>\u201cSacrebleu.\u201d With a mighty shake, Levet rid himself of the clinging bits of stone, waddling forward and waving his arms in anger. \u201cYou mangy, lice-ridden dog, I\u2019m going to...\u201d Belatedly spotting Regan tied to the tree, Levet widened his eyes in alarm. \u201cMa cherie, what are you doing here? Are you harmed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I am is pissed off,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Levet frowned as he glanced around the island. \u201cWhere\u2019s your vampire?\u201d</p><p>Regan turned to glare at Duncan. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for me and he\u2019s not going to be happy if I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>Duncan planted his fists on his hips. \u201cGet the gargoyle to contact Salvatore, and you\u2019re free as a bird.\u201d</p><p>She ground her teeth, knowing she was between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>Of course, a voice whispered in the back of her head, it wasn\u2019t the first time.</p><p>Hell, it wasn\u2019t even the first time today.</p><p>And with her luck, it wouldn\u2019t be the last.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d She turned her attention to the wary gargoyle. \u201cLevet, I need a favor.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Despite Jagr\u2019s grim determination to keep the howling demons at bay, the passing hours began to take their toll. Pacing the cramped prison, he felt his powers being ruthlessly drained even as the walls seemed to close in around him.</p><p>Memories of the endless years of torture seared through his mind, clenching his muscles until he was curled into a shuddering ball in the corner.</p><p>At last, not even the image of his beautiful Regan could hold back the hovering insanity.</p><p>In desperation, Jagr sank into the deep, death-like sleep only a vampire could achieve.</p><p>The comatose state left him vulnerable to attack, but it conserved his strength and, more importantly, it muted the black rage that threatened to consume him.</p><p>He was unaware of the passing hours. At least he was unaware until the soothing blackness was stirred by the sound of approaching footsteps outside his cell.</p><p>Slowly he allowed his consciousness to rise back to the surface, careful to keep his body perfectly still. At a glance he would look like a corpse, no heartbeat, no pulse, not even a breath. It was an ability that had served vampires well over the years.</p><p>Who would fear a dead man?</p><p>There was a scraping at the door, almost as if whoever was on the other side was unfamiliar with the lock. At last, there was a distinctive click and the door slid open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jagr\u2019s fangs lengthened as the footsteps edged toward his seemingly unconscious form.</p><p>His first thought was that there was no scent. An impossibility without the assistance of a witch. His second thought was that the intruder hadn\u2019t bothered to close and lock the door.</p><p>Freedom.</p> <p>With grim effort, he leashed his brutal surge of hope.</p><p>There would be no escape until he\u2019d dealt with the enemy who was stalking slowly toward him.</p><p>With his eyes closed and the creature\u2019s scent masked, Jagr silently measured the sound of the footsteps.</p><p>Closer, closer, closer...</p><p>There was a stir of air as the intruder knelt beside him, clearly believing he was dead, or at least incapacitated.</p> <p>It would be the last mistake the fool ever made.</p><p>Preparing to attack, Jagr allowed the bloodlust he\u2019d so desperately tried to keep at bay to flow freely through his body. With his strength muted by the damned hexes, he needed the fury to fuel his powers.</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d</p><p>The soft voice cut through the silence, but Jagr was past hearing. His only thought was to kill the enemy so he could reach the door and escape.</p><p>With a movement too swift for even the most skilled demon to avoid, Jagr shot his arm upward, grasping his enemy around the throat.</p><p>There was a gurgling moan as he wrenched his eyes open, staring at the pale, beautiful face poised above him.</p> <p>Something flickered in the back of his mind. Some strange alarm that clamored for attention, but the bloodlust made his gaze flicker with a haze of red, obscuring the delicate features and drowning out the distress that clutched at his heart.</p><p>Kill.</p><p>He had to kill to be free.</p><p>With a low roar, he surged to his feet, still holding his prey by the neck. It was surprisingly slender. As easy to snap as a twig.</p><p>\u201cJagr,\u201d a voice rasped. \u201cIt\u2019s Regan.\u201d</p><p>Regan.</p><p>The bloodlust faltered.</p><p>That name...</p> <p>With a rough motion, he jerked the squirming captive closer, burrowing his head into the curve of her neck. Nothing. No scent. No explanation for why he was halting his killing blow.</p><p>\u201cJagr...please,\u201d the voice pleaded, a hand touching his face in with a soft, familiar touch.</p><p>Jagr shook his head, dropping the creature as he struggled to clear his mind.</p><p>Instinct howled for blood, but a more powerful force refused to give into the screaming need.</p><p>He knew this woman, a voice whispered in the back of his fogged mind. She was...</p><p>His.</p><p>His to protect.</p><p>Shuddering against the fierce desire to attack, Jagr wrapped his arms around himself. Shit. He truly was going mad.</p><p>\u201cJagr?\u201d The woman painfully struggled to her feet, either too courageous, or too stubborn, to remain down. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay back,\u201d he growled in warning.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He gave another shake of his head. \u201cWhy can I not smell you?\u201d</p><p>Beautiful green eyes widened, then with a jerky rush she reached into the pocket of her too-tight jeans to reveal a small amulet. She licked her lips as he tracked her every movement, his fangs exposed and his eyes no doubt glowing with hunger. He didn\u2019t need to smell her fear to recognize it.</p><p>Careful to keep her motion slow and unthreatening, the female tossed the amulet toward the open door.</p><p>Immediately the sweet scent of midnight jasmine filled the cell, threading its way through the crimson veil of his bloodlust.</p><p>Drinking in the heady aroma, Jagr felt a stirring of excitement deep in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>\u201cThat scent,\u201d he breathed. \u201cI\u2019ve smelled it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d With a frown she stepped forward, as if to touch him.</p><p>Jagr took a hasty step back, knowing that he was far from stable. Just as he knew that something would break inside him if he accidentally injured the woman.</p><p>\u201cDo not.\u201d</p><p>As if sensing the danger throbbing in the air, the female stood perfectly still, her expression troubled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have much time. I managed to slip past the curs on guard, but without the amulet they\u2019ll soon catch my scent and come to investigate.\u201d</p><p>Jagr growled, his fangs aching. Curs. Yes. He\u2019d always hated the bastards.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He snapped his teeth with impatience. \u201cNever mind. I will find them on my own.\u201d</p><p>Whirling on his heel, Jagr headed for the open door. His rage pulsed and the bloodlust still thundered through his body. He needed to kill. And if he didn\u2019t want it to be the woman in front of him, then he needed other prey.</p><p>The curs would do just fine.</p><p>The woman called out, but he ignored her plea to remain. He was a vampire on the hunt, and anything foolish enough to cross his path was dead.</p><p>Four long strides took him through the outer chamber and to the narrow flight of stone steps. Those he consumed in two swift bounds. A wooden door blocked his path at the top of the stairs, but one swing of his arm smashed through the fragile barrier.</p><p>Splinters flew through the air, spreading before Jagr as he stepped through the mangled frame. There was a yip as a cur keeping guard was hit with the small, but painful missiles. A yip that became a howl of agonized pain as Jagr grabbed him by the hair and tossed him across what appeared to be a kitchen.</p><p>Jagr watched the slender man smack painfully into the wall, leaving a trail of blood as he crumpled to the floor. The cur lived, but before Jagr could concentrate on yanking the bastard\u2019s heart out, there was the sound of footsteps from outside the house.</p><p>Bending down, Jagr yanked out the silver-bladed daggers he always kept hidden in his boots. A part of him might relish the thought of ripping apart his enemies with his bare hands, but bloodlust didn\u2019t equal stupidity.</p><p>Until he knew just how many curs were prowling around the place, he wasn\u2019t going to take any chances.</p><p>There was a low snarl and Jagr listened as one of the approaching sets of footsteps shifted from two legs to four. Jagr widened his stance, a dagger clutched in each hand, his lips pulling back to reveal his lethal fangs.</p><p>Showtime.</p><p>The shifted cur entered first, crashing through a set of French doors that led to a back terrace. It was large by cur standards, the height of a good-sized pony and thickly muscled beneath the shaggy brown fur. But it was the long, razor sharp teeth that could slice through bone that was the true danger. Even a vampire could be killed if his head was snapped off.</p><p>There was another snarl as the cur launched his heavy body directly at Jagr. The brainless animal was too far gone to have the sense to realize it was a suicide mission.</p><p>Which suited Jagr just fine.</p><p>Braced for the impact, he barely moved when the cur smashed into his body. Instead, he easily avoided the teeth aimed at his throat and slid the two daggers deep into the beast\u2019s chest.</p><p>The glowing eyes of the cur widened, a death rattle in its throat the only sound it made as it slid off the daggers and tumbled backward. He was changed back to a man, a very dead man, by the time he hit the floor.</p><p>Jagr had no time to admire his handiwork as two more curs appeared through the destroyed French door, both rushing forward in unison.</p><p>With deadly accuracy, Jag threw one of the daggers. It spun through the air, end over end, shimmering with brilliant flares of silver as the slanting moonlight caught it. The charging cur, stuck midway in his shift to wolf, had no chance to avoid the blade as it sunk deep into his chest.</p><p>The second attacker screamed in fury as his companion dropped to the ground. But he did, astonishingly, have enough sense to avoid a direct attack.</p><p>Slowly circling Jagr, the cur battled his instinctive need to shift. His eyes glowed and his skin rippled as his wolf struggled to free itself.</p><p>Jagr flashed a taunting smile. \u201cAre we going to dance or fight, dog?\u201d</p><p>The cur snapped his teeth, reaching beneath his shirt to pull out a large handgun.</p><p>\u201cIn a rush to die, vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot before dinner.\u201d</p><p>With a slow grin, Jagr released his coiled power. The frigid blast exploded through the room, knocking pans from the shelves and shattering the windows. The remaining cur screamed as he was tossed through the air and pinned to the wall by the tangible force.</p><p>Ignoring the bullets that his enemy desperately fired in his direction, Jagr prowled forward. He could easily kill the cur with his powers. Or even with the dagger still clutched in his hand.</p><p>His bloodlust, however, demanded more.</p><p>With a surge of desperate hunger, Jagr grabbed the cur by the hair and jerked his head to one side. There was the sound of someone calling his name, and the tantalizing scent of midnight jasmine, but he was too far gone to be distracted.</p><p>His fangs ached for soft flesh and warm blood. Nothing less would satisfy him now.</p><p>Roaring his victory, Jagr struck with painful force, his teeth sinking deep into the cur\u2019s throat.</p><p>The man briefly struggled, dropping the now empty gun as he pummeled Jagr\u2019s chest. Jagr didn\u2019t even feel the blows. Not with the rich, soothing taste of blood filling his mouth and the potent heat washing away the lingering effects of the hexes.</p><p>It took a few minutes to actually drain the cur dry, although his struggles ended after only a few deep sucks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At last dropping the lifeless body to the floor, Jagr roared as the power rushed through him.</p><p>Although not a full demon, the cur\u2019s blood was far more potent than a mere human, bringing with it a satisfying rush that eased the black rage.</p><p>Shuddering in relief, Jagr allowed the madness to recede. Slowly, the red haze dissipated from his mind, clearing his thoughts and relaxing the knotted muscles.</p> <p>As the fog lifted, he glanced around the ruined kitchen with a frown.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Painful minutes passed as he struggled to recall where he was and what had happened.</p><p>His last true memory had been of himself in a small, cramped cell. The imp\u2014Gaynor, yes that had been his name\u2014had yanked him through a portal. That\u2019s when things began to get fuzzy.</p><p>There\u2019d been pacing and cussing and futile attempts to break down the door. That he damned well remembered. Then he\u2019d gone deep inside himself to avoid the looming panic, hadn\u2019t he?</p> <p>So how did he get out of the cell?</p><p>\u201cJagr?\u201d</p><p>Regan\u2019s soft voice, along with the tantalizing scent of midnight jasmine, was nothing more than a whisper, but both slammed into him with the force of a two-ton truck.</p><p>Oh...shit.</p><p>The lingering fog was blasted away as images of his escape from his prison seared through his mind with cruel clarity.</p><p>The invader entering the cell. Leaning over him. And then...</p> <p>Spinning on his heel, Jagr frantically studied the slender form standing in the door leading to the basement. Even through the shadows he could detect the faint marks that marred her slender neck.</p><p>Marks he had put there.</p><p>Regan wasn\u2019t a coward. Granted, she didn\u2019t have one of those hero complexes that demanded she always dash around proving her courage, but she could face pain and even danger when necessary.</p><p>So it wasn\u2019t fear that kept her in the basement as Jagr charged out of the cell and headed upstairs to battle the curs.</p><p>At least, not fear for herself.</p><p>For the moment, Jagr was at the mercy of his rampaging emotions. No big freaking surprise there. The vampire had to have a major case of PTSD after enduring centuries of torture, and being locked in the tiny cell had obviously pushed all his buttons.</p><p>And while she refused to believe he would seriously hurt her even in the midst of his bloodlust, she knew that during battles anything could happen. Friendly fire wasn\u2019t just a human danger.</p><p>If she were accidentally injured, the stupid man would hold himself responsible for rest of eternity.</p> <p>So ignoring the desperate urge to rush up the stairs and make certain Jagr didn\u2019t allow his blind rage to get himself killed by the guards she\u2019d slipped past only a short time ago, Regan hovered near the bottom of the stairs, clutching the dagger and hating the feelings of helplessness.</p><p>Thank the gods that the marks from Duncan\u2019s damned silver chains had already healed. At the time, she had been infuriated that it had taken so long for Levet to convince Salvatore to meet with the stupid cur. She might sympathize with the King of Were\u2019s reluctance to strike a bargain with an out-and-out traitor, but her only concern was being released so she could get to Jagr.</p><p>And of course, there had been long minutes wasted as she\u2019d argued with Levet. The gargoyle had been determined to return to Hannibal with her, but while Regan would have taken any assistance she could get, she couldn\u2019t dismiss the thoughts of her sister.</p><p>If Duncan could honestly reveal where she might be hidden, then she didn\u2019t want the bastard out of sight for a moment. He wouldn\u2019t be allowed to disappear before Salvatore could get the information out of him.</p><p>With a shake of her head, Regan returned her attention to the cramped basement.</p><p>Distantly she could sense the bothersome drain of the hexes that lined the cell, and the lingering scent of Jagr\u2019s desperation, but she concentrated on the crashes echoing from above. One hint that Jagr was in danger, and she would be up those stairs and kicking some cur butt.</p><p>At last the sounds of the short, brutal battle came to an end, and sucking in a deep breath, Regan made her way to the top of the steps.</p><p>What she discovered as she stepped into the trashed kitchen didn\u2019t particularly surprise her. Windows shattered, one wall cracked, pots and pans scattered, three injured or dead curs on the floor, and the fourth being rapidly drained by the infuriated vampire.</p><p>Still, she couldn\u2019t help but admire Jagr\u2019s brute strength.</p><p>No wonder Culligan was always so nervous when it came time to negotiate with the local clan chief.</p><p>Watching from a relatively safe distance, Regan sensed the moment Jagr\u2019s maddened fury began to slip away. It was in the hint of warmth that threaded through the biting chill in the air, and the loosening of the warrior\u2019s bunched muscles.</p><p>Of course, she wasn\u2019t stupid enough to run and throw herself in his arms as she strangely ached to do.</p><p>Instead she softly called his name, careful not to startle him by moving forward.</p><p>For a moment, she thought he meant to ignore her, then slowly he turned, his expression wary as his gaze slid a searing path over her.</p><p>Sharp relief flared through Regan as recognition flared in those beautiful blue eyes. He was back. And lucid.</p><p>Taking a step forward, she abruptly halted as the ice-blue gaze landed on her neck and recognition morphed to black regret.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>She resisted the urge to lift her hand and hide the telltale marks. Instead, she held herself perfectly still as he walked toward her, his movements jerky, as if his mind and body were at painful odds.</p><p>\u201cRegan,\u201d he breathed, not stopping until his cool power wrapped around her like a welcomed blanket.</p><p>Regan licked her lips, unable to bear the look of shame that twisted Jagr\u2019s stark features. Since their first memorable encounter, she had ruthlessly fought to keep this man from tromping over her defenses. Even when her own body had betrayed her.</p><p>In this moment, she knew if she truly wanted to be rid of him and his aggravating interference in her life, all she had to do was keep her lips shut and allow him to drown in his own guilt. It was etched on every line of his face.</p><p>But even as the thought fluttered through her mind, she was already shoving it down the black hole where it belonged.</p><p>No freaking way.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t give a shit what it might reveal about her pathetic emotions.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she demanded, resisting the urge to wrap her arms around him and offer the comfort that he so obviously needed. He wasn\u2019t ready. Not yet.</p><p>Proving her point, he gave a slow shake of his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m damned well not okay,\u201d he rasped, his eyes never leaving her throat. \u201cI hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She waited a beat, but when his eyes refused to leave the fading bruises, she reached up to grasp his face in her hands and forced his head up. \u201cJagr, look at me.\u201d Grudgingly his gaze met hers. \u201cI. Am. Fine. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI very nearly killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d She narrowed her gaze, her tone angry. This was no time for touchy-feely crap. Not with a wounded warrior bent on self-flagellation. \u201cI might not be an oversized oaf like some I could name, but I\u2019m not that easy to get rid of. I would have stopped you if I truly thought I was in danger.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. Annoying, stubborn vampire.</p><p>\u201cNo, Regan, you couldn\u2019t have. If I hadn\u2019t hesitated...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d she interrupted, squeezing his face as if she could squeeze in a bit of sense. \u201cNo harm, no foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the next time the madness overtakes me?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cNext time? Does it happen often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did in the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Well...duh. She\u2019d be worried if he hadn\u2019t gone Rambo after what the Kesi and her merry band of torturers had done to him.</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>His gaze abruptly dropped. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Regan snorted. He didn\u2019t want to answer because he must know it would only prove her point.</p><p>\u201cHow long since the last time you...\u201d She caught herself, not willing to call him mad. He might be maddening, but he was the sanest demon she\u2019d met in her entire life. \u201cLost control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d She growled low in her throat as he remained mute. \u201cJagr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been several centuries,\u201d he grudgingly confessed.</p><p>There. She knew it.</p><p>\u201cFine. Then I\u2019ll start worrying a few hundred years from now.\u201d</p><p>His expression hardened as his fingers dropped from her neck. No doubt telling himself he might accidentally hurt her.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be dismissed. I\u2019m dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you were imprisoned.\u201d Damn, she wished he wasn\u2019t too huge to shake. Trust her to get entangled with the biggest, most difficult demon to ever walk the earth. \u201cChrist, anyone would have gone a little nuts.

He wanted to be a dick? Then he was going to get treated like one.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Knowing she would have only one opportunity to catch him off guard, Regan leaned into his hard body, deliberately rubbing her softer curves against him. Temporarily distracted by her ploy, Jagr was unprepared when her foot slid behind his leg and she suddenly pushed for all she was worth against his chest. The vampire grunted in surprise, unable to halt the inevitable fall. He landed hard on his back, but giving no mercy, Regan was swiftly perched on top of his chest, the dagger she\u2019d yanked from the waistband of her jeans shoved directly above his heart. \u201cWell, fool this,\u201d she gritted.</p> <p>She held her higher ground for less than the beat of a heart. With a low growl, Jagr twisted to the side, reversing their position so that she was pinned to the ground by his massive body.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve made my point,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cNot even close, chief. I would already have carved out your heart if I wanted.\u201d</p><p>His expression was the perfect example of an exasperated male who\u2019d reached the end of his rope.</p><p>Even his fangs were showing.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Regan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, damn you, Jagr,\u201d she hissed, not about to back down. Jagr had isolated himself for centuries, pushing everyone away who might get too close. He wasn\u2019t going to get by with it this time. \u201cI get that you\u2019re not a boy scout. Yippee kiyah. I don\u2019t need a freaking saint. I need a warrior. I need...\u201d She swallowed the uncomfortable lump in her throat, and forced herself to admit the truth. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, his eyes briefly revealing the stark, aching loneliness that was echoed deep within her before they were abruptly shuttered.</p><p>\u201cLittle one, I swore a vow that I would protect you.\u201d His jaw twitched, as if he struggled to contain his emotions. \u201cEven from myself.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd I swore a vow that I would never be at the mercy of another man.\u201d</p><p>Jerking as if her words had struck a nerve, Jagr abruptly flowed to his feet, glaring down at her with an offended expression.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not at my mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d She scrambled to her feet with a great deal less grace than Jagr, planting her fists on her hips. \u201cYou want to make my decisions for me. You want to tell me what\u2019s best for me. You want...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to protect you, God dammit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe in your mind, but it feels like shackles to me.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, his hands lifted to scrub his face in a gesture of utter weariness.</p><p>\u201cGod, you drive me crazy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly. She hadn\u2019t won the battle, but she hadn\u2019t lost.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to my world,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Lowering his hands, Jagr gave a shake of his head, his gaze sweeping over the destroyed kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the time or place for this discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least we can agree on one thing.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cWe need to get out of here. Eventually someone is going to come looking for the guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can return to Tane\u2019s lair. I\u2019ll...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come with me,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>His eyes narrowed as a cold blast of air filled the kitchen. \u201cI have a few debts to pay off first.\u201d</p><p>Already expecting his response, she smiled sweetly. \u201cDo you really want me running around the countryside by myself, Jagr? Who knows what I might take it in my silly head to do?\u201d</p><p>For a moment he struggled with his furious need to seek out vengeance. He\u2019d been tormented in the worst possible way, and he needed to make those responsible pay.</p><p>At last his hands clenched as he accepted she couldn\u2019t possibly be trusted to make her own way back to Tane\u2019s lair. Typical male.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play fair, wolf,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Her brows lifted. \u201cAnd your point, vampire?\u201d</p><p>He threw his hands up in resignation. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Stepping toward the door, Regan abruptly halted. \u201cWait there, I forgot something.\u201d Turning, she headed for the door to the basement.</p><p>\u201cRegan.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his warning growl as she sprinted down the stairs and scooped up the amulet she had tossed near the door of the cell. The damned things had caused her nothing but headaches since coming to Hannibal. It seemed only fair that she have one to return the favor.</p><p>Shoving the amulet into her pocket, she raced upstairs to find Jagr pacing by the French doors that had seen better days.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Offering her a frustrated glare, the vampire stepped through the busted window.</p><p>\u201cYou know, little one, for a woman who bitches about shackles, you\u2019re willing enough to wrap them around me,\u201d he accused in low, rough tones.</p><p>Regan refused to feel guilt for having manipulated Jagr as she followed his large form across the terrace and around the silent tea shop. At the moment he was in no condition to be out hunting curs. Not when his furious need for payback was greater than his sense of self-preservation.</p><p>Besides, she didn\u2019t intend to allow his guilt over hurting her to fester into some big, freaking wound he would carry along with all his other scars.</p><p>Of course, that was easier said than done.</p><p>Flowing through the darkness at a speed he had to know would take all her efforts to match, Jagr headed directly toward Tane\u2019s lair, his expression bleak in the silver moonlight.</p><p>She snapped her lips together and grimly kept pace. Let him pout for now. Once they reached the lair...</p><p>Well, she wasn\u2019t exactly sure what she intended to do, but it was going to include shaking some sense into that thick skull.</p><p>And maybe ripping that shirt off his wide chest, and licking her way down...</p><p>Allowing the fantasy to fill her mind, Regan ran through the dark fields, managing not to falter despite Jagr\u2019s punishing pace.</p><p>Unfortunately, she was so lost in the erotic imaginings that she was unprepared when Jagr came to an abrupt halt just as they reached the crumbling building that marked Tane\u2019s lair.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Ramming into his back was like running face-first into a brick wall, and rubbing her injured nose, she glared at her aggravating companion.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Tilting back his head, his expression hardened. \u201cStyx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Damn. She\u2019d forgotten her frantic conversation with the King of Vampires. \u201cI called and asked him to come.\u201d</p><p>His head snapped round to regard her with a shocked frown. \u201cYou called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried.\u201d</p><p>As swiftly as the shock had appeared, it was being replaced by an expression of resignation.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d His lips twisted in a humorless smile. \u201cA good choice. There are no warriors more powerful than the Anasso. You will be safe in his care.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open as she realized he assumed she called for Styx as some kind of replacement vampire when Jagr had been captured.</p><p>Before she could halt the impulse, she moved forward to punch him squarely in the chest. A wasted effort. The damned man didn\u2019t even flinch.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t call him to be in his damned care.\u201d She shook her hand. Crap, she\u2019d almost broken her fingers. \u201cHell, I\u2019ve done everything possible to avoid that fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I would have done anything...\u201d She was forced to halt and clear the lump from her throat. \u201cAnything to find you.\u201d</p><p>The blue eyes briefly darkened at her soft confession, but before he could speak, a large form detached from the shadows of the looming building.</p><p>\u201cJagr. Sister-mate.\u201d</p><p>Wanting to scream with frustration, Regan turned to cast an impatient glance at the unwelcome intruder.</p><p>Only to freeze in shock.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>As big as, or even bigger than Jagr, the vampire possessed the features of an ancient Aztec, with raven black hair pulled into a braid that hung well past his waist and golden brown eyes that seemed to sear right through her.</p><p>But it was more than his stark beauty and the way his leather pants and loose silk shirt caressed his heavily muscled body that made her instinctively step toward Jagr.</p><p>His power was a thick, tangible presence in the air, prickling over her skin with a near painful intensity.</p><p>Christ, her sister must have nerves of steel to bind herself to the dangerous demon.</p><p>At her side, Jagr offered a stiff bow. \u201cMy lord.\u201d</p><p>That unnerving golden gaze shifted to run a searching path over Jagr\u2019s stiff form, narrowing as he caught sight of the vampire\u2019s brittle expression.</p><p>\u201cI am pleased to discover you unharmed, if not unscathed, brother,\u201d the Anasso rumbled, a hint of question in his deep voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou will not be pleased to discover I have failed in my duty,\u201d Jagr retorted, offering another bow. \u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>Before Regan could guess his intent, Jagr was heading for the nearby stairs to the terrace, his back stiff and his shoulders bunched with tension.</p><p>\u201cJagr, wait.\u201d She stomped her foot as he deliberately ignored her plea and disappeared through the open door. \u201cDammit. He is...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cComplicated,\u201d Styx helpfully supplied. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>Forgetting the fact that she was confronting perhaps the most lethal demon in the world, not to mention her current brother-in-law, Regan clenched her fists and headed in Jagr\u2019s wake.</p><p>Walk out on her?</p><p>Not gonna happen.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m just about to uncomplicate him,\u201d she muttered. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRegan.\u201d</p><p>The dark voice was pleasant, but edged with enough of a command that she instinctively halted to glance over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His beautiful face was somber in the moonlight. \u201cI would ask to meet with you and discuss your future.\u201d</p><p>Future? Shit. She didn\u2019t want to deal with the expectations her call had no doubt raised in her sister. Or any future that might include a family she\u2019d never wanted.</p><p>Not when she had an obstinate, mule-headed, world\u2019s most aggravating vampire to straighten out.</p> <p>\u201cI...\u201d She halted her instinctive denial as she met the steady golden gaze. He wasn\u2019t budging on this. It might as well have been tattooed across his forehead. She sighed. Great. Just what she needed. Another ruthless vampire with an agenda. \u201cYeah, fine. But later.\u201d She headed for the door. \u201cMuch later.\u201d</p><p>Sadie was beyond pissed off.</p><p>Nothing unusual.</p><p>Being pissed off was a constant state of mind lately.</p><p>No. Not lately.</p><p>She could pinpoint the precise time her life had gone into the shitter.</p><p>The moment Regan-freaking-Princess-of-Weres had hit town.</p><p>Damn the bitch.</p> <p>This was all her fault.</p><p>She was the one who had called the wrath of the vampires down on the curs. She was the one who had brought Salvatore snooping around where he didn\u2019t belong. She was even responsible for that damned gargoyle who was proving to be such a pain in the ass.</p><p>And yet, Sadie knew she would be the one held to blame for the entire fiasco.</p><p>Caine was not a cur who accepted failure.</p><p>Hell, the last person to fail him was stuffed and mounted to stand as a gruesome reminder of what happens to those who disappoint the self-proclaimed leader of the curs.</p><p>Which, no doubt, explained why Duncan had done a disappearing act, along with the witch.</p><p>Well, screw them.</p><p>Sadie didn\u2019t run. She didn\u2019t hide.</p><p>Not any more.</p><p>Caine commanded she capture Regan, come hell or high water, and that was exactly what she was going to do.</p><p>Unfurling the whip, she sliced another ribbon of flesh off Gaynor\u2019s back as he cowered in a corner of the basement.</p><p>When they had returned to the tea shop, after yet another futile search for the pureblood, to discover her guards dead and the vampire missing, Sadie had lost no time in taking out her frustrations on the imp.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think straight with her temper blazing and her lust for pain clogging her mind.</p><p>Besides, she couldn\u2019t risk shifting. Not when her time was running out.</p><p>\u201cStupid bastard,\u201d she gritted, clenching the whip as she watched the blood pour down the imp\u2019s shredded back. \u201cYou swore to me the vampire couldn\u2019t escape from your prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Another crack of the whip. \u201cYou have him hidden in the closet?\u201d</p><p>The imp screamed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Dumpster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gaynor pressed even tighter to the wall, looking remarkably like Culligan, as he whimpered and cowered beneath her strikes. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t get out on his own. I can smell that female Were all over the cell.\u201d</p><p>The knowledge that Gaynor was right did nothing to ease her fury. While Sadie had been out tracking the damned Were so she could convince her to concede defeat peacefully, Regan had outwitted them all.</p><p>Now Sadie didn\u2019t have her prize, and her one bargaining chip was gone.</p><p>Regan would pay for that.</p><p>In blood.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did she find this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d Needing her punishment to be a bit more personal, Sadie stepped forward to kick the imp in the head. There was a satisfying thump as he reeled to the side. \u201cYou must have revealed something when you spoke with her. After all, no one would suspect that a demon with half a brain would be stupid enough to hide his most private lair directly beneath his very public tea shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d Ridiculously, the imp tried to drag himself across the floor. \u201cI said nothing, I swear.\u201d</p><p>She followed his painful path, kicking him in the side. \u201cSo a clueless Were barely out of diapers managed to outsmart a centuries-old imp?\u201d</p><p>Curling into a ball, Gaynor managed to gather enough balls to glare at her.</p><p>\u201cShe also managed to get past four of your curs.\u201d</p><p>Sadie stilled, distracted by a sudden, unpleasant thought.</p><p>\u201cYes, she did,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cAnd her scent wasn\u2019t outside the building. Why?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause as Gaynor struggled to breathe with his collapsed lung.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s found a witch of her own,\u201d he at last panted.</p><p>\u201cOr taken mine,\u201d Sadie growled, her eyes glowing in the dark as she considered the various possibilities. \u201cOf course, all she really needed was to get her greedy little hands on one of the amulets.\u201d</p><p>Gaynor grunted as he received another kick to the head. \u201cWhy are you punishing me? I didn\u2019t give her a damn amulet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I punishing you?\u201d Leaning down, she grabbed the imp by the hair and glared into his ruined face. \u201cBecause I can, you pathetic worm.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Jagr wasn\u2019t surprised to discover his hands shaking as he braided his hair and slipped on a clean pair of jeans. The hot shower might have been capable of washing the filth from his skin, but it did nothing to wash away the lingering effects of his madness.</p><p>Or the horrifying memory of his fingers squeezing into Regan\u2019s throat.</p><p>Nothing would ever wash that away.</p><p>He had come so close...</p><p>Too close.</p><p>Leaning against the wall of the bathroom, Jagr banged his head with enough force to crack the marble.</p><p>In his mind, the images of blood-soaked corridors tormented him. Those hours of slaughtering Kesi and her clan were still wrapped in fog, but not the long journey out of her lair. Or the unstable years that followed when his rampages would strike without warning, leaving anyone in the vicinity slaughtered.</p><p>Over the past centuries he\u2019d allowed himself to believe that those days were behind him. He\u2019d buried his rage deep, and carefully honed his control. Oh, he would always possess a dangerous temper and a ready willingness to use violence when necessary. But he never unleashed his full fury.</p><p>Not until tonight.</p><p>Again the image of Regan, her eyes wide and her lips parted as he crushed her throat, seared through his mind.</p><p>No.</p><p>He would never, ever take such a risk again.</p><p>Ignoring the unexpected wrench of agony at the mere thought of walking away from Regan, Jagr forced himself to leave the bathroom and returned to the connecting bedroom.</p><p>He tossed his satchel on the bed, digging out his remaining daggers before shoving his used clothes into the bag.</p><p>He was reaching for the clean shirt he\u2019d left on a side table when the unmistakable scent of jasmine had him spinning toward the door.</p><p>Stepping into the bedroom, Regan allowed her gaze to skim over the open satchel on the bed before returning to linger on his still bare chest.</p><p>A heat flushed through Jagr as her emerald eyes flared with awareness, tracing the scars that ran the length of his stomach.</p><p>Before Regan, he\u2019d always kept his scars well hidden. They were a badge of shame that no one was allowed to witness. But standing before this beautiful Were, he felt nothing but searing pleasure as she studied his hard body. There was no disgust, no pity, no aversion.</p><p>Just pure appreciation.</p><p>Wanting nothing more than to yank off the jeans that were the only thing covering him, Jagr instead forced himself to turn back toward the bag.</p><p>His desire for Regan might be a brutal force, but it was nothing in comparison to his driving need to keep her safe.</p><p>For the first time in centuries, someone else\u2019s existence mattered more than his.</p><p>With an impatient click of her tongue, Regan moved to perch on the end of the bed, her expression impossible to read, though there was no missing the anger that snapped in the air around her.</p><p>\u201cI thought I would find you here, you big lummox.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look up. It was bad enough to have her so close. To be wrapped in her exotic scent and feel the heat of her body.</p><p>To actually see her on the bed where he\u2019d so recently spread her legs and plunged into her damp heat...damn, it was enough to snap what little control he had left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLummox?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a word.\u201d He sensed her shift on the bed. Gods. His jeans tightened painfully over his growing erection. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t look. Do. Not. Look.</p> <p>\u201cI would think it\u2019s rather self-evident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it is. Hard to miss a six-foot-plus sulking vampire. Or is it pouting? Difficult to tell,\u201d she taunted. \u201cI assume you\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst I intend to go imp hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>Pain ripped through his chest, nearly sending him to his knees. \u201cThen I will return to Chicago.\u201d</p> <p>She breathed a shockingly vile curse. \u201cSo, you\u2019re fleeing back to your prison...oh, I mean lair. It\u2019s so much safer to watch the world through MTV and YouTube, isn\u2019t it, chief?\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched into fists at her accusation, refusing to consider the bitter truth of her words.</p><p>\u201cReturn to Styx, Regan. He\u2019ll be able to track Culligan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need him or you or anyone else to track Culligan,\u201d she gritted. \u201cI already found him.\u201d</p><p>The defenses he\u2019d been struggling to build were shattered as Jagr jerked his head around to stab her with a shocked gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes flashed, as if pleased at by his sharp reaction. \u201cWhere do you think I picked up that handy-dandy little amulet?\u201d Her brows abruptly drew together. \u201cAn amulet, I might add, that was confiscated by your friend Tane before he would let me come down here.\u201d</p><p>Jagr shook his head. Later he would thank Tane for ensuring that Regan couldn\u2019t slip up on him unaware, but for now he could think of nothing but the realization that she\u2019d found the imp who had tormented her for thirty years.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe was alive when I left the cabin, but his odds of living through the night are about zero to none. Not once the curs realize he\u2019s just as pathetic at being bait as he is at being an imp.\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward her, his bare feet sinking into the thick carpet, his damp braid brushing across his back. Not that he noticed. He was utterly consumed by the tiny female perched on the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou found the imp and...walked away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had other things on my mind, as I have mentioned more than once,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jagr frowned. She was behaving as if finding the demon responsible for her years of misery, a demon who she had risked her life to kill, was nothing more than a trivial encounter.</p> <p>\u201cDammit, Regan, you\u2019ve waited your entire life to have your revenge.\u201d</p><p>The emerald gaze never wavered. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d</p><p>He growled low in his throat as he studied her stubborn expression.</p><p>Okay, it was official.</p><p>The woman was going to drive him right over the edge.</p><p>\u201cThere had to be more than just a need to find me, little one.\u201d He folded his arms over his chest, refusing to back down. He didn\u2019t understand why he had to know. Only that he did. \u201cKilling him would have taken you less than a heartbeat. Tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>She abruptly rose to her feet, standing so close to him that his entire body was bathed in sweet jasmine heat.</p><p>\u201cChrist, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she rasped. \u201cI suppose a part of it was the fact that he looked so incredibly pathetic chained in that cabin. For so many years he was my personal boogeyman. He brutalized me for so long I began to think of him as invincible.\u201d Her lips twisted as she gave a shake of her head. \u201cBut then I saw him as he truly is. A weak, cowardly idiot who crawled through the sewers because he didn\u2019t have the talent or intelligence or spine to be a decent man. He just wasn\u2019t worth the effort of killing.\u201d</p><p>He trembled with the need to pull her into his arms as her eyes darkened with a vulnerability that cut through his very soul.</p><p>This was more than lust. More than an instinctive need to protect.</p><p>This was...</p><p>Gods, he didn\u2019t know what to call it.</p><p>He only knew that it had buried so deep inside him that he\u2019d never be rid of it.</p><p>\u201cAnd the other part?\u201d he demanded, his voice thick.</p><p>\u201cI realized I didn\u2019t need to kill him.\u201d She held her arms wide. \u201cThe chains are already gone.\u201d</p><p>A combination of emotions warred through him. Pride, relief, astonishment, and a treacherous sense of regret at the knowledge she no longer had need of him.</p><p>Unable to battle his need, he reached up to lightly stroke his fingers down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cRegan.\u201d</p><p>She stepped even closer, sending jolts of agonizing need through his body.</p><p>\u201cI understand now,\u201d she said, softly. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t holding me in the past. I was. It\u2019s time to let it go.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered at the feel of her soft skin beneath his finger tips. A warm, satin temptation. His thighs clenched in response, his erection painfully hard.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re free,\u201d he whispered, ignoring the desire clamoring through him. It was something he was going to have to get used to.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll never be completely free. The memories will always haunt me.\u201d Her hand reached up to cover his fingers, pressing them against her cheek. \u201cJust as they haunt you.\u201d</p><p>Feeling as if he\u2019d just been singed, Jagr yanked his hand away and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cThey do a great deal more than haunt me,\u201d he pointed out, his voice harsh.</p><p>Her lips thinned with annoyance. \u201cYou reacted to your situation. Just like any other human or demon or fey would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blind, killing rage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it had been a blind, killing rage, you wouldn\u2019t have stopped with the curs holding you captive. All of Hannibal would be dead.\u201d</p><p>Jagr shifted. It was true. In his early days, the rage would consume him to the point he couldn\u2019t halt. Only the threat of dawn could end the rampage and drive him back to his lair.</p><p>Still, he\u2019d lost enough control to strangle Regan. And that was unacceptable.</p><p>His gaze lowered to her throat that was once again smooth and unmarred.</p><p>\u201cI hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I\u2019ve tripped over my damned feet and done more damage.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that everyone has moments of insanity.\u201d She deliberately moved forward, perhaps knowing he couldn\u2019t form a coherent thought when she was so near. \u201cSalvatore told me that Styx nearly destroyed the entire vampire race because he protected some crazed vampire he was sworn to, and your own clan chief tried to kill your precious king. Should they be locked up in their lairs?\u201d</p><p>Again he couldn\u2019t refute her words. Styx had protected the previous Anasso even when it was obvious the vampire was threatening to rip apart the peace they\u2019d struggled for centuries to achieve. And Viper had been willing to sacrifice his own king to save Shay from death.</p><p>It was even rumored that Styx had been lost in bloodlust when he\u2019d been attacked by a band of renegade vampires intent on taking his crown.</p><p>\u201cNothing you say will change my mind,\u201d he forced himself to say, although the words didn\u2019t ring quite true in his heart.</p><p>No doubt because he wanted his mind changed.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Obviously wearied of his stubborn refusal to dismiss the dark fever that lurked deep inside him, Regan took matters into her own hands.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>Keeping her gaze locked on his tight expression, she grasped the hem of her too-tight shirt, and with one smooth motion had it yanked over her head and tossed on the floor.</p><p>Jagr grunted, feeling as if he\u2019d just been hit in the stomach with a sledgehammer.</p><p>Against his will his eyes lowered, feasting on the slender limbs that were toned with muscle and covered with flawless ivory skin. She wore a flimsy bit of lace that covered her breasts, but it was no barrier to his greedy gaze. Not when the rosy nipples hardened beneath his hot gaze.</p><p>A roaring need to tumble her onto the nearby bed instead had Jagr backing away until he banged into the wall.</p><p>\u201cRegan, what the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>With a wicked smile, Regan casually reached up to snap the tiny clip of her bra, dropping it on top of her shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou said I couldn\u2019t change your mind,\u201d she purred. \u201cAt least not with words.\u201d</p><p>His mouth went dry, his brain shutting down as his desire settled into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cSo you think you can manipulate me with...\u201d</p><p>The words lodged in his throat as she slid down the zipper on her jeans and shimmied them down her body. There was a moment as she halted to kick off her shoes, then the jeans were gone and she was standing there in nothing more than a pair of white panties.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>The things he could do to that exquisite, ivory body. Delicious, sinful, perhaps even illegal things that would include his lips and tongue and throbbing fangs.</p><p>As if fearing it might have been forgotten, his cock gave a painful jerk against his jeans, reminding Jagr of just how good it felt to be buried deep inside Regan\u2019s heat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it working?\u201d she murmured, running hands up his bare chest.</p><p>Working? He was on fire, being consumed by flames that raged through his body like an inferno. And worse, he was beginning to forget why he shouldn\u2019t have her beneath him as he explored every inch of her delectable body.</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut as his muscles clenched with desperate hunger.</p><p>\u201cGods,\u201d he breathed, his stomach cramping as he tried to deny the furious instinct to take this woman to his bed and never let her go.</p><p>Her soft chuckle feathered over his chest, her fingers skimming down to tease at the waistband of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re showing your fangs, vampire.\u201d</p><p>His eyes snapped open as he reached out to grasp her shoulders, careful not to dig into her tender flesh.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re playing a perilous game, Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he growled, although he knew with perfect clarity that there was no genuine danger.</p><p>At least not to Regan.</p><p>He, on the other hand, was in very serious danger of imploding if he didn\u2019t ease the savage need to be inside her.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>She deliberately licked her lips. \u201cAre you going to hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it up, and I\u2019ll devour you.\u201d</p><p>The green eyes glittered with invitation. \u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>He smacked his hands against the wall behind him, barely noticing the large holes he punched into the paneling. Screw it. Tane could send him a bill.</p><p>\u201cRegan, I want you too much and my control is too unpredictable,\u201d he gritted, his body trembling. \u201cIf I start this, I won\u2019t be able to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about stopping?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. This was a mistake. Even if he could be confident his control was trustworthy, Regan no longer needed a champion. Hell, she never truly had.</p><p>And no doubt, she was already making plans to move on.</p><p>Plans that didn\u2019t include a damaged vampire.</p> <p>So why not enjoy what was offered before he returned to his dark, lonely lair? The voice of temptation whispered in the back of his mind.</p><p>Because he was rapidly reaching the point where he would never be capable of letting her go. The voice of reason answered.</p><p>Which might explain why he was so anxious to grasp onto the fear that he couldn\u2019t be trusted with her.</p><p>Already the thought of walking away made him want to howl in pain. How much worse would it be if they became even more intimate?</p><p>Barely aware of what he was doing, Jagr allowed his hands to caress the silky perfection of her shoulders, his thoughts occupied with a last, desperate means to cling to a thread of reason.</p><p>\u201cDammit, woman, you\u2019ve been trying to get rid of me since I arrived in Hannibal,\u201d he rasped. \u201cWhy would you suddenly want me to stay?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m a woman. I\u2019m allowed to change my mind whenever I want, as many times as I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d With a smile, she popped the button of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Jagr hissed as his hand reached to grasp her wrist. How the hell was he supposed to be reasonable when she refused to cooperate?</p><p>She didn\u2019t struggle against his grip. Instead she leaned forward to lick a warm, wet path from his sternum to the base of his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me?\u201d she whispered against his skin.</p><p>Jagr swallowed his shout of pleasure, his fangs fully extended, and his last hope to cling to common sense shattered.</p><p>\u201cI...yes.\u201d His hands grasped her hips and pressed them against his aching erection. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes fluttered down until only a small, smoldering slit of emerald was visible.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>There was a problem. He\u2019d just been thinking about it. Unfortunately, it was as elusive as a mist fairy and, when she once again tugged at the button of his jeans, it disappeared altogether.</p><p>His head lowered so he could bury his face in the curve of her neck, the heated jasmine scent doing nothing to clear his desire-fogged brain.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Regan,\u201d he husked, his fangs scraping against her soft skin. \u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at his soft warning, but not from fear. He could already smell the potent perfume of her arousal as she awkwardly tugged at his zipper.</p><p>Jagr was swift to help push down the unwelcome jeans, kicking them impatiently aside. Later he would no doubt regret this momentary weakness, but for now nothing mattered but the feel of her soft hands exploring the clenched muscles of his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, chief, I don\u2019t need you to protect me,\u201d she husked, nipping at his chest. \u201cNot even from you.\u201d</p><p>Jagr shuddered, the pleasure of even such a light caress nearly sending him over the edge.</p><p>\u201cTake care with those teeth, little one,\u201d he muttered, his hands compulsively stroking over her back. \u201cVampires exchange blood for more than food.\u201d</p><p>Tilting back her head, she regarded him with a hint of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vampire\u2019s blood is the source of our power, as well as our means of claiming our true mate.\u201d A rueful smile touched his lips. \u201cTake my blood and I might very well be bound to you for all eternity.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, uncertainty flaring through them at his blunt confession.</p><p>\u201cJagr...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to flee, now would be the time to do it.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he thought she would. His body tensed and his gut wrenched with a ruthless disappointment.</p><p>Why the hell hadn\u2019t he kept his mouth shut?</p><p>A stark painful silence filled the room, and Jagr braced himself for rejection. Regan might possess more courage than any creature he\u2019d ever known, but the one thing she truly feared was being imprisoned once again.</p><p>And in her mind, emotional attachments were just as terrifying as any chains made of silver.</p><p>Why else would she refuse to meet with Darcy?</p><p>Even as he tensed, however, Regan was giving a slight shake of her head and without warning, she bent forward to scatter kisses over his chest, pausing at each nipple to flick her tongue over the beaded tip. Jagr groaned, one hand burying in her satin hair in silent encouragement.</p><p>Later he would wonder why Regan had so abruptly gone from trying to deny the desire that constantly pulsed between them, but for now...</p><p>Gods, for now he could only enjoy.</p><p>Trailing a devastating path down the center of his stomach, she tongued his belly button, making his cock twitch with a silent plea of mercy. Jagr squeezed his eyes shut, torn between the need to flip her onto the bed and take her with a swift, glorious explosion of pleasure, and allowing Regan to continue her seductive torment.</p><p>It was at last the feel of Regan\u2019s soft lips stroking ever lower that made the decision.</p><p>In the past, he\u2019d always been the aggressor during a sexual encounter. His predatory nature preferred being the hunter to the prey. Besides, it made it easier to make the contact as brief and uncomplicated as possible. The last thing he wanted was a clinging woman.</p><p>He\u2019d never realized just how erotic it could be to have a woman take charge.</p><p>Running his fingers through the strands of her hair as she kneeled before him, he forgot his earlier terror at having been lost in his bloodlust. And even his lingering suspicion of her sudden determination to seduce him.</p><p>There was only one thought on his mind.</p><p>Getting that warm, wet mouth on his aching arousal.</p><p>A pleasure easier dreamed of than achieved.</p><p>Although Regan had to be aware of the straining thrust of his erection, she refused to give into his silent urging, instead nibbling a path over his hip bone and down his inner thigh.</p><p>Muttering a desperate curse, he tugged her head up to meet his hungry gaze.</p><p>\u201cIf you intend to punish me, little one, you\u2019re doing a fine job.\u201d</p><p>A tiny smile curved her lips as she held his gaze, her finger tracing a teasing path up the length of his cock.</p><p>\u201cWell, I would hate for my efforts to be wasted.\u201d</p><p>He moaned as she reached the tip, toying with the tiny drop of moisture that had pooled there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do try,\u201d she murmured, bending down to trace him with her tongue from top to bottom and then back again. He swallowed a shout of pleasure, his hips instinctively arching toward her tempting lips.</p><p>\u201cOh...damn that feels good,\u201d he ground out, forcing his eyes open so he could witness the sight of her pleasuring him.</p><p>He nearly came at the mere sight.</p><p>Lost in a sensual haze, his gaze drifted over the strands of hair that shimmered like gold in the pale light, the perfect lines of her profile, and the expanse of ivory skin that stretched over her supple muscles.</p><p>Nothing was ever so beautiful.</p><p>His tiny Were, with the soul of a warrior and the innocence of an angel.</p><p>A warm, poignant tenderness threaded through his hunger. He had warned Regan to take care, already sensing that if she were to drink his blood the mating would be complete, but in this moment he realized that it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>She had already claimed him in all the ways that mattered, and whether they ever completed the bond, he would never, ever love another woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The thought should have terrified him.</p><p>A vampire who found and lost his mate usually ended up an empty shell.</p><p>Instead, Jagr felt nothing but a tide of all-consuming peace that chased away the lingering darkness.</p> <p>The past and all he had suffered no longer mattered.</p><p>Regan was like a blast of sunlight that chased away the bitter shadows.</p><p>The realization had barely managed to form, when it was abruptly shoved to the back of his mind as his temptress circled her fingers around him and explored the straining length with exquisite care.</p><p>His hands instinctively fisted in her hair, his body coiled so tight he nearly shattered when her lips tentatively slipped over the tip of his cock and slid downward.</p><p>Paradise.</p> <p>Complete, utter paradise.</p><p>A moan hummed deep in his throat, his world focused on the sensation of warm lips and rasping tongue.</p><p>With slow wet strokes, she all too swiftly had him straining toward climax. Damn. He wanted to enjoy the fierce pleasure. To spend the night pressed against the wall as Regan offered him the most intense and blissful sensations he\u2019d ever enjoyed. But even as the sweet release beckoned, he was reaching down to grasp her arms and tug her upward.</p><p>He wanted to be buried deep inside her, to watch her beautiful face as she reached her own orgasm.</p><p>\u201cI need to be in you, Regan,\u201d he groaned, capturing her lips in a rough, demanding kiss before pulling back to regard her with a raw, undisguised yearning. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you waiting for, chief?\u201d she husked, her smile piercing his heart with the ruthless power of a dagger.</p> <p>The bed loomed behind her, but too impatient for even that small distance, Jagr slid his hands down her pretty little bottom and with one powerful motion had her lifted off her feet with her legs wrapped around his waist.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he whispered, positioning the tip of his erection at her entrance. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Regan moaned, her body already wet and ready for his thrust.</p><p>Clutching her thighs, he captured her mouth in a devouring kiss before he plunged himself inside her, halting only when he was buried as deep as he could go.</p><p>\u201cJagr\u201d she rasped, her sheath clamping around him like a warm, luscious vise.</p><p>He momentarily stilled, savoring the sense of completeness that flooded through him. This is what it meant to be with his true mate. This intense connection that went way beyond two bodies indulging in sex.</p><p>This was two souls, two hearts, two minds joined as one.</p><p>As they both absorbed the sheer pleasure of being so intimately joined, their eyes met and Jagr gently began to thrust into her heat. Her hands lifted to frame his face, claiming his lips in a branding kiss. He moaned his pleasure, his fingers tightening on her thighs.</p> <p>More. He needed more.</p><p>He shifted his mouth to nip at her ear and was rewarded as her body shuddered with undisguised need.</p><p>\u201cGod, I want taste you,\u201d he muttered as he nibbled and stroked a path down her neck, careful not to break her skin with his extended fangs. \u201cEverywhere.\u201d</p><p>Regan gasped as Jagr licked the underside of her breast. \u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s a good start.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled as he thrust even deeper, his tongue finding the hardened tip of her nipple.</p><p>\u201cWhat about here?\u201d</p><p>Her legs tightened as he quickened his pace, her head falling back to reveal the smooth, tempting curve of her throat.</p><p>Oh...gods.</p><p>Every instinct urged him to pierce that ivory perfection. To sink his fangs in deep, and take in her essence as he pounded into her body. To mark her as his, and only his.</p><p>With a low growl, he wrenched his thoughts from the dangerous enticement and concentrated on surging into her damp heat. A task made considerably easier as her fingernails sank into his back and she moaned in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cFaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my demanding Were,\u201d he breathed as he suckled on a tender nipple.</p><p>Someday he would know the satisfaction of taking Regan\u2019s blood as he took her body. For today this was enough.</p><p>More than enough, he acknowledged as his cock sank to the very heart of her.</p><p>Her nails dug deeper as he steadily pumped himself into her. \u201cChrist, Jagr, I\u2019m...\u201d</p><p>His fingers bit deep into her skin, his need an unbearable ache. The flames were beginning to consume him and nothing had ever felt so glorious.</p><p>They surged together. Her pants filled the air, mixed with his low moans. Deeper, faster, climbing ever higher.</p><p>Then with one last thrust, he heard Regan cry out in release as he climaxed with enough force to shatter the remaining lamp and blast the marble statues in the bathroom into a fine layer of dust.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Lying in Jagr\u2019s arms on the bed, Regan floated in a fog of pleasure.</p><p>Sweaty, shivering, sated pleasure.</p><p>Good Lord.</p><p>That had been...</p><p>Well, she didn\u2019t actually have words to describe what had just happened between her and Jagr. Fierce, certainly. Overwhelming. Shattering.</p><p>And insanely wonderful.</p><p>With a rueful smile she glanced around the room. There was little left to destroy after their last bout of sex, but what remained was now scattered across the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI sincerely hope that your tastes run toward Tupperware instead of Tiffany in that lair of yours, chief,\u201d she murmured, unable to keep her fingers from tracing the scars that ran the length of his stomach. \u201cThings could get expensive after a wild night.\u201d</p><p>He shifted to steal a brief, heart-pounding kiss. \u201cSince you seem to be the only trigger for my more destructive tendencies, I\u2019ll be certain to lock away the china when you visit.\u201d</p><p>His tone was light, but Regan tensed, unable to halt her instinctive withdrawal at his possessive tone. During the heat of the moment, she\u2019d managed to block out his unnerving suggestion that she was his mate. Hell, at that precise moment she would have been able to block out a looming apocalypse.</p><p>Now she discovered that the thought made it difficult to breathe. As if she was being smothered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming I\u2019ll visit your lair?\u201d she tried to tease, not entirely surprised when his eyes narrowed. He was far too capable of sensing her emotions not to catch whiff of her unease.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding you naked in my arms after enjoying the most intense orgasm either of us has ever experienced.\u201d He caught and held her wary gaze. \u201cWhat else would I assume?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, weakly. \u201cWho knows what the future might hold?\u201d</p><p>There was no return smile. In fact, his expression was downright grim.</p><p>\u201cWho, indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should get dressed. I promised Styx that I would...\u201d Pressing her hands against his chest, she struggled to push away from his hard body, only to have the massive vampire abruptly roll on top of her. \u201cJagr.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shimmered with suppressed irritation in the thick shadows. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His body pressing her intimately into the mattress did nothing to help her breathing troubles.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about mates or emotional entanglements or the fear of being expected to offer something she didn\u2019t even know if she possessed.</p><p>She just wanted to spread her legs and allow pure, uncomplicated sensation to sweep her away.</p><p>So much easier.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jagr seemed more intent of forcing an unwelcome discussion rather than enjoying their brief time together.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she at last forced herself to demand.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come down here tonight determined to seduce me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think that was obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndulge me.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed a resigned sigh. \u201cI wanted you. You said you wanted me. Granted, I\u2019ve been caged most of my life, but I was under the assumption that was an adequate reason for two people to have sex. Am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I wanted you, I still want you, but not out of some twisted sense of sympathy.\u201d</p><p>Sympathy? Her brows snapped together. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>His jaw was tight as he glared down at her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want me to punish myself for hurting you, so you came down here determined to do whatever necessary to distract me.\u201d</p><p>It took a second for his words to sink in, but when they did, her temper instantly flared.</p><p>\u201cYou think this was a pity fuck?\u201d she gritted.</p><p>He flinched at her blunt words. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re the one who\u2019s implying I\u2019m willing to barter my body for a bit of comfort. Real nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes there have to be a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it could be exactly as you said...\u201d He deliberately paused, then with an exaggerated motion he rolled off her and stood beside the bed. \u201cA mindless coupling to relieve a physical urge. Maybe I should be grateful you didn\u2019t decide Tane would do.\u201d</p><p>Scrambling off the mattress, Regan jerkily pulled on her clothes, covertly watching as Jagr did the same. Her stomach did a funny flop as he slid the stone-washed jeans up the powerful muscles of thighs and over his butt. Holy crap.

I came down here because I was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was a pity...\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d slammed her hand across his mouth before he could throw her words back into her face.</p><p>\u201cI came down here because I was worried, but that\u2019s not the reason I seduced you.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up, he tugged her hand from his lips, his thumb absently rubbing a tender circle on her inner wrist.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to tell me why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I needed to be with you,\u201d she muttered awkwardly. Christ. She didn\u2019t do confessionals. They made her feel like a cheap extra on As the World Turns. \u201cAnd it had to be you. Just you. Nobody else.\u201d She shook her head as his lips parted. \u201cDon\u2019t freaking ask me why, because I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Bending his head, he stroked his lips over the pulse hammering in her inner wrist.</p><p>\u201cIf you need me, then the thought of visiting my lair shouldn\u2019t send you into a panic.\u201d</p><p>A renewed sense of alarm had her tugging her hand free so she could step back.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have if you hadn\u2019t mentioned that whole mate thing.\u201d</p> <p>He searched her tight expression. \u201cAre you afraid I intend to trap you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...\u201d She wrapped her arms around her waist, unable to find the words for her unease. \u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout me being your mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t carry my mark yet, but yes, I\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, telling herself it was all some cosmic mistake. This large, beautiful, incredibly sexy predator deserved a mate who could offer untarnished, unconditional devotion. Not a screwed-up Were who was torn between fleeing in utter terror, and a breathless dread of never seeing him again.</p><p>\u201cHow can it even be possible? I mean, we\u2019ve done nothing but argue since we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of fate\u2019s little jokes, no doubt.\u201d</p> <p>Ridiculously, she felt a prick of disappointment at his mocking tone.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound particularly happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d He planted his fists on his hips, the movement stretching the shirt over his massive chest. \u201cAfter centuries of being alone, I at last find the female destined to be my mate, and she has commitment issues. Forgive me for not jumping for joy.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin, although her gaze kept straying down to the enticing ripple of muscle beneath that damned shirt.</p><p>Hey, she might be a demon, but she was all female.</p><p>Who wouldn\u2019t be distracted?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have issues, I just...\u201d</p><p>Golden brows arched as she struggled to find the words. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just not ready to think about the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found Culligan. What else do you have to think about but the future?\u201d</p><p>She latched onto the first thing that came to mind. \u201cMy sister for one thing.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cDarcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the one being held captive by Caine.\u201d She met his exasperated gaze with a tight smile. \u201cI think we might have a means to track her.\u201d</p><p>Levet was not a happy gargoyle.</p><p>He\u2019d come to Hannibal to rescue Regan from the clutches of the evil imp. He was supposed to be the hero who won the fair damsel and was celebrated among the demon-world.</p><p>Instead, he\u2019d not only lost the girl to yet another devious vampire, but he was now stuck playing babysitter to a bad-tempered cur who couldn\u2019t decide if he wanted to be a good or bad guy.</p><p>Where was the justice in that?</p><p>And to top it off, he was stuck in a cramped fishing cabin that was nearly hidden in a tangle of trees, waiting for Salvatore to make an appearance at dawn.</p><p>Kicking a stray rock, Levet negotiated the narrow trail that ran along the Mississippi River.</p><p>When Salvatore had commanded Duncan to meet him at a private sanctuary less than an hour north of St. Louis, Levet had held on to the hope the place would be along the lines of Hefner\u2019s Playboy Mansion. Salvatore might be a dog, but he was King of the Dogs, and rumors were that he liked the ladies.</p><p>Stupid Were.</p><p>The splash of water wrenched Levet out of his satisfying bout of self-pity, and with a sinking heart he turned toward the river to watch as Bella\u2019s head popped into view, the rest of her body remaining hidden in the murky waves.</p><p>\u201cWell, well.\u201d A smug smile touched her lovely face. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t the stunted gargoyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacrebleu.\u201d Levet threw up his hands in resignation. \u201cAm I to be forever tormented by you? Why will you not go away?\u201d</p><p>The water sprite pouted. Oy. She managed to make even that a thing of beauty.</p><p>\u201cUntil the cur makes his third wish, I am free to roam as I please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen roam somewhere else, you annoying pest.\u201d</p><p>She swam closer. \u201cYou\u2019re only mad because I managed to lure you into a trap.\u201d</p><p>Levet snorted, refusing to admit his pride was stung at having been so easily distracted by the tempting sprite.</p><p>\u201cI am mad because you make my head hurt.\u201d His eyes narrowed as he was struck by a sudden thought. \u201cWait. Duncan has wishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe summoned me,\u201d she said, sounding annoyed that he would even ask such an obvious question. \u201cThat\u2019s the deal. You summon me, you get three wishes.\u201d</p><p>Of course Levet knew the basics of calling a water sprite. He\u2019d accidentally done it just a few weeks ago. His interest was in whether or not Duncan was playing some devious game.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t he just wish for you to make him impervious to harm?\u201d Levet snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sprite, not a god. I can alter physical appearances, as I did with you, or conjure material possessions.\u201d She deliberately reminded him of his brief stint as a full-sized gargoyle. One capable of plundering, pillaging, and wholesale destruction. Ah, good times. \u201cBut I can\u2019t make someone immortal, or influence anyone other than the person making the wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he couldn\u2019t wish away his enemies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr make Caine forget him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, nope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what did he wish for?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cThe usual.\u201d</p><p>Levet\u2019s brief suspicion began to ease. \u201cRiches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. So tedious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis own private island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he want an island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he has some grandiose scheme to take over the renegade curs and start his own pack, once Salvatore kills Caine for him.\u201d</p><p>His wings snapped with mocking amusement. \u201cWhat a titty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTitty?\u201d Bella blinked in confusion. \u201cOh...do you mean boob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTitty, boob, whatever,\u201d he dismissed. \u201cSalvatore will never allow the curs to escape to some private Garden of Eden. They\u2019ll be lucky to keep their hides. The King of Weres might be a pureblood, but he\u2019s as rabid as any dog. He should have been put down years ago, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t tell my victims...\u201d Bella hastily tried to cover her slip. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t tell my fortunate masters what to wish for. I just obey.\u201d</p><p>Levet wasn\u2019t fooled. As a full blooded demon, he was immune to the water sprite\u2019s curse, but most men greedy enough to accept the offer of her three wishes, soon learned the truth in the old saying, \u201cIf it sounds too good to be true...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why hasn\u2019t Duncan demanded his last wish?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled. \u201cHe\u2019s a cur, not a demon.\u201d</p><p>It took a minute, then his eyes widened. \u201cAh. So like a human, his last wish will condemn him to the watery depths of your nest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a smart little gargoyle,\u201d she murmured, swimming forward and stepping out of the river to reveal her full glory.</p><p>And what glory it was.</p><p>Levet\u2019s tail went stiff as the moonlight lapped over the tiny, perfectly formed woman wearing nothing more than a sheer toga. The sprite might be the most dim-witted, annoying creature ever to have crossed his path, but with her white skin, slanted blue eyes, and pale green hair, she was causing all sorts of things to hum and jump and grow.</p><p>Grow really hard.</p><p>\u201cMon Dieu,\u201d he groaned in genuine pain.</p><p>Smiling, she sashayed toward him, her hands running down her generous curves. \u201cDo you like?\u201d</p><p>Levet muttered his favorite curses. The damned sprite had made a fool of him once. He was horny (holy bat dung, was he horny), but he wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>\u201cI am a male\u2014I enjoy a good ogle as well as the next\u2014but I am also a gargoyle with powers that make the demon-world shudder in fear,\u201d he muttered. \u201cMy...man parts do not rule me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA shame.\u201d She closed the tiny space he\u2019d managed to earn, enveloping him in the scent of spring rain. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about you so often during my long, lonely days beneath the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui, thoughts about putting my precious testicles into a vise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. When I thought about your testicles, they were in quite a different place.\u201d</p> <p>She deliberately licked her lips, and Levet nearly swallowed his tongue.</p><p>He wanted to be ruled by his man parts.</p><p>Actually he wanted to rule her with his man parts.</p><p>This whole being sensible thing sucked.</p><p>\u201cBah,\u201d he managed to croak. \u201cDo you think I have forgotten that you betrayed me at the first opportunity?\u201d</p> <p>She did another one of those charming pouts. \u201cI will admit I was the teeniest bit annoyed that you condemned me back to my nest after I helped you rescue your friends. Can you blame me?\u201d</p><p>A thread of irritation managed to bubble through his raging lust.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes, I can blame you. I was magic-bombed...by a cur.\u201d He pounded a fist against his chest. \u201cMe. Do you know the indignity I will suffer if that little embarrassment gets back to my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, pooh. Who will tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let me think...\u201d He pointed a claw in her direction. \u201cYou. You will tell them. What better revenge than to make me a source of mockery among my brethren?\u201d</p><p>She studied him with a vacant gaze. \u201cBut I would think you were already...\u201d She slapped a hand over her mouth. \u201cOops.\u201d</p> <p>Levet quivered with outrage. \u201cI am already what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it was something.\u201d He turned his hand over, allowing a small ball of flame to dance in his palm. \u201cMaybe I should just change you into a toad and be done with it. At least I won\u2019t have to worry about you flapping your lips.\u201d</p><p>Rather than trembling in terror, the aggravating pest leaned down to stroke her fingers lightly on the tip of his wings.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s not be hasty, my tiny gargoyle.\u201d</p><p>Ohhhhh. It was good. So good.</p><p>\u201cI am not tiny,\u201d he denied, his voice strained. \u201cI am majestically petite.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers dipped and fondled and caressed.</p> <p>\u201cI like petite.\u201d</p><p>He groaned against his will. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lips say no, but your wings say yes.\u201d</p><p>Levet glanced over his shoulder, realizing the treacherous things were glowing like a neon light in front of a cheap bar.</p><p>\u201cStupid wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about these delectable horns?\u201d Her hands skimmed up to toy with the stunted nubs. \u201cWhat do they have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBella...\u201d She stroked a particularly tender spot, and his knees nearly gave way. Now this was a sprite who knew the secrets of pleasing a gargoyle. \u201cOh. Sacrebleu. Where did you learn to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere and there.\u201d She leaned down to lick the tip of one horn. \u201cDo you want to discover what else I\u2019ve learned?\u201d</p><p>Eyes rolling back in his head, Levet conceded defeat. No, he leaped headfirst into defeat.</p><p>If this was a trap, then screw it.</p><p>\u201cYes. Gods, yes.\u201d</p><p>The great philosophers, poets, and playwrights devoted entire lives to revealing the ironies of life.</p><p>Jagr had made a study of their works.</p><p>He\u2019d intellectually understood their struggles to make sense of a sometimes senseless existence. But there\u2019d always been a part of himself removed from their experiences.</p><p>For centuries he had remained distant from society, watching from the shadows and rarely interacting. Shrouded in peace and solitude, he often considered the portrayals of intimate relationships as nothing more than melodramatic drivel.</p><p>How could love, or even affection, offer such uncertainty, such confusion, such downright torture?</p><p>Now he understood with painful clarity.</p><p>Since Regan\u2019s arrival in his world, nothing was the same.</p><p>It was like existing in the midst of a whirlwind, he grimly acknowledged, pacing Tane\u2019s bedroom with jerky steps. One moment he was drowning in sensual pleasure, the next he was struggling against the bleak tide of resignation as Regan panicked at the thought of being his mate.</p><p>And the next...</p><p>The next he was consumed with pure fury as Regan revealed her adventures in stupidity while he\u2019d been locked in Gaynor\u2019s prison.</p><p>\u201cYou went searching for Sadie without Tane?\u201d he gritted, his voice dripping with ice as he sought to contain his ravaging emotions.</p><p>Standing near the door to the bathroom, Regan jerked a brush through her glorious curls, her jaw set in stubborn lines even though she had to know she was in the wrong.</p><p>\u201cHe was a little too sun-combustible to join me.\u201d</p><p>Jagr fiercely refused to remember just how wondrous it had felt to run his fingers though that golden mane.</p><p>\u201cDammit, when you said you found Culligan, I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d been out roaming the countryside alone.\u201d</p><p>The green eyes shimmered with warning. \u201cBecause a pureblooded Were can\u2019t take care of herself without a vampire playing bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if something happened to you, it would send me over the edge,\u201d he ground out the brutal truth. \u201cAnd nothing would bring me back.\u201d</p><p>He heard her catch her breath, the brush dropping from her fingers as her defensive expression softened.</p><p>\u201cLook, all I intended to do was see if I could track the curs. I had no plans to confront them without Tane and Styx.\u201d</p><p>Jagr stilled, struck by the sudden realization that Regan had managed to do what he\u2019d tried and failed to do.</p><p>\u201cHow did you track them?\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched at the hint of irritation he couldn\u2019t hide.</p><p>\u201cGaynor mentioned Sadie\u2019s obsession with his peanut butter fudge. Once I had the scent, I searched until I ran across it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeanut butter fudge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked.\u201d</p><p>He muttered an ancient curse. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where you found Culligan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was chained in the shed.\u201d She shrugged, but it didn\u2019t disguise the lingering revulsion. \u201cWhen I questioned him, I learned that Gaynor\u2019s portal was weak, and that you were probably being held close to where you disappeared. I decided to take his amulet and see if I could find you.\u201d</p><p>Jagr bit back his harsh words. As furious as he might be, he\u2019d rather cut out his tongue than cause Regan unnecessary distress.</p><p>\u201cAnd Duncan?\u201d he instead demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe stumbled over each other when I left the cabin.\u201d</p><p>The thought of the cur not only attacking Regan, but actually holding her captive was enough to make his fangs lengthen and the room fill with a frigid burst of power.</p><p>Not bloodlust, just good old-fashioned fury any male would feel at his mate being harmed.</p><p>\u201cHe could have killed you.\u201d</p><p>With an impatient click of her tongue, Regan moved to stand directly before him.</p><p>\u201cOne more word about me putting myself in danger and we\u2019re done with this conversation, chief.\u201d</p><p>Chief. Absurdly, the pet name helped to calm his temper. It reminded him that for all her protests, Regan wasn\u2019t as emotionally detached as she wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he grudgingly conceded. What was the point in arguing? Regan would do what she wanted. Always.</p><p>And in some twisted way, it was what he admired most about her.</p><p>Irony, indeed.</p><p>\u201cBesides, it all worked out for the best,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cNow we can at least hope my sister can be rescued.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was true enough. Jagr scrubbed his hands over his face, feeling weary despite his recent feeding of the cur.</p><p>A small part of him wished he\u2019d managed to pack his bag and return to the sanctity of his lair. Every moment spent in Regan\u2019s company was bound to deepen the sense of loss when she disappeared from his world.</p><p>But even as the cowardly thought flared through his mind, he was dismissing it.</p><p>So long as this beautiful Were had need of him, he would stand at her side.</p><p>Pitiful, but true.</p><p>With a restless shake of his head, Jagr headed toward the door to the outer rooms.</p><p>\u201cWe must share this information with Styx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d</p><p>Halting, he glanced over his shoulder. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, strangely uncertain. As if she struggled with some inner demon.</p><p>At last she gave a jerky shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Jagr bit back his curse of impatience. He might not be the most perceptive vampire, but he did learn from his mistakes. And trying to press Regan would only make her dig in her heels deeper.</p><p>A knowledge that did nothing to ease his temper as he stormed from the rooms and went in search of his Anasso.</p><p>Following the unmistakable scent of power, Jagr moved through the surveillance rooms to a large library, complete with plasma TV. Not surprisingly, Styx was engrossed in a rare book on the history of the Huguenots rather than watching Cinemax. The ancient vampire had never possessed Jagr\u2019s interest in the ever changing society, and it was only because he was determined to please his new mate that he wasn\u2019t still living in a damp cavern without one modern convenience. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Jagr stepped through the door, Styx was on his feet, his lifted brow revealing he was well aware of his companion\u2019s tangled emotions, although he was smart enough not to comment.</p><p>Instead he listened in silence as Jagr revealed Duncan\u2019s attempted negotiations with the Weres, and the cur\u2019s promise he could reveal the location of Regan\u2019s missing sister.</p><p>As he finished, Styx pulled a cell phone from his pocket and swiftly dialed Salvatore\u2019s number.</p> <p>Absently, Jagr listened to the short, tense argument, his body flaring with awareness as he felt Regan entering the room behind him.</p><p>He deliberately kept his gaze on Styx\u2019s imposing form as she halted beside him, not that it mattered. She had only to be near for him to drown in her jasmine-scented presence.</p><p>With an audible snap, Styx closed his phone and stuffed it into the pocket of his leather pants. Perhaps not surprisingly, Regan took a step closer to Jagr.</p><p>Styx was overwhelming under the best of circumstances. With the scowl marring his stark features, and his massive body tense with annoyance, any creature not brain-dead would be wary.</p><p>Either unaware, or simply ignoring the prickles in the air, Styx lifted a hand to smooth over the raven hair he\u2019d pulled into a braid that hung nearly to his knees.</p> <p>Darcy was never going to drag the proud vampire fully into the twenty-first century.</p><p>\u201cThe meeting with Duncan is set for dawn,\u201d Styx revealed, his voice hard. \u201cHe refused to offer the location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRefused?\u201d Jagr shook his head. \u201cArrogant dog.\u201d</p><p>Styx grimaced. \u201cHe has proclaimed it Were business and I have no authority to interfere, although Darcy may have a different opinion when I tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, you actually listen to your mate\u2019s opinion?\u201d Regan demanded, her tone overly sweet.</p><p>Jagr frowned, but Styx seemed to find the jab amusing. \u201cBelieve me, it was a hard-earned talent,\u201d he admitted with a low chuckle.</p> <p>Jagr\u2019s frown deepened as he glared at his king. Traitor.</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to return to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>Styx briefly closed his eyes, testing the air. \u201cIt is too late to make the journey tonight,\u201d he concluded, opening his eyes. \u201cAnd I would prefer to clean up any loose ends before leaving.\u201d</p><p>Jagr gave a dip of his head. \u201cSpeaking of loose ends, I have an imp to track down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dawn is only two hours away,\u201d Styx warned.</p><p>Jagr patted one of the numerous daggers strapped to his body. \u201cThis won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will join you.\u201d Styx took a step forward. \u201cOnce the imp is dead, we can search the cabin that Regan found. It could be the remaining curs have returned there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means you\u2019ll need me if you want to find the place,\u201d Regan said, a smug smile curving her lips.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need. We can follow your trail,\u201d Jagr said, unable to halt the futile words even as Regan was sticking a finger in his face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even start. I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>The two stood there, glaring at one another, until Styx moved forward to slap Jagr on the back.</p><p>\u201cI would suggest you let it go, old friend,\u201d Styx warned, leaving the room.</p><p>Jagr didn\u2019t concede defeat as much as give into the inevitable. Regan was a force of nature he didn\u2019t know how to control.</p><p>In silence, he followed Styx out of the lair and to the waiting Porsche parked in the circle drive. He even managed to hold his tongue as Regan climbed into the back, and he took his position in the passenger seat.</p><p>He\u2019d barely shut the door when Styx revved the powerful engine and hurtled them through the empty streets, his lips twisted in what Jagr strongly suspected was a smile of amusement.</p><p>What the hell happened to vampire solidarity?</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>At least the car was able to make the trip at a pace just short of light speed, and directing Styx through the back roads, he at last held up his hand.</p><p>\u201cStop here.\u201d He pointed toward the frilly house on the corner. \u201cThe tea shop is just ahead.\u201d</p><p>The Porsche came to a halt, and they climbed out to stand in the shadows of a dogwood tree.</p><p>A dogwood that was currently decorated with a familiar, albeit considerably worse for the wear, truck.</p><p>Styx studied the ruined vehicle with a lift of his brows. \u201cTane\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Jagr glanced toward Regan, who was looking decidedly guilty. \u201cYour handiwork?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019d never driven before.\u201d She gave an awkward lift of her shoulder. \u201cBesides, it was already a piece of junk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suggest you keep your keys close at hand, my lord,\u201d he said, dryly.</p><p>\u201cHa. Very funny.\u201d With a toss of her head, Regan moved down the street, her back rigid.</p><p>Styx smiled. \u201cAlthough I hate to question Regan\u2019s skill in demolition, I have to admit she is a mere amateur in destroying cars compared to Levet. That gargoyle possesses an exquisite ability to mangle even the finest vehicle. Just ask Viper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering Viper\u2019s unnatural obsession with his cars, I would rather not provoke any unpleasant memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise choice,\u201d Styx drawled.</p><p>\u201cI occasionally have moments of self-preservation.\u201d His gaze was instinctively drawn to Regan as she paced impatiently just across the street from the tea shop. \u201cAlthough not nearly so many as I might hope for.\u201d</p><p>Styx laid a surprisingly gentle hand on his shoulder. \u201cI would tell you that it gets easier, but I try to make it a policy not to lie any more than necessary.\u201d</p><p>Jagr winced as a sharp pang pierced his heart. \u201cOur time together draws to an end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the Oracles can read the future. Cezar is proof of that.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s lips twisted. Cezar\u2019s mate had turned out to be one of the rare Oracles, a fate that Jagr wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone.</p><p>Bad enough to have a bad-tempered Were with a commitment phobia.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need an Oracle to tell me that Regan is determined to remain a true lone wolf.\u201d</p><p>Obviously weary of waiting, Regan planted her hands on her hips and glared at the two vampires.</p><p>\u201cAre we doing this, or what?\u201d</p><p>Styx slanted Jagr an amused glance. \u201cBossy little thing, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Throwing up her hands in defeat, Regan turned on her heel and marched across the street to the silent tea shop.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should make sure she doesn\u2019t run into trouble,\u201d Styx murmured.</p><p>\u201cIf only it was possible.\u201d Jagr was swiftly rushing after her tiny form, a sudden urgency lending him speed as she disappeared through the gate of the picket fence and rounded the back of the house. Even at a distance, the scent of rotting peaches filled the air. \u201cRegan.\u201d</p><p>She came to an abrupt halt, her expression wary. \u201cI smell it. Is he dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jagr didn\u2019t need to see Gaynor\u2019s body to feel the violence that shrouded the house. \u201cAnd his death wasn\u2019t pleasant. There\u2019s a lot of blood.\u201d</p><p>Appearing from the shadows, Styx studied the broken French doors. \u201cThere are three dead curs, and one unconscious, as well as the dead imp. I sense no one else.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s gaze searched the dark garden, his instincts tingling with an unmistakable warning.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t prowling around,\u201d he growled. \u201cThose damn amulets make it impossible to be certain.\u201d</p><p>Styx frowned. \u201cWe should make a quick sweep of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go.\u201d Jagr continued his wary survey. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr...\u201d</p><p>He placed a finger over Regan\u2019s lips to halt her protest. \u201cNo, Regan, this has nothing to do with protecting you.\u201d</p><p>Styx stepped closer. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I can put my finger on. I just think we should keep guard.\u201d</p><p>The ancient vampire nodded, not questioning Jagr\u2019s vague unease.</p><p>\u201cI trust your instincts, my brother. I will not be long.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Regan watched as the very large, very scary Styx disappeared through the French doors before turning to study Jagr with a frown.</p><p>She felt strangely numb as the smell of death and violence wrapped around her.</p><p>Maybe not surprising after the last few days.</p><p>There was only so much a woman, even one accustomed to demon brutality, could bear without going into emotional overload.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean, however, she was oblivious to the danger that continued to haunt her.</p><p>She had only to glance at Jagr\u2019s tight expression to be reminded.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you sense?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re being watched.\u201d Without even glancing in her direction (a seeming trend this evening), Jagr tugged two daggers from his boots and handed her one. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Gingerly taking the dagger, she grimaced at the long, lethally sharp blade.</p><p>\u201cSilver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Try not to stick yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where I\u2019d like to stick it.\u201d</p><p>Expecting a sharp response, Regan was caught off guard as Jagr slowly turned, his expression somber. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre we destined to be enemies, little one?\u201d</p><p>She floundered at the soft, but inexorable question.</p><p>Christ, this vampire tied her knots. Why couldn\u2019t he just let her panic and drive him away with her volatile, completely irrational behavior?</p> <p>It\u2019s what any decent demon would do.</p><p>Instead, he stood there staring at her with that icily guarded expression that she knew hid just how much her answer meant to him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she at last whispered, unable to deliver the final, unalterable blow. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be your enemy, Jagr. I seem to have enough of them already.\u201d</p><p>Lifting a hand, he gently cupped her face. \u201cRegan...\u201d</p><p>She had no idea what he was about to say, nor was she destined to discover, as Jagr abruptly turned toward the house, his body stiff with tension.</p> <p>\u201cJagr, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA trap,\u201d he rasped, charging toward the French doors with a near blinding speed. \u201cStyx.\u201d</p><p>Momentarily stunned, Regan watched as Jagr disappeared into the tea shop. What the hell? Regan stepped forward, intent on following Jagr, when there was an audible click, followed instantly by the sound of an explosion that made the earth shake beneath her feet.</p><p>The world seemed stuck in slow motion as Regan watched in horror while the flames and smoke billowed through the house. Then without warning, the concussion hit, sending her flying backward as the house shattered from the force of the blast.</p><p>Jagr.</p><p>Stark panic clawed through her, but she was helpless as she was tossed like a piece of trash through the air, at last crashing into an oak tree with enough force to briefly knock her unconscious.</p> <p>The blackness came and went with a blazing flare of pain, but Regan ignored the dizziness and urge to toss up what little remained in her stomach. She didn\u2019t have time to be sick. Jagr had been in the house. She had to reach him, and by God, if he\u2019d let himself be killed, she was going to...</p><p>\u201cAlone at last, bitch.\u201d</p><p>Consumed with her desperate fear, Regan was completely unprepared for the tall, dark-haired, dark-eyed woman who dropped from the branches of the tree to stand directly in her path.</p><p>Stumbling to a halt, Regan gritted her teeth as her gaze swept over the stranger, absently grimacing at the leather bustier and pants that matched the high-heeled boots. It wasn\u2019t the Sluts-R-Us outfit, however, that caught and held her attention. Instead it was the hard, perfectly toned muscles that revealed this woman wasn\u2019t just a local stripper on her way home from a hard night.</p><p>That, and the complete absence of scent.</p><p>\u201cSadie,\u201d she breathed, her gut twisting with fury.</p><p>This woman was behind luring Regan to Hannibal, behind Gaynor imprisoning Jagr, and now behind an explosion that might very well have killed her vampire.</p><p>She was going to cut her heart right out of her freaking chest.</p> <p>\u201cI see my reputation precedes me,\u201d the woman taunted, clearly unaware that she was already dead. \u201cWhat? No snappy banter? I knew you were bound to be a disappointment.\u201d</p><p>Regan slowly began to circle the cur. During her unexpected flight, she\u2019d dropped the dagger that Jagr had given her. Go figure. And while her instincts howled for an opportunity to rip out her heart, she wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>Now was not the time to take chances. Not when Jagr needed her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need snappy banter to kill you,\u201d she drawled, hoping to keep the woman distracted.</p><p>\u201cYou kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing without your vampire, you genetic freak,\u201d the woman mocked. \u201cA Were who can\u2019t even shift.\u201d</p><p>Regan\u2019s heart twisted at the mention of Jagr, but she grimly kept circling the cur.</p><p>\u201cI may be a freak, but I\u2019m a pureblooded freak, which is more than you can say...cur.\u201d</p><p>Reaching behind her back, Sadie tugged free a tightly coiled whip.</p><p>A whip?</p><p>Who the hell used a whip? Well, who besides Indiana Jones?</p><p>With a practiced flip of her hand, the cur snapped her wrist, sending the tail of the whip cracking a mere inch from Regan\u2019s face.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>Leaping back, Regan swallowed a curse of frustration. The whip couldn\u2019t kill her, but it could wrap around her and hold her immobile.</p><p>Not to mention it had enough reach to keep her from easily retrieving the dagger.</p><p>The only hope was leading Sadie away from the damned thing so she could try and make a dash for it when the cur was off guard.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re better than me?\u201d The whip snaked out again, slicing through the flesh of Regan\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think, I know.\u201d Ignoring the blood that dripped down her neck, Regan altered her course as if she were trying to reach the nearby gate. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing more than an infected human who can imitate a Were but never become one. A pathetic wannabe.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes flared as the words hit their mark. \u201cYou know nothing.\u201d</p><p>Regan jerked to the side as the whip flared out. \u201cI know of your psycho plan to use my sister as some sort of guinea pig, in the pathetic hope you can become more than the bottom-feeders of the demon-world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our destiny to rule.\u201d</p><p>Regan took two steps closer to the gate, hiding her grim satisfaction as Sadie followed.</p><p>\u201cBecause some idiot saw it in a vision?\u201d</p><p>Crack. The whip cut a deep slice through her abdomen, ruining her new shirt.</p><p>Bitch.</p><p>\u201cCaine is a prophet,\u201d Sadie hissed.</p><p>Regan didn\u2019t bother hiding her flare of pain as she stumbled, deliberately glancing over her shoulder as if judging the distance to the open gate.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a whack job who should be put in a straightjacket, and you\u2019re even more of a whack job to believe him. I suppose the old saying is true\u2014\u2018There\u2019s a sucker born every minute.\u2019\u201d</p><p>A hard smile curved the woman\u2019s lips. A pity really. The cur would have been beautiful if not for the vicious expression.</p><p>Well, that and the tart-from-hell outfit.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your faith, Were?\u201d Sadie demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhen someone starts babbling about visions, my first thought is medication, not hallelujah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, that\u2019s what is wrong with youth today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSanity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCynicism.\u201d A hand stroked up the bustier, cupping a still pert breast. \u201cLook at me, I was a two-bit whore who was regularly raped by my father, and traded my body for the heroin that made my personal hell bearable. Then Caine changed everything, and soon I\u2019ll be a queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen of Dogs?\u201d She mocked, ignoring the heat of the burning tea house as she managed another few steps. Dammit, she had to get to that dagger and kill the bitch. If Jagr were still alive...no, he was alive. She couldn\u2019t allow herself to think anything else. And she had to get to him. \u201cBig deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly better than wasting my time whining and pouting because you think you got a bad break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad break? Culligan tortured me for the past thirty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoohoo. So you had a few cuts and bruises.\u201d The whip sizzled through the air, striking Regan\u2019s neck even as she dove to the side. \u201cDid you have to spread your legs for every disgusting male who couldn\u2019t get it up unless he was beating on you? Did you sleep in an alley and pray someone would slit your throat so you didn\u2019t have to wake up?\u201d</p><p>Regan gritted her teeth. She healed swiftly, but she was losing too much blood.</p><p>\u201cWorse, I\u2019ve had to listen to your entire life story,\u201d she taunted, luring Sadie even further from the dagger. \u201cDo you bore everyone with it? Because that might explain why your only friend is an outlaw cur with delusions of grandeur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than a stunted gargoyle and a walking corpse.\u201d The black eyes smoldered with hatred. \u201cTell me, what\u2019s it like banging a cold stiff?\u201d</p><p>Regan hissed, her wolf howling with the urge to kill.</p><p>\u201cGod damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, did I touch a nerve?\u201d Sadie unwittingly stepped further from the dagger, using the whip to slice another wound on Regan\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou know, you have no one to blame but yourself for his untimely death. Well...second death. If you\u2019d just come along nicely, there\u2019d be no reason for the gorgeous vampire to die.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Regan pressed a hand to the gaping wound. A few more steps.</p><p>Just a few.</p><p>\u201cI have issues with becoming a lab rat for a bunch of dogs. Sue me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather kill you, but unfortunately that\u2019s going to have to wait until Caine is confident he has all he needs from your sister.\u201d</p><p>Regan never halted her slow circle, but her eyes narrowed at the mention of her sister.</p><p>Just maybe she could kill two birds with one stone.</p><p>Or two worthless curs.</p><p>\u201cWhy does he want me?\u201d</p><p>Sadie sneered as she flicked a dismissive gaze over Regan\u2019s tattered, bloody body.</p><p>\u201cYou, my freak, are our backup in case she\u2019s so ill-mannered as to croak on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevolutions are always messy.\u201d She lashed out with her whip, frowning when Regan managed to dance out of the path. \u201cAt least for the losers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, you have that right.\u201d From the corner of her eye, Regan could see the silver of the dagger glittering in the moonlight. Time to bring out the big guns. \u201cAs your beloved Caine is about to discover. Salvatore is already on his trail.\u201d</p><p>Sadie snarled, her eyes suddenly glowing with an eerie light as the urge to shift pulsed through her body.</p><p>\u201cI suppose this is some pathetic trick to try and distract me?\u201d</p> <p>Regan managed a mocking smile despite her pain. \u201cYou really need to work on that sparkling personality of yours, Sadie. It doesn\u2019t seem to inspire the sort of loyalty that successful revolutions are made of.\u201d Her smile widened. \u201cDuncan has already turned traitor.\u201d</p><p>Sadie froze. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Regan began to covertly angle directly toward the dagger. She couldn\u2019t waste any more time.</p><p>\u201cSurely you can\u2019t be surprised?\u201d she demanded, inwardly judging the remaining distance. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you did to him, but the cur hates you with a passion. He couldn\u2019t wait to set up a meeting with Salvatore to squeal everything he knows about Caine and his secret laboratories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if Caine would reveal anything to a mere peon like Duncan,\u201d Sadie scorned, although she couldn\u2019t disguise the tightening of her hard features. \u201cThey\u2019ll never find him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, they will.\u201d Regan grunted as the whip caught her across the shoulder. She was going to shove that thing up Sadie\u2019s ass once this was over. For the moment, all she could do was grin and bear it. \u201cAnd, if you\u2019re as smart as you claim to be, then you\u2019ll contact Salvatore and try to make your own deal. If you can lead him directly to my sister, he might be willing to negotiate with you rather than Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be no negotiating,\u201d Sadie hissed, trembling with the need to shift. \u201cIf Salvatore interferes, he\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not a betting woman, Sadie, because you\u2019re backing the wrong horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d the cur screeched. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Prepared for Sadie\u2019s attempt to wrap the whip around her, Regan lunged to the ground, managing to avoid the strike. Remaining on her hands and knees, she crawled the short distance, at long last managing to grasp the dagger.</p> <p>A surge of victory tingled through her. About freaking time. Sadie was soooo dead.</p><p>Closing her fingers around the hilt, she was already envisioning sliding the silver blade deep into the bitch\u2019s heart when a low growl filled the air.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Regan swiftly rolled to the side, barely avoiding the snapping jaws of the shifted cur.</p><p>Obviously Sadie had decided that if she couldn\u2019t take Regan alive, then she\u2019d take her dead.</p><p>Or maybe she just couldn\u2019t control that cur instinct of hers.</p><p>In either case, Regan abruptly knew she was in serious danger.</p><p>Rolling onto her back, Regan caught her first sight of the transformed Sadie. She was a beautiful wolf. Of course. Large and lean, her pelt was a rich mahogany, with a touch of silver on her muzzle. In the darkness her eyes glowed with a crimson light, sending a tingle over Regan\u2019s skin as if her own wolf was struggling to respond.</p> <p>Something that might almost have been envy briefly flared through Regan before she was thrusting aside the inane sensation and concentrating on more important matters.</p><p>Like staying alive.</p><p>Growling deep in her throat, Sadie prepared to leap, and realizing that it would be fatal to be pinned to the ground, Regan lashed out with the dagger.</p><p>She was too far away to do more than cut a shallow gash through the cur\u2019s chest, but the burn of silver was enough to make Sadie leap backward instinctively.</p><p>Swift to take advantage, Regan was on her feet, her gaze never wavering from the cur who was moving to the side in an effort to catch Regan from behind.</p><p>She stepped in perfect time with the cur, the dagger held at her side. In her current form, Sadie held a distinct advantage, not only in size, but sheer, raw strength.</p><p>Thankfully, any common sense tended to disappear when a cur was in full-rage mode.</p><p>Sadie continued to circle, snapping her impressive fangs and occasionally feigning an attack. Regan ignored the taunts, knowing the woman was hoping to lure her into overreacting, exposing an opening.</p><p>Behind her the fire continued to spread through the tea shop, the smoke and heat spilling through the garden, but wiping away the sweat that gathered on her brow, Regan remained grimly prepared to strike. Sadie wouldn\u2019t last long. She was a cur, not a Were. Her emotions would be her downfall.</p><p>There was another feint, but as Regan refused to flinch, Sadie laid back her ears and howled in frustration.</p><p>Regan shifted her weight to the balls of her feet, her fingers tightening on the grip of the dagger. Any second now. Any...second...</p><p>The howl lowered to a growl as Sadie abruptly charged forward, her jaws parted as she leaped directly at Regan\u2019s throat. Prepared for the attack, Regan bent backwards, avoiding the snapping teeth even as she plunged her dagger deep into the cur\u2019s chest.</p><p>The blade slid in with sickening ease, but the force of Sadie\u2019s heavy body sent Regan reeling from the impact. Landing flat on her back, she ignored the teeth that sank into her shoulder and kept the dagger stuck deep into the cur\u2019s flesh. Already the stench of burning flesh was tainting the air. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the silver weakened Sadie.</p><p>She was right.</p><p>Only a few minutes passed before there was a shimmer around the wolf form, and Sadie was shifting back to human. A few minutes that seemed like an eternity as the bitch managed to gnaw her way to Regan\u2019s shoulder bone.</p><p>As the wolf melted to a human shape, Regan forced herself to ignore her pain and rolled over so she was perched on top of her nemesis. Still clutching the dagger that she\u2019d deliberately stuck in an inch above the woman\u2019s heart, she struggled to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cTell me where to find my sister,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>The pale features twisted with hate. \u201cGo screw yourself, freak.\u201d</p><p>Regan didn\u2019t hesitate as she yanked the dagger free and plunged it back in. This time directly into the heart.</p><p>The woman would rather die than betray Caine, and Regan wasn\u2019t about to waste any more time.</p><p>\u201cThis is for Jagr,\u201d she muttered as the dagger hit the cur\u2019s heart.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait to watch Sadie die.</p><p>The silver would eventually do its thing, even if the cur managed to pull out the dagger, and Regan was far more interested in reaching Jagr.</p><p>Dripping blood from a half dozen wounds, Regan reached the back terrace when she heard an eerie laugh behind her.</p><p>Against her will, her feet halted and her head turned to see Sadie, crawling the short distance to her shredded clothing, pulling a pistol from the tattered pile of leather.</p><p>Stupidly, all Regan could think about was how the hell the woman had managed to hide a gun. The freaking outfit had been stretched so tight that not even a prayer could have come between leather and skin.</p><p>Then it no longer mattered where Sadie had stashed the gun.</p><p>Smiling with cruel intent, the cur pulled the trigger. Over and over.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is for me.\u201d</p><p>Regan was quick, but there was no dodging the bullets that drilled into her torso, shattering ribs and puncturing her lungs.</p><p>The force of the projectiles dropped Regan to her knees, her breathing labored, the pain ripping through her with relentless force.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she whispered as her life began to drain from her body.</p><p>The bullets had been coated in silver.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Jagr felt like hell.</p><p>It might have been because he\u2019d just survived an explosion, had a tea shop fall on his head, and was forced to dig a tunnel to avoid becoming charcoaled.</p><p>It might have been.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>For all his lingering wounds, his current suffering was entirely due to the woman lying on the bed in Tane\u2019s lair.</p><p>Perched on the edge of the mattress, Jagr gently stroked his fingers through Regan\u2019s golden hair, his gaze compulsively running over her too-slender form that he\u2019d stripped down to the tiny bra and panties so he could keep a constant surveillance on her numerous injuries.</p><p>The gashes from the whip had healed before they had returned to the lair (not soon enough to ease Jagr\u2019s fury at the thought of Regan being flayed by the damned cur), but the bullet wounds remained angry red lesions that made his gut twist with pain.</p><p>Silver-plated bullets.</p><p>If Sadie hadn\u2019t already been dead, Jagr would have torn her apart limb by limb.</p><p>Without warning, Regan stirred beneath his fingers, and abruptly realizing his frigid power was blasting through the room, he hurriedly smothered his fury and leaned down to brush his lips over her temple in silent apology.</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back just far enough to watch her lids flutter upward, revealing her pain-dazed eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe explosion...\u201d Her voice was a low, tortured rasp. \u201cI thought...\u201d</p><p>He tenderly tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cYou thought you were rid of me? No such luck, I fear.\u201d</p><p>An echo of remembered horror darkened her eyes. \u201cGods, don\u2019t even joke.

She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone.\u201d Her distress only deepened. \u201cShe\u2019s going to warn Caine. You have to stop her.\u201d</p> <p>He cupped her cheek, his thumb rubbing the satin skin of her cheek in a soothing motion.</p><p>\u201cYou made certain that Sadie won\u2019t be talking with anyone but the grim reaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat, then the green eyes flashed with unmistakable satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist, Jagr bent down to lightly brush his lips over her brow. He loved that fire that burned deep inside her.</p><p>The fire of a survivor.</p><p>\u201cI agree, but I would have preferred you would have killed her before letting her shoot you full of silver bullets,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. They hurt like a bitch.\u201d She shifted to glance down at her chest, frowning as she caught sight of the lingering wounds. \u201cAre they out?\u201d</p><p>The air chilled as he fought back the memories of cutting the bullets from her broken body. The image would be seared into his mind for all eternity.</p><p>\u201cI removed them before we brought you back to Tane\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have we been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few hours.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI should be healed, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe silver did a lot of damage.\u201d</p><p>Shifting, he stretched out on the mattress, pulling her into his arms so he could hold her close. He paused, waiting to see if she would pull away. When she instead snuggled closer, he swallowed a moan.</p><p>This is what fate had intended.</p><p>This female completed him in a way he\u2019d never dreamed possible.</p><p>\u201cHave they found my sister?\u201d she demanded, her voice thick as she tried to hold back the healing darkness.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken with Salvatore or Levet. I doubt if they\u2019ve had time to search yet.\u201d His hand cupped the back of her head as he settled it more firmly against his chest. \u201cYour work is done, little one. You must rest.\u201d</p><p>She gathered enough strength to poke him in the side. \u201cYou should know better than to give me orders, chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like me giving you orders, then get well enough to get out of this bed and stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBully.\u201d</p><p>He dropped a kiss on top her head. \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr?\u201d she murmured as her eyes drifted shut.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stay?\u201d</p><p>His heart clenched. This time with Regan was a moment out of time. He intended to savor every second.</p><p>\u201cFor as long as you need me, little one.\u201d</p><p>With a soft sigh, she slung her arm over his body and gave into the inevitable.</p><p>Tugging her even closer, Jagr allowed the midnight jasmine to soothe away his lingering pain and heal his wounds. Although he still needed to feed to regain his strength, he realized that the gentle magic in Regan\u2019s touch was swiftly healing the last of his injuries.</p><p>Yet more proof she was his intended mate.</p><p>Drinking in the bittersweet pleasure of simply holding her close, Jagr didn\u2019t stir as he felt the encroaching presence of Styx.</p><p>His respect for the ancient vampire had gone up a great deal over the past few hours.</p><p>Not only had Styx remained unruffled as the house had fallen on their heads, but he hadn\u2019t hesitated to trust Jagr to hold back the wall of flames as he calmly blasted a hole in the thick cement and forged a path through the heavy dirt.</p><p>It was that trust that had altered something deep inside Jagr.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted to be a part of a clan. He didn\u2019t need brothers, or a leader, who cared whether he lived or died.</p><p>He just wanted to be alone.</p><p>Now he was forced to accept that he\u2019d felt...pride at Styx\u2019s faith in his ability.</p><p>Not that he was ready to leap into vampire society. Nor had he forgotten that it was Styx who sent him to Hannibal in the first place.</p><p>The cunning old Aztec had a great deal to answer for.</p><p>Entering the bedroom, Styx leaned against the doorjamb and studied the two lying on the bed. In the candlelight, his face looked like polished bronze, and his massive form was covered in black leather and sharp weapons.</p><p>Jagr impulsively shielded Regan with his larger body. Not that he feared Styx would cause her harm. What little brains he had left understood the Anasso had pledged his life to protect his sister-mate. Still, his instincts refused to be denied.</p><p>Thankfully, Styx seemed accustomed to deranged vampires, and with a faint smile, he nodded his head toward the half-hidden woman.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s healing?\u201d he demanded, softly.</p><p>\u201cSlowly.\u201d</p><p>The harsh expression promised dire retribution on the curs who had dared to hurt Regan.</p><p>\u201cSo much silver was bound to make her recovery more difficult.\u201d His attention shifted to Jagr. \u201cYou could speed the process.\u201d</p><p>Jagr tensed. The urge to share his blood with his mate was a vicious force. The means to heal her flowed through his veins, but because of the barriers she\u2019d placed between them, he was unable to share his gift.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Styx arched a brow at his sharp refusal. \u201cShe\u2019s refused your blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s refused me as her mate.\u201d His icy tone didn\u2019t hide the savage pain. \u201cI won\u2019t force any deeper connection.\u201d</p><p>Styx grimaced, realizing that Jagr couldn\u2019t share his blood without completing his half of the mating process.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Tucking the blanket around Regan\u2019s slender body, Jagr slid from the bed, careful not to disturb his sleeping beauty.</p><p>As much as he disliked giving up the rare opportunity to hold Regan without protest, Jagr had a few questions he intended to get answered.</p><p>Crossing the room, he stood directly before his king, his arms folded across his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you send me to Hannibal, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Styx met his accusing gaze with a bland smile. \u201cObviously to rescue my sister-mate. Which reminds me that I have yet to thank you for your services. You have only to name your price...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a half dozen Ravens who are the finest vampire warriors ever born,\u201d Jagr interrupted, in no mood for games. \u201cWhy did you send me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me, the Ravens have spent the past centuries hidden from society while protecting the previous Anasso. They are still struggling to learn the skills necessary to pass among the humans, including the latest technology.\u201d His smile widened with genuine amusement. \u201cYou should watch them try to use the remote control. You, on the other hand, have made a study of this era.\u201d</p><p>Jagr stiffened. He\u2019d never shared his fascination with the MTV generation, and he sure as hell hadn\u2019t announced his occasional forays into the human population.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cViper keeps a close eye on his clan.\u201d Styx shrugged. \u201cVery little escapes his notice.\u201d</p><p>Keeping a close eye sounded way too much like spying for Jagr\u2019s peace of mind.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that becoming a part of a clan included losing any right to privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViper can be a bit overzealous in his attempts to protect his brothers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jagr snorted. \u201cMeddling mother hen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you know he cares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could care without sticking his nose in my business.\u201d</p> <p>Styx flashed his rare smile, revealing fangs that could rip through steel.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but it would not be nearly so much fun.\u201d</p><p>Jagr narrowed his eyes at the deliberate goading, then with effort, he gave a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I will not be distracted,\u201d he warned. \u201cTell me the truth of why I was sent to Hannibal.\u201d</p><p>Styx silently toyed with the medallion that hung about his neck, debating just how much he was willing to share.</p> <p>\u201cIt was in part because of your comfort in moving among humans, as well as your skills as a warrior,\u201d he said, at last.</p><p>\u201cAnd the other part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that you were the one person who would be able to sympathize with what Regan had endured.\u201d</p><p>Jagr flinched. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been tortured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Styx admitted without apology. \u201cYou better than anyone could understand the damage that was done during her years of captivity, and offer patience while she struggled to come to terms with her newfound freedom.\u201d The ancient vampire grimaced. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t anticipate quite so much patience.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance at having been needed not for his strength, but for his weakness, stirred Jagr\u2019s temper, adding a sudden chill to the air.</p> <p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>Styx blandly ignored the danger prickling in the air. \u201cI assumed you would be eager to be done with your task, and bring Regan directly to Chicago. I didn\u2019t consider the possibility that you would actually encourage her dangerous lust for vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t encourage her,\u201d Jagr snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>The air dropped another ten degrees. \u201cShe\u2019s young, but she\u2019s capable of making her own decisions. In fact, she insists on it.\u201d</p><p>Styx grunted, his expression rueful. \u201cThat I believe. Any relation of Darcy is bound to have a mind of her own, and a stubborn streak a mile wide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStubborn?\u201d Jagr glanced toward the fragile woman curled on the bed. \u201cShe\u2019s as obstinate as an emula demon, with the temper of a hellhound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven more reason to return her to her family,\u201d Styx pointed out.</p> <p>Jagr snapped his brows together. Damned if he would be chastised as if he were a fledgling demon. He\u2019d done what he thought best for Regan, and he wouldn\u2019t change a thing.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted me to treat her as my prisoner, then you should have told me,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cAs I recall, I was warned to treat her with kid gloves.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps sensing he\u2019d pressed as far as he dared, Styx shrugged. \u201cTrue enough, and as the famous bard once said, \u2018All\u2019s well that ends well.\u2019 So long as there are no unexpected complications, she should be recovered enough to be moved to Chicago by this evening.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s scowl only deepened, his heart feeling as if it were being crushed in a ruthless vise.</p><p>So this was it?</p><p>This was how it was all to end?</p><p>Gods.</p><p>\u201cAre you so certain she wants to be moved?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>The golden eyes hardened with determination. \u201cIt will take two or three days before she is back to full strength. Until then she needs the protection my lair can provide. Besides, Darcy will castrate me if I don\u2019t give her the opportunity to nurse Regan back to health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Regan might castrate you for forcing her into a family reunion she doesn\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem I\u2019m in a no-win situation, not an unusual place for a mated vampire.\u201d Without warning, Styx reached out to place a comforting hand on Jagr\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDo not fear, Jagr, we will take good care of your wounded female.\u201d</p><p>Shaking off his companion\u2019s hand, as well as his sympathy, Jagr hid his jagged pain behind a stoic mask.</p><p>He\u2019d been alone for centuries.</p><p>What were a few more isolated, forlorn, miserable years?</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Salvatore?\u201d He deliberately changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Styx allowed a hint of fang to show. \u201cThe damned King of Weres has an annoying habit of forgetting that I\u2019m the Anasso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can remind him if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>The Anasso stilled, his expression unreadable. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may not possess the same hunting skills as your Ravens, but I know Salvatore\u2019s scent. Eventually I\u2019ll stumble over the dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt your skill, Jagr, but what of Regan?\u201d</p><p>His jaw knotted as he ignored the clawing need to keep her at his side.</p><p>She was his mate, the woman meant to complete his life.</p><p>He would rather have his heart cut out than to allow her to leave without him.</p><p>But what choice did he have?</p><p>Unless Regan accepted his bond, he had no claim on her.</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019re taking her to Chicago,\u201d he said, his voice as empty as his soul.</p><p>Styx frowned. \u201cI assumed you would go with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan has no need of me. Not with you to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might not be willing to admit her need, but I saw the way that she clung to you when I entered.\u201d</p><p>Jagr clenched his fists at the searing memory of Regan snuggled against him.</p><p>\u201cOnly because she was feeling alone and vulnerable,\u201d he muttered, more to convince himself than Styx. The only thing more painful than disappointment was clinging to futile hope. \u201cIf she\u2019d been in her right mind, she never would have turned to me.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s sharp laugh echoed through the room. \u201cBloody hell, I thought I was ignorant when it came to females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman doesn\u2019t cling to a man like that just because she\u2019s lonely.\u201d</p><p>Jagr took a stiff step back, swallowing the urge to howl in despair. Damn Styx. If he was trying to rub salt in Jagr\u2019s wounds then he was doing a bang-up job.</p><p>\u201cI will not discuss this with you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d With a weary motion, Styx rubbed the muscles of his neck, reminding Jagr that the older vampire had endured his own share of wounds. \u201cI would appreciate discovering if Salvatore has learned anything from the cur he is meeting. I have only one request.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cNo, two requests.\u201d</p><p>Jagr was wary. Styx\u2019s last request had led him to being mated to a woman who didn\u2019t want him. He really didn\u2019t want any more.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first is that you feed and rest before starting your hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you take Tane with you.\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned, but he readily dipped his head in agreement. The Anasso was merely being cautious.</p><p>\u201cAs you command.\u201d He took two agonizing steps toward the door before need overcame common sense, and he halted to turn back for one last glance at the woman who would forever be engraved on his heart. \u201cStyx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of her.\u201d</p><p>Styx pressed his fist over his heart in a solemn pledge. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>Levet was ten feet tall.</p><p>Okay, he wasn\u2019t literally ten feet tall. Not even mind-blowing sex could make him grow seven feet in two hours. But by God it went a long way in making him feel that big.</p><p>Lying beneath a tangle of bushes, he struggled to wipe the satisfied smile off his lips.</p><p>It had been a long time since he\u2019d been with a woman who knew just how to stroke a gargoyle\u2019s horns. Oh, and the things Bella had done to his wings. It made his tail curl just to remember them.</p><p>Such a naughty water sprite.</p><p>A pity she had disappeared so abruptly. He might have been ridden hard and put up wet, but there was a chance he would recover before the sun crested. And when a demon had to wait centuries between sex, he couldn\u2019t afford to waste a single opportunity.</p><p>Debating the odds of finding Bella before dawn, Levet was floating on a delicious cloud of sated pleasure.</p><p>Or at least he was floating until the bushes were ruthlessly ripped aside and Salvatore\u2019s angry face was looming over him.</p><p>\u201cLevet?\u201d</p><p>With a squawk, Levet scrambled to his feet, not at all pleased to have been caught fantasizing like a horny teenager.</p><p>\u201cSacrebleu, did your mother never teach you not to sneak up on a gargoyle? I could have turned you into a steaming pile of dog poop.\u201d</p><p>The Were\u2019s lean features were hard with displeasure. Not unusual. The King was always displeased with something or other. Just like a stupid vampire. Only with fur.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing skulking in the bushes?\u201d</p><p>Levet didn\u2019t hesitate.

Stumbling behind with all the grace of a drunken sailor, Levet shifted through his mind for some spell that would shrink a Were\u2019s balls to marbles.</p><p>In the distance, he could smell the scent of Salvatore\u2019s curs spread throughout the surrounding woods, and something else. Something that smelled like...blood.</p><p>\u201cCristo,\u201d Salvatore muttered, bolting toward the small cabin with a speed that Levet couldn\u2019t hope to match.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Huffing and puffing, Levet at last reached the open door. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>Kneeling beside a lifeless cur that was fully shifted into wolf form, Salvatore turned his head to stab Levet with a glowing gaze.</p><p>\u201cNothing can get by you?\u201d he growled. \u201cHow do you explain this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMon Dieu,\u201d Levet breathed, stepping onto the bare wooden floor, although he stayed far away from the corpse.</p><p>Salvatore touched the cur\u2019s head in a soft benediction. \u201cDuncan, I presume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d Levet\u2019s stomach twisted. He hadn\u2019t liked the treacherous cur, but he would never have wished this on him. \u201cHe was fine just an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps it was closer to two or three hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorthless demon,\u201d Salvatore growled, returning his attention to the dead dog.</p> <p>Levet flapped his wings. He wasn\u2019t taking the fall for this disaster. Even if he was responsible.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like one of your sniveling curs?\u201d he demanded. \u201cNo, I do not. I am here only as a favor to Regan, and if you think I am going to stand here and be insulted by a lice-infested, mangy dog, then you have another thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, and come here,\u201d Salvatore interrupted.</p><p>\u201cArrogant bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevet.\u201d</p><p>Throwing up his hands, Levet waddled across the floor. \u201cI am coming. Do not get your thong in a bunch.\u201d</p><p>Slashing him an impatient frown, Salvatore pointed at the lifeless cur.</p><p>\u201cHow did he die?\u201d</p><p>Levet\u2019s tail twitched, warily wondering if the King had taken a recent blow to the head.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is only a guess, but it might have something to do with that huge silver dagger sticking in his heart.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore hissed as he yanked the dagger free and tossed it across the barren room.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019d been killed by silver, he would have shifted back to human form. He was already dead when someone stuck the dagger in his heart.\u201d</p><p>Levet frowned. \u201cWhy would someone stick a dagger into a dead cur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more interested in how he died.\u201d</p><p>Holding out his hands, Levet circled the main room of the cabin, pausing at the stone fireplace, as well as the wooden table and chairs that were the only furniture.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no hex marks or magic, at least not a spell directed at him.\u201d Sensing a faint tingle in the air, Levet hopped onto one of the chairs and grabbed the half-empty glass of wine that was left in the center of the table. \u201cCan a cur be poisoned?\u201d</p><p>Flowing to his feet, Salvatore studied the bottle of wine with a frown.</p><p>\u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt was sitting on the table, along with the two glasses, when we arrived.\u201d Levet shuddered as the air thickened with Salvatore\u2019s power. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>With glowing eyes, Salvatore pointed toward the hidden door that was swinging open near the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cA trap.\u201d</p><p>A low, mocking laugh floated through the night. \u201cAnd here I thought the King of Weres was all fangs and no brains.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Drifting in some weird stage between sleep and vague awareness, Regan shifted on the wide bed and reached her hand out.</p><p>\u201cJagr?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was no more than a ragged whisper, but there was a movement to the side, and the edge of the mattress dipped down as someone settled next to her.</p><p>\u201cNot Jagr, I\u2019m afraid. Just a sister who has longed to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Cracking her eyes open a bare slit, Regan stilled as she caught sight of the tiny heart-shaped face that was all too familiar.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>The woman looked just like her. Same blond hair, although Darcy\u2019s was cut short and spiked. The same green eyes. The same slender body. Even the same stubborn line of their jaw.</p><p>Twins without a doubt, but Regan suspected that the two of them would never be mistaken for one another.</p><p>It would take only a glance at Darcy\u2019s serene expression and sweet smile to recognize the difference.</p><p>There was nothing serene or sweet about Regan.</p><p>Careful not to jar her aching head, Regan scooted up the pile of pillows and glanced around the gold and ivory room that seemed to go on forever.</p><p>Holy crap.</p><p>Everything was big.</p><p>Big and shiny.</p><p>Polished marble walls. Gilded furnishings. Cut crystal chandeliers. Hell, there was enough glitz and glitter to please Elton John.</p><p>Obviously Darcy liked her bling.</p><p>Regan...well, not so much.</p><p>Maybe it was her years of living in a trashy RV, but she felt unnerved lying beneath the cupids that danced across the vaulted ceiling. Talk about Versailles overkill.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>Seeming almost as out of place among the elegance as Regan felt, Darcy tucked her feet beneath her as she settled more comfortably on the mattress. Certainly she didn\u2019t dress like a queen. Not with those faded jeans and oversized T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cStyx brought you to Chicago so you could heal in safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Darcy chewed her bottom lip, studying Regan\u2019s tight expression. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be angry with Styx. He only did what he thought best.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, big surprise there. Regan had known she was going to be hauled to Chicago the moment she called Styx and requested his help.</p><p>Everything had a price.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean she had to like it.</p><p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t consider asking my opinion?\u201d she demanded dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spent the past few days in the company of a vampire.\u201d Darcy wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhen do they ever ask for another\u2019s opinion?\u201d</p><p>Well, hell, how could she argue with that logic? She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI suppose there\u2019s always a chance hell will freeze over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very remote chance.\u201d</p><p>Regan tilted her chin. \u201cHe should have at least waited until I was conscious.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, Darcy grasped Regan\u2019s hand in a warm grasp. \u201cThe blame is mine, Regan. Styx knew how desperate I was to have you here, and he doesn\u2019t mind trampling over anyone in his quest to please me. I swear, a mated vampire should have to wear a blinking warning sign for the safety of others.\u201d</p><p>Mated vampire.</p><p>The image of a huge, blond, ruthlessly beautiful Visigoth chief scorched through her mind.</p><p>Regan flinched. She\u2019d tried so hard to ignore the looming thoughts of Jagr.</p><p>So stupid.</p><p>He was a two hundred and fifty pound gorilla squatting smack-dab in the middle of her brain. She wouldn\u2019t be able to concentrate on anything until she knew he was all right.</p><p>\u201cI suppose Jagr is here as well?\u201d She tossed out the words as if she couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>\u201cJagr?\u201d Darcy frowned at the unexpected question. \u201cActually, I think he stayed in Hannibal to try and discover if Salvatore has any clues to finding our sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her gut twisted with disappointment. He wasn\u2019t even in Chicago. She hadn\u2019t seen that coming.</p><p>As if sensing Regan\u2019s distress, Darcy tugged a rolling table closer to the bed, and whipped aside the linen cloth that was covering it.</p><p>\u201cI brought a tray. I thought you might be hungry after your healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d Regan admitted, knowing she needed to eat to regain her strength. Turning her head toward the tray, she grunted in disbelief. \u201cGood God.\u201d</p><p>Darcy laughed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Regan studied the mounds of eggs, ham, pancakes, fresh fruit, toast, fried potatoes, sausage links, and warm biscuits.</p><p>\u201cSo you brought everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to feel at home, Regan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meeting the warm, welcoming gaze, Regan squirmed in discomfort. Dammit. Her sister was the sort of charming, captivating, completely adorable woman you couldn\u2019t help but love. But Regan didn\u2019t want to love her sister. Or feel the growing connection.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d Darcy firmly interrupted. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p> <p>Guilt and something that might\u2019ve been misery swirled through her heart, reminding Regan of why she avoided emotional complications. She was bound to disappoint Darcy.</p><p>And Jagr.</p><p>Blinking back ridiculous tears, Regan took a plate and filled it with a large helping of the eggs and ham and sausage. She would need protein to finish healing the last of her wounds that remained an angry red beneath the satin nightgown.</p><p>Freaking silver.</p><p>She still felt as weak as a newborn babe.</p> <p>Strangely vulnerable, Regan wolfed down her food, her eyes darting about the monstrosity of a bedroom rather than meeting Darcy\u2019s worried gaze.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. It\u2019s outrageous, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Darcy murmured, her hand sweeping to indicate the acres of gilt and ivory. \u201cAnd as hard as it is to believe, the rest of the mansion is even worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not what I\u2019m used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either. I grew up in the streets, and Styx lived in a damp cave for centuries.\u201d She softly chuckled. \u201cThe poor man tiptoes through the place as if he\u2019s terrified he\u2019s going to break something.\u201d</p><p>Draining a glass of orange juice, Regan shot her sister a puzzle glance.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, why do you live here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cViper convinced me that the King of Vampires should own a suitably impressive lair. Someday I\u2019m going to repay him for his helpful suggestion.\u201d A small, dangerous smile curved her mouth. \u201cAlthough I might give the honor to Shay. She does a fine job of punishing him when necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mate. She\u2019s a Shalott demon and quite capable of keeping her clan chief in line.\u201d Darcy\u2019s smile widened. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love her. And of course there\u2019s Abby, who is mated to Dante. She\u2019s a goddess. Oh, and Anna is an Oracle, she\u2019s mated to Cezar.\u201d</p><p>Regan polished off the last of the food and returned the plate to the tray, sinking back into the pillows with a small sigh of contentment.</p><p>Already she could feel her energy returning. Within a few days she would be well enough to strike out on her own.</p><p>That\u2019s all that mattered.</p><p>And that hollow place in the center of her heart...</p><p>Well, that was one of those prices she had to pay.</p> <p>\u201cYou lost me at Shalott,\u201d she said, anxious to distract her dark thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll meet everyone in time. Including our mother. She\u2019s...\u201d Darcy paused to clear her throat. \u201cPerhaps I should let you decide for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Christ, she\u2019d forgotten there was a mother hovering in the background.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds ominous.\u201d</p><p>Darcy shrugged. \u201cJust expect more Sharon Osbourne than June Cleaver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything.\u201d Regan made her tone deliberately firm. The last thing she wanted was meeting a whole posse of vampire mates who were no doubt deliriously happy. Not to mention a mother she didn\u2019t want. \u201cI won\u2019t be around long enough to meet her.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause as Darcy struggled to disguise her disappointment.</p><p>\u201cAre you going somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, places to go, people to see.\u201d</p><p>Regan tried to lighten the atmosphere, but Darcy\u2019s expression remained somber.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll feel as if this is your home now, Regan. There\u2019s no hurry for you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hurry?\u201d Regan couldn\u2019t hide her shudder. \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck in a cage for the past thirty years. I need...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo feel free.\u201d</p><p>Darcy tilted her head to the side. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t do that here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan.\u201d Once again Darcy reached out to grasp Regan\u2019s hand, as if she needed the physical contact. \u201cStyx told me about Caine. How he kidnapped us when we were just babies.\u201d</p><p>Regan stiffened at the mention of the cur who\u2019d ruined her life.</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but my point is that you weren\u2019t abandoned by your family. If I had known you were out there and in trouble...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, I don\u2019t blame you for what happened,\u201d Regan interrupted the soft words.</p><p>Darcy frowned. \u201cThen why do you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>Regan sighed, struggling to find the words to explain the annoying sensation of panic that wouldn\u2019t leave her in peace.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been a prisoner all my life. I\u2019m not ready for any more chains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChains?\u201d</p><p>She squeezed Darcy\u2019s fingers, sensing her sister\u2019s pain at the stumbled explanation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the thought of a family and home feels like shackles to me. I need space to discover who I am, and who I can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will try to be patient, dear sister,\u201d Darcy ruefully conceded defeat. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to warn you that it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><p>Regan licked her lips, studying Darcy\u2019s unmistakable air of contentment.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever feel trapped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrapped? Never.\u201d Shock widened the eyes so similar to Regan\u2019s. \u201cStyx completes me.\u201d</p><p>A pang of unmistakable envy clenched Regan\u2019s heart. God, why couldn\u2019t she let it be that simple?</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she just accept what others were so willing to offer?</p><p>She restlessly shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have no right to pry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not prying, and even if you were, you have every right. We\u2019re family.\u201d Darcy smiled sweetly. \u201cRegan, you have to understand, my childhood was one of constant loneliness and the fear I would never truly belong anywhere. I didn\u2019t know what I was or why I was so different, so I could never let anyone close, in case they realized I was...abnormal. And then Styx came crashing into my life, and I learned that I was a Were, if a rather dysfunctional one. I also learned I wasn\u2019t alone. There are all sorts of wonderful, weird, and wacky demons in the world.\u201d</p><p>Regan snorted. \u201cWe can at least agree to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, at last, have a family who loves me exactly as I am, and it\u2019s everything to me.\u201d Darcy leaned down to brush a light kiss on Regan\u2019s troubled brow. \u201cI want you to share in that joy.\u201d</p><p>Regan\u2019s heart gave another twist of envy. \u201cPerhaps someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired.\u201d Slipping off the bed, Darcy tucked the covers around Regan\u2019s shivering body. \u201cWe can speak later.\u201d</p><p>Regan snuggled into the pillows. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy crossed the room, pausing at the door. \u201cRegan, always know you have a place with me.\u201d</p><p>Regan gave an absent nod, but she knew her place wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>But if not here, then where?</p><p>Wrapped in the icy composure that had held his demons at bay for centuries, Jagr followed Tane\u2019s shadowed form through the dark trees that lined the Mississippi River.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that his soul didn\u2019t howl for Regan, who\u2019d been carted off to Chicago hours ago. Or that his instincts weren\u2019t raw with the need to follow her and force the bond that pulsed through his blood.</p><p>But his past had taught him the necessary skills to survive even the most brutal pain.</p><p>Until he could return to his lair and lick his wounds in private, he would simply endure.</p><p>As always.</p><p>Walking a step ahead of Jagr, Tane came to a sudden halt, holding up his hand as he scented the damp night air.</p><p>\u201cHold,\u201d he warned, his voice audible only to another vampire. \u201cCurs. One of them dead.\u201d</p><p>Jagr stepped beside his companion. They had been searching for Salvatore along the banks of the Mississippi for the past three hours.</p><p>It was about damned time they caught a break.</p><p>\u201cHess,\u201d Jagr growled, recognizing the pungent scent.</p><p>Tane\u2019s nose flared in disgust. The Charon had little love for dogs.</p><p>\u201cYou know them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore\u2019s mangy courtiers.\u201d Jagr sent his senses flowing through the isolated area, a frown touching his brow. \u201cBut no Salvatore. Interesting.\u201d</p><p>Tane grunted as four fully shifted curs came crashing through the trees.</p><p>\u201cOr lethal.\u201d</p><p>Jagr released a blast of frigid power, knocking the charging animals backwards.</p><p>\u201cStand down, dogs,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>The curs snapped and snarled in frustration, but as they slowly realized they were no match for two powerful vampires, they at last shimmered and shifted back to human form.</p><p>It was the hulking, bald-headed cur who took charge, glaring at Jagr as he stood completely naked among the tangled underbrush.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s our king?\u201d he rasped, sounding more wolf than human.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a nanny for a damned Were?\u201d Tane drawled, absently twirling the large silver dagger he held in his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re his guard. Isn\u2019t it your job to keep track of him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTane.\u201d Jagr gave a shake of his head. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to play with the curs. He wanted to discover if Salvatore had any information on Regan\u2019s sister, and be done with the entire mess. He turned his head to meet Hess\u2019s glowing gaze. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Hess gritted his teeth, but obviously judging that Jagr was there to help, he jerked his head toward the cabin set in a clearing just on top of the ridge.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore was to meet with Duncan in the cabin. He went in with the gargoyle and never came out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLevet is missing as well?\u201d Jagr demanded, his thoughts instantly turning to Regan\u2019s bizarre fondness for the stupid beast. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Tane arched a raven brow. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you cared.\u201d</p><p>Jagr shrugged. \u201cNothing would please me more than to send the stunted pain in the ass back to the gutter he crawled out of. Unfortunately, he\u2019s a favorite of the Anasso\u2019s mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your own mate?\u201d Tane demanded.</p><p>Jagr flinched at the unexpected stab of pain, swiftly returning his attention to the wary Hess.</p> <p>\u201cA pureblood and a gargoyle can\u2019t just disappear,\u201d he accused. \u201cYou saw nothing?\u201d</p><p>Hess gritted his teeth, looking as if he were in dire need of some bloody, mindless violence to take the edge off.</p><p>\u201cI saw nothing.\u201d</p><p>Accepting that Hess was clueless, Jagr brushed past the curs and made his way to the cabin. Tane was quickly at his side, his gaze sweeping the ground with the expertise of a trained hunter.</p><p>\u201cFootprints going in.\u201d Tane pointed to the two sets of tracks.</p><p>\u201cAnd none going out,\u201d Jagr muttered, easily detecting the scents of Salvatore and Levet. They\u2019d entered the cabin together and neither had left. Turning his head, Jagr stabbed the towering cur with a narrow gaze. \u201cAre there any tunnels?\u201d</p> <p>Hess gave a shake of his head, tugging on the jeans he\u2019d left near the door.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore borrowed the cabin from the St. Louis pack master. I don\u2019t know about any tunnels.\u201d</p><p>Jagr growled with impatience. The cur\u2019s talent as a king\u2019s guard clearly wasn\u2019t his keen intelligence.</p><p>\u201cIs the pack master a pureblood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s a tunnel. You and your merry band of idiots\u2014keep watch. I won\u2019t be pleased with any unexpected visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me orders.\u201d Hess snapped his fangs, his hands curled into fists large enough to smash a small car. Hell, maybe a midsize. \u201cThe others can keep watch, I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>Only Jagr\u2019s swift reflexes saved the damned cur\u2019s life. Catching Tane\u2019s arm as he surged toward Hess, Jagr gave the younger vampire a warning shake of his head.</p> <p>Once Salvatore was found, Tane could snack on as many curs as he wanted. For now, they might have need of Hess\u2019s considerable muscle, if not his less than considerable brain.</p><p>\u201cFine, just stay out of the way,\u201d he warned.</p><p>Allowing the grumbling Tane to take the lead, Jagr entered the shadowed cabin, his instincts screaming as he moved toward the dead cur in the middle of the floor. His brows snapped together as a shiver inched down his spine.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be the heavy scent of death that made his nerves twitch, or his fangs lengthen. Death was his stock in trade. So what was it?</p><p>Bending beside the lifeless cur, Jagr allowed his senses to flow outward, his frown deepening at the strange prickles that filled the air.</p><p>It was almost as if lightning had recently struck.</p><p>Inside the cabin.</p><p>With a shake of his head, Jagr lifted his head to watch Tane circle the room.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are tunnels.\u201d The younger vampire briefly closed his eyes. \u201cHeaded west.\u201d</p><p>Jagr straightened, gesturing toward the hovering cur. \u201cStart looking for a trapdoor.\u201d</p><p>In silence, the three scoured the cramped cabin, seeking the entrance to the tunnels. It was at last Tane who discovered the hidden door at the side of the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Not bothering to seek the lever that would open the door, Tane swung his arm and knocked the panel loose.</p><p>Instantly, the scent of Were blood filled the air.</p><p>With a howl, Hess charged forward, obviously intent on storming into the dark tunnel with mindless fury.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore.\u201d</p><p>Jagr grasped the cur by the neck and tossed him against a far wall.</p><p>\u201cDammit, if you can\u2019t control yourself, then find me someone who can. Salvatore needs his guards to rescue him, not a pack of rabid beasts attracting unwanted attention.\u201d</p><p>Hess banged his head against the wall, the muscles of his thick neck corded, his eyes squeezed shut as he battled the instinctive urge to shift.</p><p>At last he sucked in a ragged breath and rose to his feet. His eyes still glowed with an eerie light, but his expression was one of grim control.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fail him.\u201d</p><p>With a snort of disgust, Tane studied the hidden door that led to the tunnel buried nearly six feet beneath the ground.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the smell of curs, and something...\u201d The golden features that spoke of South Pacific islands hardened with annoyance. \u201cElse.\u201d</p><p>Jagr joined his companion near the fireplace. \u201cWitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat covers a lot of territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as close as I can get.\u201d Tane shook his head. \u201cI know it\u2019s a demon and that it\u2019s female, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind.\u201d</p><p>Jagr shrugged. A demon would explain the oddly charged air around the dead cur. There were a few species that could call powers that were remarkably like a jolt of electricity. It might even be what had killed Duncan.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a mongrel,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThey always leave a confusing scent.\u201d</p><p>Tane smiled with a lethal intent. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>Jagr stilled. \u201cYou intend to follow the trail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing better to do at the moment.\u201d</p><p>There was a growl from behind Jagr. \u201cNot without me and the others,\u201d Hess foolishly challenged. \u201cOur lives are pledged to protecting our king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re doing a real bang-up job,\u201d Tane mocked. Then astonishingly, the vampire muttered a curse and gave a wave of his hand. \u201cShit. Get your dogs and try to keep up.\u201d</p><p>Hess was smart enough not to press his luck, and spinning on his heel, he ran from the cabin to collect the other curs. Alone with Tane, Jagr leaned against the edge of the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to do this, Tane. Styx gave the duty of finding Salvatore to me.\u201d</p><p>Tane sheathed his dagger and pulled a leather cord from the pocket of his khaki shorts to tie back his long raven hair.</p><p>\u201cWhich only confirms my belief that a vampire loses all higher brain functions when he becomes mated,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>True enough. Regan had stolen any hope of coherent reasoning days ago. Of course, agreeing with Tane didn\u2019t mean Jagr was going to stand around and be mocked by a vampire half his age.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re insulting Styx\u2019s judgment, or my skills.\u201d</p><p>Tane shrugged. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always heard that Charons had a death wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReturn to Chicago, Jagr. Until the woman takes you as a mate, you\u2019re going to be worthless.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s hard, humorless laugh echoed through the barren cabin.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>Of course Jagr knew. He wasn\u2019t stupid, despite his lack of higher brain functions. Regan was a constant, endless distraction. A distraction could mean the difference between life and death when confronting an enemy.</p><p>But what the hell was he to do?</p><p>Lock himself in his lair and mold into a hermit?</p><p>He shoved away from the door and paced toward the center of the room.</p><p>\u201cYou may be right, but since the woman has no intention of taking me as a mate, I might as well...\u201d Cutting off his words, Jagr turned to glare at the young vampire who had tossed back his head to laugh with obvious enjoyment. \u201cYou find something amusing?\u201d</p><p>Tane met Jagr\u2019s burning gaze without flinching. \u201cI\u2019m trying to decide if you\u2019re blind or just a fool.\u201d</p><p>Jagr stepped forward, his jaw clenched. \u201cYou really do have a death wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Jagr, that woman nearly sets the air on fire when she\u2019s in the same room with you. I\u2019m afraid I might get singed if I get too close.\u201d</p><p>Jagr grunted at the painful blast of memories. Regan in his arms. Her nails digging into his back. Her soft moans brushing over his skin.</p><p>Tiny slices of paradise that would have to last him for the rest of eternity.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt her desire, but we both know that it takes more than lust to form the mating bond,\u201d he said, his voice thick.</p><p>\u201cThank the gods,\u201d Tane muttered, referring to his own insatiable desire, before his expression become somber and he reached out to lay a hand on Jagr\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLook, old man, there are few demons who have more experience with desire in all its delightful forms than I do, and I know when a female is simply in heat. I\u2019ve never had a woman look at me the way Regan looks at you. She might not admit it yet, but she\u2019s yours.\u201d He gave Jagr a smack on the back. \u201cGo back to Chicago and claim her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jagr took a sharp step backward, shaking his head against the agonizing need that clamored to heed Tane\u2019s words.</p><p>God dammit.</p><p>Was the vampire trying to send him over the edge?</p> <p>He\u2019d done everything in his power to earn Regan\u2019s heart. And deep in his gut, he was certain she did love him.</p><p>But after years of being held captive, she wasn\u2019t capable of bonding herself to anyone.</p><p>Let alone to an overly possessive, overly arrogant vampire who was consumed with his need for her.</p><p>And in many ways, he couldn\u2019t blame her. He remembered his own bleak days after escaping Kesi. The last thing he could have endured was a mate who depended on him for her every happiness.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t force her to become my mate.\u201d</p> <p>Tane flashed a wicked smile. \u201cNo, but you can remind her what she\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>They were thankfully interrupted by the sound of approaching footsteps, and turning his head, Jagr watched the gang of curs troop into the cabin, all fully dressed and loaded with enough firepower to take out the Pentagon.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d Hess stated the obvious.</p><p>Tane muttered his opinion of working with stinking dogs, but with a wry grimace, he moved toward the doorway and stairs that led into the waiting tunnel.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p> <p>Left alone in the cabin, Jagr briefly considered his options.</p><p>He could always join Tane on the trail of Salvatore.</p><p>The ease that Caine had revealed in kidnapping a pureblood of Salvatore\u2019s strength proved the cur (or whoever the hell was behind this latest disaster) was a dangerous adversary. And who the hell knew what damage the unknown demon could cause?</p><p>Unfortunately, he knew that Tane was right.</p><p>In this moment, he wasn\u2019t capable of concentrating on the hunt.</p><p>Not with his emotions unstable and his thoughts consumed with Regan.</p><p>Humiliating, but true.</p><p>His only other option was to return to Tane\u2019s lair.</p> <p>It was far too late to attempt the journey to Chicago before dawn. And if he was being perfectly honest, he wasn\u2019t prepared to make his appearance at Styx\u2019s and give his latest report.</p><p>Not when Regan was bound to be there.</p><p>His need was still too raw. If he caught scent of her, there was nothing that would keep him from tossing her over his shoulder and hauling her to his lair, whether she liked it or not.</p><p>Something he was trying to avoid.</p><p>Besides, he was weary to the bone.</p><p>He needed to rest and feed.</p><p>His decision made, Jagr followed the trail back to Tane\u2019s remote lair, careful to choose a room far from the one he shared with Regan. The aching emptiness was bad enough without being surrounded by the vivid reminders of their time together.</p><p>Forcing himself to feed, Jagr endured the worried questions of Tane\u2019s servants, and then managed a few hours\u2019 rest.</p><p>He was pacing the floor by the time the sun at last set again, and the moment he judged it safe, he was speeding out of the lair and heading to Chicago.</p><p>The journey was thankfully tedious, and heading directly to Styx\u2019s sprawling mansion north of the city, he was taken to the Anasso\u2019s private office.</p><p>Now he sat on a low leather sofa and watched as Styx paced from one end of the book-lined room to the other.</p><p>\u201cDamn. These curs are starting to wear on my temper,\u201d the towering Aztec muttered as Jagr finished his report, appearing distinctly out of place among the polished mahogany furniture and delicate Persian carpet. A six-foot-five leather-clad bull in a china shop. \u201cSomeone needs to nail their hides to a wall.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s lips twisted as he considered Salvatore\u2019s reaction to being kidnapped. The proud Were was no doubt ready to declare genocide on the curs.</p><p>\u201cI would guess that you\u2019re not alone in wanting to nail a few cur hides to the wall,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cUnfortunately, they constantly seem to be one step ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Styx made a sound of disgust, his hands clenched at his side as if wishing he had a weapon to seize.</p><p>\u201cCould you sense how badly Salvatore was injured?\u201d</p><p>Jagr shrugged. \u201cNot so badly he should have been overcome by a mere cur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTane could sense a female demon, but he couldn\u2019t determine a species. It could have magical abilities.\u201d</p><p>Styx halted near his massive desk, his brow furrowed with frustration.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this. Tane could be walking into a trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want, I\u2019ll return and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve done enough, my brother,\u201d Styx interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ll contact Tane, although I might as well ram my head into a wall as try to convince him to return to Hannibal. The vampire terrifies even me when he\u2019s on the hunt.\u201d</p><p>Jagr didn\u2019t doubt it. There was an intensity about Tane that would frighten anyone.</p><p>\u201cI assume that\u2019s why you chose him as a Charon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the reasons.\u201d</p><p>Jagr grimaced. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to know the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise choice.\u201d Styx folded his arms over his chest. \u201cThere was no sign of Levet?\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, Jagr felt a small pang of remorse at the disappearance of the aggravating gargoyle. Not that he actually cared if the beast was dead, he hastily assured himself. He couldn\u2019t have gone that soft in the head. It was just that he couldn\u2019t bear the thought of Regan mourning for one of her few friends.</p><p>\u201cWe know he went into the cabin and didn\u2019t come out,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Styx leaned against the desk, his expression weary. \u201cBloody hell, Darcy\u2019s not going to be happy. Not only have I lost track of her sister, but that ridiculous gargoyle has disappeared. Why she\u2019s attached herself to that annoying lump of granite defies logic, but then she\u2019s a woman. They very rarely make sense.\u201d</p><p>Jagr snorted. What was the latest saying...preaching to the choir...</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get an argument from me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose I would.\u201d Styx paused, his gaze unnervingly perceptive. \u201cRegan is here.\u201d</p><p>Jagr clenched the arms of his chair until the wood threatened to crack beneath the pressure.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need Styx to warn him of Regan\u2019s presence. He\u2019d sensed her like a punch in the gut the moment he stepped onto the rolling parkland that surrounded the mansion.</p><p>Thankfully, the large office was hexed to ensure privacy, and the familiar scent of midnight jasmine was muted enough to ease the stark yearning that plagued him.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He turned his head to stare at the leather-bound books that filled the shelves. He couldn\u2019t bear to see the sympathy in Styx\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s...well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s healing,\u201d Styx said slowly. \u201cAt least physically.\u201d</p><p>Unable to halt the biting concern, Jagr snapped his head back to stab Styx with a narrowed glare.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Styx tugged on the ancient medallion hung around his neck. A sure sign he was troubled.</p><p>\u201cI may not possess Viper\u2019s skill in reading the souls of others, but I know Regan carries a burden that darkens her heart.\u201d</p><p>Jagr struggled not to overreact.</p><p>Bad, bad things happened when he overreacted.</p><p>\u201cShe was just released from hell. She needs time to heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShutting herself off from those who would help her isn\u2019t healing,\u201d Styx growled, clearly annoyed that Regan wasn\u2019t embracing her new family with the eagerness he\u2019d hoped for. \u201cI should know. I spent centuries wandering alone and miserable. It wasn\u2019t until the previous Anasso took me as his servant that I could accept the brutality of my past, and begin to consider a future.\u201d</p><p>Although Jagr had never heard Styx speak of his past, the Anasso was old enough to have endured the chaos and violence that was common among the vampires in ancient times. Back then, a newly made vampire rarely survived more than a few years.</p><p>Something that Styx had dedicated his life to changing.</p><p>Jagr slowly rose to his feet. He was weary and in need of the peace of his lair.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s to say that if the Anasso had approached you any earlier you would have been prepared to join him?\u201d he demanded with a wry smile. \u201cPerhaps our master was wise enough to wait until you could accept a place as his chosen.\u201d</p><p>Styx arched a brow. \u201cAnd Viper told me you were just another pretty face. Obviously all those years of scholarly research wasn\u2019t a complete waste.\u201d</p><p>Jagr\u2019s sharp laugh echoed through the room. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t jump to any hasty conclusions. I can be remarkably stupid when I put my mind to it.\u201d</p><p>Styx moved to stand directly before him. \u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the next few moments, or with the rest of my existence?\u201d</p><p>Styx flashed his rare smile. \u201cYou are in a philosophical mood tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be the ambiance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, don\u2019t remind me.\u201d Styx shuddered as he cast a disgusted glance around the ornate, elegant furnishings before returning his attention to Jagr. \u201cAre you returning to your lair?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to be alone, you know. Viper called earlier with an invitation for you to join him and Shay. And, of course, you are always welcome here.\u201d</p><p>Jagr narrowed his gaze at the low, almost commanding tone. Why the hell would Styx care where he stayed? God knew he\u2019d been left alone in his lair for years without...</p> <p>Comprehension struck like a bolt of lightning, and Jagr stiffened in humiliation.</p><p>\u201cAh, Regan told you about my bout of madness,\u201d he gritted. \u201cAre you afraid I might ravage Chicago?\u201d</p><p>Styx allowed a hint of his power to flow over Jagr, the prickle of energy a painful reminder of the Anasso\u2019s strength.</p><p>\u201cIf I feared you were mad then you would be locked in a cell, not sipping my finest brandy in the lair I share with my mate.\u201d As swiftly as the punishment began, it came to a halt, and Styx reached out to lay a hand on Jagr\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMy only concern is for your happiness, my brother.\u201d</p><p>Jagr gave a shake of his head, spinning away from the disturbing compassion etched on the vampire\u2019s face.</p> <p>Dammit. Just a few weeks ago he\u2019d been a nearly forgotten vampire living beneath the streets of Chicago. An eccentric loner who possessed the nasty sort of reputation to keep others away.</p><p>And that was exactly how he had liked it.</p><p>Then without warning, he\u2019d been dragged kicking and screaming back into a world filled with clan brothers, vampire politics, and a beautiful Were that had breathed life back into his frozen soul.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to stick a stake in Styx\u2019s heart, or fall to his knees and bless him.</p><p>Maybe both.</p><p>\u201cI need...distance,\u201d he at last admitted.</p> <p>\u201cFrom Regan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence, then Styx moved to take his seat behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cYou could leave Chicago if you want,\u201d he said smoothly.</p><p>\u201cNot without fighting every clan chief whose territory I enter. That\u2019s why I approached Viper in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs one of my Ravens, you could travel the world without fear of being challenged by other vampires.\u201d</p><p>Jagr jerked around, meeting Styx\u2019s steady gaze with an undisguised shock.</p><p>Holy hell. He hadn\u2019t seen that coming.</p> <p>\u201cA Raven?\u201d</p><p>Styx leaned back in the chair, his fingers steepled beneath his chin as he studied Jagr.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare that I find a warrior of your skill and loyalty. When I do, I\u2019m smart enough to insist upon their service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoyalty?\u201d Jagr shook his head, wondering if the man was suffering from dementia. What else could possess the usually intelligent vampire to make such a dangerous offer? \u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, I don\u2019t follow orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoyalty is different from blind obedience,\u201d Styx countered. \u201cI often send out my Ravens on delicate tasks. I need soldiers who can think for themselves and make decisions when they can\u2019t contact me.\u201d</p><p>Jagr snorted. \u201cI\u2019m about as delicate as a war hammer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes a mission takes a rapier, and sometimes it takes a war hammer.\u201d Styx tapped his fingers on the glossy surface of the desk. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to determine which weapon is needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my bouts of madness?\u201d he demanded. \u201cThey are rare, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are no more than any other demon battles, including myself,\u201d Styx overrode his argument.</p><p>Jagr shook his head.</p><p>A Raven.</p><p>A part of him wanted to laugh at the sheer absurdity.</p><p>He was a half-feral vampire who had devoted his first centuries to hating those who\u2019d tortured him, and the last few centuries hating the beast he\u2019d become.</p><p>Now, the King of Vampires was offering him a position of highest respect among the demon-world.</p><p>Talk about irony.</p><p>But another part of him, the part he\u2019d kept closed off until Regan had smashed into his life, was strangely tempted by the offer.</p><p>He\u2019d always depended on his studies to give him a sense of purpose. The gaining of knowledge was not only fascinating, but it was as lethal a weapon as his sword or daggers.</p><p>Besides, there was a quiet peace to be found in his vast library. And of course, the bonus of knowing his books weren\u2019t going to try to kill him.</p><p>Now, however, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it was time he put an end to his self-imposed exile.</p><p>Without undue vanity, he knew he was one of the most powerful vampires to walk the earth. And his vast studies gave him insights into both the human and demon-world that few others could claim.</p><p>Skills that would serve the Anasso well.</p><p>More importantly, becoming a Raven might offer an opportunity to devote his mind to something other than mourning the absence of his mate.</p><p>As if sensing his conflicting emotions, Styx rose from his seat and rounded the desk to stand directly in front of Jagr.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer now. Take your time to consider the offer,\u201d he commanded. \u201cIt will always be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d Jagr offered a dip of his head. \u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, you must be anxious to return to your lair.\u201d Waiting until Jagr had reached the door, Styx cleared his throat. \u201cBe warned that Viper will be intruding into your privacy, along with Dante and Cezar.\u201d</p><p>Jagr glanced over his shoulder with a frown. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Styx shrugged. \u201cBecause they\u2019re meddlesome mother hens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Knowing the Anasso would do nothing to save him from the impending interference of his brothers, Jagr stepped out of the office, instantly hit with the potent scent of jasmine.</p><p>On cue, his fangs lengthened and his muscles clenched in desperate, clawing need.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He had to get out of there.</p><p>Regan knew the minute that Jagr entered the house.</p><p>Amazing considering that she\u2019d been verging on sleep miles away (or at least it seemed like miles), in a bedroom at the far wing of the mansion.</p><p>Or maybe not so amazing, she wryly acknowledged as she yanked on a pair of faded jeans and a yellow T-shirt.</p><p>After all, it wasn\u2019t the sound of his voice or his erotic scent that had jerked her from her light slumber. No, it had been the cool wash of power that had filled the entire mansion that had her hastily dressing and hurrying through the silent hallways.</p><p>It had to be Jagr.</p><p>Regan rushed down the long flight of stairs, only to discover that Jagr had disappeared into Styx\u2019s private office. With a muttered curse, she plopped down on the last step, prepared to wait the entire night if necessary.</p><p>Why she was prepared wait was a question that should have troubled her.</p><p>Thankfully, she was developing a fine talent for self-deception, and telling herself that she was simply anxious to know if he discovered anything about her missing sister, she gnawed on her thumbnail and pretended her heart wasn\u2019t lodged somewhere in her throat.</p><p>Her abused nail was nearly gone by the time the door to the office at last opened and Jagr stepped from the room. Hidden by the carved oak banister, Regan felt as if the wind had been kicked from her.</p><p>Christ, did he have to be so damned beautiful?</p><p>Struggling to breathe, Regan allowed her gaze to drink in the pale, starkly carved features and golden hair that was pulled into a long braid.</p><p>Beautiful, but so terrifyingly dangerous.</p><p>In more ways than one.</p><p>Lost in the painful tangle of emotions, it took a moment for Regan to realize that Jagr was headed directly toward the back entrance.</p><p>Why, the annoying jerk.</p><p>He had to know she was just behind him.</p><p>Hell, he could probably close his eyes and hit her with a dart a hundred miles away.</p><p>Which meant that he was deliberately ignoring her.</p><p>And why wouldn\u2019t he, a tiny voice whispered in the back of her mind.</p><p>He was a proud, magnificent vampire who had offered her his heart. She, on the other hand, was a totally screwed-up Were who was running scared.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t blame him if he never wanted to see her again.</p><p>Of course, that didn\u2019t stop her from charging after his retreating form.</p><p>Screwed up, indeed.</p><p>\u201cJagr, wait.\u201d</p><p>He halted at her soft call, his shoulders stiff, as if he were battling the urge to keep walking.</p><p>Then, with obvious reluctance, he slowly turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cRegan.\u201d His expression was as coldly aloof as his voice. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in an agonized breath. God, she would rather he hit her than treat her as if she were a vague stranger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she managed to husk. \u201cDid you just return from Hannibal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Sharp. To the point.</p><p>Emotionless.</p><p>Regan licked her dry lips, her gut twisting with sick regret.</p><p>\u201cDid you discover anything about my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The pale eyes darkened with frustration. \u201cSalvatore disappeared, along with Levet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Regan stiffened in shock, momentarily forgetting her own troubles. \u201cDid Duncan betray them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. Duncan was dead when we found the cabin where they were supposed to meet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Regan pressed a hand to her heart.

Or at least I did.\u201d Without warning, that almost smile touched his lips, making her heart kick against her ribs. \u201cThe rats may have taken over while I was gone.\u201d</p><p>Tentatively she moved toward him, half-afraid he might disappear into the night if she pressed too hard.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>He arched a golden brow. \u201cYou\u2019re obviously unfamiliar with the rats native to Chicago. They fear no demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps no demon, but every creature fears an oversized Visigoth chief.\u201d</p><p>His gaze deliberately skimmed over her pale face, lingering on the dark shadows beneath her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cNot every creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never been very smart. If I had a brain, I\u2019d no doubt be terrified.\u201d</p><p>The stunning blue gaze lowered to her lips, his jaw clenching, as if in pain.</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>Her hand lifted to touch him, only to hastily drop when he took a sharp step back.</p><p>\u201cWill you be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless Styx commands my presence.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the thick lump in her throat. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>There was a tense, awkward silence that made Regan want to ram her head into the wall.</p><p>Before tonight she\u2019d felt a lot of things when Jagr was near.</p><p>Fury, frustration, searing passion, and heart-melting tenderness.</p><p>Never, ever awkwardness.</p><p>What the hell had she done?</p><p>Slowly his gaze lifted to tangle with hers. \u201cDo you intend to remain here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I...\u201d She gave a helpless shrug, unable to explain the stupid panic that attacked her each time Darcy tried to draw her deeper into their cozy clan. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will you go?\u201d</p><p>For all her determination to leave, she\u2019d given remarkably little thought to the tedious details.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go far. At least not until I\u2019ve found a job and saved some money.\u201d</p><p>His brows snapped together. Regan found herself pathetically pleased by the first real display of emotion.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to work...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy\u2019s already offered me money,\u201d she hurriedly headed off his offer.</p><p>\u201cWhich you refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just being stubborn, Jagr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say you were?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to,\u201d she ruefully teased. \u201cIt was written in neon across your face.\u201d</p><p>His scowl remained firmly intact. \u201cHighly doubtful.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, running a restless hand through her hair. \u201cI want to see if I can make my way in the world like a normal person. Is that so astonishing?\u201d</p><p>The brief glimpse of emotion was wiped away. Replaced by a coating of ice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never be a normal person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, like a normal demon.\u201d She clenched her hands, wishing she could make someone, anyone, understand. \u201cI need to know I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you trying to convince, Regan?\u201d he demanded, softly. \u201cMe? Or yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to explain...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>The tightening of his jaw was Jagr\u2019s only response as he turned on his heel.</p><p>\u201cI must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Regan, what do you want from me?\u201d he hissed, keeping his back to her.</p><p>A good question.</p><p>Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t have a damned clue.</p><p>She only knew that watching him walk away was ripping out her heart.</p><p>\u201cI...I want to thank you.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, still refusing to turn. \u201cThank me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for you, I would have walked straight into the trap that Sadie set for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I doubt you would have been so easily captured,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Her lips twisted. Her pride might want to believe his words, but she\u2019d had plenty of time to consider her rash flight to Hannibal.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your confidence in my skills, but we both know I was so consumed with my need for revenge, I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. If it hadn\u2019t been for you I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your gratitude, Regan,\u201d he unexpectedly intruded, his voice harsh. \u201cJust take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he was wrenching open the door and disappearing into the waiting shadows.</p><p>Stunned by his abrupt departure, Regan grasped a nearby marble statue as her knees threatened to buckle.</p><p>Every instinct screamed at her to run after Jagr and wrap her arms around him. To beg him to toss her over his shoulder, and cart her to his hidden lair.</p><p>To...</p><p>With a crack loud enough to wake the dead, the arm of the statue snapped off in her hand. With a muttered curse, she hastily tossed the dismembered limb onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>One month later...</p><p>The quaint pub near Wrigley Field was the trendy sort of place that attracted locals, as well as a number of tourists who came for the hot wings and stayed for the cold beer.</p><p>Regan had quite literally stumbled across the joint when she\u2019d been on the search for a place to live, and before she knew it, she\u2019d rented one of the retro-shabby apartments above the pub and was working as a dishwasher to supplement the money that Darcy had adamantly insisted she take before leaving the mansion.</p><p>Not that she regretted her choice.</p><p>The owner of the building and pub, Tobi Williams, was a tiny, thirty-something woman with short, spiky pink hair, dark eyes, and enough piercings to make a metal detector explode.</p><p>In many ways she reminded Regan of her sister. She was perky, incurably optimistic, and yet a shrewd enough businesswoman to have taken a dilapidated building she\u2019d inherited from her father and turned it into a raging success.</p><p>She also had a heart as big as Chicago.</p><p>Within two days of Regan moving in, Tobi had not only offered her a job washing dishes, but she\u2019d badgered and hounded Regan to allow her to sell the drawings that Regan had created to fill her long, lonely nights.</p><p>Regan had been reluctant at first.</p><p>The simple ink-on-canvas etchings of local streets and various tourist spots were more doodles than masterpieces. Who the hell would waste their hard-earned money on them?</p><p>Only a week later, however, Tobi had managed to sell ten of the smaller etchings and four of the larger ones, handing over a wad of cash that Regan had promptly stashed into her nest egg. Now she could barely keep up with the demand.</p><p>Stacking away the last of the dishes, Regan wiped down the stainless steel sinks. It was well past midnight and the kitchen had shut down an hour ago. The bar would stay open until three a.m., but Regan\u2019s duties were done.</p><p>Still, she made no move to climb the back steps to her apartment.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t love her new home, she grimly assured herself.</p><p>Granted it was small, with Brady Bunch furnishings and the constant smell of hot wings, but it was hers. Completely and utterly hers.</p><p>Proof positive of her independence.</p><p>Yippee kiyah.</p><p>Trying to shake her strange sense of melancholy, Regan jerked off the large apron that covered her cotton shorts and skimpy T-shirt. The Illinois weather had taken a turn toward spring, and standing in front of a hot, steaming sink for hours didn\u2019t help. If it wouldn\u2019t have shocked the natives, she would come to work wearing nothing.</p><p>She\u2019d just tossed the apron into the laundry basket when the swinging doors were shoved open, and Tobi danced into the kitchen waving around a small business card.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I told you, I told you,\u201d she sang as she twirled to a halt directly in front of Regan.</p><p>Regan rolled her eyes at her friend\u2019s antics. \u201cChrist, Tobi, you\u2019re making me dizzy.\u201d</p><p>Tobi flashed her charming grin, looking about sixteen in her polka dot sundress that revealed her numerous tattoos.</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, you\u2019ve told me that the old man who lives in 4B is actually an alien who missed his ride home on the mother ship. You told me that terrorists are training sharks to attack our beaches. And that your dead mother communicates to you through tea leaves,\u201d Regan said dryly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be a bit more specific.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Taking the card that Tobi shoved into her hand, Regan studied the gilt name etched onto the expensive card paper.</p><p>\u201cCharles Rosewood.\u201d With a frown, she lifted her head to meet Tobi\u2019s expectant gaze. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he be waiting for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe owns a bazillion tourist shops around Chicago. All in the most primo locations, I might add.\u201d She heaved a wistful sigh. \u201cGod, I\u2019d kill for his Michigan Avenue store.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That explained precisely nothing.</p><p>Not an uncommon occurrence with Tobi.</p> <p>She might possess the business acumen of a Fortune 500 executive, but she rambled like a total ditz.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly.\u201d Tobi ran a hand through her hot pink hair. \u201cHe\u2019s way out of my league. I only recognize him from the society pages.\u201d</p><p>Regan shifted, uneasy at the thought some stranger was asking to see her.</p><p>Was it another trap? Was Caine still hoping he could capture her?</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s he doing here?\u201d she demanded, openly suspicious. \u201cAnd why does he want to see me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s here because he noticed the etchings in the window, and he wanted to be introduced to the artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, for such an intelligent woman, you can be incredibly dim.\u201d With quicksilver movements that made Regan occasionally wonder if Tobi was more than just human, she grasped Regan\u2019s arm and pushed her out the swinging doors. \u201cGo talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Tobi hissed, shoving her hard enough that she stumbled into the main room.</p><p>Intensely aware that a dozen customers had turned to look at her with raised brows, Regan had little choice but to smooth back the damp curls that had escaped her ponytail, and walk with as much dignity as possible toward the bar.</p><p>Keeping her pace measured, she wound her way through the wooden booths and small tables that glowed beneath the discreet lighting set in the open-beamed ceiling.</p><p>Once she reached the open space reserved for bar patrons, it was easy to spot the odd man out.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just his hand-tailored suit that fit his lean body like a glove, or the perfectly trimmed silver hair that framed his lined, still-handsome face. It was the way he held himself, and the cool arrogance with which he studied his surroundings.</p><p>He might as well have rich bastard stamped on his forehead.</p><p>Certainly not one of their usual fun-loving, free-spirited customers.</p><p>Angling so she would approach him from behind, Regan opened her senses and breathed in deeply. The stranger certainly smelled like a human. Not even a hint of demon blood. Odd considering most successful business owners were at least part imp.</p><p>Of course, that didn\u2019t mean she was going to lower her guard.</p><p>\u201cMr. Rosewood?\u201d</p><p>The older man turned smoothly, a charming smile already curving his lips. A smile that didn\u2019t hide the shrewd intelligence in his dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTobi said you wanted to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ms...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan,\u201d she said shortly, not bothering to hide her suspicion.</p><p>\u201cRegan.\u201d He took her hand and lifted it to his lips. \u201cA beautiful name for a beautiful young woman.\u201d</p><p>Regan allowed his grip to linger before pulling her hand free.</p><p>Yep. Definitely human.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>He waved a manicured hand toward the etchings in the pub window. \u201cYou did those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Tobi lets me sell them here on commission to make some extra cash. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite the opposite. I find them enchanting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her voice was polite, guarded. \u201cWere you interested in buying one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m interested in selling them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelling?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I find them enchanting, but more importantly, I\u2019m certain my customers will find them enchanting.\u201d Almost as if a switch had been thrown, his expression went from charming to astute. \u201cHow fast do you work?\u201d</p><p>Regan blinked, sensing she was about to be hit by a steamroller.</p><p>\u201cI can do one or two smaller sketches in a day. The larger ones take at least two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...four smaller sketches and two large sketches in a week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He regarded her steadily. \u201cI want to buy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them, every week. And I\u2019m willing to pay top dollar for exclusive rights to your work. Shall we say\u2014\u201d He reached down to pluck his business card from her hand, and retrieving a pen from his pocket, he wrote on the back. Then with a faint smile he shoved it back into her hand. \u201cHow\u2019s that as a starting figure?\u201d</p><p>Steamroller, indeed.</p><p>No wonder the man owned half of Chicago. The poor imps didn\u2019t have a chance.</p><p>Bemused by the man\u2019s brisk, decisive manner, Regan glanced down at the card, her heart nearly halting at the figure he had scrawled on the card.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Reaching toward the bar, Charles poured a large shot of whiskey into a glass and handed it to her. \u201cYou look like you could use a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She downed the whiskey in one fiery gulp. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good shock, I hope?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, I...\u201d Abruptly, Regan was hit by the unwelcome reminder, that \u201cif it seemed to good to be true...\u201d motto. This sudden windfall seemed all too convenient. \u201cWait. You don\u2019t happen to know Styx, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyx?\u201d The man frowned in confusion. \u201cAs in the mythical river?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jagr?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve never heard of them. Are they local artists?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. His confusion seemed genuine enough.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted at her odd behavior, but taking the empty glass from her hands and setting it on the bar, he determinedly pressed his advantage.</p><p>\u201cSo, Regan, will you meet at my office so we can make my offer official?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to business, I\u2019m always serious,\u201d he assured her. \u201cCall the number on the card and my secretary will make the arrangements.\u201d</p><p>With a nod of his silver head, Charles turned and walked toward the pub door.</p><p>Regan watched his departure, clutching the business card as she tried to decide what she was feeling.</p><p>There was surprise, of course. She never dreamed her casual etchings could be worth a dime, let alone a small fortune. And maybe a bit of pride. Hell, she wasn\u2019t above a few vices.</p><p>But shouldn\u2019t there be more?</p><p>Satisfaction at the knowledge she would soon have financial security? Anticipation of planning her future? Overwhelming joy and fulfillment?</p><p>Obviously spying from the kitchen, Tobi was charging toward the bar before the door had closed behind Charles.</p><p>Skidding to a halt, she regarded Regan with an impatient expression.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Regan gave a bemused shake of her head. \u201cHe wants to buy my etchings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoo hoo!\u201d Indifferent to the curious gazes she was attracting, Tobi grabbed Regan and gave her a rib-crushing hug. \u201cI knew it. Haven\u2019t I been telling you that you\u2019re a fabo artist, and that you were bound to be discovered?\u201d</p><p>Gently disentangling herself so she could suck air into her collapsed lungs, Regan pulled her lips into a stiff smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure peddling art to tourists is being discovered, but I\u2019ll admit you\u2019ve always had a lot more faith than I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know talent when I see it.\u201d</p><p>Regan\u2019s smile became genuine as she reached out to ruffle Tobi\u2019s pink spikes of hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been such a good friend to me, Tobi. If you hadn\u2019t let me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlah, blah, blah.\u201d The woman waved her hands in dismissal, then her eyes abruptly widened. \u201cYou know, you should go out and celebrate. Drink some bubbly, eat some chocolate, find some yummy stud to spend the night giving you mind-blowing sex.\u201d She grimaced, waving her hand toward the bar. \u201cI\u2019d join you, but Carly\u2019s a no-show yet again, and I have to close.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what she should do.</p><p>Go out.

You\u2019re beautiful, intelligent, and sexy as hell, and if I weren\u2019t such a nice person I\u2019d hate your guts, but you don\u2019t have a damn clue about enjoying yourself.\u201d She tilted her head, her smile disappearing as she studied Regan with an uncharacteristically serious expression. \u201cThat apartment might as well be a prison, Regan. Go out. Live. You can\u2019t be a hermit forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Prison...</p><p>Regan winched at the repulsive word.</p><p>Because it was true.</p> <p>Oh, it was nothing like her time with Culligan.</p><p>She could come and go as she pleased. She could wear what she wanted, eat what she wanted, and make her own decisions.</p><p>She had her independence. A home, a job, the promise of all the money she could possibly need.</p><p>But where was the glorious freedom she\u2019d been seeking?</p><p>She worked, she sketched, she slept.</p> <p>Not precisely the full-throated, guns-blazing sort of existence she\u2019d dreamed about all those years behind bars.</p><p>She\u2019d exchanged one prison for another.</p><p>And why?</p><p>Because every moment of every day she missed Jagr.

Is there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Regan was jerked out of her painful thoughts. With a blink she focused on Tobi, not surprised to discover her friend staring at her with a worried expression.</p><p>She\u2019d been standing there like a mindless zombie.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m great.\u201d Impulsively she leaned forward to kiss Tobi\u2019s cheek. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right. What my night needs is a yummy stud.\u201d</p> <p>Tobi lifted her brows. \u201cYou sound like you know where to find one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, but I know where to start the search.\u201d</p><p>With a newfound, glorious sense of purpose, Regan squared her shoulders and headed directly toward the front entrance. In a distant part of her mind she heard Tobi call her name, but she never faltered as she stepped out the door and into the dark street.</p><p>She\u2019d made up her mind.</p><p>And for the first time, perhaps in her entire life, it felt absolutely, completely right.</p><p>Jogging down the street without her purse, without her keys to her apartment, or even her cell phone, Regan headed directly south. She didn\u2019t know the precise location of Jagr\u2019s lair, but Darcy had mentioned the neighborhood, so she at least had a general idea of where she was going.</p><p>Of course, a general idea in a city the size of Chicago still meant hours wasted zigzagging through dingy, trash-lined streets, not to mention teaching the occasional mugger the dangers of messing with a pureblood on a mission.</p><p>Just when she was beginning to wonder if Jagr had moved, or even left town, she caught the faint trace of cold power.</p><p>Slowing her rapid pace, Regan angled across the eerily empty street toward the abandoned warehouse.</p><p>Jagr was near.</p><p>Even if she couldn\u2019t sense his presence, she would know by the fact there wasn\u2019t so much as a mouse willing to stray near the place. No doubt it had something to do with the whole Night of the Living Dead vibe.</p><p>Perfect for keeping away unwanted guests.</p><p>Like her?</p><p>The dispiriting thought had barely passed through her mind when the temperature abruptly plunged, and a low, familiar voice floated on the air.</p><p>\u201cLose your way, Regan?\u201d</p><p>Spinning around, Regan could see nothing but abandoned cars and empty Dumpsters. Jagr was there, but he\u2019d cloaked himself in those damned vampire shadows.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she have some of those freaking Romulan powers?</p><p>Warning herself to be patient, Regan ignored the biting need to see him, and spoke in his general direction.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I did,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI was hoping that I could find someone to give me directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this neighborhood, you\u2019re more likely to get your throat slit. If you want to slum, you should find a less dangerous place.\u201d</p><p>His voice was cool, distant, but Regan\u2019s heart warmed with joy. God, just knowing he was near gave her more happiness than she\u2019d had in a month.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d She sensed him move, slowly circling her like a predator on the hunt. \u201cAround here, things really do go bump in the night.\u201d</p><p>She stood perfectly still, refusing to show unease. She might be a bit slow (okay, a lot slow), but the one thing she was absolutely certain of was that Jagr would never harm her.</p><p>\u201cThings like vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other demons.\u201d</p><p>Regan shrugged. \u201cThen I should fit right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d decided to live like a human.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at his mocking words. \u201cHow do you know I\u2019ve been living like a human?\u201d</p><p>His soft laugh tingled down her spine and clenched her stomach with a surge of awareness.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be na\u00efve enough to believe that Styx hasn\u2019t had a guard keeping constant watch on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d she breathed, refusing to admit just how much time she\u2019d spent at her window searching for some hint of Jagr, or hell, even Darcy. \u201cI would have sensed if a vampire was near.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of Styx\u2019s servants are demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of Chicago\u2019s finest.\u201d</p><p>Her surprise that the arrogant Styx would lower himself to deal with mere humans was overshadowed by a hypocritical flare of annoyance.</p><p>Okay, she might have been hurt by the thought that she\u2019d been so easily forgotten, but that didn\u2019t mean she wanted to be spied on.</p><p>\u201cHow dare he?\u201d Unable to see Jagr, she glared at the nearest Dumpster. \u201cI\u2019m not one of his Almighty\u2019s subjects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you are family, and for all we know Caine is still plotting to capture you.\u201d His voice sounded closer, as if he were circling ever closer to her. \u201cDarcy would neuter him if something happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s been reporting my every moment to you?\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned that you had a job and apartment the last time we met. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip at his dismissive tone. Christ. Had she made a terrible mistake coming here? Maybe Jagr had decided his life was a whole lot better without her driving him nuts. And who the hell could blame him?</p><p>\u201cSo...you spend a lot of time with Styx and Darcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I expected,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She was struck by a sudden thought. \u201cAre you being punished for not forcing me back to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s a matter of opinion.\u201d There was a short pause. \u201cHe\u2019s requested that I become one of his Ravens.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cA Raven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be more shocked than I was.\u201d</p><p>Regan shook her head. She wasn\u2019t shocked. She was horrified.</p><p>\u201cAre you considering his offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice came directly in front of her.</p><p>Concern tightened her muscles. \u201cDarcy said the Ravens are sent to keep the vampires and other demons in line. Like some sort of uber enforcer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of the duties.\u201d</p><p>If she could have seen him, she might have punched him for at his cavalier tone.</p><p>From what little she\u2019d learned from her sister, the Ravens were Styx\u2019s private Secret Service, and regularly risked their lives at the command of the king.</p><p>Jagr was supposed to be a scholar. A recluse. A vampire who was too smart to go around looking for trouble.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s life without a little danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe?\u201d she gritted.</p><p>\u201cEvery day is a gamble. Something I forgot along the way,\u201d he said, not hiding his self-derision. \u201cAnd at least this way, I\u2019ll always be on my guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr...\u201d Her words broke off in frustration. \u201cDammit, why are you hiding from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to decide if you\u2019re friend or foe.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at the smooth response. \u201cI\u2019ve never been your foe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I distinctly recall you threatening to shove a stake up my ass.\u201d</p><p>She remembered, too.</p><p>Vividly.</p><p>It had been during their first encounter and at the time, she had only wanted to be rid of him.</p><p>Now...</p><p>Now her heart ached to hold him in her arms for an eternity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve warned you that I\u2019m not very smart.\u201d</p><p>She thought she heard a low hiss at her words. \u201cWhy are you here, Regan?\u201d</p><p>Knowing that this was it, her one chance to make it right, Regan spoke the words that seared across her heart.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you.\u201d</p><p>Jagr was centuries old.</p><p>He\u2019d watched nations rise and fall. He\u2019d witnessed plagues, fire, and war sweep around the world, decimating everything in its path. He\u2019d endured torture and bloody battles that would turn any demon\u2019s stomach.</p><p>But nothing had shattered him.</p><p>Not until Regan breathed those soft words.</p><p>His powers faltered, shredding his protective shadows and lowering his icy barriers to allow the full force of Regan\u2019s presence to slam into him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a soft groan he savored the midnight jasmine that washed over him.</p><p>Over the past month he\u2019d waged an endless war to keep himself from tracking her down and haunting her every step.</p><p>It was a vampire\u2019s instinct to keep his mate close. Hell, there\u2019d been a time when vampires would hold a reluctant mate prisoner in their lair.</p> <p>Only the knowledge that his lurking presence might infuriate her into leaving Chicago altogether kept him away.</p><p>That, and Styx\u2019s constant assurances that she was well guarded and seemingly content in her new life.</p><p>Now he stepped close enough to allow her precious heat to warm his frozen heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he rasped, his gaze drinking in her pale, golden beauty.</p><p>She licked her lips in a nervous gesture. \u201cHave your advanced years made you hard of hearing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRegan.\u201d</p><p>She sighed at his warning tone. \u201cI said I love you.\u201d</p><p>He trembled, desperate to believe.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to bring up that whole being stupid thing again?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her teasing, needing to be certain.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t survive losing her again.</p><p>\u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>Without warning she moved forward, her hands lifting to frame his face.</p><p>\u201cI love you because you\u2019re strong and loyal and tender and honorable.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered at her gentle touch, his too-long suppressed hunger not giving a damn if she were sincere or not.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. She wasn\u2019t helping.</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>The emerald eyes darkened with all the emotion he\u2019d been seeking. \u201cAnd when I\u2019m with you, I\u2019m whole again.\u201d</p><p>His meager restraint snapped. She was here. She said she loved him.</p><p>What more did he need?</p><p>Leaning down, he claimed her lips in a near savage kiss.</p><p>\u201cRegan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, chief,\u201d she whispered against his mouth, her breath catching as he abruptly jerked her off her feet and cradled her against his chest. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, Jagr headed into the empty warehouse. \u201cWhat I should have done the minute you rammed into my life.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, but a pleased smile curved her lips. \u201cVery caveman of you. And for your information, any ramming was done by you.\u201d</p><p>Wicked need curled through his stomach at her intentionally provocative words.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anything yet, little one,\u201d he growled.</p><p>A delicious blush touched her cheeks. \u201cPromises, promises.\u201d</p><p>Oh, they were going to be more than promises, he silently vowed.</p><p>He was going to put her in his bed and savor her for the next millennium.</p><p>Reaching the middle of the decrepit building, Jagr bent down to tug aside the heavy trapdoor. Then, holding Regan tight in his arms, he stepped off the edge and fell the six feet to the tunnel beneath.</p><p>He landed without jarring the woman in his arms, and with long strides headed down the narrow tunnel, muttering curses as he was forced to halt at the heavy steel doors that guarded his lair.</p><p>As he disarmed the various locks, hexes, and sensors, Regan choked back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYow. Paranoid much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter safe than sorry.\u201d His gaze swept over her precious face. He would go to any lengths to protect this woman. His woman. \u201cEspecially now.\u201d</p><p>Stepping over the threshold, Jagr slammed the door shut and used his powers to fill the long room with light. Regan gasped at the dozen rows of shelves that were overflowing with leather-bound books. It was only a small portion of his collection. The fragile and rarest manuscripts were kept in a vault beneath his lair. Soon he intended to share his priceless treasures with his mate.</p><p>Soon, but not now.</p><p>Ignoring her attempts to catch a glimpse at the numerous framed maps that lined the steel walls, he passed into his most private rooms, not surprised by her startled expression as she caught sight of the high-tech computer system that consumed one corner of the carpeted room, and the plasma TV angled toward the sectional couch.</p><p>Most who met him assumed he must live in a dungeon, complete with chains.</p><p>\u201cWait, Jagr, I want to see...\u201d</p><p>He cut off her words with a brief, desperate kiss. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. Longer. Deeper.</p><p>\u201cMuch later,\u201d he whispered, pulling back to watch in satisfaction as her eyes darkened with ready passion.</p><p>Reaching the back of the lair, he pressed open the thick door to his bedroom and crossed directly to the low, wide bed draped in gold satin sheets and a thick fur cover. On the walls, twelfth century tapestries glowed in the candlelight, hiding the heavy cabinets that held his lethal collection of daggers, swords, spears, and handguns.</p><p>Not exactly the most romantic setting, but Regan didn\u2019t seem to notice as she smiled up at him with a slow, wicked temptation.</p><p>Bracing one knee on the edge of the bed, he bent over her and tugged the ribbon from her hair. Flames licked through his blood as he threaded his fingers through the golden strands, his gaze skimming over her slender curves.</p><p>\u201cBlessed gods, you are so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened as she reached up, and with unexpected strength, ripped the T-shirt from his body.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as beautiful as you,\u201d she murmured, her fingers tracing the scars that crisscrossed his torso.</p><p>He shuddered, his fangs extending and his body hardening in all the right places.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always heard that love is blind. Now I\u2019m certain of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play coy.\u201d Her fingers trailed a path of fire down the hard planes of his stomach, popping the button of his jeans and easing down the zipper. Jagr growled in approval. She was a woman in charge. And he liked it. \u201cYou know very well you make women all hot and bothered.\u201d</p><p>Him?</p><p>Well, hell. If she wanted to believe he was some sort of babe magnet, then so be it.</p><p>Kicking off his heavy boots, Jagr rid himself of the jeans and climbed on the bed to pull Regan into his arms.</p><p>He had once cursed a fate that offered nothing but cruelty and stark loneliness. Now he could only marvel at his extraordinary stroke of fortune.</p><p>Skimming his hands over her warm, deliciously shaped body, he removed her far too short shorts and far too tight shirt, briefly appreciating the matching bra and panties before they too were tossed onto the floor.</p><p>Once she was exposed in all her glory, he forced himself to slow his pace, his fingers savoring the sensation of her smooth, ivory skin.</p><p>\u201cAre you all hot and bothered?\u201d he husked.</p><p>Her arms lifted to circle around his neck, her breath unsteady as his roaming fingers stroked up the curve of her breast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his head, he brushed his lips down the line of her nose, then gently teased the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cRegan, you\u2019re certain?\u201d he forced himself to ask. \u201cOnce we\u2019re mated, I won\u2019t be able to let you go.\u201d</p><p>Painful regret flared through her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jagr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for apologies. You did what you needed to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was big, freaking coward.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cI wasn\u2019t proving I could make it on my own. I was running from my feelings because they terrified me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back with a frown. \u201cTerrified?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how to be alone. I\u2019m pretty good at it.\u201d A wistful smile touched her lips as her hands glided down his back. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about being a mate or sister.\u201d</p><p>A groan was wrenched from his throat as he planted a path of kisses down her jaw, and at last buried his face in the curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out together,\u201d he promised softly.</p><p>She deliberately rubbed against the heavy length of his erection. \u201cMmmm. I like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he liked more than just the sound of it.</p><p>He liked the feel and taste and...</p><p>A vicious hunger gripped him and with an unsteady hand, he tugged aside her hair, baring her throat.</p><p>\u201cI need to taste you, little one,\u201d he rasped, his voice thick. \u201cI want to be your mate.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to hesitate. Even to pull away.</p><p>After all, he was demanding nothing less than her heart and soul.</p><p>Instead, she plunged her fingers into the thickness of his hair and urged him even closer.</p><p>\u201cNow, Jagr.\u201d</p><p>The soft prompting pushed him over the edge, searing away his last trace of common sense.</p><p>He\u2019d waited over a thousand years to find his mate.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to wait another moment.</p><p>Tilting her chin, Jagr bared his fangs and allowed them to sink into her sweet, vulnerable flesh. Oh...gods. He closed his eyes as the rich, potent elixir hit his tongue and slid down his throat.</p><p>The taste of Regan\u2019s blood was just as erotic, just as intoxicating as he remembered.</p><p>But this time it was more.</p><p>More than nourishment. More than a means to heal his wounds. Even more than sex.</p><p>It was dazzling magic that swirled through his body and tingled through his blood. As if the very essence of Regan was flooding through him, melding and altering him until they coalesced into one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beneath him, he felt Regan tremble, her moan of pleasure echoing through the room.</p><p>\u201cJagr.\u201d Her nails bit into his back, her voice ragged. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Eager and willing to fulfill her every desire, Jagr unlatched from her throat, gently licking closed the two small puncture wounds before scattering kisses down her collarbone and over the swell of her breast.</p> <p>\u201cYour every wish is my command, my love,\u201d he assured her as he shifted to settle between her legs. \u201cFor now and always.\u201d</p><p>Her hands clutched his lips, her creamy skin flushed with need. \u201cA dangerous promise, chief.\u201d</p><p>He gazed deep into the slumberous emerald eyes, capable of feeling the sharp ache of her desire.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t scare me, Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?

So close to perfect.</p><p>So. Very. Close.</p><p>\u201cRegan.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes were clenched shut as he steadily pumped himself into her. \u201cMmmm?\u201d</p><p>He traced the tip of one breast his tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s time to complete the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d With obvious effort, she lifted her heavy lids. \u201cDoes it have to be now?\u201d</p><p>With a soft chuckle he brushed his lips over her cheeks and gently nipped at her earlobe.</p><p>\u201cYou are a part of me, little one. Now I want to be a part of you.\u201d</p><p>Her beautiful face softened with a heartrending tenderness. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be a part of me, Jagr.\u201d Her hands moved to frame his face. \u201cNow and forever.\u201d</p><p>With a soft kiss, Jagr cupped the back of Regan\u2019s head and pressed her mouth to the side of his neck.</p><p>\u201cBite,\u201d he commanded softly.</p> <p>There was a moment of hesitation before he felt her lips part and she dug her teeth deep into his skin.</p><p>Jagr shouted in raw pleasure as she gently sucked at the wound, taking his blood into her.</p><p>He\u2019d never willingly allowed anyone to feed from him. He hadn\u2019t realized just how intimate the exchange could be.</p><p>A primitive passion surged through him.

She felt sated to the very tips of her toes.</p><p>And more than that, she felt...</p><p>Jagr.</p><p>Christ, it was amazing.</p><p>He was like a low hum in the back of her mind.</p><p>She sensed his glow of peaceful contentment, his stark need to protect her, and overall the fierce love that shimmered through his soul like threads of gold.</p><p>Awed by the sensation of being so closely bound to another, Regan stroked an absent finger down a puckered scar on Jagr\u2019s chest. Instantly she was aware of his heated response to her touch. And unexpectedly, a hint of vulnerability as she caressed the flesh he\u2019d kept hidden for so long.</p><p>Her heart melted.</p><p>How could she have wasted even a moment with her stupid fears?</p><p>Culligan and the damn curs had made her a captive, but it had very nearly been her own choice to remain a prisoner.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Dropping a kiss on top of her head, Jagr pulled back to study her with a lift of his brows.</p><p>\u201cStrange? That\u2019s not exactly what a virile vampire wants to hear after making love with his mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant it\u2019s strange that I can feel you.\u201d Grasping his hand, she pressed it directly over her heart. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>The brilliant blue eyes flared with a heat that he reserved only for her.</p><p>\u201cThe mating bond.\u201d His hand shifted to curve possessively around her breast. \u201cFrom now on you will always know where I am, what I\u2019m feeling, if I have need of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed of me, eh?\u201d</p><p>He teased the sensitive tip of her nipple, his body hardening with an eagerness that made her chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWhich will be always,\u201d he husked.</p><p>Regan deliberately glanced down at the full erection pressing against her hip.</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>The words had barely left her lips when she found herself flat on her back with a smug vampire perched on top of her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to do more than just see?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah, she wanted more.</p><p>She wanted to lick him from head to toe, pausing to nibble at all the most interesting places. She wanted to spend hours exploring the hard planes and angles of his body. She wanted to forget the world and...</p><p>Almost as if the mere thought of the world allowed it to intrude, her lovely fantasies were suddenly distracted.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>A ghost of a smile played about his lips. \u201cAgain, not what a virile vampire wants to hear.\u201d His fingers brushed her cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I forgot to ask about Levet. Have you heard from him?\u201d</p><p>Jagr snorted, lowering his head to sprinkle light, tormenting kisses over her face and down the line of her throat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a story for later.\u201d He easily evaded her question and set about distracting her with delicious strokes of his tongue that were leading lower and lower.</p><p>She tried to hang onto a shred of sanity. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, little one.\u201d He tugged her legs apart and smiled with wicked intent. \u201cMuch later.\u201d</p><p>And it was. </p> </body></html>"]
