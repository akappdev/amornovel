Leningrad, 1941: The European war seems far away in this city of fallen grandeur, where splendid palaces and stately boulevards speak of a different age, when the city was known as St. Petersburg. Now two sisters, Tatiana and Dasha Metanov, live in a cramped apartment, sharing one room with their brother and parents. Such are the harsh realities of Stalin\u2019s Russia, but when Hitler invades the country, the siege of its cities makes the previous severe conditions seem luxurious. Against this backdrop of danger and uncertainty, Tatiana meets Alexander, an officer in the Red Army whose self-confidence sets him apart from most Russian men and helps to conceal a mysterious and troubled past. Once the relentless winter and the German army\u2019s blockade take hold of the city, the Metanovs are forced into ever more desperate measures to survive. With bombs falling and food becoming scarce, Tatiana and Alexander are drawn to each other in an impossible love that threatens to tear her family apart and reveal his dangerous secret \u2014 a secret as destructive as the war itself. Caught between two deadly forces, the lovers find themselves swept up in a tide of history at a turning point in the century that made the modern world. Mesmerizing from the very first page to the final, breathtaking end, The Bronze Horseman brings alive the story of two indomitable, heroic spirits and their great love that triumphs over the devastation of a country at war.</p><p>THE BRONZE HORSEMAN By Paullina Simons</p><p>Copyright ? 2000 by Paullina Simons.</p> <p>For my beloved grandparents, Maria and Lev Handler, who have lived through World War I, the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War, who have lived through World War II, the siege of Leningrad and evacuation, through famine and purges, through Lenin and Stalin, and in the golden twilight of their lives, through twenty non-air-conditioned summers in New York. God bless you.</p><p>Hence in a season of calm weather</p><p>Though inland far we be,</p><p>Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea</p><p>Which brought us hither,</p> <p>Can in a moment travel thither,</p><p>And see the children sport upon the shore,</p><p>And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.</p><p>\u2014 William Wordsworth</p><p>Book One</p><p>LENINGRAD</p> <p>Part One</p><p>THE LUCENT DUSK</p><p>THE FIELD OF MARS</p><p>LIGHT came through the window, trickling morning all over the room. Tatiana Metanova slept the sleep of the innocent, the sleep of restless joy, of warm, white Leningrad nights, of jasmine June. But most of all, intoxicated with life, she slept the exuberant sleep of undaunted youth.</p><p>She did not sleep for much longer.</p><p>When the sun\u2019s rays moved across the room to rest at the foot of Tatiana\u2019s bed, she pulled the sheet over her head, trying to keep the daylight out. The bedroom door opened, and she heard the floor creak once. It was her sister, Dasha.</p><p>Daria, Dasha, Dashenka, Dashka.</p><p>She represented everything that was dear to Tatiana.</p> <p>Right now, however, Tatiana wanted to smother her. Dasha was trying to wake her up and, unfortunately, succeeding. Dasha\u2019s strong hands were vigorously shaking Tatiana, while her usually harmonious voice was dissonantly hissing, \u201cPsst! Tania! Wake up. Wake up!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana groaned. Dasha pulled back the sheet.</p><p>Never was their seven-year age difference more apparent than now, when Tatiana wanted to sleep and Dasha was . . .</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Tatiana muttered, fishing helplessly behind her for the sheet and pulling it back over her. \u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m sleeping? What are you? My mother?\u201d</p><p>The door to the room opened. Two creaks on the floor. It was her mother. \u201cTania? You awake? Get up right now.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana could never say that her mother\u2019s voice was harmonious. There was nothing soft about Irina Metanova. She was small, boisterous, and full of indignant, overflowing energy. She wore a kerchief to keep her hair back from her face, for she had probably already been down on her knees washing the communal bathroom in her blue summer frock. She looked bedraggled and done with her Sunday.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Mama?\u201d Tatiana said, not lifting her head from the pillow. Dasha\u2019s hair touched Tatiana\u2019s back. Her hand was on Tatiana\u2019s leg, and Dasha bent over as if to kiss her. Tatiana felt a momentary tenderness, but before Dasha could say anything, Mama\u2019s grating voice intruded. \u201cGet up quick. There\u2019s going to be an important announcement on the radio in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana whispered to Dasha, \u201cWhere were you last night? You didn\u2019t come in till well past dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I help it,\u201d Dasha whispered with pleasure, \u201cthat last night dawn was at midnight? I came in at the perfectly respectable hour of midnight.\u201d She was grinning. \u201cYou were all asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDawn was at three, and you weren\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>Dasha paused. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Papa I got caught on the other side of the river when the bridges went up at three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do that. Explain to him what you were doing on the other side of the river at three in the morning.\u201d Tatiana turned over. Dasha looked particularly striking this morning. She had unruly dark brown hair and an animated, round, dark-eyed face that had a reaction for everything. Right now that reaction was cheerful exasperation. Tatiana was exasperated herself \u2014 less cheerfully. She wanted to continue sleeping.</p><p>She caught a glimpse of her mother\u2019s tense expression. \u201cWhat announcement?\u201d</p><p>Her mother was taking the bedclothes off the sofa.</p><p>\u201cMama! What announcement?\u201d Tatiana repeated.</p><p>\u201cThere is going to be a government announcement in a few minutes. That\u2019s all I know,\u201d Mama said doggedly, shaking her head, as if to say, what\u2019s not to understand?</p><p>Tatiana was reluctantly awake. Announcement. It was a rare event when music would be interrupted for a word from the government. \u201cMaybe we invaded Finland again.\u201d She rubbed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d Mama said.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe they invaded us. They\u2019ve been wanting their borders back ever since losing them last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t invade them,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cLast year we went to get our borders back. The ones we lost in the Great War. And you should stop listening to adult conversations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t lose our borders,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cComrade Lenin gave them away freely and willingly. That doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, we are not at war with Finland. Get out of bed.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana did not get out of bed. \u201cLatvia, then? Lithuania? Byelorussia? Didn\u2019t we just help ourselves to them, too, after the Hitler-Stalin pact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana Georgievna! Stop it!\u201d Her mother always called her by her first and patronymic names whenever she wanted to show Tatiana she was not in the mood to be fooled with.</p><p>Tatiana pretended to be serious. \u201cWhat else is left? We already have half of Poland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said stop!\u201d Mama exclaimed. \u201cEnough of your games. Get out of bed. Daria Georgievna, get that sister of yours out of bed.\u201d</p><p>Dasha did not move.</p><p>Growling, Mama left the room.</p><p>Turning quickly to Tatiana, Dasha whispered conspiratorially, \u201cI\u2019ve got something to tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething good?\u201d Tatiana was instantly curious. Dasha usually revealed little about her grown-up life. Tatiana sat up.</p><p>\u201cSomething great!\u201d said Dasha. \u201cI\u2019m in love!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana rolled her eyes and fell back on the bed.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Dasha said, jumping on top of her. \u201cThis is serious, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right. Did you just meet him yesterday when the bridges were up?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYesterday was the third time.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shook her head, gazing at Dasha, whose joy was infectious. \u201cCan you get off me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t get off you,\u201d Dasha said, tickling her. \u201cNot until you say, \u2018I\u2019m happy, Dasha.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I say that?\u201d exclaimed Tatiana, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m not happy. Stop it! Why should I be happy? I\u2019m not in love. Cut it out!\u201d</p><p>Mama came back into the room, carrying six cups on a round tray and a silver samovar \u2014 an urn with a spigot used for boiling water for tea. \u201cYou two will stop at once! Did you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mama,\u201d said Dasha, giving Tatiana one last hard tickle.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d said Tatiana as loudly as possible. \u201cMama, I think she cracked my ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to crack something else in a minute. You\u2019re both too old for these games.\u201d</p><p>Dasha stuck out her tongue at Tatiana. \u201cVery grown-up,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cOur Mamochka doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re only two.\u201d</p><p>Dasha\u2019s tongue remained out. Tatiana reached up and grabbed the slippery thing between her fingers. Dasha squealed. Tatiana let go.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say!\u201d Mama bellowed.</p><p>Dasha leaned over and whispered to Tatiana, \u201cWait until you meet him. You\u2019ve never met anybody so handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean better-looking than that Sergei you tortured me with? Didn\u2019t you tell me he was so handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d hissed Dasha, smacking Tatiana\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tatiana grinned. \u201cAnd wasn\u2019t that just last week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never understand because you are still an incorrigible child.\u201d There was another smack. Mama yelled. The girls stopped.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s father, Georgi Vasilievich Metanov, came in. A short man in his forties, he sported a full head of untidy black hair that was just beginning to turn to salt and pepper. Dasha got her curly hair from Papa. He walked past the bed, glanced vacantly at Tatiana, her legs still under the sheets, and said, \u201cTania, it\u2019s noon. Get up. Or there\u2019s going to be trouble. I need you dressed in two minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy,\u201d Tatiana replied, jumping up on the bed and showing her family that she was still wearing her shirt and skirt from yesterday. Dasha and Mama shook their heads; Mama nearly smiled.</p><p>Papa looked away toward the window. \u201cWhat are we going to do with her, Irina?\u201d</p><p>Nothing, Tatiana thought, nothing as long as Papa looks the other way.</p><p>\u201cI need to get married,\u201d Dasha said, still sitting on the bed. \u201cSo I can finally have a room of my own to get dressed in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d said Tatiana, jumping up and down on the bed. \u201cYou\u2019ll just be in here with your husband. Me, you, him, all sleeping in one bed, with Pasha at our feet. Romantic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get married, Dashenka,\u201d her mother said absentmindedly. \u201cTania is right for once. We have no room for him.\u201d</p><p>Her father said nothing, turning on the radio.</p><p>Their long, narrow room had one full bed on which Tatiana and Dasha slept, one sofa on which Mama and Papa slept, and one low metal cot on which Tatiana\u2019s twin brother, Pasha, slept. His cot was at the foot of the girls\u2019 bed, so Pasha called himself their little footdog.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s grandparents, Babushka and Deda, lived in the adjacent room, joined to theirs by a short hallway. Occasionally Dasha would sleep on the small sofa in the hallway if she came in late and didn\u2019t want to disturb her parents and thereby get into trouble the next day. The hall sofa was only about one and a half meters long, more suitable for Tatiana to sleep on, since she was just over one and a half meters long herself. But Tatiana didn\u2019t need to sleep in the hall because she rarely came in late, whereas Dasha was a different story.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Pasha?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>\u201cFinishing breakfast,\u201d Mama replied. She couldn\u2019t stop moving. While Papa sat on the old sofa, still as a building, Mama bustled all around him, picking up empty packs of cigarettes, straightening books on the shelf, wiping down the little table with her hand. Tatiana continued to stand on the bed. Dasha continued to sit.</p><p>The Metanovs were lucky \u2014 they had two rooms and a sectioned-off part of the communal hallway. Six years earlier they had built a door to partition the very end of the corridor. It was almost like having an apartment of their own. The Iglenkos down the hall had to sleep six to a large room \u2014 off the corridor. Now that was unlucky.</p><p>The sunshine filtered in through the billowing white curtains.</p><p>Tatiana knew there would be only an instant, a brief flicker of time that bathed her with the possibilities of the day. In a moment it would all be gone. And in a moment it all was. Still . . . that sun streaking through the room, the distant rumble of buses through the open window, the slight wind.</p><p>This was the part of Sunday that Tatiana loved most: the beginning.</p><p>Pasha walked in with Deda and Babushka. Despite being Tatiana\u2019s twin, he looked nothing like her. A compact, dark-haired boy, a smaller version of their father, he acknowledged Tatiana by casually nodding in her direction and mouthing, \u201cNice hair.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stuck out her tongue. She just hadn\u2019t brushed and tied it up yet.</p><p>Pasha sat on his low cot, and Babushka snuggled up next to him. Because she was the tallest of the Metanovs, the whole family deferred to her in all matters except matters of morality, in which everyone deferred to Deda. Babushka was imposing, no-nonsense, and silver-haired. Deda was humble and dark and kind. He sat next to Papa on the sofa and murmured, \u201cIt\u2019s something big, son.\u201d</p><p>Papa nodded anxiously.</p><p>Mama continued to clean anxiously.</p><p>Tatiana watched Babushka stroke Pasha\u2019s back. \u201cPasha,\u201d Tatiana whispered, crawling to the edge of the bed and pulling on her brother. \u201cWant to go to Tauride Park later? I\u2019ll beat you in war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDream on,\u201d said Pasha. \u201cYou will never beat me.\u201d</p><p>The radio began to make a series of clicking sounds. It was 12:30 p.m. on June 22, 1941.</p><p>\u201cTania, be quiet and sit down,\u201d Papa ordered his daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s about to begin. Irina, you, too. Sit.\u201d</p><p>Comrade Vyacheslav Molotov, Joseph Stalin\u2019s Foreign Minister, began:</p><p>Men and women, citizens of the Soviet Union \u2014 the Soviet government and its head, Comrade Stalin, have instructed me to make the following announcement. At 4 A.M., without declaration of war and without any claims being made on the Soviet Union, German troops attacked our country, attacked our frontier in many places, and bombed from the air Shitomir, Kiev, Sevastopol, Kaunas, and other cities. This attack has been made despite the fact that there was a nonaggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany, a pact the terms of which were scrupulously observed by the Soviet Union. We have been attacked, although during the period of the pact the German Government had not made the slightest complaint about the USSR\u2019s not carrying out its obligations . . .</p><p>The government calls upon you, men and women citizens of the Soviet Union, to rally even more closely around the glorious Bolshevik Party, around the Soviet government and our great leader, Comrade Stalin. Our cause is just. The enemy will be crushed. Victory will be ours.</p><p>The radio went dead, and the family sat in stunned and heavy silence.</p><p>Finally Papa said, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d And from the sofa he stared at Pasha.</p><p>Mama said, \u201cWe have to immediately go and get our money out of the bank.\u201d</p><p>Babushka Anna said, \u201cNot evacuation again. Can we survive another one? Almost better to stay in the city.\u201d</p><p>Deda said, \u201cCan I even get another evacuation teaching post? I\u2019m nearly sixty-four. It\u2019s time to die, not move.\u201d</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cThe Leningrad garrison doesn\u2019t go to war, right? The war comes to the Leningrad garrison?\u201d</p><p>Pasha said, \u201cWar! Tania, did you hear? I\u2019m going to enlist. I\u2019m going to go and fight for Mother Russia.\u201d</p><p>Before Tatiana could say what she was thinking \u2014 which was an immeasurably excited \u201cWow!\u201d \u2014 her father jumped up off the sofa and, responding only to Pasha, exclaimed, \u201cWhat are you thinking? Who do you think will take you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Papochka,\u201d said Pasha with a smile. \u201cThe war always needs good men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood men, yes. Not children,\u201d barked Papa as he kneeled on the floor, looking under Tatiana and Dasha\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cWar, why, that\u2019s not possible,\u201d Tatiana said slowly. \u201cDidn\u2019t Comrade Stalin sign a peace treaty?\u201d</p><p>Mama poured tea and said, \u201cTania, it\u2019s for real. It\u2019s for real.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana tried to keep the thrill out of her voice when she said, \u201cWill we have to . . . evacuate?\u201d</p><p>Papa pulled an old, ratty suitcase from under the bed.</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>She knew of evacuation from the stories Deda and Babushka had told her of the unrest around the time of the Revolution of 1917, when they went just west of the Ural Mountains to live in a village whose name Tatiana could never remember. Waiting for the train with all their belongings, crowding in, crossing the Volga on barges . . .</p><p>It was the change that excited Tatiana. It was the unknown. She herself had been to Moscow once for a minute when she was eight \u2014 did that even count? Moscow wasn\u2019t exotic. It wasn\u2019t Africa or America. It wasn\u2019t even the Urals. It was just Moscow. Beyond the Red Square there was nothing, not even a little beauty.</p><p>As a family the Metanovs had taken a couple of day trips to Tsarskoye Selo and Peterhof. The summer palaces of the tsars had been turned by the Bolsheviks into lavish museums with landscaped grounds. When Tatiana wandered the halls of Peterhof, treading carefully on the cold, veined marble, she could not believe there had been a time when people had all this to live in.</p><p>But then the family would return to Leningrad, to their two rooms on Fifth Soviet, and before Tatiana got to her room, she would have to walk past the six Iglenkos who lived off the corridor with their door open.</p><p>When Tatiana was three, the family vacationed in the very Crimea that this morning had been attacked by the Germans. What Tatiana remembered from that trip was that it was the first time she ate a raw potato. Also the last. She saw tadpoles in a little pond and slept covered with a blanket in a tent. She vaguely remembered the smell of salt water. It was in the frigid April Black Sea that Tatiana felt her first and last jellyfish, floating past her tiny naked body and making her shriek with delighted terror.</p><p>The thought of evacuation filled Tatiana with stomach-churning excitement. Born in 1924, the year of Lenin\u2019s death, after the revolution, after the hunger, after the civil war, Tatiana had been born after the worst but before anything good either. She had been born during.</p><p>Lifting his black eyes to her, as if measuring her emotions, Deda spoke. \u201cTanechka, what are you even thinking?\u201d</p><p>She tried to make her face calm. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that head of yours? It\u2019s war. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think you do.\u201d Deda paused. \u201cTania, the life you know is over. Mark my words. From this day forward, nothing will be as you have imagined.\u201d</p><p>Pasha exclaimed, \u201cYes! We\u2019re going to boot the Germans back to hell, where they belong.\u201d He smiled at Tatiana, who smiled back.</p><p>Mama and Papa were quiet.</p><p>Papa said, \u201cYes. And then what?\u201d</p><p>Babushka went to sit on the sofa next to Deda. Placing her large hand on his, she pursed her lips and nodded, in a way that showed Tatiana that Babushka knew things and was keeping them to herself. Deda knew, too, but whatever it was they knew did not measure up to Tatiana\u2019s tumult. That\u2019s all right, she thought. They don\u2019t understand. They are not young.</p><p>Mama broke the silence of seven people. \u201cWhat are you doing, Georgi Vasilievich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many children, Irina Fedorovna. Too many children to worry about,\u201d he said dolefully to her, struggling with Pasha\u2019s suitcase.</p><p>\u201cReally, Papa?\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cWhich of your children would you like not to worry about?\u201d</p><p>Without replying, Papa went to Pasha\u2019s drawers in the armoire they all shared and started haphazardly throwing the boy\u2019s clothes into the suitcase.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending him away, Irina. I\u2019m sending him away to camp in Tolmachevo. He was going to go anyway next week with Volodya Iglenko. He\u2019ll just go a little sooner. Volodya will go with him. Nina will be glad to have them go a week early. You\u2019ll see. Everything will be all right.\u201d</p><p>Mama opened her mouth and shook her head. \u201cTolmachevo? He will be safe there? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Papa.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d said Pasha. \u201cPapa, war has started! I\u2019m not going to camp. I\u2019m going to enlist.\u201d</p><p>Good for you, Pasha, thought Tatiana, but Papa whipped around to glare at her brother, and, sucking in her breath, Tatiana suddenly understood everything.</p><p>Grabbing Pasha by the shoulders, Papa started to shake him. \u201cWhat are you saying? Are you crazy? Enlist?\u201d</p><p>Pasha fought to break free. Papa would not let go.</p><p>\u201cPapa, let go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPavel, you\u2019re my son, and you will listen to me. The first thing you\u2019re going to do is get out of Leningrad. Then we\u2019ll discuss enlisting. Right now we have a train to catch.\u201d</p><p>There was something embarrassing and awkward about a physical scene in a small room with so many people watching. Tatiana wanted to turn away, but there was nowhere to turn. Across from her were her grandmother and grandfather, behind her was Dasha, to the left of her were her mother and father and brother. She looked down at her hands and closed her eyes. She imagined lying on her back in the middle of a summer field eating sweet clover. No one was around her.</p><p>How did things change in a matter of seconds?</p><p>She opened her eyes and blinked. One second. She blinked again. Another second.</p><p>Seconds ago she was sleeping.</p><p>Seconds ago Molotov spoke.</p><p>Seconds ago she was exhilarated.</p><p>Seconds ago Papa spoke.</p><p>And now Pasha was leaving. Blink, blink, blink.</p><p>Deda and Babushka were diplomatically silent, as always. Deda, God love him, never missed an opportunity to keep quiet. Babushka was quite the opposite of him in that respect, but in this particular instance she had obviously decided to follow his lead. Perhaps it was his hand tightly squeezing her leg each time she opened her mouth, but for whatever reason, she did not speak.</p><p>Dasha, unafraid of their father and not discouraged by the distant prospect of war, got up and said, \u201cPapa, this is crazy. Why are you sending him away? The Germans are nowhere near Leningrad. You heard Comrade Molotov. They\u2019re at the Crimea. That\u2019s thousands of kilometers from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet, Dashenka,\u201d said Papa. \u201cYou have no idea about the Germans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not here, Papa,\u201d Dasha repeated in her strong voice that allowed for no argument. Tatiana wished she could speak as persuasively as Dasha. Her own voice was echo soft, as if some female hormone hadn\u2019t come her way yet. In many ways it barely had. She\u2019d got her monthlies only last year, and even then . . . she barely got her monthlies. They were more like quarterlies. They came in the winter, decided they didn\u2019t like it, and left till fall. In the fall they came and stayed as if they were never leaving. Since then Tatiana had seen them twice. Maybe if they came more often, Tatiana would have a meaningful voice like Dasha\u2019s. You could set the clock by Dasha\u2019s monthlies.</p><p>\u201cDaria! I\u2019m not going to argue with you on this point!\u201d exclaimed Papa. \u201cYour brother is not staying in Leningrad. Pasha, get dressed. Put on some trousers and a nice shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPasha! I said get dressed. We cannot waste time. I guarantee those children\u2019s camps are going to completely fill up in one hour, and then I won\u2019t be able to get you in.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps it was a mistake to tell that to Pasha, because Tatiana had never seen her brother move more slowly. He must have spent a good ten minutes looking for the one dress shirt he owned. They all averted their eyes while Pasha changed. Tatiana closed her eyes again, searching for her meadow, for the pleasant summer smell of white cherry and nettles. She wanted some blueberries. She realized she was a little hungry. Opening her eyes, she glanced around the room. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d complained Pasha.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just for a little while, son,\u201d said Papa. \u201cIt\u2019s a precaution. You\u2019ll be safe in camp, out of harm\u2019s way. You\u2019ll stay maybe a month, until we see how the war is going. Then you\u2019ll come back, and if there\u2019s evacuation, we\u2019ll get you and your sisters out.\u201d</p><p>Yes! Tatiana wanted to hear that.</p><p>\u201cGeorg.\u201d Deda spoke softly. \u201cGeorg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Papochka?\u201d Tatiana\u2019s father said respectfully. No one loved Deda more than Papa, not even Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cGeorg. You cannot keep the boy out of conscription. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can. He is only seventeen.\u201d</p><p>Deda shook his neat gray head. \u201cExactly \u2014 seventeen. They\u2019ll take him.\u201d</p><p>The look of trapped fear slid across Papa\u2019s face and was gone. \u201cThey won\u2019t take him, Papochka,\u201d said Papa hoarsely. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He was clearly unable to say what he felt: everyone stop talking and let me save my son the only way I know how. Deda sat back against the sofa cushions.</p><p>Feeling bad for her father and wanting to be helpful, Tatiana began to say, \u201cWe\u2019re not yet\u2014\u201d but Mama cut in with, \u201cPashechka, take a sweater, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking a sweater, Mama,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of summer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had frost two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now it\u2019s hot. I\u2019m not taking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to your mother, Pavel,\u201d said Papa. \u201cThe nights will be cold in Tolmachevo. Take the sweater.\u201d Pasha sighed deeply, rebelliously, but took the sweater and threw it inside the suitcase. Papa closed it and locked it. \u201cEveryone, listen. Here\u2019s my plan . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat plan?\u201d Tatiana said with mild frustration. \u201cI hope this plan includes some food. Because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know why,\u201d Papa snapped. \u201cNow, be quiet and listen. This concerns you, too.\u201d He started telling them what he needed them to do.</p><p>Tatiana fell back on the bed. If they weren\u2019t evacuating this instant, she didn\u2019t want to hear any more.</p><p>Pasha went to boys\u2019 camp every summer, in Tolmachevo, Luga, or Gatchina. Pasha preferred Luga because it had the best river for swimming. Tatiana preferred Pasha in Luga because he was close to their dacha, their summer house, and she could go and visit him. The Luga camp was only five kilometers from their dacha straight through the woods. Tolmachevo, on the other hand, was twenty kilometers from Luga, and there the counselors were strict and expected you up by sunrise. Pasha said it was a bit like being in the army. Well, now it would be almost like enlisting, she thought, not listening to her father speak.</p><p>She felt Dasha pinch her hard on the leg. \u201cOuch!\u201d she said, deliberately loudly, hoping her sister would get into trouble for hurting her. No one cared. No one said anything. They didn\u2019t even look her way. All eyes were on Pasha as he stood \u2014 reedy and awkward in his brown trousers and frayed beige shirt \u2014 in the middle of the room, in the half bloom of late adolescence, so beloved. And he knew it.</p><p>He was everyone\u2019s favorite child, favorite grandchild, favorite brother.</p><p>Because he was the only son.</p><p>Tatiana lifted herself off the bed and came to stand by Pasha. Putting her arm around him, she said, \u201cCheer up. You\u2019re so lucky. You\u2019re going to camp. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>He stepped slightly away from her, but only slightly; stepped away not because he was uncomfortable with her, Tatiana knew, but because he did not feel himself to be lucky. She knew that her brother wanted to become a soldier more than anything. He didn\u2019t want to be in some silly camp. \u201cPasha,\u201d she said cheerfully, \u201cfirst you have to beat me in war. Then you can enlist and fight the Germans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Tania,\u201d said Pasha.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Tania,\u201d said Papa.</p><p>\u201cPapa,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201ccan I pack my suitcase? I want to go to camp, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPasha, are you ready? Let\u2019s go,\u201d said Papa, not even replying to Tatiana. There were no girls\u2019 camps.</p><p>\u201cI have a joke for you, dear Pasha,\u201d said Tatiana, not wanting to give up and not put off by her brother\u2019s reluctance.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to hear your stupid jokes, dear Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll like this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I doubt it?\u201d</p><p>Papa said, \u201cTatiana! This is no time for jokes.\u201d</p><p>Deda intervened on Tatiana\u2019s behalf. \u201cGeorg, let the girl speak.\u201d</p><p>Nodding at Deda, Tatiana said, \u201cA soldier is being led to his execution. \u2018Some bad weather we\u2019re having,\u2019 he says to his convoy. \u2018Look who\u2019s complaining,\u2019 they say. \u2018We have to go back.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Nobody moved. No one even smiled.</p><p>Pasha raised his eyebrows, pinched her, and whispered, \u201cNice going, Tania.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. Someday her spirit would soar, she thought, but not this day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>\u201cTatiana, no long good-byes. You\u2019ll see your brother in a month. Come downstairs and hold the front door open for us. Your mother\u2019s back is bothering her,\u201d Papa told her as they got ready to carry Pasha\u2019s things along with bags of extra food for camp.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Papa.\u201d</p><p>The apartment was laid out like a train \u2014 a long corridor with nine rooms attached. There were two kitchens, one at the front of the apartment, one at the back. The bathrooms and the toilets were attached to the kitchens. In the nine rooms lived twenty-five people. Five years ago there were thirty-three people in the apartment, but eight people had moved or died or\u2014</p> <p>Tatiana\u2019s family lived in the back. It was better to live in the back. The rear kitchen was the bigger of the two, and it had stairs leading up to the roof and down to the courtyard; Tatiana liked taking the rear stairs because she could sneak out without passing crazy Slavin\u2019s room.</p><p>The rear kitchen had a bigger stove than the front kitchen and a bigger bath. And only three other families shared the rear kitchen and bathroom with the Metanovs \u2014 the Petrovs, the Sarkovs, and crazy Slavin, who never cooked and never bathed.</p><p>Slavin was not in the hall at the moment. Good.</p><p>As Tatiana walked down the corridor to the front door, she passed the shared telephone. Petr Petrov was using it, and Tatiana had time to think how lucky they were that their telephone worked. Tatiana\u2019s cousin Marina lived in an apartment where the telephone was broken all the time \u2014 faulty wiring. It was difficult to get in touch with her, unless Tatiana wrote or went to see her personally, which she did not do often, since Marina lived on the other side of town, across the river Neva.</p><p>As Tatiana neared Petr, she saw that he was very agitated. He was obviously waiting for a connection, and though the cord was too short to allow him to pace, he was pacing with his whole body while standing in one place. Petr got his connection just as Tatiana was passing him in the narrow corridor; Tatiana knew this because he screamed into the phone. \u201cLuba! Is that you? Is that you, Luba?\u201d</p> <p>So unexpected and sharp was his cry that Tatiana jumped away from him, knocking into the wall. Getting her bearings, she passed him quickly and then slowed down to listen.</p><p>\u201cLuba, can you hear me? We have a bad connection. Everyone is trying to get through. Luba, come back to Leningrad! Did you hear? War has started. Take whatever you can, leave the rest, and get the next train. Luba! No, not in an hour, not tomorrow \u2014 now, do you understand? Come back immediately!\u201d Short pause. \u201cForget our things, I tell you! Are you listening to me, woman?\u201d</p><p>Turning around, Tatiana caught a glimpse of Petr\u2019s stiff back.</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d Papa was glaring at her with an expression that said, if you don\u2019t come here right now . . .</p><p>But Tatiana dawdled to hear more. Her father yelled across the corridor, \u201cTatiana Georgievna! Come here and help.\u201d Like her mother, her father said her full name only when he wanted Tatiana to know how serious he was. Tatiana hurried, wondering about Petr Petrov and about why her brother couldn\u2019t open the front door himself.</p><p>Volodya Iglenko, who was Pasha\u2019s age and was going to the Tolmachevo camp with him, walked downstairs with the Metanovs, holding his own suitcase and opening his own door. He was one of four brothers. He had to do things for himself. \u201cPasha, let me show you,\u201d Tatiana said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s like this. You put your hand on the handle, and you pull. The door opens. You walk outside. It shuts behind you. Let\u2019s see if you can do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust open the door, Tania,\u201d said Pasha. \u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m carrying my suitcase?\u201d</p><p>Out on the street they stood still for a moment.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d said Papa. \u201cTake the hundred and fifty rubles I gave you and go and buy us some food. But don\u2019t dawdle, like always. Go immediately. Do you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear, Papa. I\u2019ll go immediately.\u201d</p><p>Pasha snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re going back to bed,\u201d he whispered to her.</p><p>Mama said, \u201cCome on, we better go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Papa said. \u201cCome on, Pasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long,\u201d Tatiana said, knocking Pasha on the arm.</p> <p>He grunted unhappily in reply and pulled her hair. \u201cTie your hair up before you go out, will you?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll scare off the passersby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Tatiana said lightly. \u201cOr I\u2019ll cut it off completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go now,\u201d said Papa, tugging at Pasha.</p><p>Tatiana said good-bye to Volodya, waved to her mother, took one last look at Pasha\u2019s reluctant back, and returned upstairs.</p><p>Deda and Babushka were on their way out with Dasha. They were going to the bank to get their savings out.</p><p>Tatiana was left alone.</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief and fell onto her bed.</p><p>Tatiana knew she had been born too late into the family. She and Pasha. She should have been born in 1917, like Dasha. After her there were other children, but not for long: two brothers, one born in 1919 and one in 1921, died of typhus. A girl, born in 1922, died of scarlet fever in 1923. Then in 1924, as Lenin was dying and the New Economic Plan \u2014 that short-lived return to free enterprise \u2014 was coming to an end, while Stalin was scheming to enlarge his power base in the presidium through the firing squad, Pasha and Tatiana were born seven minutes apart to a very tired twenty-five-year-old Irina Fedorovna. The family wanted Pasha, their boy, but Tatiana was a stunning surprise. No one had twins. Who had twins? Twins were almost unheard of. And there was no room for her. She and Pasha had to share a crib for the first three years of their life. Since then Tatiana slept with Dasha.</p><p>But the fact remained \u2014 she was taking up valuable bed space. Dasha couldn\u2019t get married because Tania took up the space where Dasha\u2019s prospective husband would lie. Dasha often expressed this to Tatiana. She would say, \u201cBecause of you I\u2019m going to die an old maid.\u201d To which Tatiana would immediately reply, \u201cSoon, I hope. So I can marry and have my husband sleep next to me.\u201d</p><p>After graduating from school last month, Tatiana had gotten a job so she wouldn\u2019t have to spend another idle summer in Luga reading and rowing boats and playing silly games with the kids down the dusty road. Tatiana had spent all of her childhood summers at their dacha in Luga and on nearby Lake Ilmen in Novgorod, where her cousin Marina had a dacha with her parents.</p><p>In the past Tatiana had looked forward to cucumbers in June, tomatoes in July, and maybe some raspberries in August, looked forward to mushroom picking and blueberry picking, to fishing on the river \u2014 all such small pleasures. But this summer was going to be different.</p><p>Tatiana realized she was tired of being a child. At the same time she didn\u2019t know how to be anything else, so she got a job at the Kirov factory, in the south of Leningrad. That was nearly adult. She now worked and constantly read the newspaper, shaking her head at France, at Marshal P\u00e9tain, at Dunkirk, at Neville Chamberlain. She tried to be very serious, nodding purposefully at the crises in the Low Countries and the Far East. Those were Tatiana\u2019s concessions to adulthood \u2014 Kirov and Pravda.</p><p>She liked her job at Kirov, the biggest industrial plant in Leningrad and probably in all of the Soviet Union. Tatiana had heard that somewhere in that factory workers built tanks. But she was skeptical. She had not seen one.</p><p>She made silverware. Her job was to put the knives, forks, and spoons into boxes. She was the second-to-last person in the assembly line. The girl after her taped the boxes shut. Tatiana felt bad for that girl; taping was just so boring. At least Tatiana got to handle three different types of utensils.</p><p>Working at Kirov was going to be fun this summer, Tatiana thought, lying on her bed, but not as much fun as evacuation would have been.</p><p>Tatiana would have liked to get in a few hours of reading. She had just started Mikhail Zoshchenko\u2019s sadistically funny short stories on the ironic realities of Soviet life, but her instructions from her father had been very clear. She looked at her book longingly. What was the hurry anyway? The adults were behaving as if there were a fire. The Germans were two thousand kilometers away. Comrade Stalin would not let that traitor Hitler get deep into the country. And Tatiana never got to be home alone.</p><p>As soon as Tatiana had realized there was going to be no immediate evacuation, she became less excited about the war. Was it interesting? Yes. But Zoshchenko\u2019s story \u201cBanya\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Bathhouse\u201d \u2014 about a man going to the Soviet bathhouse and washing his clothes there, too, and losing his coat checks, was hilarious. Where is a naked man to put those coat checks? The checks were washed away during the bath. Only the string remained. I offer the string to the coat attendant. He won\u2019t take it. Any citizen can cut up string, he says. There won\u2019t be enough coats to go around. Wait until the other customers have gone. I\u2019ll give you whatever coat is left.</p><p>Since no one was evacuating, Tatiana read the story twice, lying on the bed, her legs up on the wall, weak from laughter by the second time.</p><p>Still, orders were orders. She had to go out and get food.</p><p>But today was Sunday, and Tatiana did not like to go out on Sundays unless she got dressed up. Without asking, she borrowed Dasha\u2019s high-heeled red sandals, in which Tatiana walked like a newborn calf with two broken legs. Dasha walked better in them; she was much more used to them.</p><p>Tatiana brushed out her very blonde long hair, wistfully wishing for thick dark curls like the rest of the family\u2019s. Hers was so straight and blah blonde. She always wore it tied back in a ponytail or in braids. Today she tied it up in a ponytail. The straightness and the blondeness of her hair were inexplicable. In her daughter\u2019s defense, Mama would say that she herself had had straight blonde hair as a child. Yes, and Babushka said that when she got married she had weighed only forty-seven kilos.</p><p>Tatiana put on the only Sunday dress she owned, made sure her face and teeth and hands were sparkling clean, and left the apartment.</p><p>A hundred and fifty rubles was a colossal amount of money. Tatiana didn\u2019t know where her father got that kind of money, but it appeared magically in his hands, and it was not her place to ask. She was supposed to come back with \u2014 what did her father say? Rice? Vodka? She had already forgotten.</p><p>Mama did tell him, \u201cGeorg, don\u2019t send her out. She won\u2019t get anything.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana had nodded in agreement. \u201cMama is right. Send Dasha, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Papa exclaimed. \u201cI know you can do it. Just go to the store, take a bag with you, and come back with\u2014\u201d</p><p>What did he tell her to come back with? Potatoes? Flour?</p><p>Tatiana walked past the Sarkovs\u2019 room and saw Zhanna and Zhenya Sarkov sitting in armchairs, sipping tea, reading, looking very relaxed, as if it were just another Sunday. How lucky they are to have such a big room all to themselves, thought Tatiana. Crazy Slavin was not in the hall. Good.</p><p>It was as if Molotov\u2019s announcement two hours ago had been an aberration in an otherwise normal day. Tatiana almost doubted that she had heard Comrade Molotov correctly until she got outside and turned the corner on Grechesky Prospekt, where teeming clusters of people were rushing toward Nevsky Prospekt, the main shopping street in Leningrad.</p><p>Tatiana could not remember when she had last seen such crowds on Leningrad streets. Quickly she turned around and went the other way to Suvorovsky Prospekt. She wanted to beat the crowds. If they were all going to the Nevsky Prospekt stores, she was going the opposite way down to Tauride Park, where the grocery stores, though understocked, were also underpatronized.</p><p>A man and a woman walked by, stared at Tatiana in her dress, and smiled. She lowered her gaze but smiled, too.</p><p>Tatiana was wearing her splendid white dress with red roses. She had the dress since 1938, when she had turned fourteen. Her father bought it from a market vendor in a town called Swietokryst in Poland, where he had gone on a business trip for the Leningrad waterworks plant. He went to Swietokryst, Warsaw, and Lublin. Tatiana thought her father was a world traveler when he came back. Dasha and Mama received chocolates from Warsaw, but the chocolates went a long time ago \u2014 two years and three hundred and sixty three days ago. But here Tatiana was, still wearing her dress with crimson roses embroidered on the thick, smooth, snow-white cotton. The roses weren\u2019t buds; they were blooms. It was a perfect summer dress, with thin shoulder straps and no sleeves. It was fitted through the waist and then billowed out in a flowing skirt to just above her knees, and if Tatiana spun around fast enough, the skirt whirled up in a parachute.</p><p>There was only one problem with this dress in June 1941: it was too small for Tatiana. The crisscross satin straps at the back of the dress that Tatiana could once tie completely closed had to be constantly loosened.</p><p>It vexed Tatiana that the body she was increasingly uneasy with could outgrow her favorite dress. It wasn\u2019t as if her body were blossoming to look like Dasha\u2019s, full of hips and breasts and thighs and arms. No, not at all. Tatiana\u2019s hips, though round, remained small, and her legs and arms remained slender, but the breasts got larger, and there was the problem. Had the breasts remained the same size, Tatiana wouldn\u2019t have had to leave the straps loose, exposing her bare spine under the crisscrosses from her shoulder blades to the small of her back for all the world to see.</p><p>Tatiana liked the notion of the dress, she liked the feeling of the cotton against her skin and the stitched roses under her fingers, but she did not like the feeling of her exploding body trapped inside the lung-squeezing material. What she enjoyed was the memory of her skinny-as-a-stick fourteen-year-old self putting on that dress for the first time and going out for a Sunday walk on Nevsky. It was for that feeling that she had put on the dress again this Sunday, the day Germany invaded the Soviet Union.</p><p>On another level, on a conscious, loudly-audible-to-the-soul level, what Tatiana also loved about the dress was a small tag that said FABRIQU\u00e9 EN FRANCE.</p><p>Fabriqu\u00e9 en France! It was gratifying to own a piece of anything not made badly by the Soviets, but instead made well and romantically by the French; for who was more romantic than the French? The French were masters of love. All nations were different. The Russians were unparalleled in their suffering, the English in their reserve, the Americans in their love of life, the Italians in their love of Christ, and the French in their hope of love. So when they made the dress for Tatiana, they made it full of promise. They made it as if to tell her, put it on, ch\u00e9rie, and in this dress you, too, shall be loved as we have loved; put it on and love shall be yours. And so Tatiana never despaired in her white dress with red roses. Had the Americans made it, she would have been happy. Had the Italians made it, she would have started praying, had the British made it, she would have squared her shoulders, but because the French had made it, she never lost hope.</p><p>Though at the moment, Tatiana walked down Suvorovsky with her dress uncomfortably tight against her swelling adolescent chest.</p><p>Outside was fresh and warm, and it was a jolt to the consciousness to remember that on this sunny lovely day full of promise, Hitler was in the Soviet Union. Tatiana shook her head as she walked. Deda had never trusted that Hitler and said so from the start. When Comrade Stalin signed the nonaggression pact with Hitler in 1939, Deda said that Stalin had gone to bed with the devil. And now the devil had betrayed Stalin. Why was that such a surprise? Why had we expected more from him? Had we expected the devil to behave honorably?</p><p>Tatiana thought Deda was the smartest man on earth. Ever since Poland was trampled over in 1939, Deda had been saying that Hitler was coming to the Soviet Union. A few months ago in the spring, he suddenly started bringing home canned goods. Too many canned goods for Babushka\u2019s liking. Babushka had no interest in spending part of Deda\u2019s monthly pay on an intangible such as just in case. She would scoff at him. What are you talking about, war? she would say, glaring at the canned ham. Who is going to eat this, ever? I will never eat this garbage, why do you spend good money on garbage? Why can\u2019t you get marinated mushrooms, or tomatoes? And Deda, who loved Babushka more than a woman deserved to be loved by a man, would bow his head, let her vent her feelings, say nothing, but the following month be back carrying more cans of ham. He also bought sugar and he bought coffee and he bought tobacco, and he bought some vodka, too. He had less luck with keeping these items stocked because for every birthday, anniversary, May Day, the vodka was broken open and the tobacco smoked and the coffee drunk and the sugar put into bread and pie dough and tea. Deda was a man unable to deny his family anything, but he denied himself. So on his own birthday he refused to open the vodka. But Babushka still opened the bag of sugar to make him blueberry pie. The one thing that remained constant and grew by a can or two each month was the ham, which everyone hated and no one ate.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s task of buying up all the rice and vodka she could get her hands on was proving much harder than she had anticipated.</p><p>The stores on Suvorovsky were empty of vodka. They carried cheese. But cheese would not keep well. They had bread, but bread would not keep well. The salami was gone, the canned goods, too. And the flour.</p><p>With a quickening pace Tatiana walked down Suvorovsky, eleven blocks in all, over a kilometer, and every store was empty of canned or long-term provisions. It was only three o\u2019clock.</p><p>Tatiana passed two savings banks. Both were closed. Signs, hastily handwritten, said CLOSED EARLY. This surprised her. Why would the banks close early? It\u2019s not as if they could run out of money. They were banks. She chuckled to herself.</p><p>The Metanovs had waited too long, Tatiana realized, sitting around as they did, packing Pasha, bickering, looking dejectedly at one another. They should have been out the door in an instant, but instead Pasha was sent to camp. And Tatiana had read Zoshchenko. She should have been out an hour earlier. If only she had gone to Nevsky Prospekt, she could be standing in line right now with the rest of the crowds.</p><p>But even though she strolled down Suvorovsky disheartened at not being able to find even a box of matches to buy, Tatiana felt the warm summer air carrying with it an anomalous scent of provenance, a scent of an order of things to come that she neither knew nor understood. Will I always remember this day? Tatiana thought, inhaling deeply. I\u2019ve said that in the past: oh, this day I\u2019ll remember, but I have forgotten the days I thought I would never forget. I remember seeing my first tadpole. Who would have thought? I remember tasting the salt water of the Black Sea for the first time. I remember getting lost in the woods by myself the first time. Maybe it\u2019s the firsts you remember. I\u2019ve never been in a real war before, Tatiana thought. Maybe I\u2019ll remember this.</p><p>Tatiana headed toward the stores near Tauride Park. She liked this area of the city, away from the hustle of Nevsky Prospekt. The trees were lush and tall, and there were fewer people. She liked the feeling of a bit of solitude.</p><p>After looking inside three or four grocers, Tatiana wanted to just give up. She was seriously considering going back home and telling her father she wasn\u2019t able to find anything, but the thought of telling him she had failed in the one small task he had assigned her filled her with anxiety. She walked on. Near the corner where Suvorovsky met Ulitsa Saltykov-Schedrin, there was a store with a long line of people stretching out into an otherwise empty street.</p><p>Dutifully she went and stood behind the last person in line.</p><p>Shifting from foot to foot, Tatiana stood and stood, asked for the time, stood and stood. The line moved a meter. Sighing, she asked the lady in front of her what they were standing in line for. The lady shrugged aggressively, turning away from Tatiana. \u201cWhat, what?\u201d the lady grumbled, holding her bag closer to her chest, as if Tatiana were about to rob her. \u201cStand in line like everybody else, and don\u2019t ask stupid questions.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana waited. The line moved another meter. She asked for the time again.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes after the last time you asked me!\u201d barked the woman.</p><p>When she heard the young woman in front of the grumpy lady say the word \u201cbanks\u201d Tatiana perked up.</p><p>\u201cNo more money,\u201d the young woman was saying to an older woman standing next to her. \u201cDid you know that? The savings banks have run out. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do now. Hope you have some in your mattress.\u201d</p><p>The older woman shook her head worriedly. \u201cI had 200 rubles, my life savings. That\u2019s what I have with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, buy, buy. Buy everything. Canned goods are especially\u2014\u201d</p><p>The older woman shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t like canned goods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then buy caviar. I heard one woman bought ten kilos of caviar at Elisey on Nevsky. What\u2019s she going to do with this caviar? But it\u2019s none of my business. I\u2019m buying oil. And matches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuy some salt,\u201d the older woman said wisely. \u201cYou can drink tea without sugar, but you can\u2019t eat porridge without salt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like porridge,\u201d the younger woman said. \u201cNever liked it. Won\u2019t eat it. It\u2019s gruel, that\u2019s what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, buy caviar then. You like caviar, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Maybe some sausage,\u201d the younger woman said thoughtfully. \u201cSome nice smoked kolbasa. Listen, it\u2019s been over twenty years that the proletariat has been the tsar. I know by now what to expect.\u201d</p><p>The woman in front of Tatiana snorted loudly. The two women ahead of her turned around.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what to expect!\u201d the woman said in a loud tone. \u201cIt\u2019s war.\u201d She gave a mirthless grunt that sounded like a train engine sputtering.</p><p>\u201cWho asked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar, comrades! Welcome to reality, brought to you by Hitler. Buy your caviar and butter, and eat them tonight. Because mark my words, your two hundred rubles will not buy you a loaf of bread next January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana lowered her head. She did not like fighting. Not at home, not on the street with strangers.</p><p>Two people were leaving the store with big paper bags under their arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s in them?\u201d she inquired politely.</p><p>\u201cSmoked kolbasa,\u201d a man told her gruffly, hurrying on. He looked as if he were afraid Tatiana would run after him and beat him to the ground to get his cursed smoked kolbasa. Tatiana continued to stand in line. She didn\u2019t even like sausage.</p><p>After thirty more minutes she left.</p><p>Not wanting to disappoint her father, she hurried to the bus stop. She was going to catch bus Number 22 to Elisey on Nevsky Prospekt, since she knew for sure they sold at least caviar there.</p><p>But then she thought, caviar? We will have to eat it next week. Surely caviar won\u2019t last until winter? But is that the goal? Food for the winter? That just couldn\u2019t be, she decided; winter was too far away. The Red Army was invincible; Comrade Stalin said so himself. The German pigs would be out by September.</p><p>As she rounded the corner of Ulitsa Saltykov-Schedrin, the rubber band holding her hair snapped and broke.</p><p>The bus stop was across the street on the Tauride Park side. Usually she got bus 136 from here to go across town to visit cousin Marina. Today bus 22 would take her to Elisey, but she knew she needed to hurry. From the way those women were talking, soon even the caviar would be gone.</p><p>Just ahead of her, Tatiana spotted a kiosk that sold ice cream.</p><p>Ice cream!</p><p>Suddenly the day was filled with possibilities. A man sat on a little stool under a small umbrella to shield himself from the sun as he read the paper.</p><p>Tatiana quickened her pace.</p><p>From behind her she heard the sound of the bus. She turned around and saw her bus in the middle distance. She knew if she ran, she could catch it easily. She stepped off the curb to cross the street, then looked at the ice cream stand, looked at the bus again, looked at the ice cream stand, and stopped.</p><p>Tatiana really wanted an ice cream.</p><p>Biting her lip, she let the bus pass. It\u2019s all right, she thought. The next one will come soon, and in the meantime I\u2019ll sit at the bus stop and have an ice cream.</p><p>Walking up to the kiosk man, she said eagerly, \u201cIce cream, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says ice cream, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019m sitting here, aren\u2019t I? What do you want?\u201d He lifted his eyes from the newspaper to her, and his hard expression softened. \u201cWhat can I get you, dearie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got . . .\u201d She trembled a little. \u201cHave you got cr\u00e8me br?l\u00e9e?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He opened the freezer door. \u201cA cone or a cup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cone, please,\u201d Tatiana replied, jumping up and down once.</p><p>She paid him gladly; she would have paid him double. In anticipation of the pleasure she was about to receive, Tatiana ran across the road in her heels, hurrying to the bench under the trees so she could eat her ice cream in peace, while she waited for the bus to take her to buy caviar because war had started.</p><p>There was no one else waiting for the bus, and she was glad for the fine moment to feast on her delight in seclusion. She took off the white paper wrapping, threw it in the trash can next to the bench, smelled the ice cream, and took a lick of the sweet, creamy, cold caramel. Closing her eyes in happiness, Tatiana smiled and rolled the ice cream in her mouth, waiting for it to melt on her tongue.</p><p>Too good, Tatiana thought. Just too good.</p><p>The wind blew her hair, and she held it back with one hand as she licked the ice cream in circles around the smooth ball. She crossed and uncrossed her legs, swung her head back, lolled the ice cream in her throat, and hummed the song everyone was singing these days: \u201cSomeday we\u2019ll meet in Lvov, my love and I.\u201d</p><p>It was a perfect day. For five minutes there was no war, and it was just a glorious Sunday in a Leningrad June.</p><p>When Tatiana looked up from her ice cream, she saw a soldier staring at her from across the street.</p><p>It was unremarkable in a garrison city like Leningrad to see a soldier. Leningrad was full of soldiers. Seeing soldiers on the street was like seeing old ladies with shopping bags, or lines, or beer bars. Tatiana normally would have glanced past him down the street and moved on, except that this soldier was standing across the street and staring at her with an expression Tatiana had never seen before. She stopped eating her ice cream.</p><p>Her side of the street was already in the shade, but the side where he stood swam in the northern afternoon light. Tatiana stared back at him for just a moment, and in the moment of looking into his face, something moved inside her; moved she would have liked to say imperceptibly, but that wasn\u2019t quite the case. It was as if her heart started pumping blood through all four chambers at once, pouring it into her lungs and flooding it through her body. She blinked and felt her breath become shorter. The soldier was melting into the pavement under the pale yellow sun.</p><p>The bus came, obstructing Tatiana\u2019s view of him. She almost cried out and got up, not to get on the bus, no, but to run forward, across the street, so she would not lose sight of him. The bus doors opened, and the driver looked at her expectantly. Tatiana, mild-mannered and quiet, nearly shouted at him to get out of her way.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting on, young lady? I can\u2019t be waiting forever.\u201d</p><p>Getting on? \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell are you doing waiting for the bus!\u201d the driver hollered and slammed the doors shut.</p><p>Tatiana backed away toward the bench and saw the soldier running around the bus.</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>The bus doors opened again. \u201cNeed the bus?\u201d asked the driver.</p><p>The soldier looked at Tatiana, then at the bus driver.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the sake of Lenin and Stalin!\u201d the driver bellowed, slamming the doors shut for the second time.</p><p>Tatiana was left standing in front of the bench. She backed away, tripped, and sat quickly down.</p><p>In a casual tone, with a shrug and a roll of his eyes, the soldier said, \u201cI thought it was my bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, me, too,\u201d she uttered, her voice croaky.</p><p>\u201cYour ice cream is melting,\u201d he said helpfully.</p><p>And it was, melting right through the bottom point of the waffle cone, onto her dress. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. Tatiana brushed the ice cream, only to spread it in a smear. \u201cGreat,\u201d she muttered, and noticed that her hand wiping the dress was trembling.</p><p>\u201cHave you been waiting long?\u201d the soldier asked. His voice was strong and deep and had a trace of . . . she didn\u2019t know. Not from around here, she thought, keeping her gaze lowered.</p><p>\u201cNot too long,\u201d she replied quietly, and, holding her breath, raised her eyes to get a better look at him. And raised them and raised them. He was tall.</p><p>He was wearing a dress uniform. The beige fatigues looked like his Sunday best, and his cap was ornate, with an enameled red star on the front. He wore wide parade shoulder boards in gray metallic lace. They looked impressive, but Tatiana had no idea what they meant. Was he a private? He was carrying his rifle. Did privates carry rifles? On the left side of his chest he wore a single silver medal trimmed in gold.</p><p>Underneath his umber cap he was dark-haired. The youth and dark hair were to his advantage, Tatiana thought, as her shy eyes met his eyes, which were the color of caramel \u2014 one shade darker than her cr\u00e8me br?l\u00e9e ice cream. Were they a soldier\u2019s eyes? Were they a man\u2019s eyes? They were peaceful and smiling.</p><p>Tatiana and the soldier stared at each other for a moment or two, but it was a moment or two too long. Strangers looked at each other for half a nothing before averting their eyes. Tatiana felt as if she could open her mouth and say his name. She glanced away, feeling unsteady and warm.</p><p>\u201cYour ice cream is still melting,\u201d the soldier repeated helpfully.</p><p>Blushing, Tatiana said with haste, \u201cOh, this ice cream. I\u2019m finished with it.\u201d She got up and threw it emphatically in the trash, wishing she had a handkerchief to wipe her stained dress.</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t tell if he was young like her; no, he seemed older. Like a young man, looking at her with a man\u2019s eyes. She blushed again, continuing to stare at the pavement between her red sandals and his black army boots.</p><p>A bus came. The soldier turned away from her and walked toward it. Tatiana watched him. Even his walk was from another world; the step was too sure, the stride too long, yet somehow it all seemed right, looked right, felt right. It was like stumbling on a book you thought you had lost. Ah, yes, there it is.</p><p>In a minute the bus doors were going to open and he was going to hop on the bus and wave a little good-bye to her and she was never going to see him again. Don\u2019t go! Tatiana shouted to him in her mind.</p><p>As the soldier got closer to the bus, he slowed down and stopped. At the last minute he backed away, shaking his head at the bus driver, who made a frustrated motion with his hands, slammed the door shut, and peeled away from the curb.</p><p>The soldier came back and sat on the bench.</p><p>The rest of her day flew out of her head without even a farewell.</p><p>Tatiana and the soldier were having a silence. How can we be having a silence? Tatiana thought. We just met. Wait. We haven\u2019t met at all. We don\u2019t know each other. How could we be having anything?</p><p>Nervously she looked up and down the street. Suddenly it occurred to her that he might be hearing the thumping in her chest, for how could he not? The noise had scared away the crows from the trees behind them. The birds had flown off in a panic, their wings flapping fervently. She knew \u2014 it was her.</p><p>Now she needed her bus to come. Now.</p><p>He was a soldier, yes, but she had seen soldiers before. And he was good-looking, yes, but she had seen good-looking before. Once or twice last summer she had even met good-looking soldiers. One, she forgot his name now \u2014 as she forgot most things now \u2014 had bought her an ice cream.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t this soldier\u2019s uniform that affected her, and it wasn\u2019t his looks. It was the way he had stared at her from across the street, separated from her by ten meters of concrete, a bus, and the electric wires of the tram line.</p><p>He took a pack of cigarettes from the pocket of his uniform. \u201cWould you like one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no,\u201d Tatiana replied. \u201cI don\u2019t smoke.\u201d</p><p>The soldier put the cigarettes back in his pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who doesn\u2019t smoke,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>She and her grandfather were the only ones Tatiana knew who didn\u2019t smoke. She couldn\u2019t continue to be silent; it was too pathetic. But when Tatiana opened her mouth to speak, all the words she thought of saying sounded so stupid that she just closed her mouth and begged silently for the bus to come.</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>Finally the soldier spoke again. \u201cAre you waiting for bus 22?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tatiana replied in a tinny voice. \u201cWait, no.\u201d She saw a bus with three digits coming up. It was Number 136.</p><p>\u201cThis is the one I\u2019m going to take,\u201d she said without thinking and quickly got up.</p><p>\u201cOne thirty-six?\u201d she heard him mutter behind her.</p><p>Tatiana walked toward it, took out five kopecks, and climbed aboard. After paying, she made her way to the back of the bus and sat down just in time to see the soldier getting on and making his way to the back.</p><p>He sat one seat behind her on the opposite side.</p><p>Tatiana scooted over to the window and tried not to think of him. Where did she intend to go on bus 136? Oh, yes, that\u2019s the bus she took to Marina\u2019s on Polustrovsky Prospekt. She would go there. She\u2019d get off at Polustrovsky and go ring Marina\u2019s doorbell.</p><p>Tatiana could see the soldier out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>Where was he going on bus Number 136?</p><p>The bus passed Tauride Park and turned at Liteiny Prospekt.</p><p>Tatiana straightened out the folds of her dress and traced the embroidered shapes of the roses with her fingers. Bending over between the seats, she adjusted her sandals. But mainly what she did was hope at every stop that the soldier would not get off. Not here, she thought, not here. And not here either. Where she wanted him to get off, Tatiana didn\u2019t know; all she knew was that she didn\u2019t want him to get off here.</p><p>The soldier didn\u2019t. Tatiana could tell he sat very calmly, looking out his window. Occasionally he would turn toward the front of the bus, and then Tatiana could swear he was looking at her.</p><p>After crossing Liteiny Bridge over the river Neva, the bus continued across town. The few stores Tatiana saw out the window either had long lines or were closed.</p><p>The streets became progressively emptier \u2014 bright, deserted Leningrad streets.</p><p>Stop after stop after stop went by. She was getting farther into north Leningrad.</p><p>Her head clearing briefly, Tatiana realized she had long since passed Marina\u2019s stop near Polustrovsky. Now she couldn\u2019t even tell where she was anymore. Unsettled, she moved tensely around on the seat.</p><p>Where was she going? She didn\u2019t know, but she couldn\u2019t get off the bus. First of all, the soldier was making no move to ring the bell, and second, she didn\u2019t know where she was. If Tatiana got off here, she would have to cross the street and take the bus back.</p><p>What was she hoping for anyway? To watch where he got off and then come back here another day with Marina? The thought made Tatiana twitch with disquiet.</p><p>Come back to find her soldier.</p><p>It was ridiculous. Right now she was hoping merely for a graceful retreat and a way back home.</p><p>Little by little, other people trickled off the bus. Finally there was no one left except Tatiana and the soldier.</p><p>The bus sped on. Tatiana didn\u2019t know what to do anymore. The soldier was not getting off the bus. What have I gotten myself into? she thought. She decided to get off, but when she rang the bell, the bus driver turned around and said, \u201cYou want to get off here, girl? Nothing here but industrial buildings. You meeting somebody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d she stammered.</p><p>\u201cWell, then wait. Next will be the last stop.\u201d</p><p>Mortified, Tatiana sat back down with a thump.</p><p>The bus pulled into a dusty terminal.</p><p>The driver said, \u201cLast stop.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana got off the bus into a hot, earth-covered bus station, which was a square lot at the end of an empty street. She was afraid to turn around. She put her hand on her chest to still her relentless heart. What was she supposed to do now? Nothing to do but take the bus back. Slowly she walked out of the station.</p><p>After \u2014 and only after \u2014 taking the deepest breath, Tatiana finally looked to her right, and there he was, smiling cheerfully at her. He had perfect white teeth \u2014 unusual for a Russian. She couldn\u2019t help but smile back. Relief must have shown in her face. Relief and apprehension and anxiety; all that, and something else, too.</p><p>Grinning, the soldier said, \u201cAll right, I give up. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>What could Tatiana say?</p><p>His Russian was slightly accented. It was correct Russian, just slightly accented. She tried to figure out if the accent and the white teeth came from the same place and, if so, where that place was. Georgia, maybe? Armenia? Somewhere near the Black Sea. He sounded as if he came from around salt water.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Tatiana said at last.</p><p>The soldier smiled again. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Looking up at him, Tatiana got a crick in her neck. She was a waif of a girl, and the soldier towered over her. Even in her high heels she barely came up to the base of his throat. Another thing she must ask him, if she could get her tongue back from him \u2014 the height. The teeth, the accent, and the height, all from the same place, comrade?</p><p>They had stopped stupidly in the middle of the deserted street. There wasn\u2019t much activity around the bus terminal on a Sunday when war had started. Instead of hanging around near buses, people were standing in lines buying food. Not Tatiana, no, she was stopped stupidly in the middle of the street.</p><p>\u201cI think I missed my stop,\u201d Tatiana muttered. \u201cI have to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you going?\u201d he repeated politely, still standing across from her, not moving, not making a move to move. Standing completely still, eclipsing the sun.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d she asked rhetorically. Her hair was a big mess, wasn\u2019t it? Tatiana never wore makeup, but she wished she had a little lipstick. Something, anything, so she wouldn\u2019t feel so plain and silly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of the street,\u201d the soldier said. They crossed. \u201cYou want to sit?\u201d He pointed to a bench by the bus stop sign. \u201cWe can wait for the next bus here.\u201d They sat. He sat too close to her.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s the oddest thing,\u201d Tatiana began after a prolonged throat clearing. \u201cMy cousin Marina lives on Polustrovsky Prospekt \u2014 I was going there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was several kilometers ago. A dozen bus stops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tatiana said, flustered. \u201cI must have just missed it.\u201d</p><p>He made a serious face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll get you right back. The bus will come in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at him, she asked, \u201cWhere were . . . you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m with the garrison. I\u2019m on city patrol today.\u201d His eyes were twinkling.</p><p>Oh, perfect, Tatiana thought, looking away. He was merely on city patrol, and I was headed practically to Murmansk. What an idiot. Embarrassed, her face all red, she suddenly felt light-headed. She looked down at her shoes. \u201cExcept for the ice cream, I haven\u2019t eaten all day,\u201d she said feebly, her consciousness yielding to unconsciousness in a matter of suspended seconds. The soldier\u2019s arm went around her back, and his calm, firm voice said, \u201cNo. No, don\u2019t faint. Stay up.\u201d</p><p>And she did.</p><p>Woozy and disoriented, she didn\u2019t want to see his tilted head looking at her solicitously. She smelled him, something pleasant and masculine, not alcohol or sweat like most Russians. What was it? Soap? Cologne for men? Men in the Soviet Union did not wear cologne. No, it was just him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tatiana said weakly, attempting to stand up. He helped her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Just hungry, I think.\u201d</p><p>He was still holding her. The perimeter of her upper arm was inside his hand, which was the size of a small country, perhaps Poland. Trembling slightly, Tatiana straightened herself, and he let her go, leaving a warm empty space where his hand had been.</p><p>\u201cSitting on the bus, now out in the sun . . .\u201d the soldier said with some concern in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right. Come on.\u201d He pointed. \u201cThere\u2019s our bus.\u201d</p><p>The bus came, driven by the same driver, who looked at them with raised eyebrows and said nothing.</p><p>This time they sat together, Tatiana near the window, the soldier with his uniformed arm draped over the wooden back of the seat behind her.</p><p>Looking at him in this proximity was truly impossible. There was just no hiding from his eyes. But it was his eyes that Tatiana wanted most to see.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t normally faint,\u201d she said, looking out the window. That was a lie. She fainted all the time. All someone had to do was bump a chair against her knee and she was on the floor unconscious. The teachers at school used to send home two or three notes a month about her fainting.</p><p>She glanced at him.</p><p>Smiling irrepressibly, the soldier said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d she said, noticing the slight stubble on his face, the sharp line of his nose, his black brows, and the small gray scar on his forehead. He was tanned under the stubble. His white teeth were outstanding.</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d he repeated in his deep voice. \u201cTatiana,\u201d he said, slower, gentler. \u201cTania? Tanechka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d she replied and gave him her hand. Before he told her his name, he took it. Her small, slender, white hand disappeared in his enormous, warm, dark one. She thought he must have heard her heart through her fingers, through her wrist, through all the veins under her skin.</p><p>\u201cI am Alexander,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her hand remained outstretched in his.</p><p>\u201cTatiana. Such a good Russian name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, too,\u201d she said and lowered her eyes.</p><p>Finally, reluctantly, she pulled her hand away. His large hands were clean, his fingers long and thick, and his nails trimmed. Neat nails on a man were another anomaly in Tatiana\u2019s Soviet life.</p><p>She looked away onto the street. The window of the bus was dirty. She wondered who washed it and when and how frequently. Anything not to think. What she felt though, was almost as if he were asking her not to turn away from him, almost as if his hand were about to come up and turn her face to him. She turned to him, lifted her eyes, and smiled. \u201cWant to hear a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDying to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA soldier is being led to his execution,\u201d Tatiana began. \u201c \u2018Some bad weather we\u2019re having,\u2019 he says to his convoy. \u2018Look who\u2019s complaining,\u2019 they say. \u2018We have to go back.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Alexander laughed so instantly and loudly, his merry eyes never leaving her face, that Tatiana felt herself \u2014 just a little bit \u2014 melting within.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny, Tania,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She smiled and said quickly, \u201cI have another joke: \u2018General, what do you think about the upcoming battle?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cI know this one. The general says, \u2018God knows it will be lost.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Tatiana continued, \u201c \u2018Then why should we try?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>And Alexander finished, \u201c \u2018To find out who is the loser.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>They both smiled and looked away from each other.</p><p>\u201cYour straps are untied,\u201d she heard him say.</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour straps. At the back of the dress. They\u2019ve come undone. Here, turn your back to me a little more. I\u2019ll tie them for you.\u201d</p><p>She turned her back to him and felt his fingers pulling on the satin ribbons. \u201cHow tight do you want them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she said hoarsely, not breathing. It occurred to her that he must be seeing down to the small of her bare back underneath the straps, and she became suddenly and keenly self-conscious.</p><p>When she turned to him, Alexander cleared his throat and asked, \u201cAre you going to get off at Polustrovsky? To see your cousin Marina? Because it\u2019s coming up. Or do you want me to take you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolustrovsky?\u201d Tatiana repeated, as if hearing the word for the first time. It took her a moment. \u201cOh, my.\u201d Placing her hand on her forehead, she said, \u201cOh, no, you won\u2019t believe \u2014 I can\u2019t go home. I\u2019m going to get in so much trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Alexander said. \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d</p><p>Why did she think he meant it? And moreover, why did she suddenly find herself relieved and strengthened and not afraid of going home?</p><p>After she told him about the rubles in her pocket and the failed quest for food, Tatiana finished with, \u201cI don\u2019t know why my father would delegate this task to me. I\u2019m the least capable of anyone in my family of actually succeeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short, Tatiana,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cBesides, I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can?\u201d</p><p>He told her he would take her to one of the officers-only army stores called Voentorgs, where she could buy many of the things she needed.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not an officer,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cAlexander Belov, first lieutenant. Impressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkeptical,\u201d she said. Alexander laughed. Tatiana didn\u2019t want him to be old enough to be a first lieutenant. \u201cWhat\u2019s the medal for?\u201d she asked, looking at his chest.</p><p>\u201cMilitary valor,\u201d he said with an indifferent shrug.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Her mouth lifted in a timid, admiring smile. \u201cWhat did you do that was so military and valiant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much. Where do you live, Tania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear Tauride Park \u2014 on the corner of Grechesky and Fifth Soviet,\u201d she instantly replied. \u201cDo you know where that is?\u201d</p><p>Alexander nodded. \u201cI patrol everywhere. You live with your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. With my parents, my grandparents, my sister, and my twin brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll in one room?\u201d Alexander asked, without inflection.</p><p>\u201cNo, we have two!\u201d Tatiana exclaimed happily. \u201cAnd my grandparents are on a housing list to get another room when one becomes available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long,\u201d asked Alexander, \u201chave they been on this housing list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince 1924,\u201d replied Tatiana, and they both laughed.</p><p>They were on the bus forever and a second.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never known anyone who was a twin,\u201d said Alexander as they got off. \u201cAre you close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Pasha can be very irritating. He thinks because he is a boy he always has to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d said Tatiana, glancing away from his teasing eyes. \u201cDo you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI was my mother and father\u2019s only child.\u201d He blinked and then quickly continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve come full circle, haven\u2019t we? Fortunately, we\u2019re not far from the store. Do you feel like walking, or do you want to wait for bus 22?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana watched him.</p><p>Did he just say, was?</p><p>Did he just say, I was my mother and father\u2019s only child? \u201cWe can walk,\u201d Tatiana let out slowly, staring thoughtfully into his face and not moving. From his high forehead to his square jaw, his facial bones were prominent and clearly visible to her curious eyes. And all were set in what seemed like cement at the moment. As if he were grinding his teeth together. Carefully, she asked, \u201cSo where are you from, Alexander? You have a slight . . . accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, do I?\u201d he asked, looking down at her feet. \u201cAre you going to be all right walking in those shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she replied. Was he trying to change the subject? Her dress strap had fallen off her shoulder. Suddenly Alexander reached out and with his index finger pulled the strap back up, his fingertip tracing her skin. Tatiana turned red. She hated that about herself. She turned red all the time for no reason.</p><p>Alexander stared at her. His face relaxed into \u2014 what was that in his eyes? It looked almost like bedazzlement. \u201cTania\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s walk,\u201d Tatiana said, mindful of the protracted daylight and the burning embers and his voice. There was something nauseating about these sudden feelings clinging to her like wet clothes.</p><p>The sandals were hurting her feet, but she didn\u2019t want to let him know it. \u201cIs the store far from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have to stop at the barracks for a minute. I\u2019ve got to sign out. I\u2019ll have to blindfold you the rest of the way. I can\u2019t have you knowing where the soldiers\u2019 barracks are, can I?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was not about to look at Alexander to see if he was joking.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, trying to sound casual, \u201chere we are, and we haven\u2019t talked about the war.\u201d She put on her purposeful serious face. \u201cAlexander, what do you think of Hitler\u2019s actions?\u201d</p><p>Why did he look infinitely amused by her? What had she said that was so amusing? \u201cDo you really want to talk about the war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she maintained. \u201cIt\u2019s a grave matter.\u201d</p><p>The look of wonder did not leave his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so inevitable. We\u2019ve been waiting for it. Let\u2019s go this way.\u201d</p><p>They walked past Mikhailovsky Palace or Engineer\u2019s Castle, as it was sometimes called, over the short Fontanka Canal bridge at the aqueous intersection of the Fontanka and Moika canals. Tatiana loved the slightly arched granite bridge, and sometimes she would climb on top of the low parapets and walk the ledge. Not today, of course. She wasn\u2019t going to be a child today.</p><p>They walked past the western end of Letniy Sad, the Summer Garden, and came out onto the grassy parade grounds of Marsovo P\u00f3le, the Field of Mars. \u201cWe need to leave this country to Hitler,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cor we need to stay and fight for Mother Russia. But if we stay, it\u2019s a fight to the death.\u201d He pointed. \u201cThe barracks are just across the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the death? Really?\u201d Tatiana looked up excitedly and slowed down on the grass. She wanted to take off her shoes. \u201cAre you going to go to the front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go where they send me.\u201d Alexander slowed down, too, then stopped. \u201cTania, why don\u2019t you take off your shoes? You\u2019ll be more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. How did he know her feet were killing her? Was it that obvious?</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he prodded gently. \u201cIt will be easier for you to walk on the grass.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Breathing a sigh of relief, she bent, unstrapped the sandals, and slipped them off. Straightening up and raising her eyes to him, she said, \u201cThat is a little better.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was silent. \u201cNow you\u2019re really tiny,\u201d he said at last.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tiny,\u201d she returned. \u201cYou\u2019re just outsized.\u201d Blushing, she lowered her gaze.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you, Tania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlder than you think,\u201d Tatiana said, wanting to sound old and mature. The warm Leningrad breeze blew her blonde hair over her face. Holding her shoes with one hand, she attempted to sort out her hair with the other. She wished she had a rubber band for her ponytail. Standing in front of her, Alexander reached out and brushed the hair away. His eyes traveled from her hair to her eyes to her mouth where they stopped.</p><p>Did she have ice cream all around her lips? Yes, that must be it. How awkward. She licked her lips, trying to clean the corners. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said. \u201cDo I have ice cream\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know how old I think you are?\u201d he asked. \u201cTell me, how old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be seventeen soon,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even seventeen,\u201d Alexander echoed.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen tomorrow!\u201d she repeated indignantly.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen, right. Very grown up.\u201d His eyes were dancing.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-two,\u201d he said. \u201cTwenty-two, just.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, and couldn\u2019t hide the disappointment in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Is that very old?\u201d Alexander asked, failing to keep the smile off his face.</p><p>\u201cAncient,\u201d Tatiana replied, failing to keep the smile off her face.</p><p>Slowly they walked across the Field of Mars, Tatiana barefoot and carrying the red sandals in her slightly swinging hands.</p><p>Once they got to the pavement, she put her sandals back on and they crossed the street, stopping at a nondescript brown stucco four-story building, distinguished by its lack of a front door. A deep, darkened passageway ran inside. \u201cThese are the Pavlov Barracks,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cwhere I\u2019m stationed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are the famous Pavlov Barracks?\u201d Tatiana looked up at the grubby building. \u201cSurely this can\u2019t be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you expecting? Maybe a snowcapped palace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to the gate. I\u2019m going to turn in my weapon and sign out. You\u2019ll wait, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d After walking through the long archway, they came to a manned iron gate, deep inside the entranceway. A young sentry lifted his hand in salute to Alexander. \u201cProceed, Lieutenant. Who is this with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana. She\u2019ll wait for me here, Sergeant Petrenko.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she will,\u201d the guard said, eyeing Tatiana surreptitiously, but not so surreptitiously that she didn\u2019t notice. Tatiana watched Alexander walk beyond the iron gate across a courtyard, salute a tall officer, then stop and chat briefly to a cluster of smoking soldiers, breaking into a laugh and striding off. Nothing distinguished Alexander from the others, except that he was taller than anyone else and had darker hair and whiter teeth, broader shoulders and a wider stride. Nothing but that he was vivid and they were muted.</p><p>Petrenko asked if she wanted to sit down.</p><p>She shook her head. Alexander had told her to wait right here, and she wasn\u2019t going to move. Certainly she wasn\u2019t going to be sitting in some other soldier\u2019s chair, though she would have liked to sit.</p><p>As she stood looking through the garrison gate, waiting for Alexander, Tatiana felt herself floating on the cloud of fate that laced her afternoon with improbability and desire.</p><p>Desire for life.</p><p>One of her Deda\u2019s favorite sayings was, \u201cLife is so unpredictable. That\u2019s what I like least about it. If only life were more like math.\u201d</p><p>This one day Tatiana had to disagree with him.</p><p>She would take a day like this over any day in school or in the factory. She decided she would take a day like this over any other day in her life.</p><p>Taking a short step toward the guard, Tatiana asked, \u201cTell me, are civilians allowed inside?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Petrenko said with a wink, \u201cWell, it depends what the sentry gets for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be quite enough, Sergeant,\u201d Alexander said, walking briskly past him. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Tania.\u201d He didn\u2019t have his rifle anymore.</p><p>Just as they were about to walk through the passageway onto the street, a soldier jumped out at them from a secret door Tatiana had not seen. He startled her so much that she actually yelped as if stung. Placing his hand on Tatiana\u2019s back, Alexander shook his head. \u201cDimitri, why?\u201d</p><p>The soldier laughed noisily. \u201cYour faces! That\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana composed herself. Was she wrong, or did Alexander move not just closer to her but closer and to the front, as if to stand not next to her but to shield her? How absurd.</p><p>Smiling, the soldier said, \u201cSo, Alex, who is your new friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDimitri, this is Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri shook Tatiana\u2019s hand vigorously, not letting go. Graciously, she pulled away.</p><p>Dimitri was average height by Russian standards, short compared to Alexander. He had a Russian face: broad, slightly washed-out features, as if the colors had all run dry. His nose was wide and turned up, his lips extremely thin. They were two rubber bands loosely strung together. His throat was nicked in several places by his razor. Underneath his left eye he had a small black birthmark. Dimitri\u2019s sidecap did not have an enameled red star like Alexander\u2019s, nor were his shoulder boards metallic. Dimitri\u2019s were red, with one thin blue stripe. His uniform tunic bore no medals.</p><p>\u201cVery nice to meet you,\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cSo where are you two headed?\u201d</p><p>Alexander told him.</p><p>\u201cIf you like,\u201d said Dimitri, \u201cI\u2019ll be glad to help carry the purchases back to your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can manage, Dima, thanks,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Dimitri smiled. \u201cIt\u2019ll be my pleasure.\u201d He was looking at Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cSo, Tatiana, how did you happen to run into our lieutenant?\u201d asked Dimitri, walking alongside her while Alexander trailed behind. Tatiana turned around and found him staring at her with anxiety. Their glances touched and moved apart. Alexander caught up and led them down the street. The Voentorg store was just around the corner.</p><p>\u201cI ran into him on the bus,\u201d Tatiana replied to Dimitri. \u201cHe took pity on me and offered his help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was certainly lucky for you,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cNo one likes to help out a damsel in distress as much as our Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hardly a damsel in distress,\u201d Tatiana muttered, while Alexander prodded her with his hand, directing her inside the store and ending the conversation.</p><p>Tatiana was amazed at what she found behind a simple glass door with a sign on it that said officers only. First, there was no line. Second, the store was stocked full of sacks and bags and smelled of smoked ham and fish, enveloped in the aroma of cigarettes and coffee.</p><p>Alexander asked her how much money she had, and she told him, thinking the sum would stun him. He merely shrugged and said, \u201cWe could spend it all on sugar, but let\u2019s be provident, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m buying for. So how can I be provident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuy,\u201d he said, \u201cas if you\u2019re never going to see these goods again.\u201d</p><p>She gave him her money without a second thought.</p><p>He bought for her four kilos of sugar, four kilos of white flour, three kilos of oats, five kilos of barley, three kilos of coffee, ten cans of marinated mushrooms, and five cans of tomatoes. Also she bought a kilo of black caviar, and with the few rubles that were left she bought two cans of ham to please her Deda. To please herself she bought a small bar of chocolate.</p><p>Smiling, Alexander told her he would pay for the chocolate out of his own money and bought her five bars.</p><p>He suggested she buy matches. Tatiana mildly scoffed at this, because, she pointed out \u2014 she thought cleverly \u2014 you couldn\u2019t eat matches. He suggested she buy some motor oil. She told him she didn\u2019t have a car. He said to buy it anyway. She didn\u2019t want to. She didn\u2019t want to be spending her father\u2019s money on something as silly as oil and matches.</p><p>\u201cBut, Tania,\u201d Alexander pointed out, \u201chow are you going to put the flour you\u2019re buying to good use if you don\u2019t have a match to light the fire? It\u2019ll be hard to bake that bread.\u201d</p><p>She relented only after she found out the matches were a few kopecks, and even then she bought only one box of 200.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the motor oil, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get a car, I\u2019ll buy the motor oil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if there is no kerosene this winter?\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d she said. \u201cWe have electricity.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms. \u201cBuy it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDid you say this winter?\u201d Tatiana waved him off. \u201cWhat are you talking about, winter? It\u2019s June. We\u2019re not going to be fighting the Germans this winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to the Londoners,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cTell that to the French, to the Belgians, to the Dutch. They\u2019ve been fighting . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can call what the French did fighting.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Alexander said, \u201cTatiana, buy the motor oil. You won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>She would have listened to him, but the voice of her father in her head was stronger, admonishing her for wasting his money. She refused.</p><p>She asked the shop assistant for a rubber band and tied up her hair nice and neat while Alexander was paying. Tatiana asked how they were going to get all the provisions home.</p><p>Dimitri said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. That\u2019s why I came along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDima,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI really think we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cWe do have a lot of . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDimitri the packhorse,\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cGlad to be of service to you, Alexander.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>Tatiana noted the smirk, remembering her feeling that when Dimitri walked into the store, past the glass door with the sign officers only, he had been as surprised as Tatiana to find himself inside the Voentorg.</p><p>\u201cAre you and Alexander in the same unit?\u201d Tatiana asked Dimitri as they piled her provisions into wooden apple crates and left the store.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no,\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cAlexander is an officer, and I\u2019m just a lowly private. No, he is a number of ranks above me. Which,\u201d Dimitri said with his smirk, \u201callows him to send me to the front in Finland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Finland,\u201d corrected Alexander mildly. \u201cAnd not to the front, but to check out reinforcements at Lisiy Nos. What are you complaining about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not complaining. I\u2019m lauding your farsightedness.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stole a glance at Alexander, uncertain how to respond to the ironic stretching of Dimitri\u2019s rubber lips.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this Lisiy Nos?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Karelian Isthmus,\u201d Alexander replied. \u201cAre you going to be all right walking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tatiana couldn\u2019t wait to get home. Her sister would die when Tatiana showed up with two soldiers. She carried the lightest crate, the one with the caviar and coffee.</p><p>\u201cIs that too heavy for you?\u201d Alexander asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. Actually, it was quite heavy, and she didn\u2019t know how she was going to get to the bus. They were going to the bus, weren\u2019t they? They weren\u2019t planning to walk to Fifth Soviet from the Field of Mars?</p><p>The pavement was narrow, so they walked in single file, Alexander leading, Tatiana second, and Dimitri bringing up the rear.</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d Tatiana panted, \u201care we planning to . . . walk home?\u201d She was out of breath.</p><p>Alexander stopped walking. \u201cGive me that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really fine.\u201d</p><p>He put down his crate, took hers, and placed it on top, lifting both crates easily. \u201cYour feet must be killing you in those shoes. Come on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The pavement expanded, and now she could walk next to Alexander. Dimitri flanked her on the left. \u201cTania, do you think we\u2019ll get some vodka for our trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my father might find some vodka for you, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Tania, tell us,\u201d Dimitri asked, \u201cdo you go out much?\u201d</p><p>Go out? What a strange question. \u201cNot much,\u201d she said shyly.</p><p>\u201cEver go to a place named Sadko?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my sister often does. She says it\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri leaned over a little. \u201cNext weekend, do you want to come to Sadko with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, no, thank you,\u201d she said, lowering her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun. Right, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>Alexander did not respond.</p><p>They walked three in a row along the wide pavement. Tatiana was in the middle. When other pedestrians headed toward them, it was Dimitri who stepped behind Tatiana to let them pass.</p><p>Tatiana noticed that Dimitri moved behind her with a reluctant sigh, as if it were a last resort, a battle, as if he were ceding territory to the enemy. At first Tatiana thought the passersby were the enemy, but soon she realized that, no, she and Alexander were the enemy because they never moved over, continuing to walk side by side, shoulder to shoulder.</p><p>Quietly Alexander asked, \u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou want to rest a minute?\u201d He put down his crates.</p><p>Dimitri did, too, eyeing Tatiana. \u201cSo, Tania, where do you go for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I go to the park. We go to our dacha in Luga.\u201d Turning to Alexander, she asked, \u201cSo will you tell me where you\u2019re from, or am I going to have to guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re going to have to guess, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere around salt water, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he didn\u2019t tell you yet?\u201d said Dimitri, standing very close to them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get a straight answer out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, Tania,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI\u2019m from Krasnodar, by the Black Sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Krasnodar,\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cHave you ever been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019ve never been anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri glanced at Alexander, who picked up his crates and said curtly, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They passed a church and crossed Grechesky Prospekt. Tatiana was so lost in thinking of a way to see Alexander again that she walked right past her apartment building. She was a few hundred meters down the block, almost near the corner of Suvorovsky, when she stopped.</p><p>\u201cYou want another rest?\u201d Alexander asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, trying to hide the feelings from her voice. \u201cWe missed my apartment building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissed it?\u201d exclaimed Dimitri. \u201cHow can that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just did, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cIt\u2019s at the other corner.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Alexander lowered his head. Slowly they walked back.</p><p>After entering the front door, Tatiana said, \u201cI\u2019m on the third floor. Will you two be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have a choice?\u201d Dimitri asked. \u201cIs there an elevator? Of course not,\u201d he added. \u201cThis isn\u2019t America. Is it, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think so,\u201d Alexander replied.</p><p>They climbed the stairs in front of Tatiana. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered behind Alexander, mostly to herself; in fact, she was just thinking out loud. The thoughts were too loud, that was all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said, without turning around.</p><p>Stumbling, she continued upward.</p><p>When she opened the door to her communal apartment, Tatiana hoped that crazy Slavin would not be lying on the floor in the middle of the corridor. This time her hopes went unanswered. He was there, his torso in the corridor, his legs inside his room, a snake of a man, thin, unkempt, malodorous, his ragged mop of greasy gray hair covering most of his face.</p><p>\u201cSlavin has been pulling his hair out again,\u201d she whispered to Alexander, who was right behind her.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the least of his problems,\u201d Alexander whispered back.</p><p>With a growl, Slavin let Tatiana walk by but grabbed hold of Alexander\u2019s leg and laughed hysterically.</p><p>\u201cComrade,\u201d said Dimitri, coming up behind Alexander and sticking his boot on top of Slavin\u2019s wrist, \u201clet go of the lieutenant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Dimitri,\u201d said Alexander, moving Dimitri away with his elbow. \u201cI can handle him.\u201d</p><p>Slavin squealed with delight and squeezed Alexander\u2019s boot harder. \u201cOur Tanechka is bringing home a handsome soldier,\u201d Slavin shrieked. \u201cExcuse me . . . two handsome soldiers! What\u2019s your father going to say, Tanechka? Is he going to approve? I don\u2019t think so! I don\u2019t think so at all. He doesn\u2019t like you to bring home boys. He\u2019ll say two is too much for you. Give one to your sister, give her one, my sweet.\u201d With glee, Slavin laughed wildly. Alexander yanked his leg away.</p><p>Slavin reached out to grab hold of Dimitri, then looked up into Dimitri\u2019s face and let his hand drop without touching him.</p><p>Calling after all three of them, Slavin screeched, \u201cYes, Tanechka, bring them home. Bring more! Bring them all \u2014 because they\u2019ll all be dead in three days. Dead! Shot by Comrade Hitler, such a good friend of Comrade Stalin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in a war,\u201d Tatiana said by way of explanation, relieved to be past him. \u201cHe ignores me when I\u2019m alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I doubt that?\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Flushing, Tatiana said, \u201cHe really does. He is bored with us because we ignore him.\u201d</p><p>Leaning into her, Alexander said, \u201cIsn\u2019t communal living grand?\u201d</p><p>That surprised her. \u201cWhat else is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he replied. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s going to take to reconstruct our selfish, bourgeois souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Comrade Stalin says!\u201d Tatiana exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Alexander, keeping a serious face. \u201cI\u2019m quoting him.\u201d</p><p>Trying not to laugh, Tatiana led him to her front door. Before opening it, she glanced back at Alexander and Dimitri and said with an excited sigh, \u201cAll right. Home.\u201d Opening the door, she said, smiling, \u201cCome in, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come in, too?\u201d Dimitri asked.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s family were in Babushka and Deda\u2019s room around the big dining table. Tatiana stuck her head in from the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m home!\u201d</p><p>No one even looked up. Mama said blankly, \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d She could have been saying, more bread?</p><p>\u201cMama, Papa! Look at the food I\u2019ve bought.\u201d</p><p>Papa looked up briefly from his glass of vodka. \u201cGood, daughter,\u201d he said. She could have returned empty-handed. With a small sigh, she glanced at Alexander standing in the hallway. What was that on his face? Sympathy? No, not quite. Warmer. She whispered to him, \u201cPut the crates down and come in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, Papa, Babushka, Deda,\u201d said Tatiana, walking into the room and trying to keep the thrill out of her voice for the imminent introduction, \u201cI want you to meet Alexander\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Dimitri,\u201d said Dimitri quickly, as if Tatiana had forgotten him.</p><p>\u201cAnd Dimitri,\u201d Tatiana finished.</p><p>Everyone shook hands and stared incredulously at Alexander and then at Tatiana. Mama and Papa remained seated at the table with a bottle of vodka between them and two shot glasses. Deda and Babushka went to sit on the couch to give the soldiers more room at the table. Tatiana thought her parents looked sad. Were they drinking to Pasha and chasing him down with pickles?</p><p>Papa stood up. \u201cYou did very well, Tania. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d He motioned to Alexander and Dimitri. \u201cCome. Have some vodka.\u201d</p><p>Alexander politely shook his head. \u201cNo, thank you. I have duty later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShake your head for yourself,\u201d said Dimitri, stepping forward.</p><p>Papa poured, frowning at Alexander. What kind of man refused a drink of vodka? Alexander may have had his reasons for refusing her father\u2019s hospitality, but Tatiana knew that because of that, her father was going to like Dimitri better. Such a small act, yet the feelings that would follow would be so permanent. And yet because he refused, Tatiana liked Alexander better.</p><p>\u201cTania, I don\u2019t suppose you bought any milk?\u201d Mama asked her.</p><p>\u201cPapa told me dry goods only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Tatiana\u2019s father asked Alexander.</p><p>\u201cKrasnodar region,\u201d he said.</p><p>Papa shook his head. \u201cI lived in Krasnodar in my youth. You don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am,\u201d said Alexander mildly.</p><p>To change the subject, Tatiana asked, \u201cAlexander, would you prefer some tea instead? I can make you some tea.\u201d</p><p>He moved closer to her, and she had to summon her breath. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he said warmly. \u201cI can\u2019t stay long, Tania. I\u2019ve got to get back.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana took off her sandals. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy feet are . . .\u201d She smiled. She had tried hard to pretend they did not bother her, but the blisters on her big toe and little toe were bleeding.</p><p>Alexander glanced at her feet, shaking his head. Then he looked into her face. That expression seeped into his almond eyes again. \u201cBarefoot is better,\u201d he said very quietly.</p><p>Dasha came into the room. She stopped and stared at the two soldiers.</p><p>She looked healthy, radiant with the day, and Tatiana suddenly thought her sister looked too healthy and too radiant, but before she could utter a sound, Dasha exclaimed, her voice thick with pleasure, \u201cAlexander! What are you doing here?\u201d Dasha didn\u2019t even glance at Tatiana, who, perplexed, looked at Alexander and said, \u201cYou know Dasha . . . ?\u201d but then broke off in the middle of the question, seeing realization and conscience and unhappiness strike his mute, comprehending face.</p><p>Tatiana looked at Dasha, then back to Alexander. She felt herself paling from the inside out. Oh, no, she wanted to say. Oh, no, how can this be?</p><p>Alexander\u2019s face became impassive. He smiled easily at Dasha and said, not looking at Tatiana, \u201cYes. Dasha and I have met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again!\u201d Dasha said with a laugh and a pinch of his arm. \u201cAlexander, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana glanced around the room to see if anyone else had noticed what she had noticed. Dimitri was eating a pickle. Deda was reading the newspaper, his glasses on. Papa was having another drink. Mama was opening up some cookies, and Babushka had her eyes closed. No one else saw.</p><p>Mama said, \u201cThe soldiers just came back with Tatiana. Brought food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dasha said, her face turning up to Alexander, full of mild curiosity. \u201cHow do you know my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI ran into her on the bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ran into my little sister?\u201d said Dasha. \u201cIncredible! It\u2019s like destiny!\u201d She tweaked him lightly on the arm again.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go sit down,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI think I will have that drink after all.\u201d He moved to the table in the middle of the room by the wall, while Dasha and Tatiana remained by the door. Dasha leaned over and whispered, \u201cHe is the one I told you about!\u201d Dasha must have thought she was whispering.</p><p>\u201cOne what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning,\u201d hissed Dasha.</p><p>\u201cThis morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so dumb? He\u2019s the one!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana got it. She hadn\u2019t been dumb. There was no morning. There was only waiting for the bus and meeting Alexander. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, refusing to allow herself to feel anything. She was too stunned.</p><p>Dasha went to sit in the chair next to him. Glancing sadly at Alexander\u2019s uniformed back, Tatiana went to put the food away.</p><p>\u201cTanechka,\u201d Mama called after her, \u201cput it away in the right place, not like usual.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana heard Alexander say, \u201cDon\u2019t bother with shots. Pour mine straight into a glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man,\u201d said Papa, pouring him a glass. \u201cA toast. To new friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo new friends,\u201d everyone chimed in.</p><p>Dimitri said, \u201cTania, come and have a toast with us,\u201d and Tatiana came in, but Papa said, no, Tania was too young to drink, and Dimitri apologized, and Dasha said she would drink for herself and her sister, and Papa said like she didn\u2019t already, and everyone laughed except Babushka, who was trying to nap, and Tatiana, who wanted the day to be instantly over.</p><p>From the hallway, as she picked up the crates and carried them one after the other into the kitchen, she heard tidbits of conversation.</p><p>\u201cWork on the fortifications must be speeded up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroops must be moved to the frontiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAirports must be put in working order. Guns must be installed in forward positions. All of this must go ahead at fever pace.\u201d</p><p>A little later she heard Papa say, \u201cOh, our Tania works at Kirov. She\u2019s just graduated from school \u2014 a year early! She plans to go to Leningrad University next year when she turns eighteen. You\u2019d never know it by looking at her \u2014 but she graduated a year early. Did I already say that?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana smiled at her father.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why she wanted to work at Kirov,\u201d said Mama. \u201cIt\u2019s so far, it\u2019s practically outside Leningrad. She can\u2019t take care of herself,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cWhy should she, when you\u2019ve been doing everything for her all her life,\u201d Papa snapped.</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d yelled Mama. \u201cWash our dishes from dinner while you\u2019re out there, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>In the kitchen Tatiana put away all she had bought. As she carried the crates, she would glance into the room to see Alexander\u2019s back. Karelia and the Finns and their borders, and the tanks, and weapons superiority and the treacherous marshy woods where it was so hard to gain ground and the war with Finland of 1940 and . . .</p><p>She was in the kitchen when Alexander and Dasha and Dimitri came out. Alexander did not look at her. It was as if he were a pipeline full of water, and Dasha had turned the faucet off.</p><p>\u201cTania, say good-bye,\u201d Dasha said. \u201cThey\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wished she were invisible. \u201cGood-bye,\u201d she said from a distance, wiping her floured hands on her white dress. \u201cThanks again for your help.\u201d</p><p>Dasha said, holding on to Alexander\u2019s arm, \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri came up to Tatiana and asked if he could call on her again. She may have said yes, she may have nodded. She barely heard him.</p><p>Leveling his eyes on her, Alexander said, \u201cIt was nice to meet you, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana may have said, \u201cYou, too.\u201d She didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>The three of them went, and Tatiana was left standing in the kitchen. Mama came out and said, \u201cThe officer forgot his cap.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana took it from Mama\u2019s hands, but before she could take one step to the corridor, Alexander had returned \u2014 by himself. \u201cForgot my cap,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tatiana gave it to him without speaking and without looking at him.</p><p>As he took the cap from her, his fingers rested against hers for a moment. That made her look up. Tatiana stared at him with sadness. What did grown-ups do? She wanted to cry. She could do nothing but gulp down the aching in her throat and act grown-up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Alexander said so quietly that Tatiana thought she might have misheard him. He turned and walked out.</p><p>Tatiana found her mother frowning at her. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe grateful we got some food, Mama,\u201d said Tatiana, and started to make herself something to eat. She buttered a piece of bread, ate part of it with absentminded abandon, then jumped up and threw the rest out.</p><p>There was nowhere for her to go. Not in the kitchen, not in the hallway, not in the bedroom. What she wanted was a little room of her own where she could go and jot down small things in her diary.</p><p>Tatiana had no little room of her own. As a result she had no diary. Diaries, as she understood them from books, were supposed to be full of personal writings and filled with private words. Well, in Tatiana\u2019s world there were no private words. All private thoughts you kept in your head as you lay down next to another person, even if that other person happened to be your sister. Leo Tolstoy, one of her favorite writers, wrote a diary of his life as a young boy, an adolescent, a young man. That diary was meant to be read by thousands of people. That wasn\u2019t the kind of diary Tatiana wanted to keep. She wanted to keep one in which she could write down Alexander\u2019s name and no one would read it. She wanted to have a room where she could say his name out loud and no one would hear it.</p><p>Alexander.</p><p>Instead, she went back into the bedroom, sat next to her mother, and had a sweet biscuit.</p><p>Her parents talked about the money Dasha was not able to get out of the bank, which had closed early, and a little about evacuation, but said nothing about Pasha \u2014 for how could they? \u2014 and Tatiana said nothing about Alexander \u2014 for how could she? Her father talked about Dimitri and what a fine young man he seemed to be. Tatiana sat quietly at the table, summoning her teenage strength. When Dasha returned, she motioned for Tatiana to come into their bedroom. Tatiana dutifully went. Whirling around, Dasha said, \u201cSo what did you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d said Tatiana in a tired voice.</p><p>\u201cTania, of him! What did you think of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice? Oh, come on! What did I tell you? You\u2019ve never met anyone so handsome.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana managed a small smile.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t I right? Wasn\u2019t I?\u201d Dasha laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou were right, Dasha,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it incredible that you met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d said Tatiana without feeling, standing up and wanting to get out of the room, but Dasha blocked the door with her twitching body, unwittingly challenging Tatiana, who was not up to a fight, not a big one, not a small one. Challengeless, she said and did nothing. That\u2019s the way it had always been. Dasha was seven years older. She was stronger, smarter, funnier, more attractive. She always won. Tatiana sat back down on the bed.</p><p>Dasha sat next to Tatiana. \u201cWhat about Dimitri? Did you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. Listen, don\u2019t worry about me, Dash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s worried?\u201d Dasha said, ruffling Tatiana\u2019s hair. \u201cGive Dima a chance. I think he actually liked you.\u201d Dasha said that almost as if she were surprised. \u201cMust be your dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be. Listen, I\u2019m tired. It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p><p>Dasha put her arm on Tatiana\u2019s back. \u201cI really like Alexander, Tania,\u201d she said. \u201cI like him so much, I can\u2019t even explain.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana felt a chill. Having met Alexander, having walked with Alexander, having smiled at Alexander, Tatiana grimly understood that Dasha\u2019s relationship with him was not some transient fling soon to be ended on the steps of Peterhof or in the gardens of the Admiralty. Tatiana had no doubt her sister meant it this time. \u201cDon\u2019t explain anything, Dasha,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cTania, someday you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Squinting sideways, Tatiana looked up at her sister sitting on the edge of the bed. She opened her mouth. A moment passed.</p><p>She wanted to say, but, Dasha, Alexander crossed the street for me.</p><p>He got on the bus for me, and went to the outskirts of town for me.</p><p>But Tatiana couldn\u2019t say any of that to her older sister.</p><p>What she wanted to say to Dasha was, you\u2019ve had plenty. You can get yourself a new one any time you want. You\u2019re charming and bright and beautiful, and everybody likes you. But him I want for myself.</p><p>What she wanted to say was, but what if he likes me best?</p><p>Tatiana said nothing. She wasn\u2019t sure any of it was true. Especially the last part. How could he like Tatiana best? Look at Dasha with her hair and her flesh. And maybe Alexander crossed the street for Dasha, too. Maybe he went across town, across the river for Dasha at three o\u2019clock in the bright morning when the Neva bridges were up. Tatiana had nothing to say. She closed her mouth. What a waste, what a joke it all had been.</p><p>Dasha studied her. \u201cTania, Dimitri is a soldier. . . . I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re quite ready for a soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing. But we might need to spruce you up a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpruce me up, Dasha?\u201d said Tatiana, her heart backing into her lungs.</p><p>\u201cYes, you know, maybe a little lipstick, maybe have a little talk . . .\u201d Dasha pulled Tatiana\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll do that. Another day, though, all right?\u201d</p><p>In her white dress with red roses, Tatiana curled up, facing the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>3</p><p>Alexander was walking fast down Ligovsky.</p><p>They were silent for a few minutes, and then Dimitri, still not catching his breath, said, \u201cNice family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d said Alexander calmly. He was not out of breath. And he did not want to talk to Dimitri about the Metanovs.</p> <p>\u201cI remember Dasha,\u201d Dimitri said, barely keeping up with Alexander. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her with you a few times at Sadko, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer sister is something, though, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>Dimitri continued. \u201cGeorgi Vasilievich said Tania was nearly seventeen.\u201d His head shuddered. \u201cSeventeen! Remember us at seventeen, Alexander?\u201d</p> <p>Alexander kept on walking. \u201cToo well.\u201d He wished he could remember himself at seventeen less. Dimitri was talking to him. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d Dimitri said patiently, \u201cdo you think she is a young seventeen or an old seventeen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo young for you, Dimitri, regardless,\u201d Alexander said coolly.</p><p>Dimitri was silent. \u201cShe is very pretty,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cYes. Still too young for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care? You\u2019re close to the older sister, I\u2019m going to get to know the younger.\u201d Dimitri chuckled. \u201cWhy not? We could make a . . . foursome, don\u2019t you think? Two best friends, two sisters . . . there\u2019s a symmetry\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDima,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cwhat about Elena last night? She told me she liked you. I can introduce you next week.\u201d</p><p>Waving him off, Dimitri said, \u201cYou actually talked to Elena?\u201d He laughed. \u201cNo. I can get dozens like Elena. Besides, why not Elena, too? No. Tatiana is not like the others.\u201d He rubbed his hands together and smiled.</p><p>Not a muscle moved on Alexander\u2019s face. Not a tic in his eye, not a tightening of his lips, not a furrowing of his brow. Nothing moved, except his legs, faster and faster down the street.</p><p>Dimitri broke into a trot. \u201cAlexander, wait. About Tania . . . I just want to make sure . . . you don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, not, Dima,\u201d Alexander said evenly. \u201cWhy would I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d He slapped Alexander on the back. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man. Quick question \u2014 do you want me to arrange entertainment for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll be on duty all night. Come on, we\u2019ll have fun like always?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Not tonight.\u201d He paused. \u201cNot again, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m late,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI\u2019m going to run. I\u2019ll see you at the barracks.\u201d</p><p>UNCHARTED TIDES</p><p>THE next morning when Tatiana woke up, the first image in her mind was Alexander\u2019s face. Tatiana did not speak to Dasha, tried in fact not to look at her sister, who, as she was leaving said, \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Tanechka, happy birthday,\u201d said Mama, hurrying out. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to lock up.\u201d</p><p>Papa kissed her on the head and said, \u201cYour brother is seventeen today, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Papa.\u201d</p><p>Papa worked as a pipe engineer at the Leningrad waterworks plant. Mama was a seamstress at a Nevsky hospital uniform facility. Dasha was an assistant to a dentist. She had worked for him since leaving university two years ago. They had had a romance, but once it was over, Dasha continued there because she liked the job. It paid well and demanded little from her.</p><p>Tatiana went to Kirov, where the whole morning she sat in on meetings and patriotic speeches. The manager of her department, Sergei Krasenko, asked if anyone wanted to join the People\u2019s Volunteer Army to dig trenches down south to help defeat the hated Germans.</p><p>Today the German was hated. Yesterday he was beloved. What about tomorrow?</p><p>Yesterday Tatiana had met Alexander.</p><p>Krasenko continued to speak. The fortifications north of Leningrad, along the old frontier with Finland, were to be put into full defensive order. The Red Army suspected that the Finns were going to want Karelia back. Tatiana perked up. Karelia, Finland. Alexander spoke about that yesterday. Alexander . . . Tatiana perked down.</p><p>The women listened to Krasenko, but no one sprang up to volunteer for anything. No one, that is, except Tamara, the woman who followed Tatiana on the assembly line. \u201cWhat have I got to lose?\u201d she whispered with fervor as she scrambled to her feet. Tatiana had suspected that Tamara\u2019s job was just too boring.</p><p>Today before lunch she received goggles, a protective mask for her hair, and a brown factory coat. After lunch she was no longer packaging spoons and forks. Now small cylindrical metal bullets came to her down the assembly line. They fell by the dozen into small cardboard containers, and Tatiana\u2019s job was to put the containers into large wooden crates.</p><p>At five o\u2019clock Tatiana took off her coat and her mask and goggles, splashed water on her face, retied her hair into a neat ponytail, and left the building. She walked on Prospekt Stachek, along the famous Kirov wall, a concrete structure seven meters tall that ran fifteen city blocks. She walked three of those blocks to her bus stop.</p><p>And waiting for her at the bus stop was Alexander.</p><p>When she saw him \u2014 Tatiana couldn\u2019t help herself \u2014 her face lit up. Putting her hand on her chest, she stopped walking for a moment, but he smiled at her and she blushed and, gulping down whatever was in her throat, walked toward him. She noticed that his officer\u2019s cap was in his hands. She wished she had scrubbed her face harder.</p><p>The presence of so many words inside her head made her incapable of small talk, just at the time when she needed small talk most. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked timidly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at war with Germany,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI have no time for pretenses.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wanted to say something, anything, not to let his words linger in the air. So she said, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you doing something special tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Today is Monday, so everyone will be tired. We\u2019ll have dinner. A drink.\u201d She sighed. In a different world, perhaps, she might have invited him over for dinner on her birthday. Not in this world.</p><p>They waited. Somber people stood all around them. Tatiana did not feel somber. She thought, but is this what I\u2019m going to look like when I\u2019m here by myself, waiting for the bus like them?</p><p>Is this what I am going to look like for the rest of my life?</p><p>And then she thought, we\u2019re at war. What is the rest of my life even going to look like?</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I\u2019d be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father told me yesterday you worked at Kirov. I took a chance you\u2019d be waiting for the bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked lightly. \u201cHave we had so much luck with public transportation?\u201d</p><p>Alexander smiled. \u201cYou mean we in the sense of the Soviet people? Or do you mean you and I?\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>Bus Number 20 came with room for two dozen people. Three dozen piled on. Alexander and Tatiana waited.</p><p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s walk,\u201d he said finally, leading her away.</p><p>\u201cWalk where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk back home. I want to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him doubtfully. \u201cHome is eight kilometers from here.\u201d She glanced at her feet.</p><p>\u201cAre your shoes comfortable today?\u201d He was smiling.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d she said, cursing herself for her little-girl awkwardness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d he suggested. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we walk one long block over to Govorova Ulitsa, and take tram Number 1 from there? Can you walk one long block? Everybody here is waiting for the bus or the trolleybus. We\u2019ll catch tram Number 1 instead.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana thought about it. \u201cI don\u2019t think that tram drops me off at my apartment,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t, but you can change at the Warsaw railroad station for tram Number 16 that will take you to the corner of Grechesky and Fifth Soviet, or you can change with me for tram Number 2, which will drop me off close to my barracks and you at the Russian Museum.\u201d He paused. \u201cOr we can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not walking eight kilometers,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cNo matter how comfortable my shoes are. Let\u2019s go to the tram.\u201d She already knew she would not be getting off at some railroad station to catch another tram back home by herself.</p><p>When the tram didn\u2019t come for twenty minutes, Tatiana agreed to walk a few kilometers to tram Number 16. Govorova turned into Ulitsa Skapina and then meandered diagonally northward until it ended in the embankment of the Obvodnoy Canal \u2014 the Circular Canal.</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t want to get to her tram. She didn\u2019t want him to get to his. She wanted to walk along the blue canal. How to tell him that? There were other things, too, to ask him. Always she tried to be less forward. Always she tried to find the right thing to say and didn\u2019t trust the etiquette pendulum swinging in her head, so she simply said nothing, which was perceived either as painful shyness or haughtiness. Dasha never had that problem. She just said the first thing that came into her head.</p><p>Tatiana knew she needed to trust her inner voice more. It was certainly loud enough.</p><p>Tatiana wanted to ask Alexander about Dasha.</p><p>But he began with, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you this. You might think I\u2019m being presumptuous. But . . .\u201d He trailed off.</p><p>\u201cIf I think you\u2019re being presumptuous,\u201d Tatiana remarked, \u201cyou probably are.\u201d</p><p>He stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cTell me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to tell your father, Tatiana, that he has to get your brother back from Tolmachevo.\u201d</p><p>As she heard those words, she saw the imperially ornate Warsaw train station across the street, and she was thinking fleetingly about what it would be like to see Warsaw and Lublin and Swietokryst, and suddenly there was Pasha and Tolmachevo, and . . .</p><p>Tatiana wasn\u2019t expecting it. She had wanted something else. Instead, Alexander had mentioned Pasha, whom he did not know and had never met.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Tatiana asked at last.</p><p>\u201cBecause there is some danger,\u201d Alexander said after a pause, \u201cthat Tolmachevo will fall to the Germans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d She did not understand, and even if she did, she would not want to. She would choose not to understand. She didn\u2019t want to get upset. She had been too happy that Alexander had come to see her unbidden, of his own free will. Yet there was something in his voice \u2014 Pasha, Tolmachevo, Germans, these three words were flowing together in one sentence, said by a near-stranger with warm eyes in a cool tone. Had he come all the way to Kirov to alarm her? What for?</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTalk to your father about getting Pasha out of Tolmachevo. Why did he send him there?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cTo be safe?\u201d Alexander shuddered, and something passed over his face. Unblinking, she watched him intently for more, for less, for an explanation. But there was nothing else. Not even words.</p><p>Tatiana cleared her throat. \u201cThere are boys\u2019 camps there. That\u2019s why he sent him.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI know. Many, many Leningraders sent their boys there yesterday.\u201d His face was blank.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, the Germans are down in Crimea,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cComrade Molotov said so himself. Didn\u2019t you hear his speech?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they are in Crimea. But we have a border with Europe that\u2019s two thousand kilometers long. Hitler\u2019s army is on every meter of that border, Tania, south from Bulgaria north to Poland.\u201d He paused. She didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cFor right now, Leningrad is the safest place for Pasha. Really.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was skeptical. \u201cWhy are you so sure?\u201d She became animated. \u201cWhy does the radio keep talking about the Red Army being the strongest army in the world? We have tanks, we have planes, we have artillery, we have guns. The radio is not saying what you\u2019re saying, Alexander.\u201d She spoke those words almost as a rebuke.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cTania, Tania, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, what, what?\u201d she said, and saw that Alexander, despite his serious face, nearly laughed. That made her nearly laugh herself, despite her own serious face.</p><p>\u201cTania, Leningrad has lived for so many years with a hostile border with Finland only twenty kilometers to the north that we forgot to arm the south. And that\u2019s where the danger is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s where the danger is, then how come you\u2019re sending Dimitri up to Finland where, as you suggest, all is quiet?\u201d</p><p>Alexander was silent. \u201cReconnaissance,\u201d he said at last. Tatiana felt he left something unsaid. \u201cMy point is,\u201d he went on, \u201call of our precautionary defenses are focused in the north. But south and southwest, Leningrad does not have a single division, a single regiment, not one military unit deployed. Do you understand what I\u2019m telling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, a little defiantly.</p><p>\u201cTalk to your father about Pasha,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>They fell silent as they walked side by side through the quiet streets. Subdued was the sunlight, still the leaves, and only Alexander and Tatiana moved languidly through the summer, slowing down at the end of every block, looking at the pavement, looking up to the street signs. Tatiana was thinking, please don\u2019t let this end so soon. What was he thinking?</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cabout yesterday . . . I\u2019m sorry about the mishap. What could I do? Your sister and I . . . I didn\u2019t know she was your sister. We had met at Sadko\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Of course. You don\u2019t have to explain,\u201d interjected Tatiana. He brought it up. That meant so much.</p><p>\u201cOh, but I do. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve\u201d \u2014 he paused \u2014 \u201cupset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. Everything is fine. She had told me about you. She and you\u2014\u201d Tatiana stopped, wanting to add that she was all right with that, but got stuck on her words. \u201cSo what\u2019s Dimitri like? Is he nice? When is he coming back from Karelia?\u201d Did she say that for effect? Tatiana wasn\u2019t sure. She just wanted to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. When his entrenching assignment is finished. In a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m getting tired. Can we catch a tram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Alexander said slowly. \u201cLet\u2019s wait for the Number 16.\u201d</p><p>They were seated on the tram when he spoke again. \u201cTatiana, your sister and I weren\u2019t serious. I will tell her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she exclaimed. The two stolid men in front of her turned around quizzically. \u201cNo,\u201d she repeated, more quietly, but no less adamantly. \u201cAlexander, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d She put her hands over her face and then took them away. \u201cShe is my older sister. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I was my mother and father\u2019s only child. His violin words echoed in her chest.</p><p>More gently, Tatiana said, \u201cShe is my only sister.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd she is serious about you.\u201d Did she need to say more? She didn\u2019t think so, but judging by the displeased look on his face, yes, she did. \u201cThere will be other boys,\u201d she finally added with a gallant shrug, \u201cbut I will never have another sister.\u201d</p><p>All Alexander said was, \u201cI\u2019m not a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen, then,\u201d Tatiana stammered. This was too difficult for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think there will be other men?\u201d</p><p>Dumbstruck, Tatiana nonetheless persisted. \u201cBecause you make up half the world. But I know for a fact I have only one sister.\u201d</p><p>When Alexander didn\u2019t comment, she ventured, \u201cYou do like Dasha, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Quietly he replied, \u201cOf course. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Tatiana interrupted, \u201cit\u2019s settled. No reason to speak any more about it.\u201d She sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alexander said, sighing briefly. \u201cGuess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d She stared out the window.</p><p>Whenever Tatiana thought of what she might like to be in life, she always thought of her grandfather and the dignity with which he conducted his simple existence. Her grandfather could have been anything, but he chose to become a math teacher. Tatiana didn\u2019t know if it was the teaching of irrefutable math that made Deda approach more intangible issues with the same black-and-white code or if it was the very essence of his character that drew him to math\u2019s absolutes, but whatever it was, Tatiana had always marveled at it. Whenever people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up, she invariably said, \u201cI want to be like my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana knew what Deda would do. He would never step on his sister\u2019s heart.</p><p>The tram moved past Insurrection Square. Alexander asked her to get off a few stops before Fifth Soviet, near the redbrick Grechesky Hospital on Second Soviet and Grechesky. \u201cI was born in this hospital,\u201d Tatiana offered, pointing.</p><p>\u201cSo, Tania, tell me, do you like Dimitri?\u201d</p><p>It was a good minute before Tatiana could answer him.</p><p>What answer was he looking for? Was he asking as a spy for Dimitri or for himself? And what should she say? If it was for Dimitri and Tatiana said no, she did not like him, then she would hurt Dimitri\u2019s feelings, and she didn\u2019t want to do that.</p><p>If it was for Alexander and she said yes, she liked Dimitri, then she would hurt Alexander\u2019s feelings, and she didn\u2019t want to do that either. What were girls supposed to say? Weren\u2019t they supposed to play some kind of game? Lure, pull, pretend.</p><p>Alexander was Dasha\u2019s. Did Dasha\u2019s younger sister owe him an honest answer?</p><p>Did he want one?</p><p>He wanted one.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she finally said. Tatiana didn\u2019t want to hurt Alexander\u2019s feelings most of all.</p><p>She saw by his face that she had given him the right answer.</p><p>\u201cDasha says I should give him a chance though. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied at once.</p><p>They were stopped at the corner of Second Soviet and Grechesky Prospekt. The dome of the church across from her building glistened a few hundred meters in the distance. Tatiana couldn\u2019t take the thought of him leaving. Now that he had come, asked the impossible, and been refused, she was afraid she would not see him like this again. Alone like this again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let him leave just yet. Not just yet. \u201cAlexander,\u201d she asked quietly, looking into his face, \u201care your . . . mother and father still in Krasnodar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not in Krasnodar.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look away. His eyes poured into her. \u201cTania, so many things I can\u2019t explain but want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo explain,\u201d Tatiana said softly, holding her breath.</p><p>\u201cJust remember, what\u2019s happening right now in the Red Army \u2014 the confusion, the unpreparedness, the disorganization \u2014 none of it can be understood except through the events of the last four years. Do you see?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stood still. \u201cI don\u2019t see. What does it have to do with your parents?\u201d</p><p>Alexander stepped a shade closer, shielding her from the setting sun. \u201cMy parents are dead. My mother in 1936, my father in 1937.\u201d He lowered his voice even more. \u201cShot,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBy the NKVD \u2014 the not-so-secret police. Now I have to go, all right?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s shocked face must have slowed him, because he patted her on the arm and said, smiling grimly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Sometimes things don\u2019t work out the way we hope, do they? No matter how much we plan, or how much we wish. True?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d replied Tatiana, lowering her gaze. For some reason she didn\u2019t think he was talking just about his parents. \u201cAlexander, do you want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he cut in. \u201cI\u2019ll see you.\u201d</p><p>All she wanted to ask was, when? but all she said was, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t want to go back to her apartment, inside the kitchen, inside. She wanted to be on the tram again, or at the bus stop, even at the store, on the street \u2014 anywhere, as long as it wasn\u2019t in the apartment without him.</p><p>When Tatiana got to her building, she stood dumbly on the landing, mindlessly drawing the outline of the figure eight with her fingers, readying herself for the climb up and beyond.</p><p>With a heavy heart she ambled upstairs.</p><p>2</p><p>The family was discussing the war. There was no birthday dinner, but there was plenty of drink. And plenty of loud argument. What was going to happen to Leningrad? As Tatiana arrived, her father and grandfather were disagreeing on Hitler\u2019s intentions \u2014 as if they both knew him personally. All Mama wanted to know was why Comrade Stalin had not spoken to the people. Dasha wanted to know if she should continue working.</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to what?\u201d snapped an irritated Papa. \u201cLook at Tania. She is barely seventeen, and she doesn\u2019t ask if she should continue working.\u201d</p><p>Everybody looked at Tatiana, including Dasha \u2014 unhappily.</p><p>Tatiana put down her bag. \u201cSeventeen today, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes!\u201d Papa exclaimed. \u201cOf course. The day has been so crazy. Let\u2019s drink a toast to Pasha\u2019s health.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd to Tania\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The room was somehow smaller because Pasha wasn\u2019t with them.</p><p>Tatiana leaned against the wall, wondering when would be a good time to bring up her brother and Tolmachevo. Hardly anyone even noticed she was holding up the wall, except Dasha, who glanced at her from the couch and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have some chicken soup? It\u2019s outside on the stove,\u201d and Tatiana thought that was a good idea. In the kitchen, she poured herself two ladlefuls of carrots and a bit of chicken and then sat on the window ledge and looked out into the yard as the soup got cold next to her. She couldn\u2019t eat anything hot. She was burning up inside.</p><p>When Tatiana walked back into their rooms, she heard her mother say consolingly to her father, \u201cThis war will not continue into winter. By then it will all be over.\u201d</p><p>Papa was quiet, rubbing the folds of his shirt. He said, \u201cYou know, Napoleon, too, came to the Soviet Union with his armies in June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNapoleon!\u201d Mama screeched. \u201cWhat does Napoleon have to do with this, Georgi Vasilievich? Please. I beg of you.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana opened her mouth to speak, to say something about Tolmachevo, but not only was she not sure of the message she was supposed to relay to her mature, all-knowing, insufferable family, it suddenly occurred to her that she might have to explain how she came by this information on the Germans\u2019 future advance into Russia.</p><p>Might? she thought. She closed her mouth.</p><p>Papa sat by Mama\u2019s side, looking into his empty glass. \u201cLet\u2019s have another shot,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd drink to Pasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to Luga!\u201d exclaimed Mama. \u201cLet\u2019s go to our dacha, get away from the city.\u201d</p><p>How could Tatiana not say something now? \u201cMaybe,\u201d she coughed up, with the confidence of a lamb, spluttering at her own audacity, \u201cmaybe we could bring Pasha back from camp in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>Papa, Mama, Dasha, Deda, and Babushka all stared at Tatiana with confusion and remorse, as if, one, they had been surprised she could speak and, two, they were sorry for saying grown-up things in the presence of a child.</p><p>Mama started to cry. \u201cWe should bring him back. Today is his birthday, and he is all by himself.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my birthday, too, Tatiana thought. She got up, deciding to go and have a bath.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Papa called to her.</p><p>\u201cTo wash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo wash what?\u201d snapped Mama. \u201cTake some plates into the kitchen, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo wash myself,\u201d replied Tatiana, gathering the dirty plates from the table.</p><p>Dasha went out, Tatiana didn\u2019t ask where. She suspected it was to see Alexander. She was not one to feel sorry for herself, and she wasn\u2019t going to start now. If there was anything to feel sorry for, it was the turn of events that allowed feeling into her heart, only to have that feeling squashed by the ludicrous hands of fate. She wasn\u2019t going to allow pointless self-pity inside \u2014 that angry fiend.</p><p>Tatiana forced herself to reread some of Chekhov\u2019s stories, which never failed to ease her with their inertness. Reading seven of his short stories put her right to sleep, the last one about a girl sitting on a bench with an older man.</p><p>She kept hearing Deda and Papa argue about the war. Deda said that many people did not view it as sheer tragedy. The idea of war was terrible, but might not war bring freedom to them? Might not this new horror bring in its wake some good? Might it not lift from Russia\u2019s back the savage burden of the Bolsheviks and give the nation a chance for a new, normal, and humane life?</p><p>Tatiana heard Papa\u2019s voice, laden with vodka. \u201cNothing will lift from Russia the savage burden of the Bolsheviks. Nothing will bring us a normal life.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana thought Papa was a pessimist. Vodka tended to make him even more morose.</p><p>Something had to bring them all a chance for a new life. But what? As if she had any answers. She slept.</p><p>She was awakened at one forty-five in the morning by a sound she had never heard before coming from outside. It was a screeching siren piercing the dusky night. She cried out, and her father came over and told her not to worry, it was just an air-raid siren. She wanted to know if she had to get up; were the Germans bombing them already?</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, Tanechka, dear,\u201d said Papa, but how could she, with the siren shrieking and Dasha not home? The siren stopped after a few minutes, but Dasha was still not home.</p><p>3</p><p>At the morning meeting at Kirov the next day, Tatiana was told that the workday, in honor of the war effort, was extended until seven in the evening, until further notice. Until further notice, Tatiana guessed, was until the war ended. Krasenko informed the workers that he and the Party secretary from Moscow decided to step up production of the KV-1, heavy tank for the defense of Leningrad. Krasenko said that Leningrad would be defended with what tanks, ammunition, artillery they could make at Kirov. Stalin would not redeploy arms from the southern front to the Leningrad front to protect the city.</p><p>Whatever Leningrad could produce to defend itself \u2014 arms and food \u2014 would have to be sufficient.</p><p>After that meeting so many workers volunteered for the front that Tatiana thought the factory would be closed down. But no such luck. She and another worker \u2014 a worn, middle-aged woman named Zina \u2014 returned to their projectile assembly line.</p><p>Late in the day the nail gun broke, and Tatiana had to nail the crates shut with a hammer. By seven her back and her arm ached.</p><p>Tatiana and Zina walked along the Kirov wall, and before she got to the bus stop, Tatiana saw Alexander\u2019s black-haired head rising above the tide of others.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Tatiana said, losing a breath and speeding up. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Zina mumbled something in return.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she greeted him, her heart racing, her voice steady. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She was too tired to feign disinterest. She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming to take you home. Did you have a nice birthday? Did you talk to your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tatiana replied.</p><p>\u201cNo to both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t talk to them, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana said, avoiding the birthday issue. \u201cMaybe Dasha can talk to them? She is a lot braver than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, much,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI\u2019m a big chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to talk to her about Pasha. She is even less concerned than you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not my place. I\u2019m just doing what I can.\u201d He glanced at the line of people. \u201cWe\u2019ll never get on this bus. Want to walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it is up the tram steps,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t move today. I\u2019m so tired.\u201d She paused, adjusting her ponytail. \u201cHave you been waiting long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours,\u201d he replied, and Tatiana suddenly felt less tired. She stared at Alexander with surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting two hours?\u201d What she didn\u2019t say was, you\u2019ve been waiting two hours for me? \u201cMy day has been extended till seven. I\u2019m sorry you waited so long,\u201d she said softly to him.</p><p>They fell away from the crowd, crossed the street, and headed toward Ulitsa Govorova.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you carrying that?\u201d Tatiana asked, pointing to Alexander\u2019s rifle. \u201cAre you on duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off duty until ten,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been ordered to carry my weapon with me at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not here yet, are they?\u201d Tatiana said, trying to be jovial.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d came his short reply.</p><p>\u201cIs the rifle heavy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He paused and smiled. \u201cWould you like to carry it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s see. I\u2019ve never held a rifle before.\u201d Taking it from him, she was surprised by how heavy it was and how hard it was to hold it with both hands. She carried it for a while and then gave it back to Alexander. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it,\u201d she said. \u201cCarry your weapon and all your other things, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just carry it, Tania, but fire it. And run forward, and fall on the ground, and jump up with it in my hands, with all my other things on my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it.\u201d She wished she could be physically strong like that. Pasha would never beat her at war again.</p><p>The tram came, and they got on. It was crowded. Tatiana gave up her seat to an elderly lady, while Alexander looked as if he never intended to sit down. He held on to the brown overhead strap with one hand and his rifle strap with the other. Tatiana held on to the partially rusted metal handle. Every once in a while the tram would lurch and she would bump into him, and every time she would apologize. His body felt as hard as the Kirov wall.</p><p>Tatiana wanted to sit down with him alone somewhere and ask him about his parents. Certainly she couldn\u2019t ask him on the tram. And was knowing about his parents a good thing? Wouldn\u2019t knowledge about his life just make her feel closer to him, when what she needed was to feel as far away from him as possible?</p><p>Tatiana remained silent as the tram took them to Vosnesensky Prospekt, where they caught tram Number 2 to the Russian Museum.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be going,\u201d Tatiana said \u2014 extremely reluctantly \u2014 after they got off.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sit for a minute?\u201d Alexander suddenly asked. \u201cWe can rest on one of the benches in the Italian Gardens. Want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tatiana said, trying not to skip with joy as she walked in little steps next to him.</p><p>After they sat down, Tatiana could tell that something was weighing heavily on his mind, something he wanted to say and couldn\u2019t. She hoped it wasn\u2019t about Dasha. She thought, aren\u2019t we past that? She wasn\u2019t. But he was older. He should have been.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, what\u2019s that building over there?\u201d she asked, pointing across the street.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s the European Hotel,\u201d Alexander replied. \u201cThat and the Astoria are the best hotels in Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a palace. Who is allowed to stay there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForeigners.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cMy father went to Poland on business once a few years ago, and when he came back, he told us that in his Warsaw hotel Polish people from Krakow were staying! Can you imagine? We didn\u2019t believe him for a week. How could Polish people be staying in a hotel in Warsaw?\u201d She chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s like me staying at the European over there.\u201d</p><p>Alexander looked at her with an amused expression and said, \u201cThere are places where people can actually travel as they please in their own country.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana waved him off. \u201cI guess,\u201d she said. \u201cLike Poland.\u201d She swallowed hard and cleared her throat. \u201cAlexander . . . I\u2019m so sorry about your mother and father.\u201d She touched him gently on the shoulder. \u201cPlease tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>With a suspended breath of relief escaping his mouth, Alexander said, \u201cYour father is right, you know.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019m not from Krasnodar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of a town called Barrington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Where is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMassachusetts.\u201d</p><p>She thought she had misheard. Her eyes became saucers. \u201cMassachusetts?\u201d she gasped. \u201cAs in, as in America?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. As in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re from Massachusetts, America?\u201d Tatiana said, astonished.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>For a full minute, maybe two, Tatiana could not speak. Her heart drummed deafeningly and electrifyingly in her ears. She willed her jaw to stay shut.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just teasing me,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI am not that gullible.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not teasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why I don\u2019t believe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking, who would want to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommunal living was a great disillusionment for us,\u201d Alexander told Tatiana. \u201cWe came here \u2014 my father anyway \u2014 so full of hope, and suddenly there were no showers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Where was the hot water? We couldn\u2019t even take a bath in the residential hotel we were staying at. Do you have hot water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we don\u2019t. We boil water on the stove and add it to the cold water in the bath. Every Saturday we go to the public bathhouse to wash. Like everybody in Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>Alexander nodded. \u201cIn Leningrad, in Moscow, in Kiev, in all of the Soviet Union.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky. In the big cities we actually have running water. In provincial towns they don\u2019t even have that. Deda told me that about Molotov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is right.\u201d Alexander nodded. \u201cBut even in Moscow the toilets flushed sporadically at best; the smell accumulated in the bathrooms. My parents and I, we adjusted somehow. We cooked on firewood and thought we were the Ingalls family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ingalls family lived in the American West in the late eighteen hundreds. Yet here we were, and this was socialist utopia. I said to my father once, with some irony, that he was right, this was much better than Massachusetts. He replied that you didn\u2019t build \u2018socialism in one country\u2019 without a struggle. For a while I think he really believed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn 1930, right after the 1929 stock market crash.\u201d Alexander looked at her blank expression and sighed. \u201cNever mind. I was eleven. Never wanted to leave Barrington in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Tatiana whispered.</p><p>\u201cCooking on a little Primus stove with kerosene got us down. Living in the dark. Living with unclean smells, it blackened our spirits in ways we never imagined. My mother took to drink. Well, why not? Everyone drank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana. Her father drank.</p><p>\u201cAnd after she drank, and the toilet was occupied by other foreigners living in our Moscow palace\u201d \u2014 he paused \u2014 \u201cnot like the European \u2014 my mother would trot to the local park and relieve herself in the public toilets there \u2014 just a hole in the ground for my mother.\u201d He shivered at those words, and Tatiana shivered, too, in the balmy Leningrad evening. Gently she touched Alexander\u2019s shoulder again, and because he didn\u2019t move away, and because they sat canopied under the covering trees, and because there was not another soul around, Tatiana pressed her slender fingers against the fabric of his uniform and did not take them away.</p><p>\u201cOn Saturdays,\u201d Alexander continued, \u201cmy father and I \u2014 like you, your mother, and sister \u2014 would go to the public baths and wait two hours in line to get in. My mother went by herself on Fridays, wishing, I think, that she had given birth to a daughter, so she wouldn\u2019t be all alone, so she wouldn\u2019t suffer over me so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she suffer over you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTremendously. At first I was all right, but as the years went by, I started to blame them for my life. We were living in Moscow at the time. Seventy of us, idealists \u2014 and not just idealists, but idealists with children \u2014 lived as you do, sharing three toilets and three small kitchens on one long floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Tatiana said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like it?\u201d</p><p>She thought. \u201cThere are only twenty-five of us on our floor. But . . . what can I say? I like our dacha in Luga better.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cThe tomatoes are fresh, and the morning air smells so clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Alexander exclaimed, as if she had said the magic word: clean.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d she added, \u201cI like not being on top of other people all the time. Having a little bit of . . .\u201d She trailed off. She couldn\u2019t think of the right word.</p><p>His legs outstretched, Alexander turned a little more to her, looking into her face.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean?\u201d Tatiana said diffidently.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI do, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo should we rejoice that the Germans attacked us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just trading Satan for the devil.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Tatiana said, \u201cDon\u2019t let them catch you talking like that.\u201d But she was youthfully curious. \u201cWhich is Satan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalin. He is marginally more sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and my grandfather,\u201d Tatiana murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat, your grandfather agrees with me?\u201d Alexander smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smiled back. \u201cYou agree with my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, don\u2019t go kidding yourself for a minute. Hitler may be viewed by some people, especially down in the Ukraine, as their deliverer from Stalin, but you\u2019ll see how quickly he will destroy those illusions. The way he destroyed them in Austria and Czechoslovakia and Poland. In any case, after the war is over, whatever the outcome for the world, I have a feeling that here in the Soviet Union we will all go back to the same place.\u201d Alexander struggled with his words. \u201cHave you been . . . protected by your family?\u201d he asked with concern. \u201cFrom the way it has been?\u201d</p><p>Pressing her fingers into his shoulder, Tatiana said, \u201cWe really haven\u2019t had much personal experience with it.\u201d She didn\u2019t like to talk about it. It frightened her a little. \u201cI once heard that someone at Papa\u2019s work was arrested. And a man and his daughter at the apartment vanished a few years ago, and the Sarkovs came to live in their place.\u201d She contemplated her words. Her father maintained that the mordant and heavyset Sarkovs were NKVD informers. \u201cI have been somewhat protected, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not me,\u201d said Alexander, taking out a cigarette and his lighter. \u201cNot at all. And so I cannot turn my mind away from my parents, who came here with such hope and were so crushed by the beliefs they supported almost from birth.\u201d He lit up. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Tatiana said, watching him. She liked his face. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d she asked. \u201cAmerican living must not be that great if an American like your father could forsake his country.\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t speak while he smoked the whole cigarette. \u201cLet me tell you exactly what it was: Communism in America in the twenties \u2014 the Red Decade \u2014 was quite fashionable among the rich.\u201d</p><p>Alexander\u2019s father, Harold Barrington, wanted him to become a member of the Communist youth group, the Young Pioneers of America, in their town when Alexander turned ten. The group had a tiny membership, Harold had said, and they needed strength. Alexander refused. He was already in the Cub Scouts, he told his father. Barrington was a small town in eastern Massachusetts, named after the Barringtons, who had lived there since Benjamin Franklin. Alexander\u2019s progenitor had fought in the Revolutionary War. In the nineteenth century the Barringtons produced four mayors, and three of Alexander\u2019s forebears served and died in the Civil War.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s father wanted to make his own mark on the Barrington clan. He wanted to go his own way. Alexander\u2019s mother, Gina, came from Italy at the turn of the century when she was eighteen to embrace the American way of life, and when she changed her name to Jane and married Harold Barrington at nineteen, she embraced it with her heart. She had left her family in Italy to go her own way, too.</p><p>At first Jane and Harold were radicals, then they were socialist democrats, and then they were Communists. They lived in a country that let them, and they embraced Communism with all their hearts. A modern, progressive woman, Jane Barrington did not want to have children, and Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, said she didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>After eleven years of being a radical with Harold, Jane decided she wanted to have children. It took her five years of miscarriages to have one child \u2014 Alexander \u2014 who was born to her in 1919 when she was thirty-five and Harold thirty-seven.</p><p>Alexander lived and breathed the Communist doctrine from the time he was old enough to understand English. In the comfort of his American home, surrounded by a blazing fire and woolen blankets, Alexander spoke words like \u201cproletariat, equality, manifesto, Leninism,\u201d before he was old enough to know what they meant.</p><p>When he was eleven, his parents decided to live the words they had been speaking. Harold Barrington was constantly getting himself arrested for less-than-peaceful demonstrations on the streets of Boston, and finally he went to the American Civil Liberties Union and asked for their help in seeking voluntary asylum in the USSR. To do it he was willing and ready to renounce his American citizenship and move to the Soviet Union, where he could be one with the people. No social classes. No unemployment. No prejudice. No religion. The Barringtons did not admire the no-religion part, but they were progressive, intellectual people, who were willing and able to put God aside to help build the great Communist experiment.</p><p>Harold and Jane Barrington surrendered their passports, and when they first arrived in Moscow, they were feted and fed as royalty. Only Alexander seemed to notice the smell in the bathrooms, the lack of soap, and the brazenly destitute with rags on their feet who collected outside their restaurant windows, waiting for the dirty dishes to be brought into the kitchen so they could eat the scraps. The drunken squalor in the beer bars to which Harold Barrington took Alexander was so depressing that Alexander finally stopped going. He didn\u2019t care how much he wanted to be with his father.</p><p>At the residential hotel where they were staying, they received special treatment, along with other expatriates from England, Italy, and Belgium.</p><p>Harold and Jane got their new Soviet passports, thereby permanently severing their ties with the United States. As a minor, Alexander would not be getting his Soviet passport until he was sixteen and had to register for the compulsory military service.</p><p>Alexander went to school, learned Russian, made many friends. He was slowly adjusting to his new life when in 1935 the Barringtons were told that they would have to leave their rent-free accommodation and fend for themselves. The Soviet government could no longer keep them. The trouble was, the Barringtons could not find a room for themselves in Moscow. Not a single room in any communal apartment anywhere. They moved to Leningrad and, after weeks of going from one housing committee to another, finally found two rooms in a squalid building on the south side of the Neva. Harold found work at Izhorsk factory. Jane\u2019s drinking increased. Alexander kept his head down and concentrated on school.</p><p>It all ended in May 1936, the month Alexander turned seventeen years old.</p><p>Jane and Harold Barrington were arrested in the least expected way \u2014 but also the most ordinary. One day she did not come home from the market.</p><p>All Harold wanted was somehow to get a message to Alexander, but they had had bitter words and he had not seen the boy in two nights.</p><p>Four days after his wife\u2019s disappearance, there was a soft knock on Harold\u2019s door at three in the morning.</p><p>What Harold did not know was that representatives of the People\u2019s Commissariat of Internal Affairs had already come for Alexander.</p><p>A man named Leonid Slonko was Jane\u2019s interrogator at the Big House. \u201cWhat funny things you say, Comrade Barrington,\u201d he said to her. \u201cHow did I know you were going to say them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never met me before,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met thousands like you.\u201d</p><p>Really, thousands, she wanted to say. Are there really thousands of us coming from the United States?</p><p>\u201cYes, thousands,\u201d confirmed Slonko, as if she\u2019d spoken. \u201cThey all come. To make us better, to live the capitalist-free life. Communism requires a sacrifice, you know that. You must put away your bourgeois aesthetic and look at us as a new reformed Soviet woman and not as an American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have put away my bourgeois aesthetic,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI\u2019ve given away my home, my job, my friends, my entire life. I came here and started a new life because I believed. All you had to do was not betray me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did we do that? Did we do that by feeding you? By clothing you? By giving you a job? A place to live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why am I here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause it is you who have betrayed us,\u201d said Slonko. \u201cWe cannot abide your disillusionment when we are trying to rebuild the human race for the benefit of all mankind. When we are trying to eradicate poverty and misery from this earth.\u201d</p><p>Slonko added, \u201cAnd let me ask you, Comrade Barrington, when you expressed contempt for our country by calling on the U.S. embassy in Moscow a few weeks ago, did you perhaps forget that you have given up your allegiance to the United States by advocating the overthrow of democracy? By being connected with the Popular Front? By giving up your American citizenship? You are not an American citizen. They do not care whether you live or die.\u201d Slonko laughed. \u201cHow silly all of you are. You come here from your countries, decrying their governments, their customs, their ways of life that are repulsive to you. Yet at the first sign of trouble, who is it that you contact?\u201d Slonko slapped the table. \u201cBe assured, comrade, that the American government couldn\u2019t care less about you right now. They\u2019ve forgotten who you are. The file on you and your husband and your son has been sealed by the U.S. Department of Justice and put into a vault. You are ours now.\u201d</p><p>It was true. Jane had gone to the U.S. embassy in Moscow two weeks before her arrest. She had taken the train with Alexander. She must have been followed. The reception she got at the embassy was chilly at best: the Americans had no interest in helping either her or her son.</p><p>\u201cWas I followed?\u201d she asked Slonko.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown that your fealty is a fickle thing. We were right to follow you. We were right not to trust you. Now you will be tried for treason under Article 58 of the Soviet Constitution. You know that, too. You know what\u2019s ahead of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wish it would come quicker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would be the point of that?\u201d Slonko was a big, imposing man of advancing age, but he still looked strong and skilled. \u201cYou understand how you look to the Soviet government. You have broken with the country you were born in, then spat on the country that provided for you and your family. You were doing quite well in America, quite well \u2014 you, the Barringtons of Massachusetts \u2014 until you decided to change your life. You came here. Fine, we said. We were convinced you were all spies. We watched you because we were cautious, not vindictive. We watched you and then we wanted you to stand on your own two feet. We promised you we would take care of you, but for that we needed your undying loyalty. Comrade Stalin expects \u2014 no, requires \u2014 nothing less.</p><p>\u201cYou went to the embassy because you changed your mind about us the way you changed your mind about America. They said, sorry, but we don\u2019t know you. We said, sorry, but we don\u2019t want you. So what\u2019s there for you to do? Where do you go? They won\u2019t have you, we don\u2019t want you. You have shown us you cannot be trusted. Now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow death,\u201d said Jane. \u201cBut I beg you, spare my only son.\u201d She lowered her head. \u201cHe was just a young boy. He never surrendered his U.S. citizenship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe surrendered it when he registered for the Red Army and became a Soviet citizen,\u201d said Slonko.</p><p>\u201cBut the U.S. State Department doesn\u2019t have a subversive file on him. He never joined the Communists there, he is not part of this. I beg you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, comrade,\u201d Slonko said, \u201che is the most dangerous of you all.\u201d</p><p>Jane saw her husband once before appearing in front of a tribunal presided over by Slonko. After a speedy trial, she was put in front of the firing squad, turned blind to the wall.</p><p>Until his arrest Harold Barrington\u2019s concern for Alexander did not outweigh his despair at being caught with his dreams around his ankles.</p><p>He had been in prison before; incarceration did not bother him. Being in prison for his beliefs was a badge of honor, and he had worn that badge proudly in America. \u201cI have sat in some of the best jails in Massachusetts,\u201d Harold used to say. \u201cIn New England no one compares to me in what I endure for my beliefs.\u201d</p><p>The Soviet Union had turned out to be a land of soup kitchens. Communism wasn\u2019t working as well in Russia as everyone hoped because it was Russia. It would work great in America, Harold thought. That was the place for Communism. Harold wanted to bring it back home.</p><p>Home.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe he was still calling it home.</p><p>The Soviet Union was well and good, but it wasn\u2019t his home, and the Soviet Communists knew it. They were done protecting him, no matter how much he had refused to believe it. Now he was the enemy of the people. He understood.</p><p>Harold derided America. He despised America with its shallowness and false morality, he hated the individualist ethic, and he thought the idea of democracy was embraced only by a special kind of idiot. But now that he was sitting in a Soviet concrete cell, Harold wanted to get his boy back to this America, at any cost, at any price.</p><p>The Soviet Union couldn\u2019t save Alexander. Only America could do that.</p><p>What have I done to my son? Harold thought. What have I left behind for him? Harold couldn\u2019t remember what Communism was anymore. All he saw was Alexander\u2019s admiring face as Harold stood on a pulpit in Greenwich, Connecticut, screaming invective on a Saturday afternoon in 1927.</p><p>Who is the boy I call Alexander? If I don\u2019t know, how will he? I found my way, but how will he find his in a country that does not want him?</p><p>All Harold wanted during his year of endless interrogations, denials, pleas, and confusion was to see Alexander once before he died. He called on Slonko\u2019s humanity.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call on my humanity,\u201d Slonko said. \u201cI have none. Also, humanity has nothing to do with Communism, with creating a higher social order. That, comrade, takes discipline, perseverance, and a certain detached attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just detached,\u201d said Harold, \u201cbut severed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour son will not be coming to visit you,\u201d Slonko said. \u201cYour son is dead.\u201d</p><p>Speechless, Tatiana sat next to Alexander as both her hands caressed his arm up and down. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered, wanting desperately to touch his face but unable to bring herself to do so. \u201cAlexander, you hear me? I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you. It\u2019s all right, Tania,\u201d he said, getting up. \u201cMy parents are gone, but I\u2019m still here. That\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>She could not move from the bench. \u201cAlexander, wait, wait. How did you get from \u2018Barrington\u2019 to \u2018Belov?\u2019 And what happened to your father? Did you ever see your parents again?\u201d</p><p>He looked at his watch. \u201cWhat happens to time when I\u2019m with you?\u201d he muttered. \u201cI have to run. We\u2019ll save that for another day.\u201d He gave her his hand to help her up. \u201cA later day.\u201d</p><p>Her heart swelled. There would be another day, then? Slowly they walked out of the park. \u201cHave you told Dasha any of this?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tatiana,\u201d Alexander replied, not looking at her.</p><p>She was treading softly next to him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you told me,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>\u201cYes, me, too,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cPromise you\u2019ll tell me the rest someday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday I\u2019ll make that promise.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re from America, Alexander. That\u2019s definitely a first for me.\u201d She blushed when she said it.</p><p>He bent and kissed her gently on the cheek. His lips were warm and his stubble prickly. \u201cBe careful walking home,\u201d Alexander said after her. Her heart aching, Tatiana nodded, watching him walk away with a feeling that resembled despair.</p><p>What if he turned around and saw her? How silly she must look standing there staring at him. Before she could think another thought, Alexander turned around. Caught, she tried to move, her slow legs betraying her confusion. He saluted her. What must he think, seeing me gaping at him as he walks away. She wished she had more guile and made a vow to herself to get some. And then she raised her hand and saluted him back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>4</p><p>At home Dasha was on the roof. Each building had already designated their air-raid workers, first clearing debris from the attics, then taking shifts on the roofs, watching for German planes.</p><p>Dasha was sitting down on the tar roofing paper, smoking a cigarette and talking loudly with the two youngest Iglenko brothers, Anton and Kirill. Near them were buckets of water and heavy bags of sand. Tatiana wanted to sit next to her sister but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Dasha got up and said, \u201cListen, I\u2019m off. Will you be all right here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, Dasha. Anton will protect me.\u201d Anton was Tatiana\u2019s closest friend.</p><p>Dasha touched her sister\u2019s hair. \u201cDon\u2019t stay up here too long. Are you tired? You\u2019re home so late. We knew Kirov would be too far for you. Why don\u2019t you get a job with Papa? You\u2019ll be home in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dash. I\u2019m fine.\u201d She smiled as if to prove it.</p><p>After Dasha left, Anton Iglenko tried to jolly Tatiana out of her mood, but she didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone. She just wanted to think for a minute, for an hour, for a year. Tatiana needed to think herself out of what she was feeling.</p><p>Finally she relented and played the dizzy geography game. She put her hands over her eyes while Anton spun her around, stopping her suddenly, and she had to point in the direction of Finland. In the direction of Krasnodar. Which way the Urals? Which way America?</p> <p>Then Tatiana spun Anton.</p><p>They named as many geographical locations as they could think of, and when they were done, they counted up their correct points. As the winner, Tatiana got to jump up and down.</p><p>Tonight Tatiana did not jump up and down. She sat down heavily on the roof. All she could think about was Alexander and America.</p><p>Anton, a scrawny blond boy, said, \u201cDon\u2019t look so glum. It\u2019s all exciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes. In two years, I\u2019ll be able to join. Petka left yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeft yesterday for where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the front.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t notice, Tania, there\u2019s a war on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed, all right,\u201d said Tatiana, shaking a little. \u201cHave you heard from Volodya?\u201d Volodya was with Pasha in Tolmachevo.</p><p>\u201cNo. Kirill and I wish we could have gone. Kirill can\u2019t wait to turn seventeen. He says the army will take him at seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe army will take him at seventeen,\u201d said Tatiana, getting up.</p><p>\u201cTania, will somebody take you at seventeen?\u201d Anton smiled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Anton,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Tell your mother I have some chocolate for her if she wants. Tell her to come by tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana went downstairs. Her grandparents were reading quietly on the couch. The small lamp was on. She squeezed in snugly between them, almost on both their laps.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, dear?\u201d said her grandfather. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeda, I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI\u2019m just very, very confused.\u201d And I have no one to talk to, she thought.</p><p>\u201cAbout the war?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana considered. Telling them was out of the question. Instead, she asked, \u201cDeda, you always said to me, \u2018Tania, there is so much still ahead of you. Be patient with life.\u2019 Do you still feel that way?\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather didn\u2019t reply at first, and she felt she had her answer. \u201cOh, Deda,\u201d she mouthed plaintively.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania,\u201d he said, putting his protective arm around her while her grandmother patted her knee. \u201cThings have changed overnight in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does seem that way,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should be less patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI think patience is overrated as a virtue anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut be no less moral,\u201d said Deda. \u201cNo less righteous. Remember the three questions I told you to ask yourself to know who you are.\u201d</p><p>She wished Deda wouldn\u2019t remind her. She had no interest in asking herself those questions tonight. \u201cDeda, in this family we leave the righteousness to you,\u201d Tatiana said, smiling weakly. \u201cThere is nothing left for the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>His head of thick gray hair shaking, her grandfather said, \u201cTania, that\u2019s all that\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>In her bed Tatiana lay quietly and thought about Alexander. She thought about him not just telling her about his life but drowning her in it, the way he himself was drowned in it. As she listened to him, Tatiana had stopped breathing, her mouth remaining slightly open, so that Alexander could breathe his sorrow \u2014 from his words, from his own breath \u2014 into her lungs. He needed someone to bear the weight of his life.</p><p>Needed her.</p><p>Tatiana hoped she was ready.</p><p>She could not think about Dasha. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>5</p><p>On the way to Kirov on Wednesday morning, Tatiana saw firemen building new water storage basins and installing what looked like fire hydrants. Was Leningrad expecting that many more fires? she wondered. Were the German bombs going to incinerate the city? She could not imagine it. It was as unimaginable as America.</p><p>In the distance the great Smolny Cathedral and Monastery was beginning to take on an unrecognizable shape and form. Camouflage nets were being draped over it by workers, who were dousing the nets in green, brown, and gray paint. What were the workers to do with the harder-to-cover \u2014 though also harder to spot from the air \u2014 spires of Peter and Paul\u2019s Cathedral and the Admiralty? For the time being they remained in full luminescent view.</p><p>Before she left work, Tatiana scrubbed her hands and face until they glistened, then stood in front of the mirror next to her locker and thoroughly brushed out her hair, leaving it long and down. This morning she had put on a wraparound floral print skirt and a blue blouse with short sleeves and white buttons. As she checked herself in the mirror, she couldn\u2019t decide \u2014 did she look twelve or thirteen? Whose kid sister was she? Oh, yes, Dasha\u2019s. Please be waiting for me, she thought before rushing out.</p> <p>She hurried to the bus stop, and there was Alexander, his cap in his hands, waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cI like your hair, Tania,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t smell like I worked with petroleum all day. Petroleum and grease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d he said, rolling his eyes. \u201cYou weren\u2019t making bombs again?\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p> <p>They looked at the sulky, overworked crowd waiting for the bus and then at each other and together said, \u201cTram?\u201d and nodded, crossing the street.</p><p>\u201cAt least we\u2019re still working,\u201d Tatiana said lightly. \u201cPravda says things are not so good with work in your America these days. Full employment here in the Soviet Union, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander said, leaning into her as they walked. \u201cThere is no unemployment in the Soviet Union or in the Dartmoor jail \u2014 and for the same reason.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Tatiana wanted to call him a subversive but didn\u2019t.</p><p>While they waited for the tram, Alexander said, \u201cI brought you something.\u201d He handed her a package wrapped in brown paper. \u201cI know Monday was your birthday. But I didn\u2019t have a chance before today . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Sincerely surprised, she took the package from him. A small lump came up in her throat.</p> <p>Lowering his voice, he said, \u201cIn America we have a custom. When you\u2019re given presents for your birthday, you\u2019re supposed to open them and say thank you.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana nervously looked down at the present. \u201cThank you.\u201d Gifts were not something she was used to. Wrapped gifts? Unheard of, even when they came wrapped only in plain brown paper.</p><p>\u201cNo. Open first. Then say thank you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWhat do I do? Do I take the paper off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You tear it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you throw it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole present or just the paper?\u201d</p> <p>Slowly he said, \u201cJust the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wrapped it so nicely. Why would I throw it away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s just paper, why did you wrap it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please open my present?\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Eagerly Tatiana tore open the paper. Inside were three books \u2014 one hefty hardcover collection by Aleksandr Pushkin called The Bronze Horseman and Other Poems, and two smaller books, one by a man she\u2019d never heard of, named John Stuart Mill; the book was called On Liberty. It was in English. The last one was an English-Russian dictionary.</p><p>\u201cEnglish-Russian?\u201d Tatiana said, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s less helpful than you might think. I speak no English. Was this yours from when you came here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd without it you won\u2019t be able to read Mill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for all of them,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe Bronze Horseman book was my mother\u2019s,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cShe gave it to me a few weeks before they came for her.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cI love Pushkin.\u201d Very quietly.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might. All Russians do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what the poet Maikov wrote about Pushkin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>Flustered by his eyes, Tatiana tried to remember the lines. \u201cHe said . . . let\u2019s see . . . His sounds do not seem made in this world\u2019s fashion . . . as if pervaded with his deathless leaven . . . All earthly stuff \u2014 emotions, anguish, passion \u2014 had been transmuted to the stuff of heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll earthly stuff \u2014 emotions, anguish, passion \u2014 had been transmuted to the stuff of heaven,\u201d Alexander repeated.</p><p>Tatiana turned red and looked down the street. Where was that tram? \u201cHave you ever read Pushkin yourself?\u201d she asked in a tiny voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have read Pushkin myself,\u201d Alexander replied, taking the wrapping paper out of her hands and throwing it away. \u201c \u2018The Bronze Horseman\u2019 is my favorite poem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too!\u201d echoed Tatiana, looking up at him wondrously. \u201cThere was a time, our memories keep its horrors fresh and near us, of this a tale now suffer me, to tell before you gentle readers, a grievous story it will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, you quote from Pushkin like a true Russian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a true Russian.\u201d</p><p>Their tram arrived.</p><p>At the Russian Museum, Alexander asked, \u201cWould you like to walk a bit?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t say no even if she wanted to.</p><p>Even if she wanted to.</p><p>They walked toward the Field of Mars.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever work?\u201d she asked him. \u201cDimitri is off on missions in Karelia \u2014 don\u2019t you need to do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I stay behind,\u201d Alexander said with a grin, \u201cand teach the rest of the soldiers how to play poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an American card game. Someday maybe I\u2019ll teach you how to play. Also, I\u2019ve been deputized as the officer in charge of all recruitment and training of the People\u2019s Volunteer Army. I\u2019m on duty from seven until six. I do sentry duty every other evening from ten to midnight.\u201d He paused.</p><p>Tatiana knew. That must be when Dasha went to see him.</p><p>Alexander quickly continued. \u201cFor all this I get my weekends off. I don\u2019t know how long that\u2019s going to last. I suspect not long. I\u2019m here with the Leningrad garrison to protect the city. That\u2019s my post. When we run out of men at the front, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll send me.\u201d</p><p>But then we would run out of you, she thought. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Letniy Sad \u2014 the Summer Garden. But wait.\u201d Alexander stopped not far from his barracks. Across the street, lining the Field of Mars, were some benches. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit, and I\u2019ll go and get us some dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for your birthday. We\u2019ll have a birthday dinner.\u201d He offered to bring her some bread and meat. \u201cMaybe I can even find some caviar.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAs a true Russian, Tania, you like caviar, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat about matches?\u201d she asked, trying not to sound too teasing, unsure how he would like it. \u201cAren\u2019t I going to perhaps need some matches?\u201d Remembering the Voentorg store.</p><p>\u201cIf you need to light something, we will light it on the eternal flame in the Field of Mars. We walked past it last Sunday, remember?\u201d</p><p>She remembered. \u201cCan\u2019t touch that bold Bolshevik flame,\u201d she said, stepping away. \u201cThat\u2019s nearly sacrilegious.\u201d</p><p>Alexander laughed. \u201cSometimes we cook shish kebabs on it on our nights off. Is that sacrilegious? Besides, I thought there was no God.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana gazed up at him, but not for long. Was he teasing her? \u201cThat\u2019s right. There is no God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in Communist Russia. We\u2019re all atheists.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana remembered a joke. \u201cComrade One says to Comrade Two, \u2018How is the potato crop this year?\u2019 Comrade Two replies, \u2018Very good, very good. With God\u2019s help the crop will reach all the way to His feet.\u2019 Comrade One says, \u2018Comrade! What are you saying? You know the Party says there is no God.\u2019 Comrade Two says, \u2018There\u2019s no potatoes either.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Alexander laughed. \u201cYou are so right about the potatoes. There aren\u2019t any. Now, go on,\u201d he said. \u201cWait on the bench for me. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She walked across the street and sank down onto the bench. She smoothed out her hair, stuck her hand into her canvas bag, caressed the books he had given her, and was awash with\u2014</p><p>What was she doing? She was so tired, she wasn\u2019t thinking. Alexander should not be here with her.</p><p>He should be here with Dasha. I know that for a fact, Tatiana thought, because if Dasha asks me where I\u2019ve been, I won\u2019t be able to tell her. Standing up, Tatiana began to walk away when she heard Alexander calling her. \u201cTania!\u201d</p><p>He came up, out of breath, carrying two paper bags. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to say anything. He saw her face.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Alexander said amiably, \u201cI promise, I will just feed you and send you home. Let me feed you, all right?\u201d Holding the bags in one hand, he placed the other hand on her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s for your birthday. Come on.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go, and she knew it. Did Alexander know it, too? That was even worse. Did he know what a bind she found herself in, what unspeakable flux of feeling and confusion?</p><p>They crossed the Field of Mars on their way to the Summer Garden. Down the street the river Neva glowed in the sunlight, though it was nearly nine o\u2019clock in the evening.</p><p>The Summer Garden was the wrong place for them.</p><p>Alexander and Tatiana couldn\u2019t find an empty bench amid the long paths, the Greek statues, the towering elms, and the intertwined lovers, like tangled rose branches all.</p><p>As they walked, her head was lowered.</p><p>They finally found a spot near the statue of Saturn. It was not the ideal place for them to sit, Tatiana thought, since Saturn\u2019s mouth was wide open and he was stuffing a child into it with derelict zeal.</p><p>Alexander had brought a little vodka and some bologna ham and some white bread. He had also brought a jar of black caviar and a bar of chocolate. Tatiana was quite hungry. Alexander told her to have all the caviar. She protested at first, but not vigorously. After she had eaten more than half, scooping the caviar out with the small spoon he had brought, she handed him the rest. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said, \u201cfinish it. I insist.\u201d</p><p>She had a gulp of vodka straight from the bottle and shuddered involuntarily; she hated vodka but didn\u2019t want him to know what a baby she was. Alexander laughed at her shuddering, taking the bottle from her and having a swig. \u201cListen, you don\u2019t have to drink it. I brought it to celebrate your birthday. Forgot the glasses, though.\u201d</p><p>He was spread out all over the bench and sitting conspicuously close. If she breathed, a part of her would touch a part of him. Tatiana was too overwhelmed to speak, as her intense feelings dropped into the brightly lit well inside her.</p><p>\u201cTania?\u201d Alexander asked gently. \u201cTania, is the food all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, fine.\u201d After a small throat clearing, she said, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s very nice, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want some more vodka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She avoided his smiling eye as best she could when he asked her, \u201cHave you ever had too much vodka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She nodded, still not looking up. \u201cI was two. Gulped down half a liter or something. Had to be taken to the children\u2019s ward of Grechesky Hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo? Not since?\u201d His leg accidentally touched hers.</p><p>Tatiana blushed. \u201cNo, not since.\u201d She moved her leg and changed the subject to the Germans. She heard him sigh, then talk a little about what was happening at the garrison. But when Alexander was the only one talking, Tatiana was able to gaze at him, her eyes roaming around his face. She noticed his dark stubble, and she wanted to ask him if he was ever clean-shaven but decided it was too forward and didn\u2019t. The stubble was most pronounced around his mouth, where the black frame of the facial hair made his lips more vivid. She wanted to ask him about his slightly chipped side tooth but didn\u2019t do that either. She wanted to ask him to put away that soft, smiling look in his ice cream eyes.</p><p>She wanted to smile back.</p><p>\u201cSo, Alexander . . . do you still speak English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I speak English. I don\u2019t get to practice. I haven\u2019t spoken it since my mother and father\u2014\u201d He broke off.</p><p>With a shake of her head, Tatiana said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to \u2014 I only wanted to know if you knew any words you could teach me in English.\u201d</p><p>Alexander\u2019s eyes gleamed so brightly that Tatiana felt as if all the blood in her body had rushed to her cheeks. \u201cTania, what words,\u201d he asked slowly, \u201cwould you like me to teach you in English?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t answer him, afraid she would stammer. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she finally managed. \u201cHow about vodka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s vodka.\u201d And laughed.</p><p>Alexander had a good laugh. A sincere, chortling, deep, male laugh, starting in his chest and infectiously ending in hers. Picking up the vodka bottle, he unscrewed the cap. \u201cWhat should our toast be to?\u201d he asked, raising the bottle. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday \u2014 we will drink to you. Here\u2019s to next year\u2019s birthday. Salut. I hope it\u2019s a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll drink a sip to that,\u201d she said, taking the bottle from him. \u201cI like to celebrate my birthday with Pasha by my side.\u201d</p><p>Not responding to her comment, Alexander put the vodka away, looking at Saturn. \u201cAnother statue would have been better, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy food is getting stuck in my throat, watching Saturn devour one of his own children whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else would you have liked to sit?\u201d asked Tatiana, sucking on a small piece of chocolate.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe near Mark Antony over there.\u201d He looked around. \u201cYou think there is a statue of Aphro\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we go?\u201d Tatiana said, suddenly rising. \u201cI need to walk off all this food.\u201d What was she doing here?</p><p>But as they strolled out of the park and to the river, Tatiana wanted to ask if he was ever called something other than Alexander. It was an inappropriate question, and she didn\u2019t ask. A walk along the granite embankment on a vanishing evening would just have to be good enough. She could not also ask what endearing, affectionate name Alexander liked to be called by.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sit?\u201d Alexander asked after a while.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Tatiana replied. \u201cUnless you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s sit.\u201d</p><p>They sat on one of the benches overlooking the Neva. Across the river was the golden spire of Peter and Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Alexander took up nearly half the seat, his long legs spread apart, his arms draped on the back of the bench. Tatiana gingerly perched down, careful not to let her leg touch his.</p><p>Alexander had a casual, unconcerned ease about himself. He moved, sat, rested, and draped as if he were completely unaware of the effect he was having on a timorous girl of barely seventeen. All his confident limbs projected a sanguine belief in his own place in the universe. This was all given to me, he seemed to say. My body, my face, my height, my strength. I did not ask for it, I did not make it, I did not build it. I did not fight for it. This is a gift, for which I say my daily thanks as I wash and comb my hair, a gift I do not abuse or think of again as I go through my day. I am not proud of it, nor am I humbled by it. It does not make me arrogant or vain, but neither does it make me falsely modest or meek.</p><p>I know what I am, Alexander said with every movement of his body.</p><p>Tatiana had forgotten to breathe. Taking a breath now, she turned to the Neva.</p><p>\u201cI love looking at this river,\u201d Alexander said quietly. \u201cEspecially during the white nights. We have nothing like this in America, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe in Alaska?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this \u2014 the river gleaming, the city around its banks, the sun setting behind Leningrad University on the left, and rising in front of us on Peter and Paul\u2019s . . .\u201d Shaking his head, he stopped talking. They sat silently.</p><p>\u201cHow did Pushkin put it in \u2018The Bronze Horseman\u2019?\u201d Alexander asked her. \u201cAnd rather than let darkness smother . . . the lustrous heaven\u2019s golden light . . .\u201d He broke off. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the rest.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana knew \u201cThe Bronze Horseman\u201d practically by heart. She continued for him, \u201cOne twilight glow speeds on the other . . . to grant but half an hour to night.\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned his head to look at Tatiana, who continued to look at the river.</p><p>\u201cTania . . . where did you get all those freckles?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI know, they\u2019re so annoying. It\u2019s the sun,\u201d she replied, blushing and touching her face as if wanting to scrub off the freckles that covered the bridge of her nose and spread in sprinkles under her eyes. Please stop looking at me, she thought, afraid of his eyes and terrified of her own heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your blonde hair?\u201d he continued, just as softly. \u201cIs that the sun, too?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana became acutely aware of his arm behind her on the bench. If he wanted to, he could move his hand a few centimeters and touch the hair that fell down her back. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhite nights are something, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he said, not taking his gaze off her.</p><p>She muttered, \u201cWe make up for them with the Leningrad winter, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, winter is not much fun around here.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cSometimes in the winter, when the Neva freezes, we go sledding on the ice. Even in the dark. Under the fleeting northern lights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPasha, me, our friends. Sometimes me and Dasha. But she\u2019s much older. I don\u2019t tag along with her too much.\u201d Why did she say that about Dasha\u2019s being much older? Was she trying to be mean? Shut up already, Tatiana said to herself.</p><p>\u201cYou must love her very much,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>What did he mean by that? She would rather not know.</p><p>\u201cAre you as close to her as you are to Pasha?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDifferent. Pasha and I\u2014\u201d Tatiana broke off. She and Pasha ate out of the same bowl together. Dasha prepared and served them that bowl. \u201cMy sister and I share a bed. She tells me I can never get married because she doesn\u2019t want my husband sleeping in bed with us.\u201d</p><p>Their stares locked. Tatiana could not look away. She hoped he didn\u2019t notice her crimson color in the golden sunlight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too young to get married,\u201d Alexander said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Tatiana said, as always a little defensive about her age. \u201cBut I\u2019m not too young.\u201d</p><p>Too young for what? Tatiana wondered, and no sooner had she wondered than in a measured voice Alexander said, \u201cToo young for what?\u201d</p><p>The expression in his eyes was just too much for her. Too much on the Neva, too much in the Summer Garden, too much.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. What would Dasha say? What would a grown-up say?</p><p>\u201cNot too young to serve in the People\u2019s Volunteers,\u201d she finally said. \u201cMaybe I can join? And you could train me?\u201d She laughed and then lost herself in her embarrassment.</p><p>Unsmiling, Alexander flinched a little but said, \u201cYou are too young for even the People\u2019s Volunteers. They won\u2019t take you until\u2014\u201d He did not finish. And she felt his unfinished sentence but couldn\u2019t grasp the meaning of the hesitation in his voice, nor of the palpitations of his lips. There was an indentation in the middle of his bottom lip, almost like a soft nesting crevice\u2014</p><p>Suddenly Tatiana could not look at Alexander\u2019s lips for a second longer while the two of them sat by the river in the sunlit night. She shot up from the bench. \u201cI\u2019d better be heading home. It\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Alexander said, also standing, much more slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s such a nice evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she quietly agreed without looking at him. They started to walk along the river.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, your America, do you miss it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you ever go back if you could?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d he replied evenly.</p><p>\u201cCould you?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cHow would I get there? Who would let me? What claim do I have on my American name?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana had an urge to take his hand, to touch him, to ease him somehow. \u201cTell me something about America,\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you ever see an ocean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the Atlantic, and it\u2019s quite something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it salty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and cold and immense, and it\u2019s got jellyfish and white sailboats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a jellyfish once. What color is the Atlantic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen like the trees?\u201d</p><p>He looked around, at the Neva, at the trees, at her. \u201cGreen a little bit like the color of your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo kind of muddy, murky green?\u201d Emotion was pressing hard on her chest, making it difficult for her to breathe. I don\u2019t need to breathe now, she thought. I\u2019ve breathed all my life.</p><p>Alexander suggested walking back through the Summer Garden.</p><p>Tatiana agreed but then remembered the sinuous lovers. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t. Is there a quicker way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The tall elms cast long shadows as the sun fell behind them.</p><p>They walked through the gate and down the narrow path between the statues.</p><p>\u201cThe park looks different at night,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been here at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted, quickly adding, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been out at night in other places. Once I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alexander leaned in to her. \u201cTania, you want to know something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, leaning away.</p><p>\u201cThe less you\u2019ve been out at night, the better I like it.\u201d</p><p>Speechless, she staggered ahead, looking at her feet.</p><p>He walked alongside, narrowing his soldier\u2019s stride to stay by her. It was a warm night; her bare arms twice touched the rough material of his army shirt.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best time, Tatiana,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cDo you want to know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will never be a time like this again. Never this simple, this uncomplicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call this uncomplicated?\u201d Tatiana shook her head.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Alexander paused. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends, walking through Leningrad in the lucent dusk.\u201d</p><p>They stopped at the Fontanka Bridge. \u201cI\u2019ve got duty at ten,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019d walk you home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m going to be fine. Don\u2019t worry. Thank you for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Looking into Alexander\u2019s face was not possible. Her saving grace was her height. Tatiana stared at his uniform buttons. She was not afraid of them.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cSo tell me,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhat do they call you when they want to call you something other than Tania or Tatiana?\u201d</p><p>Her heart jumped. \u201cWho\u2019s they?\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing for what seemed like minutes.</p><p>Tatiana backed away from him, and when she was five meters away, she looked at his face. All she wanted to do was look into his wonderful face. \u201cSometimes,\u201d she said, \u201cthey call me Tatia.\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>The silences tormented her. What to do during them?</p><p>\u201cYou are very beautiful, Tatia,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she said \u2014 inaudibly \u2014 as sensation left her legs.</p><p>He called after her, \u201cIf you wanted to, you could call me Shura.\u201d</p><p>Shura! That\u2019s a marvelous endearment. I would love to call you Shura, she wanted to tell him. \u201cWho calls you Shura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody,\u201d Alexander replied with a salute.</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t just walk home. She flew. She grew brilliant red wings, and on them she sailed through the azure Leningrad sky. Closer to home, her heavy-with-guilt heart brought her down and the wings disappeared. She tied up her hair and made sure his books were at the very bottom of her bag. But she couldn\u2019t go upstairs for a number of minutes as she stood against the wall of the building, clenching both fists to her chest.</p><p>Dasha was sitting at the dining table with \u2014 surprisingly \u2014 Dimitri.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you for three hours,\u201d said Dasha petulantly. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wondered if they could smell Alexander walking next to her through Leningrad. Did she smell of fragrant summer jasmine, of the warm sun on her bare forearms, of the vodka, of the caviar, of the chocolate? Could they see the extra freckles on the bridge of her nose? I\u2019ve been walking under the lights of the North Pole. I\u2019ve been walking and warming my face with the northern sun. Could they see it all in her exquisitely anguished eyes?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been waiting. I work too late these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Dasha asked. \u201cBabushka made cutlets and mashed potatoes. You must be starved. Have some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry. I\u2019m tired. Dima, will you excuse me?\u201d said Tatiana, going to wash.</p><p>Dimitri stayed for another two hours. The grandparents wanted their room back at eleven, so Dimitri and Dasha and Tatiana went out onto the roof and sat until dusk fell after midnight, talking in the waning light. Tatiana couldn\u2019t talk much. Dimitri was friendly and light on the tongue. He showed the girls blisters on his hands from digging trenches for two straight days. Tatiana would feel him glancing at her, seeking eye contact and smiling when he got it.</p><p>Dasha, said, \u201cSo tell me, Dima, are you very close to Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Alexander and I go back a very long way,\u201d replied Dimitri. \u201cWe are like brothers.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana, through her haze, blinked twice as her brain tried to focus on Dimitri\u2019s words.</p><p>Dear God, Tatiana prayed in bed that night, turning to the wall and pulling the white sheet and the thin brown blanket over herself. If You are there somewhere, please teach me how to hide what I never knew how to show. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>6</p><p>All Thursday long, as she worked on the flamethrowers, Tatiana thought about Alexander. And after work he was waiting for her. Tonight she didn\u2019t ask why he had come. And he didn\u2019t explain. He had no presents and no questions. He just came. They barely spoke; just their arms banged against each other, and once when the tram screeched to a stop, Tatiana fell into him, and he, his body unmoving, straightened her by placing his hand around her waist.</p><p>\u201cDasha talked me into coming by tonight,\u201d he said quietly to Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Of course. My parents will be glad to see you again. They were in a great mood this morning,\u201d she continued. \u201cYesterday Mama got through to Pasha on the telephone, and apparently he is doing great\u2014\u201d She stopped talking. Suddenly she felt too sad to continue.</p> <p>They walked as slowly as they could to tram Number 16 and stood silently, their arms pressed against each other, until it stopped at Grechesky Hospital.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you, Lieutenant.\u201d She wanted to say Shura but could not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you, Tatia,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Later that night was the first time the four of them met at Fifth Soviet and all went out for a walk together. They bought ice cream, a milk shake, and a beer, and Dasha clung to Alexander\u2019s arm like a barnacle. Tatiana maintained a polite distance from Dimitri, using every faculty in her meager possession of faculties not to watch Dasha clinging to Alexander. Tatiana was surprised at how profoundly unpleasant she found it to look at her sister touching him. Dasha going to see him in some nebulous, unimagined, unexplored Leningrad, unseen by Tatiana\u2019s eyes, was infinitely preferable.</p><p>Alexander seemed as casual and content as any soldier would be with someone like Dasha on his arm. He barely glanced at Tatiana. How did Dasha and Alexander look together? Did they look right? Did they look more right than she and Alexander? She had no answers. She didn\u2019t know how she looked when she was close to Alexander. She knew only how she was when she was close to Alexander.</p> <p>\u201cTania!\u201d Dimitri was talking to her.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dima, what?\u201d Why did he raise his voice?</p><p>\u201cTania, I was saying don\u2019t you think Alexander should transfer me from the rifle guard division to somewhere else? Maybe with him to the motorized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. Is that possible? Don\u2019t you have to know how to drive a tank or something in the motorized?\u201d</p><p>Alexander smiled. Dimitri said nothing.</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d exclaimed Dasha. \u201cWhat do you know about what you have to do in the motorized? Be quiet. Alex, are you going to be storming rivers and charging at the enemy?\u201d She giggled.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cFirst Alexander sends me. To make sure it\u2019s safe. Then he goes himself. And gets another promotion. Right, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, Dima,\u201d Alexander said, walking beside him. \u201cThough sometimes when I go myself, I also take you.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana could barely listen. Why was Dasha walking so close to him? And how could he go himself and take Dimitri with him? What did that mean?</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cTania, are you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said. Why does he keep raising his voice?</p><p>\u201cYou seem distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. It\u2019s a nice evening, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take my arm? You look like you\u2019re ready to fall down.\u201d</p> <p>Carelessly glancing at Tatiana, Dasha said, \u201cWatch out, or any minute she is going to faint.\u201d</p><p>That night when Tatiana got into bed, she pulled the blanket over her head, pretending to be asleep even when Dasha lay down next to her and whispered, \u201cTania, Tania, are you sleeping? Tania?\u201d and nudged her lightly. Tatiana didn\u2019t want to talk to Dasha in the dark, divulging confidences. She just wanted to say his name once out loud. Shura. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>7</p><p>Friday at work Tatiana noticed that hardly anyone worthwhile was left at Kirov. Only the very young, like her, and the very old. The few men that remained were all over sixty or in management positions, or both.</p><p>In the first five days of war there had been suspiciously little news from the front. The radio announcers lauded wide-scale Soviet victories, while saying nothing at all of the German military power, nothing at all of the German position in the Soviet Union, nothing at all of danger to Leningrad or of evacuation. The radio was on all day as Tatiana filled her flamethrowers with thick petroleum and nitrocellulose, while through the open double doors the metal machine poured projectiles of different sizes onto the conveyor belt.</p><p>She heard clink, clink, clink from the metal rounds like the passing of seconds, and there were many seconds in her long day, and all she heard during them was clink, clink, clink.</p> <p>And all Tatiana thought about was seven o\u2019clock.</p><p>During lunch she heard on the radio that rationing might start next week. Also during lunch Krasenko told his waning staff that probably by Monday they were going to start military exercises, and that the working day was going to be extended until eight in the evening.</p><p>Before she left, Tatiana scrubbed her hands for ten minutes to get the petroleum smell out and failed. As she hurried out of the factory doors with Zina and made her way down the Kirov wall, she wanted to tell someone of her ambivalence and distress.</p><p>But then she saw Alexander\u2019s officer\u2019s cap tilted to the side, and she saw him take the cap off his head and hold it in his hands as he waited for her to walk up to him, and Tatiana forgot everything. She had to keep herself from breaking into a run. They crossed the street and made their way to Ulitsa Govorova.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk a bit.\u201d Tatiana couldn\u2019t believe it was she who uttered those words after her day. But she didn\u2019t feel her day. She knew she wasn\u2019t going to have a minute with him on the weekend.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a bit?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cLet\u2019s walk all the way.\u201d</p><p>Slowly they strolled through the nearly deserted streets, anonymous to everyone. The railroad tracks and farm fields lay to their right, the industrial buildings of the Kirov borough rose to their left. There were no air-raid sirens, no planes flying overhead, just the pale sun shining. There were no other people.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, why isn\u2019t Dima an officer like you?\u201d</p><p>Alexander paused for a few moments. \u201cHe wanted to be an officer. We entered Officer Candidate School together.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t know that. She told him Dimitri had not said a word about it.</p> <p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t. We went in together, thinking we were going to stay together, but unfortunately Dima didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened. He couldn\u2019t stay underwater long enough without panicking, couldn\u2019t hold his breath, couldn\u2019t be quiet enough under false fire, didn\u2019t keep his cool, lost his nerve, his time in the five-mile wasn\u2019t good enough. Couldn\u2019t do fifty push-ups in a row. He just didn\u2019t make it. On many levels. He is a good soldier. A pretty good soldier,\u201d Alexander amended. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t cut out to be an officer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like you,\u201d said Tatiana, taking an excited breath on the you.</p><p>With amusement Alexander glanced at her and shook his head. \u201cI,\u201d he said, \u201cam too angry a fighter.\u201d</p><p>The tram stopped right in front of them. Reluctantly they climbed aboard.</p><p>\u201cHow does Dimitri feel about it all?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana had stopped trying to avoid Alexander as the tram bumped them together. She lived for that bumping now. Every time the tram moved, she moved with it in Alexander\u2019s direction, barely holding on to the handle. And he stood there like an inverted pyramid, catching her waist with his arm. Tonight, as he caught her, his hand remained around her. He motioned her to continue talking. But she couldn\u2019t until he took his hand away.</p> <p>He took his hand away. \u201cAbout what? Not becoming an officer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. About you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout how you\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>The tram stopped. To steady her, Alexander took hold of Tatiana\u2019s upper arm. Goose bumps broke out all over her body. Letting her go, he continued. \u201cI think Dimitri often feels that things come too easily to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d Tatiana asked bravely.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Things in general. The army, the shooting range . . .\u201d He stopped.</p><p>She looked at him, waiting. What was he going to say next? What else came too easily to Alexander?</p><p>\u201cNothing comes easily to you, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana said at last. \u201cYou\u2019ve had the hardest life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it has barely begun,\u201d he said. But when he spoke again, Tatiana detected a forced mildness. \u201cListen, Dimitri and I have a long history together. If I know Dima, in due course he will tell you things about me that you will not want to believe. I\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings that are true or things that are complete lies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot answer that,\u201d Alexander replied. \u201cSome will be true, some will be complete lies. Dimitri\u2019s got a gift, if you will, for mixing lies with just enough of the truth to drive you crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome gift,\u201d she said. \u201cSo how will I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. It will all sound true.\u201d Alexander glanced at her. \u201cIf you want to know the truth, ask me and I will tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ask, you\u2019ll tell me the truth about anything?\u201d She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana held her breath because for a moment her heart had stopped beating. It stopped as she bit her lip to keep the question off her tongue. Do you love me? she wanted to ask him. She wanted to slap herself into a terror that would paralyze her and make even thinking that impossible, but she could not. He wanted a question? That was the question yelling through her closed teeth and her silence and her breathless heart.</p><p>\u201cYou have a question for me, Tania?\u201d he asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, looking down at the metal handle and at the gray head of the woman in front of her.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Alexander said, as they got off at Obvodnoy Canal. They didn\u2019t take their second tram as usual. They ambled the five kilometers back home.</p><p>They passed an iron gate with a door behind it. The gate and the door did not look like an entryway to a building, but as if they had been built and now led to nowhere. Pointing, Alexander said, \u201cThose gates, those doors, they can all be listening, now, yesterday, tomorrow, to you at Kirov, lying with a glass to the wall on the other side of your bed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re kidding. My grandparents are on the other side of my bed. You\u2019re not saying they\u2019re informers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is . . . no one at all can be trusted. And no one is safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one?\u201d Tatiana asked teasingly, looking at him. \u201cNot even you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be trusted or is not safe?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>He smiled back. \u201cIs not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re an officer in the Red Army!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes? Tell that to the officers in the Red Army in 1937 and 1938. They were all shot. Which is why now no one wants to take responsibility for this war.\u201d</p><p>Silently she sidled up to him and finally asked, \u201cAm I safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d he whispered, leaning close to her ear, \u201cwe are followed, always, everywhere. The day might come when someone will jump out at you from a secret door, and then you will be presented to a man behind a desk, and he will want to know what Alexander Belov spoke to you about on your walks home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have told me way too much, Alexander Belov,\u201d Tatiana declared, leaning away from him. \u201cWhy did you do that if you thought I was going to be interrogated about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to trust someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell Dasha and risk her life?\u201d</p><p>Alexander paused before he replied. \u201cBecause I needed to trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can trust me,\u201d Tatiana said cheerfully, shoving him lightly with her body. \u201cBut do me a favor, don\u2019t tell me anything else, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d he said, shoving her lightly back.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying we\u2019re doomed?\u201d she asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cEternally,\u201d replied Alexander. \u201cCan I buy you an ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d She beamed.</p><p>\u201cCr\u00e8me br?l\u00e9e, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>They sat on a bench while she ate it, but even after she was done, they continued to sit and talk and not move until Alexander glanced at his watch and got up.</p><p>It was nearing ten o\u2019clock by the time they stopped at the corner of Grechesky and Second Soviet, three blocks away from her building.</p><p>Tatiana paused. \u201cSo are you coming a little later?\u201d She sighed. \u201cDasha said you might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sighed also. \u201cWith Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was silent. They stood facing each other.</p><p>He was so near her she could smell him. Tatiana had never known anyone to smell as good and as clean as Alexander.</p><p>She thought he wanted to say something to her. He had opened his mouth, bent his head forward, frowned. She waited tensely, wanting it desperately, not wanting it, hating her ugly brown work boots, wishing she were wearing red sandals, remembering they were Dasha\u2019s, remembering she had no nice shoes of her own, wanting to be barefoot in front of him, and swelling with feeling and guilt previously unknown to her. Tatiana took a step back.</p><p>Alexander took a step back. \u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cI will see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>She walked away, feeling his eyes behind her. Turning around, she found him looking at her from a distance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>8</p><p>Alexander and Dimitri came by after eleven. It was still bright outside. Dasha was not home yet. Her boss had her working overtime, taking gold out of people\u2019s teeth. During times of crisis people liked to have gold instead of hard currency to barter with; gold kept its value. Dasha worked later and later, hating it, wanting everyone to behave as if life could still go on in the Leningrad summer as it had been \u2014 slow, warm, dusty, and full of young people in love.</p><p>Tatiana, Dimitri, and Alexander stood awkwardly in the kitchen as water dripped into the cast-iron sink. \u201cSo what\u2019s the matter with you two glum kids?\u201d said Dimitri, looking from Tatiana to Alexander.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m tired,\u201d said Tatiana. It was only a partial lie.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m hungry,\u201d said Alexander, glancing at her.</p><p>\u201cTania, let\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dima.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ll leave Alexander here to wait for Dasha.\u201d Dimitri smiled. \u201cThey don\u2019t need us. Those two would love to be left by themselves. Am I right, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going to have much luck here,\u201d Tatiana muttered. Thank goodness.</p> <p>Alexander walked over to the window and looked down into the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t,\u201d Tatiana protested. \u201cI\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>Dimitri took Tatiana by the arm. \u201cCome on, Tanechka. You\u2019ve eaten already, haven\u2019t you? Let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll be back soon, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana saw Alexander\u2019s squared shoulders.</p><p>She wanted to call him Shura. \u201cAlexander,\u201d she said, \u201cyou want us to bring you something back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tania,\u201d he replied, glancing back at her. His unhappy eyes flashed for a moment and were subdued by his own will.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go inside? Babushka made meat pirozhki. Go have some. There is borscht, too.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri\u2019s hand was already yanking Tatiana down the hall. They stepped over Slavin in the corridor, who was resting quietly on the floor, and it looked as if they would pass him without incident, but just as Tatiana neared him, he stirred, lifted his head, and grabbed her ankle.</p><p>Roughly Dimitri stepped on his wrist, and Slavin yelped, letting go, looking up at Tatiana, and wailing, \u201cStay home, Tanechka dear, it\u2019s too late for you to go out at night! Stay home!\u201d He did not look at Dimitri, who cursed at him and stepped on his wrist again.</p><p>On the street Dimitri asked if she wanted an ice cream. She didn\u2019t want him to buy her one but said, \u201cAll right. A vanilla cone.\u201d She ate the ice cream unhappily as they walked. The night was warm. She was thinking about only one thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar,\u201d she lied. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you, Tania. You\u2019re quite different from the kind of girl I usually meet.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana muttered a hapless thank-you, concentrating on her ice cream.</p> <p>\u201cI hope Alexander goes inside and eats,\u201d she said. \u201cDasha might not be home for another hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Dimitri said, \u201cis that what you want to talk about? Alexander?\u201d Even Tatiana with her untrained ear heard a chill in Dimitri\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I don\u2019t,\u201d she said hurriedly. \u201cI\u2019m just making conversation.\u201d She changed the subject. \u201cWhat did you do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDug more trenches. The front line to the north is nearly complete. We\u2019ll be ready for those Finns next week.\u201d He smirked. \u201cSo Tania, I know you must be thinking it \u2014 why am I not an officer like Alexander?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you asked me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Her heart beat a little faster.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow? No.\u201d She wanted to throw out what was left of the ice cream and run home.</p><p>\u201cHave you been speaking to Alexander about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, high-strung.</p><p>\u201cHow come you haven\u2019t asked why I\u2019m just a frontovik and he\u2019s an officer?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana had no answer for that. This was too stupid. She hated lying. Not saying anything, keeping a straight face, averting her eyes was difficult enough. But outright lying? Her tongue and throat weren\u2019t used to it.</p><p>\u201cAlex and I had every intention of being officers together. That was our original plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat plan?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri didn\u2019t answer, and Tatiana\u2019s question hung in the air and then got lodged in her head.</p><p>Her hands began to shake slightly.</p><p>She did not want to be out at night alone with Dimitri.</p><p>She did not feel safe.</p><p>They got to the corner of Suvorovsky and Tauride Park. Though the sun was still thirty degrees in the sky, under the trees the park was in shade.</p><p>\u201cYou want to walk around the gardens for a bit?\u201d Dimitri asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI really have to get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Dimitri. My parents are not used to my being out late at night. They\u2019ll get upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t get upset. They like me.\u201d He moved closer to her. \u201cYour father likes me very much. Besides,\u201d he added, \u201cyour parents are too busy thinking about Pasha to notice what time you come and go.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stopped and turned around. \u201cI\u2019m going back.\u201d And she started to walk up Suvorovsky away from him.</p><p>He grabbed her arm. \u201cTania, don\u2019t walk away from me.\u201d Without letting go, he said, \u201cCome. Come and sit with me on the bench over by the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDimitri,\u201d she said, not moving, \u201cI\u2019m not going by the trees with you. Can you let go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me by the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dimitri, let me go now.\u201d</p><p>He stepped up to her, holding her very hard. His fingers dug into her skin. \u201cWell, what if I don\u2019t want to let go, Tanechka? What are you going to do then?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana did not move away from him. His free arm went around her waist, and he brought her close to him. \u201cDima,\u201d said Tatiana, composed and unafraid, looking him right in the face, \u201cwhat are you doing? Have you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said and bent his face to kiss her. With a small cry Tatiana turned her face down and sharply away.</p><p>\u201cNo! Let go of me, Dimitri,\u201d she said. She did not lift her head.</p><p>Suddenly he let go of her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said with a tremor in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI have to go home right now,\u201d she said, walking as fast as she could. \u201cDima, you\u2019re too old for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No. Please. I\u2019m only twenty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m too young for you. I need someone who\u201d \u2014 she paused in thought \u2014 \u201cexpects less,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cHow much less?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho expects nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Tania,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you off like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, not looking at him. \u201cI\u2019m just not the kind of girl who goes by the trees.\u201d With you, she thought with a pang in her heart, remembering the Summer Garden.</p><p>\u201cI know that now. I think that\u2019s why I really like you. I just don\u2019t know how to act around you sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe respectful and patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll be as patient as Job.\u201d Dimitri leaned in to her. \u201cBecause, Tanechka,\u201d he said, \u201cI have no intention of leaving you alone.\u201d</p><p>She hurried up Suvorovsky.</p><p>Suddenly Dimitri said, \u201cI hope Dasha likes Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha does like Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he really likes her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d Tatiana said weakly. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has almost stopped his previously uncontrolled extracurricular activities. Don\u2019t say that to Dasha, of course. It\u2019ll just hurt her feelings.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wanted to say to Dimitri that she had no idea what he was talking about, but she was too afraid that he would tell her.</p><p>When they got home, Dasha and Alexander were sitting together on the small sofa in the hallway, reading from a volume of Zoshchenko\u2019s short stories and laughing. The only thing Tatiana could say was a sullen and grumpy, \u201cThat\u2019s my book.\u201d</p><p>For some reason Dasha found that very funny, and even Alexander smiled. As Tatiana walked past him, his legs were sticking so far out that she tripped over them and would have fallen face forward for sure, had he not instantly grabbed her. And just as instantly let go.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cwhat\u2019s that on your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Making hasty excuses about exhaustion, she said good night and disappeared into her grandparents\u2019 room, where she sat between her Deda and Babushka on the sofa and listened to the radio. They chatted quietly about Pasha, and soon she felt better.</p><p>Later that night she was facing the wall when she heard Dasha whispering to her. \u201cTania? Tania?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana turned to her sister. \u201cWhat is it? I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>Dasha kissed her shoulder. \u201cTania, we never talk anymore. Our Pasha left, and we never talk. You miss him, don\u2019t you? He\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him. You\u2019re busy. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow, Dashenka,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love, Tania!\u201d Dasha whispered.</p><p>Tatiana whispered back, \u201cI\u2019m glad for you, Dasha.\u201d And she turned to the wall.</p><p>Dasha kissed the back of Tatiana\u2019s head. \u201cI think this is really it, I do. Oh, Tanechka, I just don\u2019t know what to do with myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, I can\u2019t think about anything else. He is driving me crazy. He is so . . . hot and cold. Tonight he was fine, relaxed and funny, but other days . . . I just can\u2019t figure him out.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Dasha continued, \u201cI know I can\u2019t expect too much at once. The fact that he is finally coming around at all is a miracle. I couldn\u2019t get him to come over until last Sunday, when he came with Dima and you.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wanted to point out that it wasn\u2019t Dasha who got Alexander to come over, but of course said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking a gift horse in the mouth. I think he likes our family. Did you know he\u2019s from Krasnodar? He hasn\u2019t been back there since he joined the army. Doesn\u2019t have any brothers or sisters. Doesn\u2019t talk about his parents. He is . . . I can\u2019t explain. So closemouthed. Doesn\u2019t like to say too much about his own business.\u201d She paused. \u201cAsks me about mine, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d was all Tatiana could manage.</p><p>\u201cHe tells me he wishes it weren\u2019t war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cWe all wish it weren\u2019t war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that sounds hopeful, doesn\u2019t it? As if a better life with him would be possible once the war was over. Tania,\u201d said Dasha into Tatiana\u2019s hair, \u201cdo you like Dimitri?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana fought for her voice. \u201cI like him fine,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe really likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does. You have no idea about these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some idea, and he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you want to talk to me about, want to ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Dismissively, Dasha said, \u201cTania, you mustn\u2019t be so shy. You\u2019re seventeen already. Why can\u2019t you just give in a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive in to Dimitri?\u201d whispered Tatiana. \u201cNever, Dasha.\u201d</p><p>In the minutes before she fell asleep, Tatiana realized she was less afraid of the intangible of war than she was of the tangible of heartbreak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>9</p><p>On Saturday, Tatiana went to the Leningrad public library and borrowed a Russian-English phrase book. She was already somewhat familiar with the odd alphabet, having learned it in school. She spent most of the afternoon trying to speak some of the more ridiculous phrases out loud. The Ths, Ws, and the soft Rs were very difficult. \u201cThe weather will be thunder and rain tomorrow\u201d was constructed to torment her. She could say \u201cbe\u201d pretty well.</p><p>On Sunday, when Alexander came by, he single-handedly glued paper strips on their windows to keep the glass from shattering in the explosive waves that might come during shelling, if and when bombs fell on Leningrad. \u201cEveryone must tape their windows,\u201d he said. \u201cSoon the patrols are going to walk around the city to check that all the windows have been taped. We won\u2019t be able to find replacement glass anywhere if the Germans get to Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>The Metanovs watched him with great interest, with Mama commenting every few minutes on how tall he was, and on his good work and how steady his hands were, and how solidly he stood on the windowsill. Mama wanted to know where he\u2019d learned how to do that. Dasha replied impatiently, \u201cWell, he is in the Red Army, Mama!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid they teach you to stand on the windowsill in the Red Army, Alexander?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, Tania,\u201d Dasha said, laughing, but Alexander laughed, too, and he did not say shut up, Tania.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that design you made on our windows?\u201d Mama said as Alexander jumped down from the sill.</p><p>Tatiana, Dasha, Mama, and Babushka looked at the shape of the glued paper on the window. Instead of being the white crisscross that the women had seen on other windows in Leningrad, Alexander\u2019s design looked like a tree. A thick trunk, slightly bent to one side, with elongated leaves growing from it, longer at the bottom, tapering off at the top.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that, young man?\u201d Babushka demanded imperiously.</p> <p>Alexander said, \u201cThat, Anna Lvovna, is a palm tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d said Dasha, standing close to him. Why always so close?</p><p>\u201cA palm tree.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana, standing by the door, watched him without blinking.</p><p>\u201cA palm tree?\u201d Dasha said quizzically.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tropical tree. Grows in the Americas and the South Pacific.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm,\u201d said Mama. \u201cStrange choice for our windows, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than just an old crisscross,\u201d muttered Tatiana.</p><p>Alexander smiled at her. And lightly she smiled back.</p><p>Gruffly, Babushka said, \u201cWell, young man, when you do my windows, don\u2019t do any fancy things. Just a simple crisscross for me. I don\u2019t need any palm trees.\u201d</p><p>Afterward Alexander and Dasha went out by themselves, leaving Tatiana with her moody and exhausted family. Tatiana went to the Leningrad library, where she spent hours mouthing alien English sounds to herself. It seemed extremely difficult: to read in this language, to speak it, to write it. Next time she saw Alexander, she would ask him to say a few things to her in English. Just to hear how they sounded. She was already thinking about the next time she saw Alexander, as if it were a certainty. She vowed to tell him that maybe, perhaps, he shouldn\u2019t come to Kirov anymore. She made the promise to herself that night as she lay in bed and faced the wall, she made the promise to the wall, touching the old wallpaper with her fingers, stroking it up and down and saying, I promise, I promise, I promise. Then she reached down to the floor between the bed and the wall and touched the Bronze Horseman book Alexander had given her. Maybe she would tell him that another day. After she heard some English from him, and after he talked to her about the war, and after\u2014</p><p>There was another air-raid siren. Dasha returned home well after it, waking Tatiana, whose fingers remained on the listening wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>10</p><p>On Monday at work, Krasenko called her to his office and told her that although she was doing a good job on the flamethrowers, he had to transfer her to one of the tank-production facilities immediately, because the order had come through from Moscow that Kirov had to make 180 tanks a month regardless of capability or manpower.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to make the flamethrowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll make themselves,\u201d said Krasenko, lighting a cigarette. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice girl, Tania. Go. Have some soup at the canteen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think the People\u2019s Volunteers would take me?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that 15,000 people have already joined from Kirov to entrench the Luga line. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s true is that you can\u2019t go. Now, get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Luga in danger?\u201d Pasha was near Luga.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Krasenko replied. \u201cThe Germans are far away. It\u2019s just a precaution. Now, go.\u201d</p><p>In tank production there were many more people and the assembly line was much more intricate, but because of that, Tatiana had less to do. She placed the pistons in the cylinders that went below the combustion chambers on the tank\u2019s V-12 diesel engine.</p><p>The facility was the size of an airplane hangar, gray and dark inside.</p><p>By the end of the day the diesel engine was in place, thanks to Tatiana, and the tread was on the tires, and the frame was tightly bolted, but there was no inside, no instruments, no panels, no weapons, no missile boxes, no ammunition launchers, and no hull roof \u2014 basically nothing that would make the machine anything other than a heavily armored car. But unlike the crating of the small-arms ammunition, or the making of flamethrowers, or the greasing of high-explosive GP bombs, making half a tank gave Tatiana a sense of accomplishment that she had not had in her entire first month of full-time work. She felt as if she had made the KV-1 herself. Another note of pride: in the afternoon Krasenko had told her the Germans could not even conceive of a tank this well built, well armed, this facile, this agile, this simple, yet armored with 45 mm of steel all around, supplied with an 85-mm gun. They thought their Panzer IV was the best tank there was. \u201cTania,\u201d he told her, \u201cyou did an excellent job on the diesel engine. Maybe you should be a mechanic when you grow up.\u201d</p><p>At eight in the evening Tatiana ran outside with her clean hands and her straightened-out collar and her brushed-out hair, not believing she could be running at the end of an eleven-hour day, yet running nonetheless, so afraid that Alexander wouldn\u2019t be waiting for her.</p><p>But he was.</p> <p>He was waiting for her but not smiling.</p><p>Out of breath, Tatiana tried to regain her composure. She was alone with him for the first time since last Friday, alone in a sea of strangers. She wanted to say, I\u2019m so happy you came to see me. What had happened to don\u2019t come and see me anymore?</p><p>Someone yelled out her name; Tatiana reluctantly turned around. It was Ilya, a boy of sixteen, who worked alongside her on the tank tracks. \u201cYou catching the bus?\u201d Ilya asked, glancing at Alexander, who said nothing.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ilya, but I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d Tatiana motioned for Alexander to cross the street.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Alexander asked.</p><p>Puzzled, Tatiana glanced at him. \u201cWho? Oh, just some boy I work with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, no.\u201d Ilya actually was bothering her a little bit. \u201cI started in a new department. We\u2019re building tanks to send to the Luga line,\u201d she said proudly.</p> <p>Nodding, he said, \u201cHow fast can you make them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy department is making one every two days,\u201d she replied. \u201cThat\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo help at the Luga line,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to need ten a day.\u201d</p><p>Detecting something . . . she looked up at him, tried to figure it out but couldn\u2019t. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>The people near the tram stop were standing silently, smoking. No one was talking to anyone else. \u201cYou want to walk back home?\u201d Tatiana asked shyly.</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been in military training all day.\u201d</p><p>Nudging him with her fingers, Tatiana said teasingly, \u201cI thought you already were in the military.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Not for me, for them. Maneuvers, gun training, more air-raid shelters.\u201d He sounded depleted for some reason. Was she that close to the nuances of his voice? Of his face?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he repeated. But then he took her arm, pulling up her sleeve a little to reveal the dark bruises on the underside. \u201cTania, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Ah. \u201cNothing.\u201d She tried to pull her arm away. He would not let go as he stood very close to her.</p><p>\u201cReally nothing,\u201d she said, unable to look up at him. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI told you, don\u2019t take up with Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking up with him,\u201d Tatiana said.</p><p>They glanced at each other, and then Tatiana stared at his uniform buttons.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was just trying to get me to sit with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to tell me if he grabs you this hard again, do you hear?\u201d Alexander said, letting go of her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want his tender, firm fingers to let go of her. \u201cDima is a nice enough man. He is just used to a different kind of girl, I think.\u201d She coughed. \u201cWho isn\u2019t? Well, listen, I took care of it. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Alexander said. \u201cLike you took care of talking about Pasha to your family?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t speak at first but then said, \u201cAlexander, I told you it was going to be hard for me. You can\u2019t even get my twenty-four-year-old sister to do it. Why don\u2019t you try? Come over for dinner one night, have some vodka with Papa, and bring it up. See how they take it. Show me how it\u2019s done. Because I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t talk to your own family about your brother, but you can stand up to Dimitri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Tatiana replied, raising her voice a little, and thought unhappily, are we fighting? Why are we fighting?</p><p>There was a seat for them on the tram. Tatiana held on to the bench in front of her. Alexander\u2019s hands were folded in his lap. He was quiet and didn\u2019t look at her. Something continued to upset him. Was it Dimitri? Still they sat close, his arm pressed into her arm and his leg pressed into her leg. His leg felt made of marble. Tatiana didn\u2019t move her body away from him; as if she could, as if that were even an option. She was magnetized to him.</p><p>Trying to alleviate the tension between them, Tatiana brought up the war. \u201cWhere is the front now, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoving north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s far still. Right? Far from . . . ?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cFor all our military bravado, we are a civilian country.\u201d He snorted. \u201cOur silly maneuvers, our exercises, our grounded planes, our pathetic tanks. We didn\u2019t know who we were dealing with.\u201d</p><p>She pressed lightly into his side, assimilating him through her skin. \u201cAlexander, why does Dimitri seem so reluctant to go and fight? I mean, it is to get the Germans out of our country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about the Germans. He cares about only one thing\u2014\u201d He broke off.</p><p>Tatiana waited.</p><p>\u201cYou will learn something about Dimitri, Tania. He treats self-preservation as his inalienable right.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him. \u201cAlexander, what is . . . inalienable?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cA right that no one can assail.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana thought. \u201cWho says that? Do we even have those kinds of rights? Aren\u2019t they usually reserved for the state?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cIn the Soviet Union.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tania. Here we do not. Here those rights are reserved for the state.\u201d Alexander paused. \u201cAnd Dimitri. Especially self-preservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInalienable. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that word before,\u201d Tatiana said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said, his face softening. \u201cHow was the rest of your Sunday? What did you do? How is your mother? Every time I see her, she looks ready to fall down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, too much worry for Mama these days.\u201d Tatiana turned to the window. She didn\u2019t want to speak about Pasha again. \u201cYou know what I did yesterday? I learned some English words. Want to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get off, and then yes, very much. Any good words?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know quite what he meant, but she blushed anyway.</p><p>They got off the tram, and as they were walking past Warsaw Station, Tatiana saw a crowd of people huddled together: women with their children, old people with luggage, waiting in a focused disorder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they waiting for?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA train. They are the smart ones. They\u2019re leaving this city,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cLeaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He paused. \u201cTania . . . as you should be leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving and going where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere. Away from here.\u201d</p><p>Why was it that a week ago the thoup bght of evacuation was so thrilling, yet today it felt like a death sentence? It wasn\u2019t evacuation. It was exile.</p><p>\u201cWhat I hear,\u201d Alexander continued, \u201cis that we\u2019re getting routed by the Germans. Trounced. We\u2019re unprepared, unequipped; we have no tanks and no weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Tatiana said with false levity. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a tank tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing except men, Tania. No matter what the cheerful radio reports say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are quite cheerful,\u201d Tatiana said, trying to sound cheerful herself \u2014 and failing.</p><p>\u201cTania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you listening? The Germans are eventually headed for Leningrad. It\u2019s not safe. You really have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my family is staying put!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Leave without them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, what are you talking about?\u201d Tatiana exclaimed and laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve never been anywhere by myself in my whole life! I barely go to the store by myself. I can\u2019t go by myself. Where? By myself to the Urals or to some place where they evacuate people? Is that where you want me to go? Or maybe to America, where you\u2019re from? Will I be safe there?\u201d Tatiana chuckled. It was just preposterous.</p><p>\u201cCertainly if you went where I\u2019m from, you\u2019d be safe there,\u201d Alexander said grimly.</p><p>After she came home that night, Tatiana struck up a conversation with her father about evacuation and about Pasha.</p><p>Papa listened to her long enough for him to take three puffs of his cigarette. Tatiana counted. Then he got up and, stubbing out the cigarette to punctuate his words, said, \u201cTanyusha, where in hell are you getting your ideas from? The Germans are not coming here. I\u2019m not going away from here. And Pasha is safe. I know it. Listen, if it will make you feel better, Mama will call him tomorrow to make sure all is well. All right?\u201d</p><p>Deda said, \u201cTania, I did ask to be evacuated east to the Molotov Oblast near the Urals. I have a cousin in Molotov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been dead for ten years, Vasili,\u201d said Babushka, shaking her large head. \u201cSince the hunger of \u201931.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wife still lives there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died of dysentery in \u201928.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was his second wife. His first wife, Naira Mikhailovna, still lives there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in Molotov. Remember? She lives where we used to live, in that village called\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman!\u201d Deda interrupted. \u201cDo you want to come with me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you, Deda,\u201d Tatiana said brightly. \u201cIs Molotov nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you, too, Vasili,\u201d said Babushka, \u201cbut don\u2019t pretend we have people in Molotov. We might as well go to Chukhotka.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana intervened. \u201cChukhotka . . . isn\u2019t that near the Arctic circle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Deda.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that near the Bering Strait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we should go to Chukhotka,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cIf we have to go somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChukhotka? Who is going to let me go there?\u201d Deda exclaimed. \u201cDo you think I can teach math there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania is a fool,\u201d agreed Mama.</p><p>Tatiana fell quiet. She wasn\u2019t thinking about Deda teaching math. She was thinking about something ridiculous. So outlandish that if she weren\u2019t in front of her judgmental family, she would have laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you thinking about the Bering Strait, Tania?\u201d asked Deda.</p><p>\u201cShe always thinks about preposterous things,\u201d Dasha piped in. \u201cShe\u2019s got a preposterous inner life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no inner life, Dasha,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cWhat\u2019s on the other side of the Bering Strait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Alaska,\u201d said Deda. \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Tania, shut up, will you?\u201d said Mama.</p><p>The next night Tatiana\u2019s father came home with ration cards for the family. \u201cCan you believe it?\u201d he said. \u201cRations already. Well, we can manage. They\u2019re not bad, actually.\u201d Workers got 800 grams of bread a day. Also, one kilo of meat a week and half a kilo of cereals. It seemed like plenty of food.</p><p>\u201cMama, did you try to call Pasha?\u201d Tatiana wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she replied. \u201cI even went to the intercity telephone bureau on Ulitsa Zhelyabova. Couldn\u2019t get through. I\u2019ll try again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Information from the front was ominous. The war bulletins \u2014 posted all over Leningrad on wooden boards where the daily papers had once been posted \u2014 were haunting in their vagueness. The radio announcer said that the Red Army was winning but the German forces were gaining some ground.</p><p>How could the Red Army be winning if the Germans were gaining ground? Tatiana wondered.</p><p>A few days later Deda said the chances were very good that he was going to get the evacuation post in Molotov and suggested that the family start thinking about packing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving without Pasha,\u201d snapped Mama. \u201cBesides,\u201d she said, in a calmer voice, \u201cat the uniform factory I\u2019m now making Red Army uniforms. I\u2019m needed for the war effort.\u201d She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. The war will be over soon. You heard on the radio. The Red Army is winning. They\u2019re repelling the enemy.\u201d</p><p>Deda shook his head. \u201cOh, Irina Fedorovna,\u201d he said calmly, \u201cthe enemy is the best-armed, best-trained enemy in the world. Have you not heard? England has been fighting them for eighteen months. Alone. England, with their RAF, have not beaten the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but, Papochka,\u201d interjected Papa coming to the defense of his wife, \u201cnow the Nazis are engaged in a real war, not just some air war. The Soviet front is massive. The Germans are going to have a hard time with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say we don\u2019t stay to find out how hard.\u201d</p><p>Mama repeated, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cI\u2019m with Mama on this.\u201d</p><p>I bet you are, thought Tatiana.</p><p>Pasha was no longer there, so he didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>They sat in their long, narrow room, Papa and Mama smoking, Baba and Deda shaking their quiet gray heads, Dasha sewing.</p><p>Tatiana kept to herself, thinking, well, I am not leaving either.</p><p>She was entrenched. She had dug a trench all around herself called Alexander, and she couldn\u2019t leave. Tatiana lived for that evening hour with him that propelled her into her future and into the barely formed, painful feelings that she could neither express nor understand. Friends walking in the lucent dusk. There was nothing more she could have from him, and there was nothing more she wanted from him but that one hour at the end of her long day when her heart beat and her breath was short and she was happy.</p><p>At home Tatiana surrounded herself with her family to protect herself, yet withdrew from them, wanting to be away from them. She watched them at night, as she did now, watched their mood, didn\u2019t trust it.</p><p>\u201cMama, did you call Pasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I got through. But there was no answer,\u201d Mama said. \u201cNo answer at the camp. I think I may have gotten the wrong number. I called the village Dohotino, where the camp was, but there was no answer from the Soviet council there either. I\u2019ll try again tomorrow. Everybody is trying to call. The lines must be overloaded.\u201d</p><p>Mama tried again and again, but there was no word from Pasha, and there was no good news from the front, and there was no evacuation.</p><p>Alexander stayed away from the apartment at night. Dasha worked late. Dimitri was up near Finland.</p><p>But every single day after work Tatiana brushed her hair and ran outside, thinking, please be there, and every single day after work Alexander was. Though he never asked her to go to the Summer Garden anymore or to sit on the bench under the trees with him, his hat was always in his hands.</p><p>Exhausted and slow, they meandered from tram to canal to tram, reluctantly parting at Grechesky Prospekt, three blocks away from her apartment building.</p><p>During their walks sometimes they talked about Alexander\u2019s America or his life in Moscow, and sometimes they talked about Tatiana\u2019s Lake Ilmen and her summers in Luga, and sometimes they chatted about the war, though less and less because of the anxiety over Pasha, and sometimes Alexander taught Tatiana a little English. Sometimes they told jokes, and sometimes they barely spoke at all. A few times Alexander let Tatiana carry his rifle as a balancing stick while she walked a high ledge on the side of Obvodnoy Canal. \u201cDon\u2019t fall into the water, Tania,\u201d he once said, \u201cbecause I can\u2019t swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d she asked incredulously, nearly toppling over.</p><p>Grabbing the end of his rifle to steady her, Alexander said with a grin, \u201cLet\u2019s not find out, shall we? I don\u2019t want to lose my weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Tatiana said, precariously teetering on the ledge and laughing. \u201cI can swim perfectly well. I\u2019ll save your weapon for you. Want to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>And sometimes, when Alexander talked, Tatiana found her lower jaw drifting down and was suddenly and awkwardly aware that she had been staring at him so long that her mouth had dropped open. She didn\u2019t know what to look at when he talked \u2014 his caramel eyes that blinked and smiled and shined and were grim or his vibrant mouth that moved and opened and breathed and spoke. Her eyes darted from his eyes to his lips and circled from his hair to his jaw as if they were afraid she would miss something if she didn\u2019t stare at everything all at once.</p><p>There were some pieces of his fascinating life that Alexander did not wish to talk about \u2014 and didn\u2019t. Not about the last time he saw his father, not about how he became Alexander Belov, not about how he received his medal of valor. Tatiana didn\u2019t care and never did more than gently press him. She would take from him what he needed to give her and wait impatiently for the rest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>11</p><p>\u201cMy days are too long,\u201d Tatiana said to him one Friday evening, smiling the beaten smile of someone who had worked solidly for twelve hours. \u201cI made you a whole tank today, Alexander! With a red star and a number thirty-six. Do you know how to operate a tank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than that,\u201d he replied. \u201cI know how to command it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do nothing except shout orders and get killed.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t smile back. \u201cHow is that better?\u201d she muttered. \u201cI want to get transferred to the breadmaking facility. Instead of tanks, some lucky people are making bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe more the better,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cTanks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBread.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey promised all of us a bonus \u2014 can you believe it? \u2014 if we made tanks over our quota. A bonus!\u201d Tatiana chuckled. \u201cThe economics of profit during war: strange that we should want to work harder for a couple of extra rubles \u2014 goes against everything they\u2019ve been teaching us from birth \u2014 but there it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere it is, indeed, Tania,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, they won\u2019t stop reconstructing you until you won\u2019t want to work harder even for a couple of extra rubles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being subversive.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re not safe. In any case, it nearly killed Zina. She said she was ready to join the volunteers, that it couldn\u2019t be worse than this pressure.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was thoughtful. The pavement was wide, but they walked close together, their arms bumping. \u201cZina is right,\u201d he said finally. \u201cDon\u2019t make any mistakes. You\u2019ve heard the story of Karl Ots, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe used to be the Kirov plant director when it was still called Putilov Works. Karl Martovich Ots. After Kirov\u2019s assassination in 1934, Ots tried to maintain order, to protect his workers from the threat of . . . retaliation, for lack of a better word.\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana had heard something about Sergei Kirov from her father and grandfather. \u201cArrest? Death?\u201d she said.</p><p>Alexander nodded. \u201cYes and yes. Anyway, one day when a T-28 tank was being inspected, a bolt was found to be missing. The tank had been about to be delivered to the army. There was of course a scandal and a frenzied search for the \u2018enemy saboteurs\u2019 to reveal themselves.\u201d Alexander took a breath. Tatiana waited.</p><p>\u201cNow, Ots knew,\u201d he continued as they stopped at a junction, \u201cthat it had just been a stupid mistake, an oversight of the mechanic who had forgotten to screw in the bolt \u2014 no more, no less. Ots knew, so he refused to permit a witch hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cHe failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was like walking into a tornado and saying, but it\u2019s just wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tornado?\u201d Tatiana asked quizzically.</p><p>Alexander went on. \u201cHundreds more people vanished from the factory.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana bowed her head. \u201cOts?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm. With him vanished his able successor, the heads of the bookkeeping department, the tank-production units, the personnel department, the machine-tool shop, not to mention former Putilov plant workers \u2014 those who had moved on and were employed elsewhere in high positions in the government, such as the Novosibirsk Party Secretary, the Secretary of the Neva Party region \u2014 oh, and let\u2019s not forget the Mayor of Leningrad. He disappeared, too.\u201d</p><p>The light had turned green, then red, then green again. When it was red, the two of them crossed the street, not touching arms anymore. Tatiana was deep in thought. Finally she spoke. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is, be careful with the bolts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZina is right. We don\u2019t need that kind of pressure. She is exhausted. All she wants is to go to Minsk and join her sister.\u201d Minsk was the capital of Byelorussia.</p><p>Alexander rubbed his eyes and adjusted his cap. \u201cTell her,\u201d he said tensely, \u201cto forget Minsk. Concentrate on the tanks. How many are you supposed to make in a month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred and eighty. We\u2019re falling short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re asking too much of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait.\u201d Tatiana put her hand on his arm and then, surprised at herself, took it away. \u201cWhy forget Minsk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinsk fell to the Germans thirteen days ago,\u201d Alexander said with grave finality.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirteen days ago? Oh, no, no.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo, Alexander, it can\u2019t be. Minsk is only a few kilometers south of . . .\u201d Tatiana couldn\u2019t say it.</p><p>\u201cNot a few, Tania, many,\u201d he said by way of comforting her. \u201cHundreds of kilometers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Alexander,\u201d said Tatiana, feeling her legs giving out. \u201cNot that many. Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, it\u2019s classified army information! I tell you as much as I can, and then no more. I keep hoping you will hear something on the radio that sounds like the truth. When I know you haven\u2019t heard, I tell you some more. Minsk fell after only six days of war. Even Comrade Stalin was surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell us when he spoke to us last week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called you his brothers and sisters, didn\u2019t he? He wanted you to rise up with anger and fight. What good would it do to tell you how deep in the Soviet Union the Germans are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow deep are they?\u201d</p><p>When Alexander didn\u2019t answer, she asked in a despondent voice, barely able to get the words out, \u201cWhat about our Pasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d he said loudly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you want me to do. I have been coming here and telling you from day one to get him out of Tolmachevo!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana turned her face away from him and struggled not to cry. She didn\u2019t want him to see that.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not in Luga yet,\u201d said Alexander, quieter. \u201cThey haven\u2019t reached Tolmachevo. Try not to worry. But I\u2019ll just tell you that on the first day of war, we lost 1,200 planes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know we had 1,200 planes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d said Alexander, glancing at her and pausing. \u201cI told you, Tania. Leave Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you my family isn\u2019t going without Pasha.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing. They continued to walk.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cYou want to go home?\u201d</p><p>I am tired. I don\u2019t want to go home.</p><p>When Tatiana didn\u2019t reply, Alexander said, \u201cWant to walk to Palace Bridge? I think they still sell ice cream in a shop near the river.\u201d</p><p>After having ice cream, Alexander and Tatiana were walking along the Neva embankment heading west into the sunset and across from the green-and-white splendor of the Winter Palace when on the opposite side of the street Tatiana spotted a man who made her stop suddenly.</p><p>A tall, thin, middle-aged man with a long, gray Jovian beard stood outside the Hermitage Museum with an expression of absolute shattered regret.</p><p>Tatiana instantly reacted to his face. What could make a man look this way? He was standing next to the back of a military truck, watching young men carry wooden crates down the ramp from the Winter Palace. It was these crates the man looked at with such profound heartbreak, as if they were his vanishing first love.</p><p>\u201cWho is that man?\u201d she asked, tremendously affected by his expression.</p><p>\u201cThe curator of the Hermitage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he looking at the crates that way?\u201d</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cThey are his life\u2019s sole passion. He doesn\u2019t know if he is ever going to see them again.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stared at the man. She almost wanted to go and comfort him. \u201cHe\u2019s got to have more faith, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, Tania.\u201d Alexander smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s got to have a little more faith. After the war is over, he will see his crates again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way he is looking at them, after the war is over he is going to bring them back single-handedly,\u201d declared Tatiana. Four gray armored trucks were parked outside the museum. \u201cWhat do you think is going on?\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing but he stopped her from walking further, motioning her to watch. In a moment four more men appeared out of the wide green doors carrying wooden crates down the ramp. The crates had holes drilled in them.</p><p>\u201cPaintings?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cFour truckloads of paintings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a small percentage of their load.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, why are they getting the paintings out of the Hermitage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s a war on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re getting the artwork out?\u201d Tatiana said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re so worried Hitler is going to come to Leningrad, why don\u2019t they get the people out?\u201d</p><p>Alexander smiled at her, and she nearly forgot her question. \u201cTania, who will be left to fight the Nazis if the people leave? Paintings can\u2019t fight for Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, we are not trained in fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we are. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Our garrison is thousands of soldiers strong. We will barricade the city and fight. First we will send the frontovik\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Dimitri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, him. Into the streets with a gun. When he is dead, we will send me, with a tank, like the one you\u2019ve been making for me. When I\u2019m dead, all the barricades down, all the weapons and tanks gone, they will send you with a rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when I\u2019m dead?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the last line of defense. When you\u2019re dead, Hitler will march through Leningrad the way he marched through Paris. Do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair. The French didn\u2019t fight,\u201d Tatiana said, wanting to be anywhere right now but standing in front of men loading artwork from the Hermitage onto armored trucks.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t fight, Tania, but you will fight. For every street and for every building. And when you lose\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe art will be saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! The art will be saved,\u201d Alexander said emotionally. \u201cAnd another artist will paint a glorious picture, immortalizing you, with a club in your raised hand, swinging to hit the German tank as it\u2019s about to crush you, all against the backdrop of the statue of Peter the Great atop his bronze horse. And that picture will hang in the Hermitage, and at the start of the next war the curator will once again stand on the street, crying over his vanishing crates.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana watched the men disappear behind the green doors and descend the ramp a few minutes later with more crates. \u201cYou make it sound so romantic,\u201d she said to him. \u201cYou make dying for Leningrad sound almost worthwhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it worthwhile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not so bad to be a Nazi.\u201d Tatiana raised her right arm outward and upward. \u201cWe can salute the F\u00fchrer. We salute Comrade Stalin now anyway.\u201d She bent her arm in a salute. \u201cWe won\u2019t be free, we\u2019ll all be slaves. But so what? We\u2019ll have food. We\u2019ll have our life. A free life is better, but any life is better than no life, right?\u201d</p><p>When Alexander, staring at her, did not reply, Tatiana continued, \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to go to other countries. But we can\u2019t now. Who wants to go to the dissolute Western free world slums anyway, where strangers kill each other for fifty \u2014 what is it? \u2014 cents? Isn\u2019t that what they teach us in Soviet schools?\u201d Tatiana peered into Alexander\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201cmaybe I would rather die in front of the Bronze Horseman with a rock in my hand and have someone else live the free life that I can\u2019t even fathom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander said hoarsely, \u201cyou would,\u201d and in a gesture both desperate and tender, he placed his palm on Tatiana\u2019s bare skin, right below her throat. His palm was so large it covered her from her clavicle to the top of her breast. Her heart nearly flew out of her chest into his hand.</p><p>Tatiana looked up at him helplessly and watched him bend to her, but a uniformed guard stepped up to the curb and shouted across the street, \u201cMove it, you two! Move it! What are you standing gawking for? What\u2019s there to gawk at? That\u2019s enough! You\u2019ve seen it all. Move on!\u201d</p><p>Alexander took his hand away from Tatiana, turned around, and glared at the guard, who backed off, muttering that Red Army officers were as bound by the law as anyone else.</p><p>When they said good-bye to each other a few minutes later, they did not speak about what had happened, but neither could Tatiana look up at Alexander, which was just as well, because Alexander didn\u2019t look at Tatiana.</p><p>At home was a dinner of cold potatoes and cold fried onions. Tatiana ate quickly and then went up to the roof to sit and look at the sky for enemy planes, but the planes could have come and razed the whole city, because all Tatiana could see was Alexander\u2019s impassioned eyes, all Tatiana could feel was Alexander\u2019s impassioned hand on her rapidly beating heart.</p><p>Somewhere in those weeks Tatiana\u2019s innocence was lost. The innocence of honesty was gone forever, for she knew she would have to live in deceit, every day in verse and prose, in close quarters, in the same bed, every night when her foot touched Dasha\u2019s, she would live in deceit. Because she felt for him.</p><p>But what Tatiana felt for Alexander was true.</p><p>What Tatiana felt for Alexander was impervious to the drumbeat of conscience.</p><p>Oh, to be walking through Leningrad white night after white night, the dawn and the dusk all smelting together like platinum ore, Tatiana thought, turning away to the wall, again to the wall, to the wall, as ever. Alexander, my nights, my days, my every thought. You will fall away from me in just a while, won\u2019t you, and I\u2019ll be whole again, and I will go on and feel for someone else, the way everyone does.</p><p>But my innocence is forever gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>12</p><p>Two days later, on the second Sunday in July, Alexander and Dimitri, dressed in their civilian clothes, called on Tatiana and Dasha. Alexander wore black linen trousers and a white cotton button-down short-sleeved shirt. Tatiana had never seen him in a short-sleeved shirt before, seen skin beyond his face and hands. His forearms were muscular and tanned. His face was clean-shaven. She had never seen him clean-shaven. By the time the evening hour fell, Alexander always had stubble. Tatiana thought, her heart catching on him, that he looked almost impossibly handsome.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you girls want to go? Let\u2019s go somewhere special,\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Peterhof.\u201d</p><p>They packed some food and went to catch the train from Warsaw Station. Peterhof was an hour\u2019s train ride away. All four of them walked a block along Obvodnoy Canal, where Alexander and Tatiana ambled every day. Tatiana walked in silence. Once when Alexander jumped off the narrow pavement and strolled ahead of her with Dasha, his bare arm brushed against her bare arm.</p> <p>On the train Dasha said, \u201cTania, tell Dima and Alex what you call Peterhof. Tell them.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana came out of her thoughts. \u201cWhat? Oh. I call it the Versailles of the Soviet Union.\u201d</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cWhen Tania was younger, she wanted to be a queen and live in the Great Palace, didn\u2019t you, Tanechka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the kids in Luga used to call you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t remember, Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they called you something so funny. The queen of . . . the queen of . . .\u201d</p><p>Tatiana glanced at Alexander, who glanced at Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d asked Dimitri, \u201cwhat would have been your first act as queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo restore peace to the monarchy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then to behead all transgressors.\u201d</p><p>Everybody laughed. Dimitri said, \u201cI really missed you, Tania.\u201d Alexander stopped laughing and stared out the window. Tatiana, too, stared out the window. They were sitting diagonally across from each other on facing seats.</p> <p>Touching her neat ponytail, Dimitri said, \u201cTania, why don\u2019t you ever wear your hair down? I saw it down once. It looked so pretty.\u201d</p><p>Dismissively Dasha said, \u201cDima, forget it, she\u2019s so stubborn. We tell her and tell her. Why do you keep it so long if you don\u2019t do something with it? But no. She never wears it down, do you, Tania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dasha,\u201d said Tatiana, wishing for her wall, for anything, just so her flushed face would not be in view of Alexander\u2019s quietly full eyes.</p><p>\u201cTake it out of your ponytail now, Tanechka,\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, Tania,\u201d said Dasha.</p><p>Slowly Tatiana pulled the rubber band out of her hair and turned to the window, not speaking again until their stop.</p><p>In Peterhof they did not take an organized tour but meandered around the palace and the Elysian manicured grounds instead, finally finding a secluded spot on the lawn under the trees near the Great Cascade Fountain to have their picnic.</p><p>With gusto they ate their lunch of hard-boiled eggs and bread and cheese. Dasha had even brought vodka, and she and Alexander and Dimitri drank from the bottle, while Tatiana refused. Then everybody had a smoke except Tatiana.</p> <p>\u201cTania,\u201d Dimitri said, \u201cyou don\u2019t smoke, you don\u2019t drink. What do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCartwheels!\u201d exclaimed Dasha. \u201cRight, Tania? In Luga, Tania taught all the boys how to do cartwheels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the boys?\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d echoed Dimitri. \u201cThere were boys in Luga?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike flies around Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Dasha?\u201d Tatiana said, suddenly embarrassed. With an effort, she did not meet Alexander\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Dasha pinched Tatiana on the thigh. \u201cTania, tell Dima and Alex how those wild beasts never left you alone.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou were like honey to bears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, tell us, Tania!\u201d said Dimitri.</p><p>Alexander said nothing.</p><p>Tatiana was beet red. \u201cDasha, I was maybe seven. There was a group of us. Boys and girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and they all buzzed around you,\u201d Dasha drew out, looking fondly at Tatiana. \u201cOur Tania was the cutest child. She had round button eyes and those little freckles and not just blonde but white-blonde hair! She was like a ball of white sunshine rolling around Luga. None of the old ladies could keep their hands off her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the old ladies?\u201d Alexander asked evenly.</p><p>\u201cDo a cartwheel, Tania,\u201d said Dimitri with his hand on her back. \u201cShow us what you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Tania!\u201d Dasha said. \u201cCome on. This is the perfect place for it, don\u2019t you think? Here in front of a majestic palace, fountains, lawn, gardenias blooming\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGermans in Minsk,\u201d said Tatiana, trying not to look at Alexander, lying on the blanket on his side, propped up by his elbow. He looked so casual, so familiar, so . . .</p><p>And yet, at the same time, utterly untouchable and unattainable.</p><p>\u201cForget the Germans,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cThis is the place for love.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what Tatiana was afraid of.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tania,\u201d Alexander said softly, sitting up and crossing his legs. \u201cLet\u2019s see these famous cartwheels.\u201d He lit a cigarette.</p><p>Dasha prodded her. \u201cYou never say no to a cartwheel.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wanted to say no today.</p><p>Sighing, she got up from their old blanket. \u201cFine. Though, frankly, I don\u2019t know what kind of a queen I\u2019d make, doing cartwheels for my subjects.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was wearing a dress, not the dress but a casual pink sundress. Walking a few meters away from them, she said, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d And from a distance she saw Alexander\u2019s eyes swallowing her. \u201cWatch,\u201d she said, putting her right foot forward. She flung herself upside down on her right arm, swinging her body in a perfect arc around onto her left arm and then her left foot, and then, without taking a breath and with her hair flying, Tatiana whirled around again, and again and again in an empyrean circle, down a straight trajectory on the grass toward the Great Palace, toward childhood and innocence, away from Dimitri and Dasha and Alexander.</p><p>As she walked back, her face flushed and her hair everywhere, she allowed herself a glance at Alexander\u2019s face. Everything she had wanted to see was there.</p><p>Laughing, Dasha fell on top of Alexander and said, \u201cWhat did I tell you? She\u2019s got hidden talents.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana lowered her gaze and sat down on the blanket.</p><p>Rubbing Tatiana\u2019s back, Dimitri said, \u201cHmm, Tania, what else do you have in your bag of tricks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she replied tersely.</p><p>A little later, Dimitri asked, \u201cDasha, Tania, how would you girls define love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you define love? What does love mean to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDima! Who wants to know?\u201d Dasha smiled at Alexander.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a question, Dasha.\u201d Dimitri drank some more vodka. \u201cThis is a good place, a fine Sunday, for that question.\u201d He smiled at Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Alexander, should I answer it?\u201d Dasha asked.</p><p>Shrugging and smoking, Alexander said, \u201cAnswer if you want.\u201d</p><p>The blanket was too small for the four of them, Tatiana thought. She was sitting in a lotus position, Dima was lying on his stomach to her left, and Alexander and Dasha were in front of her, Dasha leaning into Alexander.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Love . . . let\u2019s see,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cHelp me out, Tania, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDash, you can do this. I know you can.\u201d Tatiana didn\u2019t want to say that Dasha had had lots of field experience.</p><p>\u201cHmm . . . love. Love is . . . when he comes by when he says he\u2019s going to,\u201d she said, nudging Alexander. \u201cLove is when he is late but says he is sorry.\u201d She smiled. \u201cLove is when he doesn\u2019t look at any other girls but me.\u201d Nudging him again, twice. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, Dasha,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Tatiana coughed.</p><p>\u201cTania! What? You\u2019re not satisfied with that?\u201d Dasha asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s very good.\u201d But the teasing hesitation was clearly in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat, clever clogs? What didn\u2019t I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Dash. Everything. But it sounds to me what you described is what it\u2019s like to be loved.\u201d She paused. No one else spoke. \u201cIsn\u2019t love what you give him, not what he gives you? Is there a difference? Am I completely wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely,\u201d said Dasha, smiling at Tatiana. \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Tatiana said, not looking at anyone.</p><p>\u201cTanechka?\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cWhat do you think love is?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana felt she was being set up.</p><p>\u201cTania? Tell us. What does love mean to you?\u201d Dimitri repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, go ahead, Tania,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cTell Dimitri what love means to you.\u201d And then in a teasing, affectionate voice, she said, \u201cTo Tania, let\u2019s see, love is being left alone for a whole summer to read in peace. Love is \u2014 sleeping late, that\u2019s the number one love. Love is \u2014 cr\u00e8me br?l\u00e9e ice cream; no, that is the number one love. Tania, tell the truth, if you could sleep late all summer, and read while you ate ice cream all day, tell me you would not be in bliss!\u201d Dasha laughed. \u201cLove is, oh, I know \u2014 Deda! He is number one. Love is this Great Palace. Love is telling us those silly jokes, trying to make us laugh. Love is, Pasha \u2014 he is definitely number one. Love is \u2014 oh! Naked cartwheels!\u201d Dasha exclaimed with joy.</p><p>\u201cNaked cartwheels?\u201d asked Alexander, who had not taken his eyes off Tatiana.</p><p>Dimitri said, \u201cCan we see those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania! They should see how you do those cartwheels! At Lake Ilmen she would catapult herself naked five times right into the water.\u201d Delight was all over Dasha\u2019s face. \u201cWait! That\u2019s it! That\u2019s what you were called. The kids used to call you the cartwheel queen of Lake Ilmen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana calmly. \u201cNot the naked cartwheel queen of Lake Ilmen.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was trying not to laugh.</p><p>Dasha and Dimitri were rolling on the blanket.</p><p>Throwing a piece of bread at her sister, all red in the face, Tatiana said, \u201cI was seven then, Dashka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seven now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Dasha knocked Tatiana back, throwing herself on top of her, \u201cTania, Tania, Tania,\u201d she squealed, tickling Tatiana. \u201cYou\u2019re the funniest girl.\u201d And when she was very close to Tatiana\u2019s face, she said, \u201cLook at all your freckles.\u201d Dasha bent her head and kissed them. \u201cThey\u2019ve really popped out. You must be walking outside a lot. You don\u2019t walk home from Kirov, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and get off me. You are way too heavy,\u201d said Tatiana, tickling her sister back and pushing her off.</p><p>Dimitri said, \u201cTania, you didn\u2019t answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cLet Tatiana answer the question.\u201d</p><p>It took Tatiana a few moments to get her breath back. Finally she said, \u201cLove is . . .\u201d And with a pulsing heart she thought about what she could say and what would be a big lie. What would be the truth? Partial truth, whole truth? How much could she give right now? Knowing who was listening. \u201cLove is,\u201d she repeated slowly, looking only at Dasha, \u201cwhen he is hungry and you feed him. Love is knowing when he is hungry.\u201d</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cBut, Tania, you don\u2019t know how to cook! He\u2019d pretty much starve, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri cackled. \u201cWhat about when he is horny? What do you do then?\u201d He laughed so hard he started hiccuping. \u201cIs love knowing when he is horny? And feeding him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up, Dimitri,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cDima, you are just so crass,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cYou have no class.\u201d Turning to Alexander and smiling, she pushed him lightly and said in an eager voice, \u201cAll right, now your turn.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana, sitting motionless in her lotus position, looked beyond Alexander to the Great Palace, thinking of the gilded throne room and all her dreams blossoming here in Peterhof when she was a child.</p><p>\u201cLove is, to be loved,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cin return.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip trembling, Tatiana would not take her eyes off Peter the Great\u2019s Summer Palace.</p><p>Dasha leaned into him with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>Only when they all got up and folded their blanket to catch the train back did it occur to Tatiana that no one had asked Dimitri what love meant to him.</p><p>That night, as she was turned to the wall, remorse over Alexander ate Tatiana up from the whites of her bones. To turn away from Dasha like this was to admit the unadmittable, to accept the unacceptable, to forgive the unforgivable. Turning away meant that deception was going to become her way of life, as long as she had a dark wall to turn her face to.</p><p>How could Tatiana live a life, breathe in a life where she could sleep next to her sister with her back turned every night? Her sister, who took her mushroom picking in Luga a dozen years ago with only a basket, no knife and no paper bag, \u201cso that the mushrooms wouldn\u2019t be afraid,\u201d Dasha had said. Her sister, who taught Tatiana how to tie her shoelaces at five and to ride her bike at six, and to eat clover. Her sister, who looked after her summer after summer, who covered for all her pranks, who cooked for her and braided her hair and bathed her when she was small. Her sister, who had once taken her out at night with her and her wild beaus, letting Tatiana see how young men behaved with young women. Tatiana had stood awkwardly against the wall of Nevsky Prospekt, eating her ice cream, while the older boys kissed the older girls. Dasha never took Tatiana with her again and after that night became more protective of Tatiana than ever.</p><p>Tatiana could not continue like this one more day.</p><p>She had to ask Alexander to stop coming to Kirov.</p><p>Tatiana felt one way. That was indisputable. But she had to behave another way. That was indisputable, too.</p><p>Turning away from the wall and to Dasha, Tatiana reached out and gently stroked the length of her sister\u2019s thick curls.</p><p>\u201cThat feels nice, Tanechka,\u201d murmured Dasha.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dasha,\u201d said Tatiana, as her tears trickled down on the pillow.</p><p>\u201cMmm, love you, too. Go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>All the while her mind was laying down the unassailable law of right and wrong, Tatiana\u2019s breath was whispering his name in the rhythmic beat of her heart. SHU-rah, SHU-rah, SHU-rah. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>13</p><p>On the Monday after Peterhof, when a smiling Alexander met an unsmiling Tatiana at Kirov, she said to him before even a hello, \u201cAlexander, you can\u2019t come anymore.\u201d</p><p>He stopped smiling and stood silently in front of her, at last prodding her with his hand. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s walk.\u201d</p><p>They walked the long block to Govorova.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d He was looking at the ground.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, I can\u2019t do this anymore. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stayed quiet.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make it,\u201d said Tatiana, strengthened by the concrete pavement under her feet. She was glad they were walking and she didn\u2019t have to look at his face. \u201cIt\u2019s too hard for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Flummoxed by that question, she fell silent. Not one of her answers could she speak aloud.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just friends, Tania, right?\u201d Alexander said quietly. \u201cGood friends. I come because I know you\u2019re tired. You\u2019ve had a long day, you have a long way home, and a long evening ahead of you still. I come because sometimes you smile when you\u2019re with me, and I think you are happy. Am I wrong? That\u2019s why I come. It\u2019s not a big thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYes, we have the pretense of not really being up to much. But please.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we tell Dasha then that you take me home from Kirov? Why do we get off every single day three blocks before my building?\u201d</p><p>Slowly he said, \u201cDasha wouldn\u2019t understand. It would hurt her feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it would. It should!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Tania, this has nothing to do with Dasha.\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana\u2019s efforts to remain calm were costing her white fingers blood. \u201cAlexander, this has everything to do with Dasha. I can\u2019t lie in bed with her night after night, afraid. Please,\u201d she said.</p><p>They came to the tram stop. Alexander stood in front of her. \u201cTania, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head away. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said, taking both her hands in his.</p><p>She raised her eyes to Alexander. His big hands felt so comforting.</p><p>\u201cTatia, look at me and say, Alexander, I don\u2019t want you to come anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d she said in a whisper, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to come anymore.\u201d</p><p>He did not let go of her hands, nor did she pull away.</p> <p>\u201cAfter yesterday you don\u2019t want me to come anymore?\u201d he asked, his voice faltering.</p><p>Tatiana could not look at him when she spoke. \u201cAfter yesterday most of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d he exclaimed suddenly. \u201cLet\u2019s tell her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She thought she had misheard.</p><p>\u201cYes! Let\u2019s tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her what?\u201d Tatiana said, her tongue suddenly full of frozen fear. She shivered in her sleeveless top. \u201cThere is nothing to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana, please!\u201d Alexander\u2019s eyes flashed at her. \u201cLet\u2019s tell the truth and live with the consequences. Let\u2019s do the honest thing. She deserves that. I\u2019m going to end it with her and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She tried to pull her hands away. \u201cPlease, no. Please. She\u2019ll be devastated.\u201d She paused. \u201cWe have to think about other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about us?\u201d He squeezed her hands. \u201cTania . . .\u201d he whispered, \u201cwhat about you and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander!\u201d Her nerves were raw. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou please!\u201d he said loudly. \u201cI\u2019m sick to death of this \u2014 all because you don\u2019t want to do the honorable thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is it honorable to hurt other people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha will get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Dimitri?\u201d</p><p>When Alexander did not reply, Tatiana repeated, \u201cWill Dimitri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me worry about Dimitri, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re wrong. Dasha will not get over you. She thinks you\u2019re the love of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks wrong. She doesn\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t listen anymore. She yanked her hands away. \u201cNo, no. Stop talking.\u201d</p><p>Alexander stood in front of her on the pavement. \u201cI\u2019m a soldier in the Red Army. I\u2019m not a doctor in America. I\u2019m not a scientist in Britain. I\u2019m a soldier in the Soviet Union. I could die any minute a thousand different ways to Sunday. This might be the last minute we will have together. Don\u2019t you want to spend that minute with me?\u201d</p><p>Mesmerized by him, Tatiana muttered, \u201cRight now, I just want to crawl into bed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he exclaimed fervently, \u201ccrawl into bed with me!\u201d</p><p>Weakening, Tatiana shook her head. \u201cWe have nowhere to go . . .\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Alexander came up close and cupped her face as he said in a trembling, encouraged voice, \u201cWe\u2019ll work it out, Tatiasha, I promise, somehow we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried.</p><p>His hands lowered.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . misunderstood,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI meant that there is nothing for us to do.\u201d</p><p>And then his eyes lowered.</p><p>And hers, too. \u201cShe is my sister,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just understand? I will not break my sister\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>Alexander took a step back and said coldly, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right, you already told me. There will be other boys. But never another sister.\u201d Without another word he turned around and began walking away.</p><p>Tatiana ran after him. \u201cAlexander, wait!\u201d</p><p>He kept walking.</p><p>Tatiana could not keep up. \u201cPlease, wait!\u201d she called into Ulitsa Govorova. She held on to the wall of a yellow stucco building, whispering, \u201cplease come back.\u201d</p><p>Alexander came back. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cI have to get back to the barracks.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana persisted. \u201cListen to me. If we stop now, at least there will be nothing to tell the people who are close to us, who love us, who depend on us not to betray them. Dasha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d Alexander came at her so suddenly that she staggered back, letting go of the wall and nearly falling to the pavement. He grabbed her by the arms. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he said. \u201cThe betrayal \u2014 it\u2019s an objective thing. What, you think just because we haven\u2019t told them yet it\u2019s not betrayal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. \u201cYou think when you can\u2019t look at me because you\u2019re afraid that everybody will see what I see, it\u2019s not betrayal? When your face lights up a block away as you fly out of your stupid job? When you leave your hair down, when those lips of yours quiver? Are they not betraying you?\u201d He was breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she said, red, upset, trying unsuccessfully to wrest herself away from him.</p><p>\u201cTatiana, every single minute that you have spent with me, you have lied to your sister, lied to Dimitri, to your parents, to God, and to yourself. When will you stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d Tatiana said in a whisper, \u201cyou stop.\u201d</p><p>He let go.</p><p>She was panting. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Tatiana said, unable to get a breath out. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t lied to myself. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d She paused. \u201cPlease . . . I don\u2019t want to fight with you. And I don\u2019t have the strength to hurt Dasha. I don\u2019t have the strength for any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe strength or the desire, Tania?\u201d</p><p>Opening her hands pleadingly, she said, \u201cThe strength. I\u2019ve never lied like this in my life.\u201d Realizing what she was admitting, Tatiana flushed with embarrassment, but what could she do? She had to bravely continue. \u201cYou have no idea what it costs me every day, every minute, every night to hide from Dasha. My blank stare, my gritted teeth, my casual disregard \u2014 do you have any idea what it costs me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do,\u201d he said, the grimmest of soldiers. \u201cI\u2019m the one who knows the truth. That\u2019s why I want to end this charade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnd it and then what?\u201d Tatiana exclaimed, flaring up. \u201cHave you thought this all the way through?\u201d She raised her voice. \u201cEnd it and then what? I\u2019ve still got to live with Dasha!\u201d She laughed with exasperation. \u201cWhat do you think, you think you can call on me after you are through with her? You think after you tell him, after I tell her, you\u2019ll be able to come over, have dinner? Chat with my family? And, Alexander, what about me? Where am I supposed to go? To the barracks with you? Don\u2019t you understand that I sleep in the same bed with her? And that I have nowhere else to go!\u201d Tatiana yelled. \u201cUnderstand,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can do what you like, you can end it with Dasha, but if you do, you will never be able to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t threaten me, Tatiana,\u201d Alexander said loudly, his eyes blazing. \u201cAnd I thought that was the whole point of this.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana groaned, ready to cry.</p><p>Lowering his voice, he said, \u201cAll right, don\u2019t be upset.\u201d He rubbed her arm.</p><p>\u201cThen stop upsetting me!\u201d</p><p>He took his hand away.</p><p>\u201cGo on with your life,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cYou\u2019re a man.\u201d She lowered her eyes. \u201cGo on with Dasha. She is right for you. She is a woman and I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlind!\u201d Alexander exclaimed.</p><p>Tatiana stood on Ulitsa Govorova, desolately failing in the battle of her heart. \u201cOh, Alexander,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat do you want from me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything!\u201d he whispered fiercely.</p><p>Tatiana shook her head, clenching her fists to her chest.</p><p>Running his hand down the length of her hair, Alexander said, \u201cTatia, I\u2019m asking you for the last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you for the last time,\u201d she said, barely able to get the words out.</p><p>Standing tall, Alexander stopped touching her.</p><p>She took a step forward, putting her gentle hand on him. \u201cShura . . . I don\u2019t own Dasha\u2019s life,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI cannot sacrifice my sister\u2019s life. I can\u2019t give it away to please you and me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he interrupted, pulling his arm away. \u201cYou\u2019ve made it very clear. I can see I was wrong about you. You can stop now. But I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m going to do it my way, not your way. I will end it with Dasha, and you will not see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you just go?\u201d Alexander said, pointing down the street. \u201cWalk away from me to the canal. Go home. Go to your Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura . . .\u201d she said with anguish.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d His voice was cold. He folded his arms. \u201cGo, I said! Walk away.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana blinked. Every night when they parted, an aching breath left her lungs where Alexander had been. She felt physically emptier in his absence. And up in her room she surrounded herself with other people to feel him less, to want him less. But invariably every night Tatiana had to climb into bed with her sister, and every night Tatiana would turn to the wall begging for strength.</p><p>I can do this, she thought. I\u2019ve spent seventeen years with Dasha and only three weeks with Alexander. I can do this. Feel one way. Behave one way, too.</p><p>Tatiana turned and walked away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>14</p><p>True to his word, the next time Dasha came to see him, Alexander took her for a short walk down Nevsky and told her that he needed some time to himself to think things through. Dasha cried, which he hated, because he hated to see women cry, and she pleaded, which he also did not like much. But he did not relent. Alexander could not tell Dasha he was furious with her younger sister. Furious with a shy, tiny thing who could fit into the palm of his hand if she crouched, yet who would not surrender one stride, not even for him.</p><p>A few days later Alexander almost felt glad he wasn\u2019t seeing Tatiana\u2019s face anymore. He found out that the Germans were just eighteen kilometers south of the barely fortified Luga line, which in turn was just eighteen kilometers south of Tolmachevo. Information came into the garrison that the Germans had combed through the entire town of Novgorod in a matter of a few hours. Novgorod, the town southeast of Luga, was where Tatiana cartwheeled into Lake Ilmen.</p><p>The People\u2019s Volunteer Army, though tens of thousands strong, had just begun digging the trenches in Luga.</p> <p>Anticipating the threat of the Finns, most of the resources for field mining, antitank trenching, and concrete reinforcements had gone to the north of Leningrad. The Finnish-Soviet front line in southern Karelia was the best-defended line in the Soviet Union \u2014 and the quietest. Dimitri must be happy, Alexander thought. Hitler\u2019s precipitous advance south of Leningrad, however, had caught the Red Army by surprise. They scrambled to build a line of defense along 125 kilometers of the Luga River from Lake Ilmen to Narva. There were some entrenchments, some gun emplacements, some tank traps dug, but not nearly enough. The Leningrad command, realizing that something had to be done and done immediately, loaded the concrete tank barriers from Karelia and trucked them down to Luga.</p><p>And all the while the Red Army had been retreating after days of constant fighting.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just retreating. It was relinquishing ground to the Germans at the rate of 500 kilometers in the first three weeks of war. There was no more air support, and the few tanks the Red Army had were insufficient, despite Tatiana\u2019s best efforts. In the middle of July the army comprised mostly rifle squads against the German Panzer units of tanks, mobile artillery, planes, and foot soldiers. The Soviets were running out of arms and out of men.</p><p>The hope for defending the Luga line now fell to the hordes of People\u2019s Volunteers, who had no training and, worse, no rifles. They were just a wall of old men and young women standing up against Hitler. What weapons they could pick up, they picked up from the dead Red Army soldiers. Some volunteers had shovels, axes, and picks, but many did not have even that.</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t want to think about how sticks held up to German tanks. He knew.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>SMOKE AND THUNDER</p><p>TATIANA\u2019S world changed after Alexander stopped coming to see her. She was now one of the last people to leave work. As she slowly walked out the double doors of the factory, she still turned her head expectantly, hoping that maybe she would see his head, his uniform, his rifle, his cap in his hands.</p><p>Down the length of the Kirov wall Tatiana walked, waiting for the buses to pick up passengers. She sat on the bench and waited for him. And then she walked the eight kilometers back to Fifth Soviet, looking for him, seeing him, in fact, everywhere. By the time she would get home at eleven or later, the dinner her family had prepared at seven was old and cold. At home everyone listened tensely to the radio, not speaking about the only thing that was on their minds \u2014 Pasha.</p><p>Dasha came home one evening in tears and told Tatiana that Alexander wanted to take a break. She cried for five straight minutes while Tatiana gently patted her back. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to give up, Tania,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cI\u2019m not. He means too much to me. He is going through something. I think he is afraid of commitment, like most soldiers. But I\u2019m not going to give up. He said he needed a little time to think. That doesn\u2019t mean forever; that\u2019s just until he sorts himself out, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Dashenka.\u201d What kind of person said he was going to do something and then did? No person Tatiana knew.</p><p>Dimitri came to see her once, and they spent an hour together surrounded by her family. She was mildly surprised that he hadn\u2019t been by more often, but he made some \u2014 Tatiana thought lame \u2014 excuse. He seemed distracted. He had no information on the position of the Germans in the Soviet Union. His mouth on her cheek at the end of the night was as distant as Finland.</p><p>Up on the roof the kids from the building looked for excitement, for incendiary bombs to put out. There weren\u2019t any bombs. It was quiet at night, except for the laughing of Anton and his friends next to her, except for the beating of her heart.</p><p>Up on the roof Tatiana thought about the evening minute, the minute she used to walk out the factory doors, turn her head to the left even before her body turned, and look for his face. The evening minute as she hurried down the street, her happiness curling her mouth upward to the white sky, the red wings speeding her to him, to look up at him and smile.</p><p>At night she was still turned to the wall, her back to the absent Dasha, who was never home.</p> <p>Tatiana would have continued this wretched way, but one morning the Metanovs heard on the radio that the Germans were trouncing their way through the countryside and, despite all measures taken by the heroic Soviet soldiers, were nearly at Luga. It wasn\u2019t the Luga part that stunned the family and made them unable to eat or talk to each other. It was that they all knew that Luga was mere kilometers from Tolmachevo, where Pasha was safely, they thought \u2014 no, were sure \u2014 ensconced at camp.</p><p>If the Germans were about to steamroll through Luga, what was to happen to Tolmachevo? Where was their son, their grandson, their brother?</p><p>Tatiana tried to console her family with hollow words. \u201cHe is fine, he\u2019ll be all right.\u201d When that didn\u2019t work, she tried, \u201cWe\u2019ll get in touch with him. Come on, Mama, don\u2019t cry.\u201d When that didn\u2019t work, she tried, \u201cMama, I can feel him still out there. He is my twin brother. He is all right, I\u2019m telling you.\u201d Nothing worked.</p><p>There remained no word on Pasha, and Tatiana, despite her brave talk, became increasingly afraid for her brother.</p><p>The local Soviet had no answers. The borough Soviet also had no answers. Tatiana and her mother went there together.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I tell you?\u201d the stern, mustachioed woman told Mama. \u201cMy information says only that the Germans are near Luga. It doesn\u2019t say anything about Tolmachevo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why isn\u2019t there any answer when we try to call the camps?\u201d Mama demanded. \u201cWhy are the phones not working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do I look like, Comrade Stalin? Do I have all the answers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get to Tolmachevo?\u201d Mama asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Can you get to the front? Can you take a bus, comrade, to the front? Yes, sure. Good luck to you.\u201d The woman\u2019s gray mustache moved as she laughed. \u201cNatalia, come here, you have to hear this.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wanted to say something rude back, but she couldn\u2019t muster the courage. Wishing she had tried harder to convince her family about Pasha, she led her mother out of the borough council office.</p><p>That night when Tatiana was pretending to sleep, her face to the wall, her hand on the floor below on Alexander\u2019s copy of The Bronze Horseman, she overheard her parents whispering tearfully to each other. It started with her mother\u2019s quiet sobbing, followed by her father\u2019s comforting \u201cShh, shh.\u201d Then he was sobbing, too, and Tatiana wanted to be anywhere but where she was.</p><p>Little whispers came to her, fragmented sentences, mournful longings.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he is all right,\u201d she heard her mother say.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d echoed her father.</p><p>\u201cOh, Georg. We can\u2019t lose our Pasha. We can\u2019t.\u201d She moaned. \u201cOur boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur favorite boy,\u201d added Papa. \u201cOur only son.\u201d</p><p>Mama sobbed.</p><p>Tatiana heard the sheets rustling. Her mother sniffed.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of God would take him away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no God. Come now, Irina,\u201d Papa said in a comforting voice. \u201cNot so loud. You\u2019ll wake the girls.\u201d</p><p>Mama cried out. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she said, nonetheless lowering her voice to a whisper once more. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t God take one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrina, don\u2019t say that. You don\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Georg, why? I know you feel the same way. Wouldn\u2019t you give up Tania for our son? Or even Dasha? But Tania is so timid and weak, she\u2019s never going to amount to anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a life can she have here anyway, timid or not?\u201d said Tatiana\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cNot like our son,\u201d said Mama. \u201cNot like our Pasha.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana put the sheet over her ears so she wouldn\u2019t hear any more. Dasha continued to sleep. Mama and Papa soon fell asleep themselves. But Tatiana remained awake, the words crashing their agonizing tune on her ears. Why couldn\u2019t God take Tania instead of Pasha? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>The next day after work, filled with apprehension, not believing her own nerve, Tatiana went to Pavlov Barracks. To a smiling Sergeant Petrenko she gave Alexander\u2019s name and waited, standing against the wall, hoping for some strength in her legs.</p><p>Minutes later Alexander walked through the gate. The sharply tense expression on his face dissolved momentarily into . . . but only momentarily. He had circles under his eyes. \u201cHello, Tatiana,\u201d he said coolly, and stood a polite distance from her in the dank passageway. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d Tatiana replied. \u201cWhat about you? You look\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Blinking, Alexander replied, \u201cEverything is fine. How have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so good,\u201d Tatiana admitted and became immediately afraid he would think it was because of him. \u201cOne thing . . .\u201d She wanted to keep her voice from breaking. There was fear for Pasha, but there was something else, too. She didn\u2019t want Alexander to know it. She would try to hide it from him.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, is there a way you could find out for us about Pasha . . . ?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her with pity. \u201cOh, Tania,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Could you?\u201d She added, \u201cMy parents, they\u2019re in despair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetter not to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Mama and Papa need to know. They just can\u2019t function.\u201d I need to know. I just can\u2019t function.</p><p>\u201cYou think it would be easier if they knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019s always better to know. Because then they could deal with the truth.\u201d She looked away even as she was speaking. \u201cThis is breaking them apart, the uncertainty over him.\u201d When Alexander didn\u2019t reply, Tatiana, chewing her lip, said, \u201cIf they knew, then Dasha and I and maybe Mama, too, would go to Molotov with Deda and Babushka.\u201d</p><p>Alexander lit a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cWill you try \u2014 Alexander?\u201d She was glad to say his name out loud. She wanted to touch his arm. So happy and so miserable to see his face again, she wanted to come closer to him. He wasn\u2019t wearing his full uniform. He must have come from his quarters, because he wore a barely buttoned shirt that was not even tucked into his army trousers. Couldn\u2019t she come closer to him? No, she couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>He smoked silently. Tilting his head, he didn\u2019t stop looking at her. Tatiana tried not to show him the expression in her eyes. She mustered a pale smile.</p><p>\u201cYou will go to Molotov?\u201d Alexander asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Alexander said without inflection or hesitation. \u201cTania, whether or not I will find out about Pasha, know this \u2014 you have to go. Your grandfather is lucky to get a post. Most people are not getting evacuated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents say the city is still the safest place right now. That\u2019s why so many thousands are coming to Leningrad from the countryside,\u201d Tatiana said with quiet authority.</p><p>\u201cNo place in the Soviet Union is safe,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d she said, lowering her voice.</p><p>Alexander leaned toward her, and Tatiana raised her eyes to him, not just eagerly but avidly. \u201cWhat? What?\u201d she whispered, but before he could say anything, Dimitri sprinted out of the gate.</p> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d he said to Tatiana, frowning. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was coming up to see you,\u201d said Tatiana quickly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m having a smoke,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cHe needs to stop smoking just as you\u2019re coming up to see me,\u201d Dimitri said to Tatiana. He smiled. \u201cVery nice of you to come, though. I\u2019m touched.\u201d He put his arm around her. \u201cLet me walk you home, Tanechka,\u201d he said, leading her away. \u201cDo you want to go somewhere? It\u2019s a nice evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you, Tania,\u201d she heard Alexander call after her. Tatiana was ready to break down.</p><p>Alexander went to see Colonel Mikhail Stepanov.</p><p>Alexander had served under Colonel Stepanov in the Winter War of 1940 with Finland, when the colonel was a captain and Alexander was a second lieutenant. The colonel had had many chances for promotion, not just to brigadier but to major general, but he refused, preferring to keep his rank and run the Leningrad garrison.</p><p>Colonel Stepanov was a tall man, nearly as tall as Alexander. He was slender and carried himself stiffly, but the movements of his body were gentle, and in his blue eyes hung a sad haze that remained even when he smiled at Alexander.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sir,\u201d Alexander said, saluting him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Lieutenant,\u201d said the colonel, coming out from behind his desk. \u201cAt ease, soldier.\u201d They shook hands. Then Stepanov stepped away and went back behind his desk. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? How is Major Orlov treating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine, sir. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Alexander cleared his throat. \u201cI just came for some information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said at ease.\u201d</p><p>Alexander moved his feet apart and placed his hands behind his back. \u201cThe volunteers, sir, what\u2019s been happening to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe volunteers? You know what\u2019s been happening, Lieutenant Belov. You\u2019ve been training them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean near Luga, near Novgorod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNovgorod?\u201d Stepanov shook his head. \u201cThe volunteers were involved in some battles there. The situation in Novgorod is not good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntrained Soviet women throwing grenades at Panzer tanks. Some didn\u2019t even have grenades. They threw rocks.\u201d Colonel Stepanov peered into Alexander\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s your interest in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColonel,\u201d said Alexander, clicking his heels together, \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a seventeen-year-old boy who went to a boys\u2019 camp near Tolmachevo. There is no answer from the camps, and his family is panicked.\u201d Alexander paused, staring at the colonel. \u201cA young boy, sir. His name is Pavel Metanov. He went to a camp in Dohotino.\u201d</p><p>The colonel stood quietly for a few moments, studying Alexander, and finally said, \u201cGo attend to your duties. I\u2019ll see what I can find out. I\u2019m not promising anything.\u201d</p><p>Alexander saluted him. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Later that evening Dimitri came to the quarters Alexander shared with three other officers. They were all playing cards. A cigarette hung languidly in Alexander\u2019s mouth as he was shuffling. He barely turned his head to look at Dimitri.</p><p>Crouching beside Alexander\u2019s chair, Dimitri cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cSalute your commanding officer, Chernenko,\u201d said Second Lieutenant Anatoly Marazov, not looking up from his cards. Dimitri stood and saluted Marazov. \u201cSir,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAt ease, Private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Dima?\u201d Alexander asked.</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d said Dimitri quietly, crouching again. \u201cNowhere to go and talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk right here. Everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine. Rumors are we\u2019re staying put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not staying put, Chernenko,\u201d said Marazov. \u201cWe\u2019re staying to defend Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Finns are calling themselves co-belligerents.\u201d Dimitri snorted derisively. \u201cIf they ally with the Germans, we\u2019re as good as dead. We might as well hang up our arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d said Marazov. \u201cBelov, did you give me this soldier?\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned to Dimitri. \u201cLieutenant Marazov is right. Dima, I\u2019m surprised by your attitude. Frankly, it\u2019s not like you.\u201d Alexander stopped his voice from inflection.</p><p>Dimitri smiled slyly. \u201cAlexander,\u201d he said, \u201cnot quite what we hoped for when we joined the army?\u201d</p><p>When Alexander didn\u2019t reply, Dimitri said, \u201cI mean, war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, war was not what I hoped for. Is it what anyone hopes for?\u201d Alexander paused. \u201cIs it what you hoped for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, as you know. But I had far fewer choices than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had choices, Belov?\u201d asked Marazov.</p><p>Putting down his cards, Alexander stubbed out his cigarette and stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he said to the other officers and strode out. With smaller footsteps Dimitri followed behind. There were too many officers in the corridor; they walked downstairs and through the side door, out onto the cobbled courtyard. It was past one in the morning. The sky was three shades darker than gray.</p><p>A few feet away from them three soldiers stood smoking. But this was as alone as they were going to get. Alexander said, \u201cDima, you need to stop this nonsense. I had no choices. Don\u2019t go believing that. What choices did I have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe choice to be somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Alexander made no reply. He wished he were anywhere else, other than standing in front of Dimitri, who said, \u201cFinland is too dangerous for us right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Alexander did not want to talk about Finland.</p><p>\u201cToo many men on both sides, NKVD border troops everywhere. The Lisiy Nos area is full of troops \u2014 theirs and ours \u2014 and barbed wire and mines. It\u2019s not safe at all. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do. Are you sure the Finns will come down to Lisiy Nos from Vyborg?\u201d</p><p>Alexander smoked and said nothing. Finally he spoke. \u201cYes. Eventually. They will want their old borders back. They\u2019ll come to Lisiy Nos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else can we do? We\u2019ll bide our time then,\u201d Dimitri said. When Alexander didn\u2019t comment, Dimitri continued. \u201cWill the right time ever come again, Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Dima. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri sighed. \u201cWell, in the meantime, can you move me out of the First Rifle Regiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDima, I already got you out of the Second Infantry Battalion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m still too close to possible attack. Marazov\u2019s men are the second line. I\u2019d rather be recon, or clean-up. Or running supplies, something like that.\u201d He paused. \u201cBest chance for success in running, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be running supplies? Ammunition to front-line troops?\u201d Alexander asked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking more of mail and cigarettes to rear units.\u201d</p><p>Alexander smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Dimitri said, stubbing out his cigarette on the pavement. \u201cTry to be more cheerful. What\u2019s the matter with you these days? Everything is all right still. The Germans aren\u2019t here; we\u2019re having a great summer.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing.</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d said Dimitri, \u201cI wanted to talk to you about something. . . . Tania is such a nice girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania. She is such a nice girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri said nothing for a while. \u201cAnd I want her to stay that way. She really shouldn\u2019t be coming here. And talking to you, of all people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019re all good friends, and she is the kid sister of your fancy-woman, but frankly, I don\u2019t want your reputation rubbing off on my nice girl. After all,\u201d Dimitri said, \u201cshe is not like one of your garrison hacks\u2014\u201d</p><p>Taking a step toward Dimitri, Alexander said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just joking. Is Dasha still coming to see you? I haven\u2019t been over there much. Tania works crazy hours. Dasha still comes, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Every night without fail Dasha would show up, trying everything she knew to get him back. But he wasn\u2019t about to tell Dimitri his business with Dasha.</p><p>\u201cWell, all the more reason Tania shouldn\u2019t come here. It would upset Dasha needlessly, wouldn\u2019t it, if she were to find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.\u201d Alexander stared at Dimitri, who did not blanch. \u201cHave you got another cigarette?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri immediately reached into the pocket of his khaki trousers. \u201cLove it. A first lieutenant asking a lowly private for a fag. I always like it when you ask me to do something for you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander took the cigarette and said nothing.</p><p>Dimitri cleared his throat. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say you had some feelings for the diminutive Tanechka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know better, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri shrugged. \u201cI guess. Just the way you were looking at her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d said Alexander, cutting him off and taking a deep drag of the cigarette. \u201cIt\u2019s in your head.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri gave a sigh. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019ve fallen bad for that girl.\u201d</p><p>The cigarette slowly burned to ash between Alexander\u2019s fingers. \u201cYou have?\u201d he asked at last.</p><p>\u201cYes. Why is that such a surprise?\u201d Dimitri laughed wholeheartedly. \u201cYou think a cad like me is too low for a girl like Tania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut from what I\u2019ve heard, you haven\u2019t stopped your Sadko activities.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri shrugged. \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d Before Alexander could reply, Dimitri came a little closer to him, lowered his voice, and said, \u201cTania is young and has asked me to go slow. I am very respectful of her wishes and patient with her.\u201d He arched his eyebrows. \u201cShe is really coming around, though\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alexander threw down the cigarette butt and stamped it out with his boot. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re finished here.\u201d He started walking back to his building.</p><p>Dimitri caught up with him and grabbed him by the arm.</p><p>Alexander whirled around, yanking his arm easily from Dimitri\u2019s grip. \u201cDon\u2019t grab me, Dimitri.\u201d His eyes flashed. The sky turned another shade of gray. \u201cI\u2019m not Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>Taking a few quick steps back from Alexander, Dimitri said, \u201cAll right, all right. Stop it.\u201d He took another step back. \u201cYou\u2019ve really got to do something about that temper of yours, Alexander Barrington.\u201d He enunciated every syllable. And then he backed farther away and smiled. He seemed smaller, his little teeth sharper and more yellow, his hair more greasy, his eyes narrower in the coming of night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>3</p><p>Tatiana ran to work the next morning, carrying hope with her. She had learned to ignore the ignoble, ever-present, blue-uniformed NKVD militia troops standing by the front doors of Kirov with their obscene rifles, walking through the factory floors, almost marching, carrying their weapons close to their hips. A few of them would look at her as she passed by, and it was the only time in her life when she wished she were smaller than she already was and less noticeable. With their grave, unyielding faces, they stared at Tatiana, hardly blinking, while she blinked frequently as she hurried past them, pushing through the doors, to the relative anonymity of the assembly line.</p><p>So that the workers didn\u2019t get bored and therefore negligent on any one production facet of the KV-1, they were moved around every two hours. Tatiana went from working the pulley that lifted the treadless tank and placed it on tread, to painting the red star on a finished tank ready to be flatbedded and put into production. She spray-painted not only the red star but the white words for stalin! on the hull that stood out markedly against the glossy green paint.</p><p>Ilya, the skinny boy with the crew cut, had not left Tatiana alone after Alexander stopped coming at night. He would ask her all sorts of questions that she was too polite not to answer, but in the end even Tatiana gave way to slight rudeness. I have to concentrate on my work, she would tell him, wondering how in the world he always managed to get a position next to her, no matter how many times she got transferred during the day to different tank-building responsibilities. In the canteen Ilya would get his plate and sit next to her and Zina, who could not stand him and frequently told him so.</p> <p>But today Tatiana felt sorrier for him. \u201cHe is just lonely,\u201d she said, biting into her meat cutlet, lapping up the gravy, her mouth full. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to have anybody. Stay, Ilya.\u201d So Ilya stayed.</p><p>Tatiana could afford to be generous. She couldn\u2019t wait for her day to end. After going to see Alexander yesterday, she was certain he would come after work to see her at Kirov. She wore her lightest skirt and her lightest, softest blouse, and even had a bath in the morning, having just taken one the night before.</p><p>That evening she ran out of the Kirov doors, her golden hair shining and down, her face scrubbed and pink, and turned her smiling head, breathless for Alexander.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>It was after eight, and she sat on the bench until after nine with her hands on her lap. Then she got up and walked home.</p> <p>There was no news of Pasha, and Mama and Papa were miserable. They kept crying intermittently. Dasha was not home. Deda and Babushka were slowly packing their things. Tatiana went out onto the roof and sat watching the airships float like white whales across the northern sky, listening to Anton and Kirill reading Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace, evoking their brother Volodya, lost in Tolmachevo. Tatiana listened with half an ear, thinking of her brother Pasha, lost in Tolmachevo.</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t come to see her. He had no news. Or the news he had was bad and he couldn\u2019t face her. But Tatiana knew the truth: he didn\u2019t come to see her because he was done. Done with her, with her childish ways, done with that part of his life. They had been friends walking in the Summer Garden, but he was a man, and now he was done.</p><p>He was right, of course, not to come. And she would not cry.</p><p>But to face Kirov day after day without him and without Pasha, too, to face evening after evening without him and without Pasha, to face war, to face herself without Alexander and without Pasha filled Tatiana with such a pervasive emptiness that she nearly groaned out loud, right in front of the laughing Anton and Kirill.</p><p>She needed just one thing now \u2014 to lay her eyes on the boy who had breathed the same air as her for seventeen years, in the same school, in the same class, in the same room, in the same womb. She wanted her friend and her twin back.</p><p>Tatiana thought she could feel Pasha while sitting out on the roof under the darkening sky; the white nights had ended on July 16. Her brother was not harmed. He was waiting for Tatiana to come for him, and she would not fail him. She wasn\u2019t going to be like the rest of her family, sitting around, smoking, fretting. Doing nothing. Tatiana knew: five minutes with Pasha\u2019s light heart and she would forget much of the last month.</p> <p>She would forget Alexander. And she needed to do something to forget Alexander.</p><p>After everyone had gone to bed, Tatiana went downstairs, got a pair of kitchen scissors, and began to mercilessly lop off her blonde hair, watching it fall in long strands into the communal sink. Afterward the small, grimy mirror showed only a vague reflection. All she saw was her sulky lips and her sad, hollow eyes that glowed greener without the hair to frame her face. The freckles on her nose and under her eyes stood out even more prominently. Did she look like a boy? All the better. Did she look younger? More frail? What would Alexander think of all her hair gone? Who cared? She knew what he would think. Shura, Shura, Shura.</p><p>Just as dawn was breaking, Tatiana put on the only pair of beige trousers she could find, packed some baking soda and peroxide for her teeth, her toothbrush \u2014 she never took trips without her toothbrush \u2014 retrieved Pasha\u2019s sleeping bag from his old days at camp, left a one-sentence note for her family, and set out for Kirov on foot.</p><p>During her last morning at work Tatiana was assigned to the diesel engines. She screwed the glow plugs into the combustion chambers. The plugs warmed up the compressed air in the cylinders before ignition could take place. She was very good at that part of the assembly, having performed it many times before, so she did her job mindlessly, while all morning struggling with her nerve.</p><p>At lunchtime she went to see Krasenko, bringing a willing Zina along, and told him they both wanted to join the People\u2019s Volunteer Army. Zina had talked about joining the volunteers for over a week.</p><p>Krasenko told her she was too young.</p><p>She persisted.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this, Tania?\u201d Krasenko asked with sympathy in his voice. \u201cLuga is not for a girl like you.\u201d</p> <p>She told him she knew how hopeless things were there. The bulletin boards at work shouted, \u201cAt Luga \u2014 to the trenches!\u201d She said she knew that boys and girls of fourteen and fifteen were working in the fields digging trenches. She and Zina wanted to do all they could to help the Red Army soldiers. Zina nodded mutely. Tatiana knew she needed special dispensation from Krasenko. \u201cPlease, Sergei Andreevich,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tatiana persisted. She told Krasenko she would take leave that was due to her, starting tomorrow, and get down to Luga one way or another if she had to. She was leaving, with or without his help. Tatiana was not afraid of Krasenko. She knew he liked her. \u201cSergei Andreevich, you can\u2019t keep me here. How would it look if you were keeping eager volunteers from helping their motherland, helping the Red Army?\u201d</p><p>Zina stood nodding by Tatiana\u2019s side.</p><p>Krasenko sighed heavily and wrote them both passes and permissions to leave Kirov and stamped their domestic passports. As they were about to leave, he got up and wished her luck. Tatiana wanted to tell him she was going to go and find her brother, but she didn\u2019t want him to talk her out of it, so she said nothing except thank you.</p><p>The girls went to a dark, gymnasium-size room, where after a physical exam they were outfitted with pickaxes and shovels that Tatiana found much too heavy for her, and were then sent to Warsaw Station on the bus to catch the special military truck transportation destined for Luga.</p><p>Tatiana wondered if they were going to be armored trucks like the ones that transported paintings from the Hermitage or like the ones that Alexander said he sometimes drove to the south of Leningrad.</p><p>They weren\u2019t. They were just regular trucks covered with khaki tarpaulin, the kind Tatiana saw constantly around Leningrad.</p><p>Tatiana and Zina climbed aboard. Forty more people piled in. Tatiana observed the soldiers loading crates onto the truck. They would have to sit on them. \u201cWhat\u2019s in them?\u201d she asked one of the soldiers.</p><p>\u201cGrenades,\u201d he replied, grinning.</p><p>Tatiana stood.</p><p>The trucks left Warsaw Station in a convoy of seven and started down the highway, bound south for Luga.</p><p>In Gatchina everyone was told to get off and take a military train the rest of the way.</p><p>\u201cZina,\u201d Tatiana said to her friend, \u201cit\u2019s good we\u2019re taking the train. That way we can get off in Tolmachevo, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, crazy?\u201d said Zina. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to Luga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You and I will get off, and then we\u2019ll get back on another train and go to Luga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZina, yes. Please. I have to get off in Tolmachevo. I have to find my brother.\u201d</p><p>Zina stared at Tatiana with incredulity. \u201cTania! When you told me Minsk had fallen, did I say to you, come with me because I have to find my sister?\u201d she said, her small, dark eyes blinking, her mouth tight.</p><p>\u201cNo, Zina, but I don\u2019t think Tolmachevo has fallen to the Germans yet. I still have hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting off,\u201d Zina said. \u201cI\u2019m going like everybody else to Luga, and I\u2019m going to help our soldiers, like everybody else. I don\u2019t want to get shot by the NKVD as a deserter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZina!\u201d Tatiana exclaimed. \u201cHow can you be a deserter? You\u2019re a volunteer. Please come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting off, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Zina said, turning her head away from Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>4</p><p>A corporal stuck his head into Alexander\u2019s quarters and shouted that Colonel Stepanov wanted to see him.</p><p>Colonel Stepanov was writing in his journal. He looked more tired than he had three days ago. Alexander patiently waited. The colonel looked up, and Alexander saw black bags under his blue eyes and taut lines in his face effected by the exertion of his will upon unwilling subjects.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant, sorry it took me a while. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have much good news for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>The colonel looked down into his journal.</p><p>\u201cThe situation in Novgorod was desperate. When the Red Army realized the Germans were surrounding the nearby villages only kilometers away, they recruited the young men from several camps around Luga and Tolmachevo to help entrench the town. One of those camps was Dohotino. I don\u2019t know specifically about a Pavel Metanov . . .\u201d The colonel cleared his throat. \u201cAs you know the German advance was much faster than we anticipated.\u201d</p><p>It was Soviet-speak. It was like listening to the radio. They said this, but they meant that.</p><p>\u201cColonel? What?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Germans got past Novgorod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the young boys from the camps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLieutenant, beyond what I already told you, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He paused. \u201cHow well did you know this boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know his family well, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA personal stake in this?\u201d</p><p>Alexander blinked. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>Colonel Stepanov was very quiet, playing with his pen, looking at the pages in his journal, not looking at Alexander, even when he spoke at last. \u201cI wish I had something better to tell you, Alexander. The Germans ran over Novgorod with their tanks. Remember Colonel Yanov? He perished. The Germans shot soldiers and civilians indiscriminately, they pillaged what they could, and then they burned the town.\u201d</p><p>Not backing away from the table, not looking away from Colonel Stepanov\u2019s face, Alexander said steadily, \u201cLet me understand. The Red Army sent underage boys into battle?\u201d</p><p>Stepanov stood up behind his desk. \u201cSurely you\u2019re not telling us how to run our war, Lieutenant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be disrespectful.\u201d Alexander struck his heels together, saluted the colonel, but didn\u2019t move. \u201cBut to use untrained boys along with battle-trained, command-experienced officers as fodder for the Nazis is sheer military madness.\u201d</p><p>Colonel Stepanov did not come out from behind the desk. The two men were quiet, one young, the other already old at forty-four. Then the colonel spoke. \u201cTell the family their son died to save Mother Russia,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cHe died in the service of our great leader, Comrade Stalin.\u201d</p><p>Later that morning Alexander was called to the entry gate. He made his way downstairs, fearing it was Tatiana. He couldn\u2019t face her just yet. He was going to meet her at Kirov in the evening. He saw Dasha standing with Petrenko. She looked shaken and tense.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked her, leading her aside, hoping she, too, wouldn\u2019t ask him about Tolmachevo and Pasha, but she stuck a piece of paper into his hand and said, \u201cLook at this, just look what my crazy sister has done!\u201d</p><p>He opened the note. It was the first time he was seeing Tatiana\u2019s handwriting. It was round, small, and neat. Dear Mama and Papa, the note read. I\u2019ve gone to join the People\u2019s Volunteers to find Pasha and bring him back for you. Tania.</p> <p>Making every effort to control his facial expression, Alexander gave the note back to Dasha with careful fingers and said, \u201cShe left when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday morning. We got up and she was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha, why didn\u2019t you come to me right away? She\u2019s been gone since yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought she was just kidding. That she would come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hope,\u201d Alexander enunciated slowly, \u201cthat she would come back with Pasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know! She gets these ideas into her head. I honestly don\u2019t know what she is thinking. She can\u2019t go to the store by herself, much less to the front. Mama and Papa are beside themselves. They were so worried about Pasha, and now this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they worried, or are they angry?\u201d asked Alexander.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re frantic. They\u2019re deathly afraid for her. She\u2014\u201d Dasha broke off. Tears were in her eyes. \u201cDearest,\u201d Dasha said, coming close to him. She put her arms around him, but Alexander\u2019s face remained as closed as a bank on a holiday. \u201cAlexander,\u201d she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know who to turn to. Help us, please. Help us find my sister. We can\u2019t lose my Tania . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Dasha said. \u201cWill you do this . . . for me?\u201d</p><p>Patting her on the back, Alexander stepped away. \u201cLet me see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Alexander bypassed his immediate commander, Major Orlov, and went straight to Colonel Stepanov. He got authorization to take twenty volunteers and two sergeants to drive an armored truck loaded with munitions south to the Luga line. Alexander knew that the line badly needed to be strengthened. He told Stepanov he would be back in a few days.</p><p>Before dismissing Alexander, Stepanov said, \u201cBring yourself back. Bring the men back, Lieutenant.\u201d He paused. \u201cAs always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do my best, sir,\u201d said Alexander. He had not seen many volunteers come back to the garrison.</p><p>Before he left, he went to see Dimitri and offered him a spot on the squad. Dimitri refused. \u201cDima,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cyou should come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go where they send me,\u201d said Dimitri, shaking his head, \u201cbut I\u2019m not swimming voluntarily into the jaws of the shark. Have you heard about what\u2019s happened to Novgorod?\u201d</p><p>Alexander drove the armored truck himself. It was filled with men, thirty-five Nagant rifles, thirty-five brand-new Tokarev rifles, two boxes of hand grenades, three crates of field mines, seven boxes of ammunition, a stack of oval artillery shells, and a keg of gunpowder for the mortars. Alexander thought it was good that the truck was armored.</p><p>He wished he had one of the tanks Tatiana had made.</p><p>The three towns followed in order from Leningrad: Gatchina was first, then Tolmachevo, then Luga. By the time Alexander reached Gatchina, he could already hear the distant thunder of artillery. His fleet of men trembled behind him as he made his way down the unpaved road. He heard bombs exploding like fireworks, and as if in a dream his father\u2019s face flashed before him, wanting to know what Alexander was doing near death\u2019s door before it was his time. He said, \u201cDad, I\u2019m going for her,\u201d and Sergeant Oleg Kashnikov, a brawny young soldier, said, \u201cWhat did you say, Lieutenant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Sometimes I do that. Talk to my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Lieutenant, that wasn\u2019t Russian,\u201d Kashnikov said. \u201cIt sounded like English, but what do I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot English, just gibberish,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>When Alexander and his men got out at Luga, the noise of artillery fire was no longer distant. The land was flat, and in the horizon there was smoke and sound. It wasn\u2019t a sound signifying nothing, thought Alexander. It was the thunder of anger and of death.</p><p>During the evening of one Fourth of July barbecue, the family had gone out sailing on the sea in Nantucket Sound and watched the fireworks from their boat. Seven-year-old Alexander lifted his head up to the sky, enchanted by the rainbow lights exploding loudly overhead. He couldn\u2019t imagine anything more spectacular than these vibrant colors showering the sky with life.</p><p>Straight ahead was the approach to Luga River. To the left were fields, and to the right was a forest. Alexander spotted children who were maybe ten years old picking what remained of this year\u2019s crops. On the perimeter of the fields, soldiers and older men and women were digging trenches. He knew that after the crops were picked, the fields would be mined.</p><p>Calmly, holding his rifle tightly, Alexander told his men to stay put while he went to find Colonel Pyadyshev, who was organizing the defense line for a twelve-kilometer stretch along the river. Pyadyshev was pleased about the extra arms and immediately had his soldiers unload them and prepare to divide them up. \u201cOnly seventy rifles, Lieutenant?\u201d he said to Alexander.</p><p>\u201cAll we have, sir,\u201d Alexander replied. \u201cMore are coming.\u201d</p><p>Then Alexander took his twenty charges closer to the river bank, where they received shovels and dug for a few hours. With a pair of binoculars Alexander searched the forest on the other side of the river and determined that the Germans had already advanced to contact, though they had not yet brought themselves into full offensive position.</p><p>The men had a bite to eat out of the canned goods they had brought with them. They drank water from the river. Alexander then left his two sergeants, Kashnikov and Shapkov, in charge, and went to find the group of volunteers who had come with the Kirov Works over four days ago.</p><p>He didn\u2019t find anyone that day. But the next day he found Zina. She was in the field, bent over with her shovel. She was digging out the potatoes and throwing them into the basket, dirt and all. Alexander suggested she clean the dirt off first, to make more room for actual potatoes. Zina glared at him, prepared to say something rude, but then looked at his red star and his rifle and said nothing. Alexander saw that she did not recognize him. Not everyone can have my memory for faces, he thought. \u201cI\u2019m looking for your friend,\u201d he said to Zina. \u201cIs she here with you? Young girl, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>Zina looked up at him, and fear flashed through her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen her,\u201d Zina said. \u201cI think she must be over there.\u201d She waved her arm.</p><p>What\u2019s she afraid of? wondered Alexander, breathing a relieved sigh. \u201cSo she is here. Over where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We got separated after we got off the train.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeparated where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d She was plainly nervous. She missed her basket completely, and the potatoes fell on the ground. Not picking them up, she continued to dig.</p><p>Alexander banged the ground twice with his rifle. \u201cComrade Atapova! Stop. Straighten up. Stand up, stop moving.\u201d Zina quickly did. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you wondering how I know your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a way of finding these things out,\u201d mumbled Zina.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Alexander Belov,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to come to Kirov to meet Tatiana. That\u2019s how I know your name. Now do you remember?\u201d</p><p>Relief showed on Zina\u2019s dirt-covered, unfriendly face.</p><p>\u201cTatiana\u2019s family is very worried about her. Do you know where she is?\u201d</p><p>Relief mixed with defensiveness. \u201cListen,\u201d Zina barked, \u201cshe wanted me to get off with her, but I said I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m not a deserter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off with her where? And you can\u2019t be a deserter,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cYou\u2019re in the volunteer army.\u201d</p><p>Zina didn\u2019t seem to or want to understand. \u201cWell, in any case I haven\u2019t seen her for days. She didn\u2019t come to Luga with us. She jumped off the train at Tolmachevo.\u201d</p><p>Alexander paled. \u201cWhen you say jumped off the train . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, the train slowed down a bit at an intersection, and she stepped down the rung and jumped. I saw her rolling down the hill.\u201d</p><p>Steeling his face, he said, \u201cWhy did you let her jump off the train?\u201d</p><p>Raising her voice, Zina said, \u201cLet her? Who let her? I said, don\u2019t do it. She wanted me to come with her.\u201d She laughed. \u201cShe wanted me to jump off a train! Why should I go with her? I\u2019m not looking for my brother. I came to join the People\u2019s Volunteer Army. For Mother Russia.\u201d</p><p>As he stepped away from her, Alexander said, \u201cSo for Mother Russia you would jump off the train, comrade?\u201d</p><p>Zina had no answer. She turned away from him and continued to dig the potatoes, mumbling, \u201cI wasn\u2019t jumping off any train. I wasn\u2019t going to be a deserter.\u201d</p><p>Alexander quickly went to find some of his men. He took Kashnikov and five volunteers and drove the truck, now emptied of munitions, north to Tolmachevo. The town itself was nearly deserted. They drove through the streets, finally finding a woman carrying a child and a satchel. The woman told them Dohotino was three kilometers west. \u201cBut you won\u2019t find nobody there,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody there at all.\u201d</p><p>They drove there anyway. The woman was right. All the huts had been long abandoned and the village bombed. There had been a fire, which had burned a swath through half a dozen homes. Still Alexander called out for her. \u201cTania!\u201d he called. \u201cTatiana!\u201d</p><p>He looked inside every single hut, even the burned-down ones. His men called for her also. It sounded foreign to him, her name coming off strangers\u2019 tongues. But Kashnikov was a good sergeant. He didn\u2019t question Alexander. The men were glad to help, if only to get away from the monotony of trench digging.</p><p>\u201cTania! Tania!\u201d Their voices echoed through the small farming village in the middle of fields and woods. They did not find a soul. They found bits and pieces on the ground, blankets, singed backpacks, toothbrushes.</p><p>On the outskirts of Dohotino there was a small sign with an arrow: Dohotino Boys Camp. The seven men walked two kilometers through a wooded path and came out at a small meadow where ten abandoned tents stood in a row near a large pond.</p><p>Alexander looked through the tents and discovered that there should have been eleven, not ten. One of the tents had been taken down and its stakes removed. The ground was still fresh where the stakes had been pulled out. Alexander thought that was a good idea and had the soldiers remove the other ten tents. The tents were big and made of thick canvas.</p><p>The fire that had been set up by the campers felt cold to his touch, as if it hadn\u2019t been lit in weeks. There was not a trace of old food around, of trash left by young boys or by a young Tatiana.</p><p>It was late in the evening when they returned to Luga. He and his men pitched their newly found tents by the forest in the rear of the army camp. Covered in his trench coat, Alexander lay on the ground. He couldn\u2019t sleep for a long time.</p><p>Back in America, in the Cub Scouts, they used to pitch tents and sleep in the woods and eat berries and fish they caught in the lake, and have fires at night. They opened up their cans of ham, they toasted marshmallows, they sang Cub Scout songs, and stayed up late, and during the day learned how to survive in the woods and how to make knots. It was an idyllic existence when Alexander was just a boy of eight, nine, ten. The summer months he spent at Cub Scout camp were by far the best months of his childhood.</p><p>He knew that if Tatiana hadn\u2019t broken her neck jumping off the train, she must have found the empty camp. Maybe, if she were smart, she took the missing tent. But what would she do next? Would she come back to Leningrad?</p><p>Alexander couldn\u2019t see that. If she had set out to find Pasha, he didn\u2019t see how she could return without some answer as to his whereabouts. After Tolmachevo where would she go?</p><p>Luga. There was nowhere else. She would go to Luga, because that\u2019s where she would think Pasha had gone \u2014 to help build the Luga line.</p><p>Invigorated and hopeful, he slept.</p><p>The next morning at sunup Alexander heard the distant roar of planes. He hoped they were Soviet planes.</p><p>No such luck. The black swastika was clearly apparent even from 300 meters below. Sixteen planes in two formations swooped, and he saw something drop from them. He heard screams of panic, but there were no bombs. In a few moments white and brown pieces of paper floated down like tiny parachutes. One landed in front of his tent. He picked it up. Soviet Man! the paper proclaimed. The end is here! Join the winning side \u2014 and live! Surrender \u2014 and live! Nazism is superior to Communism. You will have food, you will have jobs, you will have freedom! Now!</p><p>Another piece of paper was an actual pass to cross the front line. Shaking his head, Alexander dropped both to the ground and went to wash in the Luga tributary that ran through the woods.</p><p>By nine in the morning Alexander saw more planes, all of them with the Nazi insignia. They flew just a hundred meters above ground. The heavy machine guns inside the planes made popping sounds as they shot at workers in the fields.</p><p>Everyone ran for the trees, for cover. One of the tents caught fire. The Nazis weren\u2019t throwing bombs, Alexander thought as he put on his helmet and jumped down into a trench. No, they were saving their precious bombs.</p><p>Then Alexander saw they might have been saving some bombs, but not the fragmentation bombs, which ultimately fell from the planes and burst overhead. Alexander heard screams muffled by the continued shelling.</p><p>He looked in the trenches for his men but couldn\u2019t find anyone he knew. The bombing continued for another thirty minutes, after which the planes flew away, but not before they threw out new leaflets. Surrender or die! was all these said.</p><p>Surrender or die.</p><p>The black smoke floating overhead, the scattered fires, the groaning human beings looked apocalyptic to Alexander. Bodies floated in the Luga. On the banks of the river, right along the ditches and the concrete reinforced holes, injured people writhed on the ground. Alexander found Kashnikov, who was alive but missing part of his ear. The wound was bleeding freely onto his uniform. Shapkov was in working order. Alexander spent the rest of the morning helping to move the wounded into field tents and the rest of the day digging not trenches but mass graves. He and sixteen of his men dug a large hole by the forest, into which they put the bodies of twenty-three people who had died that morning. Eleven women, nine men, one old man, and two children under ten. None of them soldiers.</p><p>Alexander looked into the face of every one of the women, his heart stopping each time.</p><p>Then he walked among the dozens of wounded, but again he did not find Tatiana. He even looked for Pasha, just in case, having seen a picture of him when he was a thirteen-year-old boy, standing in swimming trunks by Tatiana, pulling at her blonde braids.</p><p>He looked for Pasha reflexively. He knew that Pasha was not in Luga.</p><p>Alexander could not find Zina again.</p><p>He finally went to talk to Colonel Pyadyshev. After standing at attention for a few moments, Alexander said, \u201cHard to work in these conditions, isn\u2019t it, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Lieutenant,\u201d said Pyadyshev, a brooding, balding man. \u201cWhat conditions would these be? The conditions of war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. The conditions of being ill prepared to face a relentless enemy. I am merely expressing a measure of sympathy for the struggle ahead. Tomorrow we will resume fortifying the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLieutenant, you will resume tonight, until there is no more light. What do you think, is tomorrow a holiday for the Nazis? You think they won\u2019t bomb us again?\u201d</p><p>Alexander was sure they would bomb again.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Belov,\u201d continued Colonel Pyadyshev, \u201cyou just got here, and today you worked very hard . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot here three days ago, sir,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cThree days ago, good. Well, the Germans have been bombing the line for the last ten days. There was bombing yesterday \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you were \u2014 and the day before. Every morning like clockwork, from nine to eleven. First they throw the leaflets telling us all to join their side, then they bomb us. We spend the rest of the day burying the bodies and digging trenches. Their main units are advancing on us at a rate of fifteen kilometers a day. They\u2019ve mowed us down in Minsk, they\u2019ve mowed us down in Brest Litovsk, and they\u2019re finishing mowing us down in Novgorod. We\u2019re next. You\u2019re right, we have no chance. But when you tell me that we\u2019re ill prepared, I tell you no, we do everything we can, and then we die. That\u2019s the whole point.\u201d Pyadyshev lit a cigarette with trembling hands and leaned on his small table.</p><p>Alexander saluted him. \u201cWe will continue to do all we can.\u201d</p><p>While there was still light, Alexander walked with three of his men around the front-line camp. As he passed the hundreds of soldiers on the Luga shores, waiting for the Germans, playing cards, smoking cigarettes, he was surprised by how many wore ranking colors on their shoulders. It seemed to Alexander that one out of every ten men was an officer. Many were lieutenants, some first, some second, but there were captains, and quite a number of majors, all on the front line, ready to face the enemy. Front line. Who was left to command the troops if the majors were down on the ground? Alexander didn\u2019t want to think about it.</p><p>He combed the fields diligently, using the grid method and going up and down, looking into the face of every person either shoveling out potatoes or shoveling out trenches. He did not find her.</p><p>Alexander went back to talk to Pyadyshev. \u201cOne more question, sir. Some volunteers came from Kirov Works about five days ago. Is there any place besides here they might have been diverted to, to help in the war effort? Could any of them have been sent farther east?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI command these twelve kilometers, and the rest I don\u2019t know about. These twelve are the last line of defense between here and Leningrad. After this there is nothing left. There is only retreat. Or surrender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no surrender, Colonel,\u201d Alexander said firmly. \u201cDeath before surrender.\u201d</p><p>Now it was the colonel\u2019s turn to blink. \u201cGo back to Leningrad, Lieutenant Belov. Go back to Leningrad while you still can. And take the volunteers you brought with you. Save them.\u201d</p><p>The next morning when Alexander went to speak to Pyadyshev, he saw that the colonel\u2019s tent had been dismantled overnight, the stakes had been removed, and the holes where the stakes had been filled in. More and more soldiers arrived at the river, and the front was split into three sectors, each with its own commander, since it became increasingly clear that it was difficult to organize such a large regiment of troops with just one command post. The new commander\u2019s tent was pitched fifty meters from Pyadyshev\u2019s old tent. The new commander not only did not know where Pyadyshev was, he did not even know who Pyadyshev was. The date was July 23.</p><p>Alexander did not have time to marvel at the speedy work of the NKVD, because at nine the shelling started again and lasted this time until noon. The Germans were trying to kill the front-line soldiers before they attacked with ground troops. They were biding their time, but not for long. Alexander suspected that it was only a matter of days before part two of the blitzkrieg. Either he was going to find Tatiana or he was going to remain at Luga and stand in front of the German tanks.</p><p>With a heavy heart Alexander walked up and down the river, looking for her. The rest of Alexander\u2019s men were taken into the entrenching service. Those who had been trained by him had been given rifles. They were told it was a crime punishable by death to get separated from their weapons. \u201cTo lose your gun is a crime against the Motherland!\u201d But during the next air raid he watched three of his men drop their rifles as they ran for cover. When the air raid was over, they smiled sheepishly at Alexander, who smiled wearily back, shaking his head.</p><p>Another day went by. As soldiers took their positions along the banks, as they set up artillery cannons and mined the potato fields, as they loaded what vegetables they could onto trucks that carried them back to Leningrad, the tight feeling inside Alexander\u2019s chest did not let up from morning until night.</p><p>Pasha was lost, that much was obvious. But where was Tatiana? Why couldn\u2019t he find her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>5</p><p>Tatiana jumped off the train and rolled down the hill without much ado. It was a breeze compared to what they used to do in Luga, taking a running jump and heaving themselves down a hard, pebbled, steep embankment to the river. The grassy hill was positively soft by comparison. The shoulder on which she fell hurt a little.</p><p>Finding the boys\u2019 camp in Dohotino abandoned traumatized Tatiana, and for one day she stayed in one of the tents at the camp, not knowing what to do. She swam in the pond and ate blueberries. She had brought a few dried and toasted bread pieces in her knapsack, but she was saving them.</p><p>When she and her brother were younger, they used to race across the Luga River to see who could swim the fastest. Pasha was slightly bigger and stronger than Tatiana, but what she had that he did not was endurance. The first time they raced, he won. The second time they raced, he won. The third time he did not win. Tatiana smiled as she thought back to that, smiled at the memory of Pasha screaming in his frustration, at the memory of herself squealing in her delight.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t going to give up on her brother yet. Tatiana figured that Pasha and his campmates had been taken into volunteer work somewhere near Luga. She decided to go ahead to Luga to look for Pasha and maybe find Zina, too, and convince her to return to Leningrad. She didn\u2019t want Zina on her conscience, the way Pasha lay on her conscience.</p><p>But the following morning as she set out, the German planes shelled the village of Dohotino, where Tatiana was walking completely alone. She ran and hid in one of the huts, but suddenly a small incendiary bomb fell through the roof and set ablaze the wooden wall in front of her. She saw the old kerosene lamp just in time. Forgetting everything, she ran like mad, and the house exploded seconds later, incinerating the hut she had been in, three surrounding huts, and a stable nearby. She was left without her tent, or her sleeping bag, or her knapsack, or her toast.</p><p>Tatiana dropped into the bushes behind the huts, crawled on her stomach through the nettles, and hid herself under a fallen oak. The bombing continued over the village and nearby Tolmachevo for another hour. She could see the nettles burning \u2014 nettles she had just crawled through burning. The bombs fell into the forest, igniting the top branches, which fell in flames to the ground on which Tatiana lay.</p><p>I\u2019m going to die, she thought. Alone, in this village, under an oak. No one will ever find me. Who in my family will come to look for me? I\u2019m going to die here alone in the woods and turn to moss, and on Fifth Soviet they will open up another bottle of vodka and chase me down with pickles, and say, this is for our Tania.</p><p>After the bombing ended, she stayed under her oak for another hour or so, just in case. Her face and arms felt swollen and stung \u2014 nettles. Better that than the bombs. She was grateful for the forethought that had kept her domestic passport with a stamp from Krasenko in her shirt pocket. Without it she wouldn\u2019t get far; she\u2019d be detained in one of many army checkpoints, or perhaps in a local Soviet office.</p> <p>Tatiana walked back to Tolmachevo and knocked at a house, where she asked for something to eat. The family let her stay with them until morning, when she left and spotted a military truck near the town Soviet. Showing her passport, she asked for a lift to Luga. The truck dropped her off at the easternmost end of the Luga defense line, closest to Novgorod.</p><p>The first day Tatiana dug for potatoes and then dug trenches across the field. Not seeing any groups of boys dressed in camp uniforms, she asked an army sergeant about camp volunteers, and he mumbled something about Novgorod. \u201cThe camp volunteers were sent there,\u201d he said, and walked away.</p><p>Novgorod? Lake Ilmen? Is that where her Pasha was? Is that where she was meant to go? Tatiana washed in the stream and slept near a tree on the grass.</p><p>The following morning the German planes shelled the potatoes, and the trenches, and Tatiana.</p><p>The fragmentation bombs were too terrifying to watch, exploding as if they meant to kill just her. She realized she had to get out of Luga at all costs. Wondering how in the world she was going to make her way to Novgorod, Tatiana wandered through the smoke. No sooner had she thought about Lake Ilmen than three soldiers came up to her, asking her if she was injured and then ordering her to follow them to the hospital field tent. Reluctantly she followed. She was even more reluctant when she found out what they wanted her to do \u2014 which was to tend to the dying. And there were many dying. Soldiers, civilian women, village children, old people. All in the hastily put-up army tent, all dying.</p><p>Having never seen death up close before, Tatiana shut her eyes and wanted to go back home, but there was no turning around and no going back. The NKVD militia stood by the entrance flaps, ready to maintain order and make sure that a volunteer like Tatiana stayed where she was supposed to.</p> <p>Her heart and teeth clenched, Tatiana learned how to clot wounds by pressing on them with sterile bandages. The wounds clotted, and then the wounded died. What Tatiana could not do was give blood transfusions, because there wasn\u2019t any blood. What she could not do was stop the limbs from infection; what she could not do was stop the limbs from pain. The doctors refused to give morphine to the dying, under orders instead to give it to the less severely wounded, who could go back to the front line.</p><p>Tatiana saw that many people could have been saved had there been some blood, or any of that new medicine, penicillin; at the very least they could have been spared the agony of death with morphine. The pervasive helplessness she felt the first night in the field hospital nearly drowned the helplessness she felt at not finding her brother.</p><p>The next morning one of the soldiers, mortally wounded in the chest, asked her if she was a boy or a girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a girl,\u201d she said sadly.</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d he said, but before she had a chance to prove it, the soldier died.</p><p>On the radio near the officers\u2019 tents, Tatiana heard heavily accented German voices inviting her in Russian to go to Germany with them. They threw passes for her to cross the front line, and when she didn\u2019t go, they tried to kill her with bombs and machine-gun fire. Then the Germans were quiet until evening, when the shelling resumed. In between the attacks Tatiana washed the dying and bandaged their wounds.</p><p>The following afternoon she went a kilometer into the fields to get a potato to eat. She heard the planes before she saw them and thought, but it isn\u2019t evening yet, instantly dropping down between the low bushes. For fifteen minutes she lay there. When the planes left, Tatiana got up and ran back to the field tent, only to discover a bonfire in its place, with charred and groaning bodies crawling out of it.</p><p>Hundreds of surviving volunteers got helmets and buckets and cups and whatever else they could find and ran down to the river and back to help put out the fire. It took three hours, well into evening, when there was more shelling, and then night. There was no tent for the wounded anymore. They lay on the ground on blankets or on the grass, moaning their last breaths into the summer air. Tatiana couldn\u2019t help anyone. Wearing a green helmet with a red star that she had used to bring water up from the river, all Tatiana could do was sit by one woman who had lost her child in the attack and who herself was gravely wounded in the stomach. She now lay in front of Tatiana, crying for her small girl. Pulling the helmet tighter over her head, Tatiana took the woman\u2019s hand and held it until the woman stopped crying for her small girl.</p> <p>Then she got up and went near the tree line and lay down on the ground. I\u2019m next, she thought. I can feel it. I\u2019m next.</p><p>How was she supposed to get to Novgorod, one hundred kilometers east of here?</p><p>She washed and slept in the field with the helmet on her head, and as soon as morning broke, she looked across the river and saw the turrets and the guns of the German tanks on the other side. A corporal, who had been sleeping nearby, gathered together Tatiana and a few other volunteers and ordered them to leave immediately and return to the city of Luga.</p><p>She pulled the corporal aside and quietly asked him if there was a way she could get to Novgorod instead. The corporal pushed her hard away with his rifle and yelled, \u201cAre you out of your mind? Novgorod is in German hands!\u201d</p><p>The look on Tatiana\u2019s face stopped him. \u201cComrade \u2014 what\u2019s your name?\u201d he said more reasonably.</p><p>\u201cTatiana Metanova.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComrade Metanova. Listen to me, you are too young to be here. How old are you, fifteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Return to Luga immediately. I think there are still military trains running from Luga Station back to Leningrad. Are you from Leningrad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She did not want to cry in front of a stranger. \u201cAll of Novgorod is in German hands?\u201d she said faintly. \u201cWhat about our volunteers there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you just shut the hell up about Novgorod!\u201d the corporal yelled. \u201cDid you not hear me? There are no Soviets left in Novgorod. And soon there will be no Soviets left in Luga, you included. So do yourself a favor, get out of here. Let me see your passport.\u201d</p><p>She showed him.</p><p>Handing it back to her, he said, \u201cYou have dispensation from Kirov. Go back to Kirov. Go home.\u201d</p><p>How did she go home without Pasha? But Tatiana couldn\u2019t tell the corporal that.</p><p>There were nine in Tatiana\u2019s group. She was the smallest and the youngest. It took them the rest of the day to walk through the fields and the forests, twelve kilometers back to Luga. Tatiana said that they were getting to Luga just in time for the evening bombing. Her weary companions dismissed her. She felt as if she were back with her family.</p><p>The group got to Luga Station at six-thirty and waited for the train.</p><p>The train did not come, but at seven o\u2019clock Tatiana heard the German planes. The volunteers were huddled inside the small station that had at first seemed so safe, the building made of brick and looking as if it could withstand a little shelling and gunfire.</p><p>But during the raid one of the women became so afraid that she screamed and ran outside, where she was instantly cut down. The other eight people watched in horror, but it soon became obvious that what the Germans wanted was to take out the very station that hid them. The Nazis were intent on knocking out the railroad. The planes weren\u2019t leaving until the station was no longer standing. Tatiana sat on the floor with her knees to her chest and pulled the green helmet over her closed eyes. She thought that the helmet would muffle the sound of death.</p><p>The train station crumbled like wet paper. Tatiana crawled from the beams and the fire, but there was nowhere for her to go. Through the smoke she could feel bodies around her. Hot and faint, she felt for them with her hands. The gunfire came from right outside the door, but when the lattice beam fell from the ceiling, all sounds faded away, all faded away, and there was no more fear. Only regret was left. Regret for Alexander. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>6</p><p>Alexander started to lose hope. In the distance across the river, the natural front boundary, he could see the Germans amassing their troops and tanks and battalions of gun-ready, aggressive, and impeccably trained soldiers who would stop at nothing, certainly not at the hundreds of shovel-bearing volunteers.</p><p>As far as his eye could see, there were only two Soviet tanks. On the other side of the river there were at least thirty Panzers. Alexander\u2019s platoon of twenty men had been reduced to twelve, and fields of mines now lay between him and Leningrad. Three of his men died when a mine they were planting went off. They didn\u2019t have experience with mines, only with rifles, but all of their rifles had been taken by the army, all but Alexander\u2019s and his two sergeants\u2019.</p><p>Turning away from the river, he didn\u2019t know which way to look.</p> <p>In the late evening the new colonel called Alexander into his command quarters. Alexander didn\u2019t like him nearly as much as he had liked Pyadyshev.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant, how many men do you have left in your charge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust twelve, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty for what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Germans have just bombed the Luga train station,\u201d the colonel said. \u201cNow the trains from Leningrad carrying more men and ammunition can\u2019t reach the front. We need you and your men to clear the debris scattered on the railroad tracks so the engineers can repair the railroad and we can resume service by tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting dark, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Lieutenant. I wish I could give you daylight, but I can\u2019t. The white nights are behind us, and this has to be done immediately.\u201d</p><p>As Alexander was about to leave, the colonel said, almost as an aside, \u201cOh, and I heard there were volunteers hiding out in the station when the bombs destroyed it. You might want to remove them.\u201d</p><p>At Luga Station, Alexander and his men used kerosene lamps to survey the damage. The once brick building lay broken on the ground, and the rail tracks were knocked out for fifty meters.</p><p>Alexander called out, \u201cIs anybody under there? Speak up!\u201d</p> <p>No one answered.</p><p>Coming closer to the wreckage, he repeated, \u201cAnybody in there?\u201d</p><p>He thought he heard a moan.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all dead, Lieutenant,\u201d said Kashnikov. \u201cLook at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but listen \u2014 Anyone there?\u201d He started moving the large pieces of stone himself. \u201cHelp me, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should get to the tracks first,\u201d suggested Kashnikov. \u201cSo the engineers can restore electricity to the railroad.\u201d</p><p>Straightening out and leveling his cool gaze on him, Alexander said, \u201cRailroad tracks before people, Sergeant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn orders from the colonel, Lieutenant,\u201d Kashnikov mumbled.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Sergeant! On orders from me. Now, move.\u201d Alexander pushed away boulders and bits of window and doorframes. There was little light, and it was hard to see. Dust and debris settled on his hands, and he cut himself on the broken glass without even feeling it. He realized it when the blood dripped from one hand to the other.</p><p>Alexander definitely heard something besides crickets. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d he said. It was a soft moan.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d said Kashnikov, looking at him with concern.</p><p>\u201cKashnikov, have your hands fallen off? Quicker, I tell you.\u201d</p><p>They worked quicker.</p><p>Finally, underneath the brick and burned beams, they found one body. Then two. Then three. Then a pile of bodies lying one on top of another in a pyramid underneath the rubble. Alexander thought they were too neat. Random force could not have stacked them. They had been placed this way. They could not have stacked themselves. He strained to listen. There was that moan again. He moved one dead man, another dead woman, anxiously shoving the kerosene lamp into their faces. Another moan.</p><p>At the bottom, underneath the third body, Alexander found Tatiana.</p><p>Her back was to him, and on her head was an army helmet. He recognized neither the clothes on her body nor the helmet on her head, but even before he removed the helmet, he knew it was her by the shape of the soft, small frame he had watched so intently for many days.</p><p>\u201cTatia . . .\u201d he said in a disbelieving voice.</p><p>Alexander threw off the rest of the bodies, cleared off the last of the beams, and pushed the hair back from her face. She was barely conscious, and in the bleak yellow light from the lamps she looked barely alive, but it was from her that the soft moans had come and were continuing every few seconds.</p><p>Her clothing, her hair, her shoes, her face were covered with dust and blood. \u201cTania, come on,\u201d he said, rubbing her cheek, kneeling by her. \u201cCome on.\u201d Her cheek was warm. That was a good sign.</p><p>\u201cIs this the Tania?\u201d asked Kashnikov.</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t reply. He was thinking of how best to pick her up. He could not tell, covered in blood as she was, where she was injured.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s dying,\u201d said Kashnikov.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re a f*cking doctor now?\u201d Alexander snapped. \u201cShe\u2019s not dying. Now, stop talking. Stay here with the men to clear the area. They need your help. I\u2019m putting you in charge, Sergeant. Afterward quickly make your way back to Leningrad. Do you hear me? Can you do that? We\u2019ve given them our arms, and eight of our men, and we found her. We are finished here in Luga. So hurry.\u201d Carefully he turned Tatiana over and lifted her into his arms. She was limp and still moaning.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the wounded, Lieutenant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hear any more noise? You didn\u2019t even hear this one. Now suddenly you\u2019re concerned. The rest are dead. Check them out yourself if you wish. I will get her to the medic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to come with you? She\u2019ll need a stretcher,\u201d Kashnikov said.</p><p>\u201cNo she won\u2019t,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI\u2019ll carry her myself.\u201d</p><p>It was eleven o\u2019clock at night by the time Alexander had walked three kilometers back to the encampment with Tatiana in his arms and searched for the medic.</p><p>He did not find him, but he found the medic\u2019s assistant, Mark, asleep in a tent.</p><p>\u201cThe medic is dead,\u201d Mark said. \u201cFragment cut him in two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have another medic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Mark. \u201cI\u2019ll have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>He took one look at Tatiana\u2019s soaked body and said, \u201cShe\u2019s bled out. Leave her outside.\u201d He lay back down on his cot.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not bled out,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s her blood.\u201d The assistant obviously wanted to be asleep again. Alexander wasn\u2019t having any of it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell with so little light,\u201d Mark said. \u201cIf she lives till morning, I\u2019ll look at her then.\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t budge, holding Tatiana in his arms. \u201cCorporal,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will look at her now.\u201d</p><p>Sitting up on his cot, Mark sighed. \u201cLieutenant, it\u2019s very late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate for what? Do you have a sheet or another bed for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bed? What is this, a resort? Let me get you a sheet.\u201d</p><p>Mark laid the white sheet on the ground. Alexander first kneeled with Tatiana in his arms, then set her down. Examining her, Mark peered at her head, at her scalp, at her face and teeth. He looked at her neck and lifted her arms. When he lifted her leg, Tatiana moaned louder than before.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Mark. \u201cDo you have your knife?\u201d</p><p>Alexander gave him his knife.</p><p>She was wearing long trousers. Mark cut open one trouser leg, then the other. Alexander saw that her right ankle and the shin above it were swollen and black. \u201cBroken shinbone,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSo much blood on her and just this so far. It\u2019s badly broken, though, fractured in several places. Let\u2019s see the rest.\u201d Unbuttoning her shirt, he cut open her once white vest and examined her chest, ribs, and stomach.</p><p>Blood stained her fragile body.</p><p>Alexander wanted to look away.</p><p>Mark sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t tell what\u2019s hers, what isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing on the legs is oozing fresh blood.\u201d He touched her stomach. \u201cYou were right. She doesn\u2019t feel clammy or cold.\u201d</p><p>Staying back, Alexander said nothing. His heart was heavy and relieved.</p><p>\u201cSee here? She\u2019s got three broken ribs on the right side. Where did you find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the train station. Under brick and dead bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that explains it. She\u2019s lucky to be alive. Charmed, I\u2019d say.\u201d Mark stood up. \u201cI have no bed for her in our hospital tent. Get her there and leave her on the ground. In the morning someone will take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving her on the ground until morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you worried about? She is not as injured as some of the others.\u201d Mark shook his head. \u201cYou should see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an officer in the Red Army, Corporal,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI\u2019ve seen wounded men. You\u2019re sure you don\u2019t have a cot for her somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Mark shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s no shrapnel in her eyes, no life-threatening wounds. I\u2019m not kicking out someone with a stomach wound to make room for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do with her tomorrow,\u201d Mark said. \u201cShe needs a proper hospital. Her leg needs to be set and put in a cast immediately. We certainly can\u2019t do it here.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. The railroad was bombed out, and the army had taken his truck. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about her tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you got some more towels and some bandages for tonight?\u201d Bending down, Alexander covered Tatiana with the sheet she lay on and picked her up. \u201cAnd another sheet.\u201d</p><p>Mark reluctantly went to his medic\u2019s bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat about some morphine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Lieutenant.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI have no morphine for her. No morphine for a girl with some broken bones. She\u2019ll have to live through the pain.\u201d</p><p>Mark placed three towels and some bandages on top of Tatiana, and Alexander carried her to his tent.</p><p>After laying her down on the sheet, he pulled closed her shirt and went to the stream to get some water in a pail. When he returned, he cut a towel into small pieces, dipped one of them in the cool water, and began washing her face and hair. He cleaned her forehead and her cheeks and her eyes and her mouth. \u201cTatia,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwhat kind of a crazy girl are you?\u201d Alexander saw her open her eyes. Mutely they watched each other. \u201cTatia,\u201d he whispered again.</p><p>Her hand reached up to his face. \u201cAlexander?\u201d she said weakly, with no surprise. \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI must be . . .\u201d She trailed off. \u201cI was just dreaming . . . of your face. What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my tent. What were you doing at Luga Station? It\u2019s been destroyed by the Germans.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana took a moment to answer. \u201cGoing back to Leningrad, I think,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He could have lied; he thought once he would have wanted to, feeling so angry and betrayed at the way she had discarded him. But the truth was so plain. \u201cLooking for you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes filled again. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened? Why am I so cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said hastily. \u201cThe medic\u2019s assistant, Mark, had to cut open your trousers and your\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tatiana lifted her hands and felt through her open clothes. Alexander looked away. He had managed to pretend so well with her at Kirov, to keep his distance, but he couldn\u2019t pretend that finding her alive and covered with blood meant nothing, that saving her meant nothing, that she meant nothing.</p><p>She brought her hand to her face and stared at the blood. \u201cIs it my blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ribs are broken\u2014\u201d</p><p>She groaned.</p><p>\u201cAnd your leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy back,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSomething is wrong with my back.\u201d</p><p>Anxious and concerned, Alexander said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s burning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably the ribs,\u201d he said. \u201cI broke a rib in the Winter War last year. It feels like your back is on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOozing.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the wet rag in the bucket of water, Alexander looked into her face. \u201cTania, can you hear me all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you sit up?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana tried to sit up. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. Her hands were holding her ripped tunic and undershirt together.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s whole heart was giving out. He lifted her to a sitting position. \u201cLet me take the clothes off you. They\u2019re no good to you anyway; they\u2019re all blood-soaked. You can\u2019t wear them.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI have to take them off you,\u201d he said. \u201cI will look at your back, and then I\u2019ll clean you. You don\u2019t want to get an infection. You will if you have open wounds. I\u2019ll clean you, I\u2019ll wash the blood off your hair, and then I\u2019ll bandage your ribs and leg. You\u2019ll feel better right away once they\u2019re bandaged.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, sitting against him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, Tania,\u201d Alexander said. He held her to him, and after a few moments, when she didn\u2019t say anything, he carefully took off her tunic and then her vest. Small and hurt and weak, she pressed her naked body against him; her blood-covered back was underneath his hands, and her skin felt warm. She needs me so much to take care of her, Alexander thought, gently feeling for any gashes. And I desperately need to take care of her. \u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you\u2019re touching me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cRight under your fingers.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her shoulder to take a look. Her back was grimy, but the blood was already thick. \u201cI think you\u2019ve probably been cut. I\u2019ll wash your back in a minute, but I think you\u2019re all right.\u201d Alexander pressed her head against his chest. His lips pressed against her damp hair.</p><p>He lowered her onto the white sheet. Her hands covered her breasts, and she closed her eyes. \u201cTatiasha,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cI need to clean you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes remained closed. \u201cLet me do it myself,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t even sit up by yourself.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply at first. \u201cGive me a wet towel, and I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatia, let me take care of you.\u201d He stopped and took a breath. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t be afraid. I will never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she muttered, unable or unwilling to open her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI tell you what,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Stay like that. I\u2019ll \u2014 wash around you.\u201d</p><p>He washed her hair, her arms, her stomach, and the top of her chest, all under the glimmering light of a kerosene lamp in the corner of the tent. Tatiana groaned loudly when he touched her blackened rib cage.</p><p>As he cleaned her, Alexander soothingly whispered, \u201cOne of these days, just one, I\u2019m not saying now, but soon, maybe you can explain to me what you were doing in a train station during bombing. All right? I want you to think about what you\u2019re going to tell me. Look how lucky you are. Move your arms a bit. After I dry you, I\u2019ll bandage your ribs. They\u2019ll heal on their own in a few weeks. You\u2019ll be as good as new.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes remaining closed, Tatiana turned her face away, her hands on her breasts. Alexander removed her torn trousers, leaving her in her underwear, and washed her legs. She flinched and fainted when he touched her broken shin. He waited for her to come to.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts very much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it\u2019s about to be cut off,\u201d muttered Tatiana. \u201cDo you have anything for the pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust vodka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much for vodka.\u201d</p><p>As he was drying her stomach with a towel, Tatiana, her eyes still closed, her hands still covering herself, whispered, \u201cPlease . . . don\u2019t look at me.\u201d Her voice broke.</p><p>His own voice breaking, Alexander said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Tatiasha.\u201d He bent down and kissed the top of her soft breast above her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d He left his lips on her skin for a moment and then straightened up. \u201cI have to turn you over, I have to clean the rest of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t turn over by myself,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI will turn you over.\u201d And he did, cleaning her back with the same careful, tender meticulousness he had washed the rest of her. \u201cYour back is all right. Many glass cuts. It\u2019s the ribs that are burning you.\u201d</p><p>Her face in the sheet, Tatiana muttered, \u201cWhat am I going to wear? This was all I had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll find you something tomorrow.\u201d Turning her around, Alexander sat her up and patted her dry. He bandaged her from behind so his face wouldn\u2019t be just centimeters from her breasts, which she continued to keep covered. He wrapped the bandage around her ribs, tying it carefully under her arms, wanting to kiss the top of her shoulder. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>After laying Tatiana down, he covered her upper body with a blanket and then tightly bandaged her leg, using a wood splint for extra support. \u201cHow is that?\u201d he asked, managing a smile. \u201cTold you, good as new. Now, come here, hold on to me.\u201d She could barely lift her arms to his neck.</p><p>Alexander moved her to his trench-coat bed on the ground, and when he set her down, Tatiana held on to him for a moment before she let go. He covered her with a woolen blanket.</p><p>Pulling the blanket to her neck, she said, \u201cWhy am I so cold? I\u2019m not going to die, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alexander said as he cleaned up the sheets and the towels. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWe just have to get you back to the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t walk. How are we going to do that?\u201d</p><p>Patting her good leg lightly, Alexander said, \u201cTania, when you\u2019re with me, don\u2019t worry. I will take care of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Tatiana replied, staring at him intensely in the dim light.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the railroad will be repaired tomorrow. That\u2019s only three kilometers from here. I wish I still had my truck, but the army took it. They need it more.\u201d He paused. \u201cWe need to leave early tomorrow morning.\u201d He moved a little closer to her. \u201cWhere were you before you decided to go under the German fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDownriver. Under the German fire.\u201d Tatiana swallowed. \u201cThey\u2019re on the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Tomorrow or the next day they\u2019ll be on this side. We will need to leave at dawn. Now, stay here, and don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d He smiled. \u201cMy Primus stove is right outside. I\u2019m going to go and get some clean water from the stream, wash, and then I\u2019ll make you some tea.\u201d Out of his rucksack he took a bottle of vodka and brought it to her lips, lifting her head slightly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease drink it. You\u2019re going to be extremely sore. This will make it a bit better. Have you ever had anything broken before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy arm, years ago,\u201d Tatiana replied, and drank with a shudder.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you cut your hair?\u201d Alexander asked, holding her head, looking down at her. He needed to shut his eyes for a moment not to continue to look at her so close to him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be in the way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou hate it?\u201d She looked up at him with her sweet, defenseless eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate it,\u201d Alexander said hoarsely. It took all his strength not to lean down and kiss her. He laid her on his coat and left the tent, needing to gather himself emotionally. Her helplessness and vulnerability had made his barely hidden feelings for her float to the surface, where they bobbed now, tantalizingly in reach, achingly out. He went to the stream and then made her some tea and went back inside. She was half awake and half conscious. He wished he had some morphine.</p><p>\u201cI have some chocolate for you. Do you want a piece?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana moved onto her good side and sucked on a small piece of chocolate as Alexander sat by her on the grass, his knees drawn up.</p><p>\u201cDo you want the rest?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhy did you do this crazy thing, Tania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo find my brother.\u201d She glanced at him and looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just come back to the barracks and ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had already gone once. I thought if you knew something, you\u2019d come and see me.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cDid you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Alexander. He watched her round face pale. She was trying to be so brave. \u201cTania, I\u2019m really sorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Pasha was sent to Novgorod.\u201d</p><p>With a choking whimper, Tatiana said, \u201cOh . . . no. Please, don\u2019t say any more. Please.\u201d She started to shiver and couldn\u2019t stop. \u201cI\u2019m so cold,\u201d she said, her hand coming up to rest on his boot. \u201cCan you give me my tea before I fall asleep?\u201d</p><p>He held her head up and the cup to her mouth as she drank.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she whispered, leaning back. Her eyes never left his face. Just like at Kirov.</p><p>Alexander started to move away before her voice sounded. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere. Right here,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep here, and early tomorrow we\u2019ll set out for home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be cold on the grass,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Shura,\u201d said Tatiana in her dulcet voice, her hand stretching out to him. \u201cPlease come near me.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t say no even if he wanted to. Turning off the lamp, he removed his boots and his bloodied and soiled uniform, fumbled around his rucksack for a clean undershirt, and lay down on his trench coat next to Tatiana, covering them both with the woolen blanket.</p><p>It was pitch black in the tent. He lay on his back, and she lay on her left side, in the crook of his arm. Alexander heard the noise of the crickets. He heard her soft breath. He felt her warm breath on his shoulder and chest. He felt her naked body under his arm, pressing against his side. He couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cTania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Her expectant voice quivering.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired? Too tired to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too tired to talk.\u201d Less expectantly.</p><p>\u201cStart at the beginning, and don\u2019t stop until you get to Luga Station. What happened to you?\u201d</p><p>After she told him everything, he waited a moment and then asked incredulously, \u201cDid you cover yourself by crawling under a pile of bodies before the station collapsed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Alexander was silent for a few moments. \u201cNice military maneuver, Tatia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet, and then he heard her crying. He held her closer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d Tatiana said, speaking so softly he had to strain to hear, \u201cremember I told you about how Pasha and I used to go to Lake Ilmen in Novgorod?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember, Tania.\u201d He stroked her hair.</p><p>\u201cMy Aunt Rita and Uncle Boris and my cousin Marina\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cousin Marina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cousin Marina you were going to visit on the bus?\u201d He smiled in the dark and felt her hand lightly pinch his stomach.</p><p>\u201cYes. They had a dacha and a rowboat on that lake, and Pasha and I used to take turns rowing. I\u2019d row halfway across the lake and he\u2019d row halfway. Well, one day we got into a stupid argument about where halfway actually was. He just didn\u2019t want to let me row, so he kept arguing and arguing, and then yelling, and then screaming, and finally he said, \u2018You want this oar? Well, here, you can have it,\u2019 and he swung it at me and knocked me right out of the boat into the lake.\u201d Tatiana shivered. Alexander heard her laugh a little. \u201cI went into the water, and I was fine, but I didn\u2019t want him to think I was fine, so I held my breath and went under the boat, and I heard him from above yelling for me, more and more panicked, more and more frantic, and suddenly he jumped into the water to rescue me, and I swam to the other side of the boat, climbed in, picked up one of the oars and whistled for him. As soon as he turned around, I whacked him on the head.\u201d Tatiana wiped her face with the hand that had just been touching Alexander. \u201cWell, with my luck, he of course lost consciousness. He had put on a life jacket\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike me. I saw him floating in the water facedown, and I thought he was just playing a trick on me, too. I wanted to see how long he could hold his breath. I was convinced he couldn\u2019t hold it as long as me. So I let him float for a minute, then another minute. Finally I jumped in and pulled him to the boat. Don\u2019t know how I got him in. And rowed all the way back to shore by myself while he lay there and moaned that I had hit him too hard. Oh, did I get it from my parents when they saw the bruise on Pasha\u2019s head. And after I\u2019d been thoroughly punished, then he told everybody that he was just faking and was conscious the whole time.\u201d She started to cry again. \u201cDo you know how I feel now? Like I\u2019m waiting any minute for Pasha to come out of the water and tell me this was all just a big joke.\u201d</p><p>His voice cracking, Alexander said, \u201cTatiasha, the f*cking Germans just hit him too hard with that oar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sad he was alone without all of us.\u201d She fell silent, and Alexander, too, as he lay and listened to her breath recover its rhythm. That he was alone without you, Tatiana, thought Alexander. He would have felt better had he been with you.</p><p>He listened to her paused breath, as if she were trying to ask him something. He continued to stroke her hair to give her strength. \u201cWhat, Tatia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, are you asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you . . . coming to Kirov. Is that all right to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve missed you,\u201d Alexander said, rubbing his lips against her gold-silk, down-feather hair. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all right to say.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing else from her, except her hand, moving on his chest, gently, tenderly, up and down. He held her close. A groan of pain escaped her, and another, and another.</p><p>Minutes passed.</p><p>Minutes.</p><p>And then hours.</p><p>\u201cShura, are you asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to say . . . thank you, soldier.\u201d</p><p>Alexander\u2019s eyes stared into the blackness, as he tried to envisage moments of his own life, of his childhood, of his mother and father, of Barrington. He saw nothing. Felt nothing but Tatiana lying on his fallen-asleep arm, caressing his chest. She stopped and placed her hand on his rapid heart. He felt her lips lightly press against his shirt, and then she slept. And finally he slept, too.</p><p>When Alexander first saw a tinge of blue-gray light from outside the tent, he said, \u201cTania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d she said, her hand still on his chest.</p><p>He disentangled himself and went to wash by the stream in the woods, where it was still dark. There was no doing it on the banks of the Luga River. The Germans were only seventy-five meters across the water, their cannons and artillery pointed at the Soviet men who slept hugging their machine guns. Not Alexander \u2014 he had slept hugging Tatiana.</p><p>Coming back to the tent with clean water, he sat Tatiana up covered in the blanket, helped her wash, and then gave her some bread and some more tea.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling this morning?\u201d he asked. \u201cSpry?\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cI think I can hop on my good leg.\u201d He saw by her constricted face she was in terrible pain.</p><p>Alexander told her he would be right back and went to wake up the medic and ask for some clothes for her and some medication. Mark had no medication, but he found her a dress that belonged to one of the nurses who had died a few days ago. \u201cCorporal, I need one lousy gram of morphine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it,\u201d Mark snapped. \u201cThey shoot you for stealing morphine. I don\u2019t have it for a broken leg. Bring her to me with intestinal damage and I won\u2019t have it. You want her to have our precious morphine or a captain in the Red Army?\u201d</p><p>Alexander did not answer that question.</p><p>After returning, he sat Tatiana up and slipped the dress over her head, taking care not to hurt her or to look at her bare and bandaged body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Alexander,\u201d she said, reaching up and laying her small palm onto his face.</p><p>\u201cBut a man first,\u201d he said quietly, leaning into her hand. He paused briefly before continuing. \u201cYour leg must hurt so much. Have some vodka again. It\u2019ll dull the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything you say.\u201d</p><p>He let her have a few swigs. \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cGo yourself, leave me. They\u2019ll have room for me in the field tent eventually. People die, beds become free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I came all the way to Luga to leave you waiting for a hospital bed?\u201d He dismantled his tent and packed up his trench coat and blanket. She sat on the ground. \u201cLet me help you up. Can you stand on one leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, groaning. Tatiana stood in front of Alexander, barely coming up to the top of his chest. All he wanted to do was kiss her head. Please don\u2019t look up at me, Alexander thought. She was very unsteady, holding on to his arms and swaying. \u201cPut your rucksack on me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be easier for you.\u201d</p><p>He did. \u201cTania, I\u2019m going to crouch in front of you, and you\u2019re going to grab my neck. Just hold on tight, hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. What about your rifle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou on my back, rifle in my hands,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cCome on, we\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed on to him, and he stood up with her on his back, taking hold of his weapon. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Alexander heard her groaning. \u201cIt hurts?\u201d</p><p>Her arms around his neck squeezed him. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><p>Alexander carried Tatiana on his back for three kilometers to Luga Station, which despite his hope was not repaired yet. \u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked anxiously when he stopped to rest.</p><p>He offered her a drink of water. \u201cNow we walk through the woods to the next station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many kilometers is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d he replied.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAlexander, no. You can\u2019t carry me for six more kilometers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any other ideas?\u201d he asked, crouching in front of her. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They were on a forest road making their way to the next train station north when they heard the planes just over the trees. Alexander himself would have continued walking, but he did not want to be walking with Tatiana on his back. If a bomb fell, she would be the first one to get hit.</p><p>He walked off the path, bringing her into the woods and setting her down by a fallen tree. \u201cLie down,\u201d he told her, helping her lean back. He lay by her side, holding on to his rifle. \u201cTurn onto your stomach,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd cover your head.\u201d She didn\u2019t move. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I be afraid now?\u201d she said haltingly, lying on her back looking up at him. She wasn\u2019t moving. She placed her hands on his chest.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said, staring at her. \u201cWhat? Do you need me to help? I should have taken your green helmet from the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that it\u2019s morning, I\u2019m suddenly Alexander again?\u201d</p><p>Gazing up at him, Tatiana whispered, \u201cOh, Shura . . .\u201d And Alexander could no longer bear it. He bent to her face and kissed her.</p><p>Her lips were as soft and young and full as he had imagined them to be. Tatiana\u2019s whole body started to tremble as she kissed him back with such tenderness, such passion, such need that Alexander involuntarily emitted a small groan. He was bewildered by her hands pressing his head into hers and not letting go. \u201cOh, God . . .\u201d he whispered into her parted mouth.</p><p>The crashing noise of the bombs overhead stopped them. Alexander felt that something had to stop him. The tip of the pine tree nearby caught fire, and bits of burning branches fell down into the damp forest very close to them. He turned her onto her stomach and lay next to her in the moss with his arm and half his body covering her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he whispered. \u201cBombs frighten you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBombs are the least of it,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>As soon as the shelling stopped, Alexander said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ve got to get to the train. Let\u2019s hurry.\u201d</p><p>As she got up, she wouldn\u2019t raise her eyes at him. Turning his back to her, he crouched, and she climbed on. He carried her, his arms under her knees, his hands holding his rifle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heavy,\u201d she said into his back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no heavier than my ruck,\u201d he said, panting. \u201cJust hang on. We\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>Every once in a while his rifle bumped her broken leg, and Alexander would feel her constrict in pain, but she didn\u2019t moan, didn\u2019t cry out. At one point he felt her put her head down on his back. He hoped she was all right.</p><p>Under a black smoky sky, amid burning woods, Alexander carried Tatiana on his back six kilometers to the next station. The nearby shelling had stopped, but the sound of explosions and artillery guns carried on all around.</p><p>At the station Alexander set her down on the ground and sank down next to her. She sidled closer to him and closer still.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d she asked him gently.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>They waited. The station was full of other people \u2014 women with little babies, with their elderly parents, with all their belongings. Grimy and shell-shocked, they waited for the train. Alexander took out a piece of his remaining bread and split it with Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cNo, you have it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need it more than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you eat anything yesterday?\u201d Alexander asked her. \u201cNo, of course you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a raw potato, some blueberries in the forest. And the chocolate you gave me.\u201d The length of her body and leg pressed against his side. She leaned her head on his arm and closed her eyes.</p><p>Alexander put his arm around her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right,\u201d he said, kissing her forehead. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Just a little longer, and you\u2019re going to be fine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The train came. It was a cattle train, with no room to sit. \u201cDo you want to wait, maybe?\u201d he asked. \u201cFor a passenger train?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied weakly. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well. Best get to Leningrad soon. Let\u2019s get on. I\u2019ll stand on one leg.\u201d</p><p>Alexander lifted her onto the platform first and then jumped up himself. The carriage was crowded with dozens of other people. They stood near the edge, where they could see the countryside through the open doors. For several hours they stood compressed against each other, Tatiana leaning on him, her head on his chest, and Alexander supporting her as best he could by her arms. He couldn\u2019t hold her tightly around her ribs or on her back. At one point he felt her body start to drift down. \u201cNo, stay up, stay up,\u201d he said to her, keeping her upright.</p><p>And she stayed up, her arms going around him.</p><p>The doors to the carriage were left open in case people wanted to jump off. The train moved past fields and dirt roads that were filled with Soviet farmers dragging their cows and pigs and goats behind them and refugees pulling carts filled with their earthly possessions. Ambulances tried to get through the same roads past the crowds of people; motorcyclists, too. Alexander watched Tatiana\u2019s somber face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking, Tatia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are those silly people carrying their whole lives on their backs? If I were leaving, I wouldn\u2019t take anything. Just myself.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWhat about all your things? You have things, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I wouldn\u2019t take any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even my Bronze Horseman book? You should take that.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, attempting a smile. \u201cMaybe that. But either I\u2019m leaving to save myself or I\u2019m saddling myself, slowing myself down, making it easier for the enemy. Don\u2019t you think we should ask ourselves what our purpose is? Are we leaving our home? Are we starting a new life? Or are we planning to continue the old one elsewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are all good questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Pensively, she stared out at the fields.</p><p>Alexander bent and rubbed his cheek against Tatiana\u2019s shorn head, his hand pressing her to him a little tighter. He had only one thing left over from his former life; otherwise America did not exist, except in his memory.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could have found my brother,\u201d he heard her whisper.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Alexander with emotion. \u201cI wish I could have found him for you.\u201d</p><p>After a pained breath, Tatiana remained silent.</p><p>The train arrived at Warsaw Station in the early evening. They sat quietly on the bench overlooking the Obvodnoy Canal and waited for the Number 16 tram to take them to Grechesky Hospital near Tatiana\u2019s house. The tram came. Alexander said, \u201cYou want to get on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied.</p><p>They sat.</p><p>The second tram came.</p><p>\u201cThis one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied.</p><p>The third came.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tatiana said before he even asked, and put her head on his arm.</p><p>Four trams came and went \u2014 and still they sat, close to each other, not speaking, looking out on the canal.</p><p>\u201cIn just one more breath,\u201d Tatiana said finally, \u201con the next tram, you are going to take me back to my old life.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing.</p><p>Uttering a small cry, Tatiana whispered, \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cAt Kirov that day,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhen we fought, did you . . . have a plan?\u201d</p><p>He did want to get her out of Leningrad. She wasn\u2019t safe in the city. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so,\u201d she said, her head against his arm.</p><p>Another tram came and went.</p><p>\u201cShura, what do I tell my family about Pasha?\u201d</p><p>Tightening his lips, he touched her face. \u201cTell them you\u2019re sorry. Tell them you did your absolute best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, like me, he\u2019s alive somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not somewhere,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cYou\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana swallowed before she continued. \u201cYes, but until yesterday, I wasn\u2019t. I was somewhere, too.\u201d She looked at him hopefully. \u201cMaybe?\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cOh, Tania.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana looked away. \u201cDid you have trouble finding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to tell her how he had searched every meter of Luga for her.</p><p>\u201cBut how did you know to look for me in Luga?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked for you in Tolmachevo, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did you know to look for me at all?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>Alexander saw her looking at him with an expression of want and hope he couldn\u2019t endure. \u201cListen . . .\u201d he said. \u201cIt was Dasha who asked me to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Tatiana\u2019s face fell. \u201cOh.\u201d She moved away from him until no part of her body was touching his.</p><p>\u201cTatia . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, our tram is here,\u201d she said, trying to get herself up. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Alexander took her arm. \u201cLet me help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, and hopped once while still holding on to him, groaning in pain.</p><p>The tram doors opened. \u201cStop,\u201d Alexander urged. \u201cLet me help you, I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I said I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said more firmly. \u201cOr I\u2019m going to let go of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let go.\u201d</p><p>With exasperation he sighed and went around to stand in front of her. \u201cStop hopping. Do your ribs like that? Hold on to me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll carry you inside.\u201d</p><p>When they were sitting down and on their way, Alexander asked, \u201cWhy are you upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset.\u201d</p><p>After a moment he put his arm around her. Tatiana sat stolidly looking out the window.</p><p>In fifteen minutes of not talking they were at the hospital on Grechesky. Alexander carried her inside, where the nurses immediately found a bed for her, put her in a clean hospital gown, and instantly gave her something for the pain.</p><p>\u201cMuch better with the morphine?\u201d He smiled. \u201cThe doctor will be here in just a minute. He\u2019ll set your leg and put it in a cast; you\u2019ll sleep. Meantime I\u2019m going to go. I\u2019ll tell your family you\u2019re here, and then I\u2019m going to go and retrieve my men.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re still stuck in Luga.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana leaned back against the pillows and said coolly, \u201cThank you for helping me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander sat on the edge of the bed. Tatiana turned her head away. He placed two fingers under her chin and turned her face back to him. There were tears in her eyes. \u201cTatia?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are you upset? Had Dasha not come to me, I never would have gone and found you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but this is how it\u2019s supposed to be. You\u2019re home, you\u2019re all right.\u201d He caressed her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re just going through too much right now, too much is broken . . .\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, trying to turn her head away again, but he wouldn\u2019t let her, feeling overwhelming, crushing tenderness. \u201cShh . . . come here,\u201d he said, and hugged her gently. \u201cTania, whatever questions you have, the answer is yes to all of them,\u201d he whispered, kissing her hair. He felt her attempting to move away.</p><p>\u201cI have no questions,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cThey\u2019ve all been answered. You did this for Dasha. She will be so grateful.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Alexander laughed once with disbelief. Allowing Tatiana to slip down on the pillow, he said, \u201cDid I kiss you for Dasha, too?\u201d</p><p>She turned red.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cwe cannot be having this conversation. Not after what we\u2019ve just been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. We should not be talking at all.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cWe should. Just not about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, Alexander. Go and tell my sister how you saved me for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t save you for her,\u201d he said, standing up. \u201cI saved you for me. And you\u2019re not being very fair, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She nodded sadly, staring at the blanket. \u201cThere is nothing fair about any of this.\u201d</p><p>Alexander took Tatiana\u2019s hand, struggling with himself not to kiss her again, not to cause her further pain and himself further pain. In the end, with a hurting heart, he pressed his lips into the trembling palm of her hand and left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>IMPALED IN SPACE</p><p>AFTER Alexander left, Tatiana wanted to cry, but her ribs hurt too much. She put her arm over her face when the nurse, Vera, came in and said, \u201cNow, now, there, there, you\u2019ll be all right. Your family will be here soon. Don\u2019t cry, you\u2019ll hurt yourself. You\u2019ve got broken ribs. Why don\u2019t you sleep? I\u2019ll give you something to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have some more morphine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already gave you two grams. How much more do you want?\u201d Vera chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cAnother kilo?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana slept.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, her family was sitting on chairs around her bed, looking alternately endeared and horrified by her. Dasha was holding her hand. Mama was wiping her face. Babushka was anxiously tapping on Deda\u2019s hand. Papa was looking at her with reproachful eyes.</p><p>\u201cTania, you\u2019ve been out for two days,\u201d said Dasha, who would not stop kissing Tatiana\u2019s cut hair.</p><p>Mama stroked her hands. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d she kept repeating in a wailing voice.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to get our Pasha,\u201d Tatiana said, squeezing her mother\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, what nonsense you talk,\u201d said Papa, walking to the window. \u201cDidn\u2019t you go to school? Didn\u2019t you graduate a year early? What did they teach you there? Obviously not sense.\u201d</p><p>Mama said, \u201cTanechka, you are our baby girl, our angel baby girl. What would we have done if we had lost you, too?\u201d She sobbed. \u201cHow could we go on?\u201d</p><p>Papa told Mama not to talk nonsense. \u201cWe have not lost Pasha! Volunteers come back from the line all the time. There is hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to Nina Iglenko,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cYou can\u2019t step into the corridor without hearing her cries for Volodya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina has four sons,\u201d Papa said grimly, \u201cwho are all going to the front if this war is not over soon. She better get used to losing them.\u201d He lowered his head. \u201cBut we have only one, and I have to have hope.\u201d</p> <p>If Tatiana had had the strength, she would have turned away from all of them, unable to face them with the truth of what she had seen on the Luga River. If she told them that she had wrapped dead bodies, that she had watched people die in front of her, that she had seen burning and mangled limbs and small children struck down, her family would not have believed her. Tatiana hardly believed it herself.</p><p>\u201cYou really are completely insane, Tania,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cPutting us all through such hell, and risking my poor Alexander\u2019s life. He went to find you, you know. I begged him to do it. He didn\u2019t want to; he had to go over his commanding officer\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d said Deda, \u201che saved your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d she said feebly.</p><p>\u201cOh, you poor thing,\u201d said Mama, rubbing Tatiana\u2019s hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember anything. Georg, she doesn\u2019t remember. What you must have gone through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, didn\u2019t you hear?\u201d said Dasha. \u201cThe station fell on her. Alexander dug her out from fallen bricks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man, Dashenka!\u201d exclaimed Papa. \u201cWhere did you find him? He\u2019s gold, pure gold. Hold on to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to, Papa.\u201d</p> <p>At that moment the man who was pure gold walked in with Dimitri. The family flocked to him. Papa and Deda shook his hands vigorously. Mama and Babushka hugged him. Dasha bent him to her and kissed him on the mouth.</p><p>And kissed him and kissed him.</p><p>And kissed him.</p><p>\u201cEnough, Daria Georgievna,\u201d said Papa. \u201cLet the soldier breathe.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri came over to Tatiana and put his arm around her. His eyes were concerned and amused. \u201cWell, Tanechka,\u201d he said, kissing her head, \u201cyou seem to be quite fortunate to have your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana, I think you have something to say to Lieutenant Belov,\u201d said Papa solemnly.</p><p>\u201cThey are going to give our lieutenant another medal for military valor,\u201d Dimitri snorted. \u201cAfter dropping off Tatiana, he returned for his men, bringing eleven out of twenty of them back to Leningrad. And most of these men were untrained. Better even than Finland, right, Alex?\u201d</p><p>Stepping up to the bed, Alexander said, \u201cTania, how are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what happened in Finland?\u201d asked Dasha, glued to Alexander\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling, Tania?\u201d Alexander repeated.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Tatiana replied, unable to look at him. She smiled at her mother. \u201cI\u2019m all right, Mama. I\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cWhat happened in Finland?\u201d Still glued to Alexander.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell them,\u201d Dimitri said brightly. \u201cIn Finland, Alexander brought back only four out of thirty men, yet somehow he managed to turn even that defeat into a victory. A medal and a promotion. Didn\u2019t you, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>Not replying to Dimitri, Alexander asked Tania, \u201cHow is your leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt will be as good as new soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot soon!\u201d exclaimed Mama. \u201cSeptember! You\u2019re in a cast until September, Tania. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cI will be in a cast until September.\u201d</p><p>Mama, shaking her head and sniffling, said, \u201cNo, Alexander carried her on his back, Georg, on his back.\u201d She grabbed Alexander\u2019s hands and said, \u201cHow can we ever thank you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks necessary,\u201d Alexander replied, smiling at Tatiana\u2019s mother. \u201cJust take care of Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, it\u2019s a good thing our Tania only weighs about three kilos,\u201d Dasha said with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cThank him, Tania,\u201d persisted Papa, practically storming Tatiana\u2019s bed in his anxiety and gratitude. \u201cThank the man for saving your life, for goodness\u2019 sake!\u201d</p><p>Forming a thin smile, with Dimitri still holding her hand, Tatiana somehow managed to look straight at Alexander as she said, \u201cThank you, Lieutenant.\u201d</p><p>Before he had a chance to respond, Dasha hugged him again. \u201cAlexander, you see what you\u2019ve done for our family? How can I ever thank you?\u201d She smiled, rubbing up to him.</p><p>Blessedly, the nurse came in and told everyone they had to leave.</p><p>Dimitri leaned down and pressed his rubbery mouth to the corner of Tatiana\u2019s mouth. \u201cGood night, dear,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll come and see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to scream.</p><p>Dasha remained behind to straighten Tatiana\u2019s blankets and move a pillow under her leg. She seemed agitated in a way Tatiana had not seen in weeks. \u201cTania,\u201d she whispered, \u201cif there is a God, thank God for you. After he brought you back, we had a long talk. I was so grateful to him for finding you, and I convinced him to give us another chance. With the war so close, I said, what did we have to lose? I said, Alexander, look at what you did for me; you wouldn\u2019t have done it if you didn\u2019t have feelings for me. And he said, Dasha, I never said I didn\u2019t have feelings for you.\u201d Dasha kissed Tatiana\u2019s head. \u201cThank you, my lovely baby, thank you for staying alive long enough for him to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d said Tatiana in a dull voice. If he was in Dasha\u2019s life again, he would be in her life again.</p><p>Why did that feel so hollow?</p><p>\u201cTania . . . do you think Pasha is alive somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana thought of the leaflets floating down from the sky like confetti, of the shells exploding in midair like metal rain, of the bleakness of the artillery guns pointed at her and at Alexander. And at Pasha.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Tatiana, closing her eyes. Whatever had happened to him, Pasha felt permanently lost.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s eyes were still closed an hour later when she thought she heard the door creak. As she opened her eyes, Alexander was sitting on her bed. How did he do that, carry his body and his rifle with such quiet?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCame to see how you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just leave Dasha?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to St. Isaac\u2019s. I do air-raid duty above the dome, in the rotunda arcade. Until one. Petrenko is on duty before me. He is a good soldier. He covers me if I\u2019m a little late.\u201d St. Isaac\u2019s Cathedral was the tallest structure in Leningrad.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Tatiana repeated.</p><p>\u201cWanted to make sure you were all right. And I wanted to talk to you about Dasha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. Really. And you shouldn\u2019t do this. Come around like this. Dasha is right. I\u2019ve made enough of a mess already. You shouldn\u2019t be late for your patrol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, glaring at him. \u201cYou\u2019re quite the hero, aren\u2019t you, Alexander?\u201d she said. \u201cMy family thinks Dasha could not have done better.\u201d Tatiana lowered her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTatia . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me that you two are back together,\u201d Tatiana said with false brightness. \u201cWhy not? With the war so close, what have you got to lose, right? The whole Luga fiasco really worked out all the way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatia . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Tatia me,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Alexander sighed. \u201cWhat would you like me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave me alone, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I, Tatiana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But you better find a way. And you see how solicitous Dimitri is being? This has brought out all his best qualities, too,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI never knew he could be so kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s kissing you kindly,\u201d said Alexander, his eyes darkening.</p><p>\u201cHe is being very kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re letting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Tatiana said, \u201cWell, at least I\u2019m not knocking him.\u201d</p><p>Alexander sucked in his breath. So did Tatiana. She couldn\u2019t believe herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said scathingly. \u201cIs that next for you two?\u201d</p><p>Shaken, she did not reply.</p><p>A nurse came in and left the door open, \u201cfor some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>When they were alone again, he said, \u201cTania, I don\u2019t know what you want me to do. I told you from the beginning, let\u2019s not play this game.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut now it\u2019s too late. Now Dimitri\u2014\u201d Alexander broke off, shaking his head. \u201cNow it\u2019s become doubly difficult.\u201d</p><p>All she wanted was for him to kiss her again. \u201cWhich leads me for the third time to my next question,\u201d she said angrily. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset!\u201d</p><p>Alexander lifted his hand to touch her. She whirled her face away.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, getting up. \u201cFrom me you turn away.\u201d He was at the door when he spun around. \u201cAnd for your information,\u201d he barked, \u201cit\u2019s impossible for you to be knocking him.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was told by vivacious Vera that she would have to remain in the hospital until the middle of August, until her ribs healed enough for her to walk around on crutches. Her shinbone was fractured in three places and had been set in a cast from her knee to her toes.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s family brought her food, which she ate with relish. Pirozhki with cabbage, chicken cutlets, some hamburger patties, and blueberry pie, which she didn\u2019t enjoy as much as she used to, having practically lived on blueberries during her stint in the volunteer army.</p><p>First Mama and Papa visited her every day. Soon it became every other day. Dasha would breeze in, radiant, healthy, cheerful, arm in arm with the uniformed Lieutenant Alexander Belov, kiss Tatiana on the head, and say she really couldn\u2019t stay. Dimitri would come over and, with his arm around her, sit by her side and then leave with them.</p><p>One night when to pass the time the four of them were playing cards, Dasha told Tatiana that her dentist had evacuated. He had asked Dasha to come with him to Sverdlovsk on the other side of the Urals, but Dasha had refused, finding work instead with Mama at the uniform factory. \u201cNow I can\u2019t evacuate. I\u2019m indispensable to the war effort, too,\u201d said Dasha, smiling at Alexander and showing Tatiana a handful of gold teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get those?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>Dasha replied that she got them as payment from the patients who came to the dentist in the last month, asking that the gold be taken out of their mouths.</p><p>\u201cYou took their gold teeth?\u201d Tatiana asked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cThe gold teeth were my payment,\u201d Dasha said unapologetically. \u201cWe can\u2019t all be so pure as you.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t pursue it. Who was she to pontificate to Dasha?</p><p>Tatiana changed the subject to war. War was like weather \u2014 always something to talk about. Alexander said the Luga line was about to fall any day, and she again felt the stamp of failure. All that effort on the part of thousands, only to have it crumble in a few days. She stopped asking. Being in the hospital imbued her with a sense of the unreal, even more than being in the deserted Dohotino village. She was stuck between four gray walls with a window, and she saw no one except the people who sporadically came to see her. She knew nothing except what she chose to ask about. Maybe if she didn\u2019t ask about war, by the time she left the hospital, the war would somehow be over.</p><p>And then what? Tatiana would ask herself.</p><p>Nothing, she would answer in the dark of night. Nothing except the life I had. I\u2019ll go back to work. Maybe next year I\u2019ll go to university, as I planned. Yes, I\u2019ll go to university, I\u2019ll study English, and I\u2019ll meet someone. I\u2019ll meet some nice Russian university student who is studying to be an engineer. We\u2019ll get married and go to live with his mother and grandmother in their communal apartment. And then we\u2019ll have a child.</p><p>Tatiana could not imagine that life. She could not imagine any life except this hospital bed, except this hospital window facing the buildings on Grechesky Prospekt, except eating oatmeal for breakfast and soup for lunch and boiled chicken for dinner. All she wanted was for Alexander to come and see her on his own. She wanted to say she was wrong, to say she had no right to behave badly. She wanted to feel him close to her again.</p><p>She read Zoshchenko\u2019s funny short stories about the ironic realities of Soviet life but couldn\u2019t find any humor in them all of a sudden.</p><p>Tatiana lay in her room day in and day out, and the days were long, and at night she couldn\u2019t sleep. The tears she saw in her mother\u2019s eyes ate at her heart, and the silence of her father ate at her even more. The feeling of failure over Pasha sickened her. But the absence of Alexander ate at Tatiana most of all.</p><p>At first she was sorry, then she was angry, then she was angry at herself for being angry. Then she felt hurt. Finally she felt resigned.</p><p>And it was on the day she felt resigned that Alexander came in the middle of the afternoon when she wasn\u2019t expecting him at all \u2014 right after lunch \u2014 and brought her an ice cream.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he replied just as quietly, and then sat in the chair by her bed and watched her eat it. \u201cI\u2019m on city patrol,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m walking around the streets, making sure the windows are all taped, checking to see if there are any strange disturbances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, rolling his eyes. \u201cWith a group of seven forty-year-old men who have never carried a rifle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeach them how, Alexander. You must be a good teacher.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at her, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve just spent the whole morning putting up tank barricades on Moscow Prospekt leading south. No trams are running there now.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut Kirov is still open and pushing out those tanks. They\u2019re just now deciding to move the production east. Little by little, other industries are leaving in trucks and the last of the trains.\u201d He paused again. \u201cTania? Are you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She broke free of the deafening noise in her head.</p><p>\u201cHow is the ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. An unexpected treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a good way to think about many things in life,\u201d Alexander said, getting up. \u201cI have to be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Tatiana said quickly, and then more quietly, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Alexander sat back down.</p><p>\u201cAbout the other night . . .\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t think of anything to say besides low-spirited words. \u201cWhy did you take so long to come by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I come by and see you every day.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t say anything, and neither did he.</p><p>They looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cI would have come alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought there was little point. It wasn\u2019t going to make you or me feel better.\u201d</p><p>An image sprang up, an image of him bending over her, washing blood from her naked body. She breathed with difficulty. Another image . . . sleeping next to him, in his arms, her lips pressed to his chest, her hands touching him. Feeling closer to him than to anyone on earth. Standing with her arms around him on the train. And worse \u2014 the visceral sensation of his lips parting her lips. She turned her face from him. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I know,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Alexander got up, and this time Tatiana didn\u2019t stop him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you,\u201d he said, bending over her and pressing his lips to her head.</p><p>Well, my head, that\u2019s something, thought Tatiana. When he was by the door, she asked, \u201cWill you come again? If you can. For just a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>With his cap in his hands, he said, \u201cTania . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re right. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, all the nurses here . . . someone will mention my visit in front of your family. It\u2019ll just end badly.\u201d</p><p>But it will end. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>After he left, Tatiana thought in loathing self-flagellation, I\u2019m a very bad sister. I\u2019ve always thought of myself as a good sister, but I realize that I have never been tested before. The first time I have been \u2014 look how I\u2019m behaving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>One night a week later, Tatiana woke up feeling her face being stroked. She wanted to open her eyes, but it felt so much like a dream, and she felt so drugged and tired that she let her eyes stay closed. A man with big hands and vodka on his breath was stroking her face. She knew only one man with big hands. She kept her eyes shut, but she knew that her breathing pattern had changed from sleepy breaths to shallow rasps. He stopped touching her. \u201cTatia?\u201d</p><p>She so wanted the illusion to continue. The illusion of being touched by Alexander in the middle of an August night. Tatiana opened her eyes.</p><p>It was Alexander. He wasn\u2019t wearing his hat. There was that look in his molasses eyes again; even in the dark she could make it out.</p> <p>\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d He smiled.</p><p>She sat up. \u201cYes. I think.\u201d She reached out and touched his arm. \u201cIt seems like the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said. He stared at her blanket, and she looked at the top of his black head. \u201cIt\u2019s around three.\u201d</p><p>They were speaking in just above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I just wanted to see if you were all right. I keep . . . thinking of you here by yourself. Are you sad? Lonely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and yes,\u201d Tatiana said. She smelled vodka on him. \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d His wandering eyes were slightly unfocused. \u201cFor the first time in a while. I had a night off tonight. Marazov and I went out, had a few drinks.\u201d He stopped. \u201cTatia . . .\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounding, she waited breathlessly. His hands were on her blanket. Her legs were underneath the blanket. \u201cShura,\u201d she said, and suddenly, for an instant, felt happy. The way she felt coming out of Kirov and turning her head and seeing his smile. Happier.</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cI can\u2019t find the right words. I thought maybe after I\u2019d had enough to drink . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery word you\u2019re saying is the right word,\u201d Tatiana told him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Alexander took her hands and pressed them to his chest. His head remained bent. He said nothing.</p><p>What to do? Tatiana was a child. Any other girl would know what to do. She didn\u2019t even know what the right thing might be. I\u2019m like a newborn. How I wish I knew what to do now in this moment with him. In my hospital bed, with my ribs taped up, with my leg in a cast, yes, but alone with him.</p><p>Dasha\u2019s face appeared between them, as if Tatiana\u2019s conscience could not let her heart have even a moment of stolen joy. That is how it should be, she said to herself, wanting desperately to lift his head and kiss him. Suddenly Dasha\u2019s face evaporated. Tatiana leaned toward him and kissed his hair. It smelled of soap and smoke. Alexander looked up. They were centimeters away from each other; she smelled his delicious, vodka-laden, Alexander-laden breath. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you came to see me, Shura,\u201d she whispered, feeling an aching pull in her lower body.</p><p>Alexander tilted his head and kissed her deeply on the lips. He let go of her hands, and she wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing herself against him. They kissed as if in a fever . . . they kissed as if the breath were leaving their bodies.</p><p>The aching in her stomach got to be too much to bear; Tatiana opened her mouth and moaned. Alexander took her face into his hands. \u201cYou sweet thing,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re the sweetest thing. I don\u2019t know what to do, what to do, Tania.\u201d He kissed her lips and licked them with his tongue and kissed her eyes and her cheeks and her neck. Tatiana moaned again, still holding on to him; she felt herself incinerating from within. His lips were so insistent and hungry that Tatiana, suddenly unable to breathe or sit, started to float down onto the bed.</p><p>Alexander held her up. Tatiana felt his hands gently moving up and down on her partially exposed back where her nightgown opened. Slowly he untied the strings of her gown. Alexander was completely clothed, sitting on her bed and kissing her as he pulled the nightgown down. Tatiana breathed out, shuddering.</p><p>He pulled back from her face, still holding her, still whispering. His eyes were blazing. \u201cTania, you are too much for me . . . I can\u2019t take you, not in small doses, not in large ones, not here, not on the street, nowhere.\u201d His hands moved around to hold her just above her bandaged ribs.</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d she whispered, her whole aching weakness in her voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me? What is this?\u201d</p> <p>Alexander cupped her breasts and fondled them. Flattening out his palms, he rubbed her nipples in circles. Tatiana moaned. He rubbed them harder. Pulling away and staring at her breasts, he muttered, \u201cOh, God . . . look at you . . .\u201d Tatiana watched him as he bent down to her breast, put her nipple in his mouth, and sucked it, while rubbing her other nipple with his fingers. Then he sucked the other nipple. Watching and feeling Alexander\u2019s lips on her nipples utterly overwhelmed Tatiana. Her hands clutching his head, she moaned so loudly that he pulled away and lightly put his hand over her mouth. \u201cShh,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThey\u2019ll hear you outside.\u201d His right hand never stopped. Spanning her, his thumb and his little finger kneaded her nipples. Tatiana moaned just as loudly. His left hand went around her mouth a little firmer. \u201cShh,\u201d he said, smiling, short of breath.</p><p>\u201cShura, I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tatia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe on me . . .\u201d</p><p>He breathed on her. She kissed him hotly, her hands not leaving his hair. The friction and pressure on her breasts from his fingers was making her delirious; she moaned with such abandon that Alexander moved away. Tatiana sat in the blue light, topless, naked to the hips, gazing at him and panting. Her hands were gripping the hospital sheet.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Alexander said, looking at her with wonder and lust. \u201cHow can you be so innocent in this day and age? How can you be so innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I knew more.\u201d</p><p>Moving flush with her, he held her to him. \u201cKnew more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad more experience. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d Alexander whispered fiercely. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand me at all? It\u2019s your innocence that\u2019s driving me mad. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>His hands caressed her. \u201cDon\u2019t moan,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have me arrested.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wanted him to \u2014 but she wasn\u2019t brave enough to say it. Gently she pushed his head downward. The only thing she could manage in a stilted whisper was, \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he went to lock the door. The door wouldn\u2019t lock. He took his rifle and stuck it against the door handle.</p><p>Alexander came back to Tatiana, laid her flat on the bed, covered her mouth, bent to her breasts, and sucked her nipples until she nearly fainted, quivering the whole time and groaning into the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cGod, is there more?\u201d she whispered, panting.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had more?\u201d Alexander asked, panting himself.</p><p>Tatiana stared into his face. To tell him the truth? He was a man \u2014 how could she tell him? She didn\u2019t want to lie to him. She said nothing.</p><p>He sat up, pulling her up, too. \u201cHave you? Tell me the truth. Please. I must know. Have you ever had more?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to lie to him. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t had more.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glazed with amazement, heartache, and desire, Alexander lowered his head and said, \u201cOh, Tania, what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura . . .\u201d Tatiana whispered, having forgotten everything else in the universe. She took his hands and put them on her breasts. \u201cPlease, Shura, please.\u201d</p><p>Alexander quietly moved his hands away to rest on her legs. \u201cWe can\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even look up at her.</p><p>Tatiana saw he didn\u2019t have an answer. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d she said, nearly crying. \u201cDon\u2019t you want more? Don\u2019t you need something for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d His voice was hoarse.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What can I do?\u201d</p><p>Smiling lightly, he whispered, \u201cWhat are you offering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Tatiana timidly touched his thigh. \u201cBut I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d She kissed his neck. \u201cAnything,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou tell me what to do and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d She moved her hand a little higher. Her fingers were trembling.</p><p>Now it was Alexander\u2019s turn to groan. He gripped her hand, and said, \u201cTania, wait \u2014 is this how you want it to be for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she moaned back, licking his lips. \u201cI want it any\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the door moved and light streaked into the room. A nurse\u2019s voice sounded from the outside. \u201cTatiana? Are you all right? What\u2019s wrong with the door?\u201d</p><p>Quickly Tatiana pulled up her nightgown, and Alexander went to his rifle, picked it up, turned on the light in the room, and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine,\u201d he said, an air of formality enveloping him. \u201cJust came to say good night to Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night?\u201d the nurse shrieked. \u201cAre you an idiot or something? It\u2019s four in the morning. There are no visiting hours at four in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNurse! You\u2019re forgetting yourself,\u201d said Alexander, raising his voice. \u201cI\u2019m a lieutenant in the Red Army.\u201d</p><p>Substantially more quietly, the nurse said, \u201cI heard screams, I thought she was hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Tatiana, and her voice was all croaky. \u201cWe were just laughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was just leaving,\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to wake up my other patients,\u201d the nurse said.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Tatiana,\u201d Alexander said, his eyes boring into her. \u201cI hope your leg feels better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lieutenant,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cCome again soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust not at four in the morning,\u201d the nurse mumbled, coming inside to check on Tatiana. Behind the nurse\u2019s back, Alexander pressed his fingers to his lips and blew Tatiana a kiss. Then he was gone.</p><p>There was no more sleep to be had that night, or the following morning. Tatiana had Vera bathe her twice, and kept obsessively brushing her teeth and tongue all day to make sure her breath was clean. She had no food, only water to drink, though by the afternoon, she nibbled on some bread left over from lunch.</p><p>Tatiana had thought that guilt would overtake her, that the force of conscience would make her unable to face herself and her thoughts. But that wasn\u2019t the case. The only thing she kept reliving was the evening minute on fiery wings with Alexander on her breasts and lips.</p><p>Nothing in Tatiana\u2019s former life had prepared her for Alexander.</p><p>There was school and there was Fifth Soviet, and there was Luga. In Luga, Tatiana had had many friends and many endless summers of mindless adventures. In Luga there had been nothing but the abandon of childhood, and in every step of that childhood there was Pasha, in her games and in her days.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Tatiana had not been occasionally and peripherally aware that every once in a while one of Pasha\u2019s friends looked at her for a little too long or stood too close to her. It was that she herself had never looked too long at anyone.</p><p>Until Alexander.</p><p>He was new. Transcendentally new. Immemorially new. She had thought all the while that their instant familiarity was based on the things she understood \u2014 compassion, empathy, fondness, friendship. Two people resoundingly coming together. Needing to sit close together on the tram, to bump into each other, to make each other laugh. Needing each other. Needing happiness. Needing youth.</p><p>But now Tatiana could not believe her preternatural desire for him. Her suffocating need for him. Simply could not fathom it. The throbbing in her lower stomach continued unabated all day as she bathed and brushed her teeth and brushed her hair.</p><p>That evening before Vera left, Tatiana asked her for some lipstick.</p><p>When Dasha, Alexander, and Dimitri came to see her, Dasha took one look at Tatiana and said, \u201cTania, I\u2019ve never seen you wear lipstick before. Look at your lips.\u201d Dasha said it as if realizing for the first time that Tatiana actually had lips.</p><p>Dimitri came over, sat on her bed, and said, smiling, \u201cYes, just look at them.\u201d</p><p>Only Alexander kept quiet. Tatiana couldn\u2019t read his expression because she could not bring herself to raise her eyes. She realized that the consequence of last night was going to be her complete inability to ever look at him in public again.</p><p>They stayed for a short time. Alexander got up and said he had to be getting back.</p><p>Tatiana sat catatonically until she heard a knock on the door, and Alexander came in, closing the door behind him. She pulled herself up straight. He came over in long purposeful strides, sat at the edge of her bed, and in a tender, possessive gesture wiped the lipstick off her lips. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAll the other girls wear it,\u201d Tatiana said, quickly wiping her mouth, breathless at the sight of him. \u201cIncluding Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want you to have anything on your lovely face,\u201d he said, stroking her cheeks. \u201cGod knows, you don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, wiping her mouth, and waited. Her head fell back on the pillow as she raised her expectant, earnest eyes to him, her expectant, earnest lips to him.</p><p>Alexander was quiet. \u201cTania,\u201d he finally said with a great sigh, \u201cabout last night . . .\u201d</p><p>She groaned.</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d he said, the resolve in his eyes fading, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what you can\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said hoarsely, holding on to his sleeve. Reaching up, she traced his lips with her fingers. \u201cShura . . .\u201d</p><p>Alexander moved his face away and stood up. The sheen had gone from his eyes. Tatiana stared at him in bewilderment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about last night,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cI had too much to drink. I took advantage of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI did. It was a terrible mistake. I shouldn\u2019t have come here; you know it even better than I do.\u201d</p><p>Speechlessly Tatiana shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGod, I know, Tania,\u201d said Alexander, his face constricted. \u201cBut we live an impossible life. Where can we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d she whispered, turning bright red, not looking at him.</p><p>The nurse walked in to check on Tatiana, looking askance at Alexander. They remained mute until she walked out.</p><p>\u201cRight here?\u201d Alexander said. \u201cWhat, with the nurses outside the door? For fifteen minutes right here, that\u2019s what you want for yourself?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t reply. She felt as if she would have taken five minutes with the nurses inside the door. Her eyes remained lowered.</p><p>\u201cAll right, and then what?\u201d Alexander said, letting out a heavy breath. \u201cWhat then for us?\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat then for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, biting her lip to keep herself from crying. \u201cWhat then for everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has it off in the alleys against the wall!\u201d Alexander exclaimed. \u201cAnd on garden benches, and in their barracks, and in communal apartments with their parents on the sofa! Everyone else does not have Dasha in her bed. Does not have Dimitri.\u201d He glanced away. \u201cEveryone else is not you, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>She turned onto her side, away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve better than that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want him to see her tears.</p><p>\u201cI came here to apologize to you and to say I won\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, trying not to shake, blinded for a moment. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Alexander walked around the bed to stand in her line of sight. He wasn\u2019t letting go of his rifle. Tatiana wiped her face. \u201cTania, please don\u2019t cry,\u201d he said emotionally. \u201cLast night I came here ready to sacrifice everything, you included, to satisfy the burning inside me I\u2019ve had since the day we met. But God was looking out for you, and He stopped us, and more important He stopped me, and I, in the gray of the morning, am less confused . . .\u201d Alexander paused. \u201cThough only more desperate for you.\u201d He took a long breath, staring at his rifle.</p><p>Tatiana could not find her voice to speak.</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cYou and I\u2014\u201d then broke off, shaking his head. \u201cBut the time is all wrong for us.\u201d</p><p>She turned onto her back, putting her arm over her face. The time, the place, the life. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have thought this through before you came here?\u201d she said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have had this talk with yourself before last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot stay away from you,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night I was drunk. But tonight I\u2019m sober. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Tears choking her throat, Tatiana said nothing.</p><p>Alexander left without touching her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>3</p><p>Luga had burned, Tolmachevo had fallen, the German general von Leeb\u2019s men cut the Kingisepp-Gatchina rail line, and despite the efforts of hundreds of thousands of volunteers digging trenches under mortar fire, none of the front lines would hold. Despite all orders not to surrender the railroad, the railroad was surrendered.</p><p>And Tatiana was still in the hospital unable to walk, unable to hold the crutches, unable to stand on her broken shinbone, unable to close her eyes and see anything else besides Alexander.</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t wring the hurt out of herself. Couldn\u2019t drench the flame out of herself.</p> <p>In the middle of August, a few days before Tatiana was to come home, Deda and Babushka came to tell Tatiana they were leaving Leningrad.</p><p>Babushka said, \u201cTanechka, we\u2019re too old to stay in the city during war. We\u2019ll never make it through the bombing, or the fighting, or a siege. Your father wants us to leave, and he is right, we need to go. We\u2019ll be better off in Molotov. Your grandfather was assigned a good teaching post and during the summer we will stay in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dasha?\u201d Tatiana interrupted with hope. \u201cShe is going to come with you, right?\u201d</p><p>Deda said that Dasha would not leave Tatiana behind.</p><p>It\u2019s not me she cannot leave behind, thought Tatiana.</p> <p>Deda said that when the cast came off Tatiana\u2019s leg, she, Dasha, and maybe their cousin Marina, too, would evacuate to Molotov. \u201cEvacuating you right now is too difficult with a broken leg,\u201d concluded Deda.</p><p>Yes, Tatiana thought, without Alexander to carry me, it is difficult indeed. \u201cSo Marina is staying in Leningrad, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Deda replied. \u201cYour Aunt Rita is very sick, and Uncle Boris is up at Izhorsk. We asked her if she wanted to come with us, but she said she could not leave her mother in the hospital and her father as he prepares to fight the Germans.\u201d</p><p>Marina\u2019s father, Boris Razin, was an engineer at Izhorsk, a factory much like Kirov, and as the Germans neared it, the workers, in between making tanks and artillery shells and rocket launchers, were preparing for battle.</p><p>\u201cMarina should definitely go with you,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cShe\u2014\u201d Tatiana tried to think of a mild description. \u201c \u2014 She does not do well under pressure.\u201d</p><p>Deda said, \u201cYes, we know. But as always, it is the ties and bonds of love and family that keep people from saving themselves. Lucky for us, your grandmother and I are our own bonds. I would say not just bonds, but chains.\u201d He smiled at Babushka.</p> <p>\u201cNow, remember, Tanechka,\u201d said Babushka, patting her blanket, \u201cDeda and I love you very much. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Babushka,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cWhen you come to Molotov, I\u2019m going to introduce you to my good friend, Dusia. She is old, very religious, and is going to eat you right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d muttered Tatiana, smiling wearily.</p><p>Deda kissed her on the forehead. \u201cThere are difficult days ahead for all of us. Ahead of you particularly, Tania. You and Dasha. Now that Pasha is not here, your parents need you more than ever. Your mettle will be tested, along with everyone else\u2019s. There will be only one standard, the standard of survival at all cost, and it will be up to you to say at what price survival. Hold your head high, and if you\u2019re going to go down, go down knowing you have not in any way compromised your soul.\u201d</p><p>Pulling him by the arm, Babushka said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Tania, you do whatever you have to do to survive, and damn your soul. We expect to see you in Molotov next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever compromise on what your heart tells you to be right, my granddaughter,\u201d Deda said, getting up and hugging her. \u201cYou hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoud and clear, Deda,\u201d Tatiana said, hugging him back.</p> <p>Later that evening, when Dasha came with Alexander and Dimitri, Tatiana mentioned that Deda had asked the girls to join them when Tatiana\u2019s cast was off in September, and Alexander said, \u201cThat won\u2019t be possible. There will be no trains in September.\u201d</p><p>He usually avoided speaking to Tatiana, keeping his careful, silent distance.</p><p>Tatiana would have liked to speak back to him, but her feelings remained in unquelled turmoil, and she didn\u2019t trust her outer face to hide the tremor in her voice or the softness in her eyes when she looked at him. So she said nothing, as usual, and didn\u2019t look at him. Dimitri sat by her side.</p><p>Dasha spoke. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means there will be no trains,\u201d Alexander repeated. \u201cThere were trains in June when you girls could have left, and there were trains in July, but Tatiana here broke her leg. In September, when her leg will be healed, there will not be a single train leaving Leningrad unless a miracle happens between now and when the Germans get to Mga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of miracle?\u201d asked Dasha hopefully.</p><p>\u201cGerman unconditional surrender,\u201d replied Alexander dryly. \u201cOnce we lost Luga, our fate was sealed. We are certainly going to try to stop the Germans at Mga, the central point for rail travel to the rest of the Soviet Union. In fact, we are told that under no circumstances are we allowed to surrender Mga to the Germans. It is now against the law to give up railroads to the Nazis.\u201d Alexander smiled. \u201cBut I have an uncanny ability to see the future. The law will be broken, and there will be no trains in September.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana heard the subtext in his even voice. Tania, I told you and told you to leave this damned city, you didn\u2019t listen to me, and now with a broken leg you can\u2019t go anywhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>4</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s life was positively joyous in the hospital compared to what she encountered when she came back home in the middle of August.</p><p>When she returned, finally able to walk \u2014 badly \u2014 on crutches, Tatiana found Dasha cooking dinner for Alexander, and Alexander sitting behind the table happily eating, joking with Mama, talking politics with Papa, smoking, relaxing, and not leaving. And not leaving.</p><p>And not leaving.</p> <p>Tatiana sat morosely and nibbled at her food like an overstuffed mouse.</p><p>When was he going to leave? It was getting so late. Didn\u2019t he have taps?</p><p>\u201cDimitri, what time is taps for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven,\u201d Dimitri replied. \u201cBut Alexander has the night off tonight.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p> <p>\u201cTania, did you hear?

Mama leaned to Dasha and whispered, \u201cHe can\u2019t stay overnight, do you hear me? Your father will go through the roof. He\u2019ll kill us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you, Mama,\u201d Dasha whispered back. \u201cHe\u2019ll leave soon, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Not soon enough, Tatiana thought.</p><p>Their parents went to bed, and Dasha took Tatiana aside and whispered, \u201cTania, can you go up on the roof and play with Anton? Please? I just want to have an hour alone with Alexander \u2014 in a room, Tania!\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana left Dasha alone with Alexander. In her room.</p><p>She went to the kitchen and threw up in the sink. The nauseating din inside her head continued even after she went up onto the roof and sat with Anton, who was supposed to be on night duty. Anton was not a very good sky-watcher. He was sleeping. Fortunately the sky was quiet. Even from far away there was no sound of war. Tatiana sifted the sand in the bucket and cried in the moonless night.</p><p>I\u2019ve done this, she thought. This is all because of me. Shuddering at herself, she laughed out loud. Anton twitched. I\u2019ve done this to myself, and I have no one else to blame.</p><p>Had she not decided to single-handedly bring Pasha back, had she not joined the volunteers and walked off God knows where and got blown up and had her leg broken, she and Dasha would have left with Deda and Babushka for Molotov. And the unthinkable would not be happening in her room right now.</p><p>She sat on the roof until Dasha came upstairs sometime later and motioned for her to come to bed.</p><p>The following evening Mama told Tatiana that now that she was home by herself all day with a broken leg and nothing to do, she would have to start cooking dinner for the family.</p><p>All Tatiana\u2019s life Babushka Anna, who did not work, had cooked. On the weekends Tatiana\u2019s mother cooked. Sometimes Dasha cooked. During holidays like New Year everybody cooked; everybody, that is, except Tatiana, who cleared up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be glad to, Mama,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cIf I only knew how.\u201d</p> <p>Dismissively Dasha said, \u201cThere is nothing to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Tania,\u201d said Alexander, smiling. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to it. Make something delicious. A cabbage pie or something.\u201d</p><p>Why not? Tatiana thought; while her leg was healing, she needed to busy her idle hands. She would try. She could not continue sitting in the room and reading all day, even if the reading was a Russian-English phrase book. Even if it was rereading Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace. She could not continue sitting in her room, thinking about Alexander.</p><p>The crutches had been killing her ribs, so Tatiana stopped using them. She hobbled to the store on her cast leg. The first thing she would cook in her life would be a cabbage pie. She would have also liked to make a mushroom pie but couldn\u2019t find any mushrooms in the store.</p><p>The yeast dough took Tatiana three attempts and five hours in all. She made some chicken soup to go with the pie.</p><p>Alexander came for dinner, along with Dimitri. Extremely nervous about Alexander trying her food, Tatiana suggested that perhaps the two soldiers wanted to go back and eat at the barracks. \u201cWhat, and miss your first pie?\u201d Alexander said teasingly. Dimitri smiled.</p><p>They ate and drank and talked about the day and about war, and about evacuation, and about hopes for finding Pasha, and then Papa said, \u201cTania, this is a little salty.\u201d</p><p>Mama said, \u201cNo, she just didn\u2019t let the dough rise enough. And there are too many onions. Why didn\u2019t you try to get something else besides cabbage?\u201d</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cTania, next time cook the carrots a little longer in the soup. And put a bay leaf in. You forgot the bay leaf.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Dimitri said, \u201cIt\u2019s not too bad for your first effort, Tania.\u201d</p><p>Alexander passed Tatiana his plate, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s great. Can I please have some more pie? And here\u2019s my bowl for the soup.\u201d</p><p>After dinner Dasha took Tatiana away and whispered in her pleading voice, \u201cCan you and Dimitri go on the roof for a little while? It\u2019s not going to be too late tonight. He\u2019s got to get back. Please?\u201d</p><p>Kids from the apartment building were constantly on the roof. Dimitri and Tatiana were not alone.</p><p>But Dasha and Alexander were alone.</p><p>What Tatiana needed was not to see her sister and him. Him for a lifetime. Her for two weeks. In two weeks, when the summer would end, Dasha\u2019s infatuation would surely end, too. Nothing could survive the Leningrad winter.</p><p>But how could Tatiana not see Alexander? Maybe she could lie to everyone else, but she could not lie to herself. She held her breath the whole day until the evening hour when she would finally hear him walking down the corridor. The last two nights he stopped at her door, smiled, and said, \u201cHello, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Alexander,\u201d she replied, blushing and looking down at his boots. She couldn\u2019t meet his eyes without trembling somewhere on her body.</p><p>Then she fed him.</p><p>Then Dasha took Tatiana aside and whispered.</p><p>Tatiana had been ready, gritted teeth and all, to put Alexander away. She had known all along what the right thing was, and she was prepared to do it.</p><p>But why did her face have to be rubbed in the right thing night after night?</p><p>As the days went on, Tatiana realized she was too young to hide well what was in her heart but old enough to know that her heart was in her eyes.</p><p>She was afraid she would glance at Alexander and something in her look would catch Dimitri\u2019s attention, something would make him think, wait a minute, why is she looking at him? Or worse, what is that in her eyes? Or worse still, why is she looking away? Why can\u2019t she look at him like everyone else? Like I look at Dasha, like Dasha looks at me?</p><p>Looking at Alexander condemned Tatiana, but not looking at him equally betrayed her, maybe even more so.</p><p>And Dimitri seemed to catch it all. Every glance away, every glance toward, Dimitri\u2019s quietly studying eyes were on Alexander, on Tatiana.</p><p>Alexander was older. He could hide better.</p><p>Most of the time he treated her as if he had never met her before last night or tonight, before an hour ago, maybe a witching hour, maybe a drunken hour, certainly a smoking hour, but he managed somehow to behave toward her as if she were nothing to him. As if he were nothing to her.</p><p>But how?</p><p>How did he hide their Kirov walks and their arms against each other, how did he hide his life that he poured into her, how did he hide his unstoppable hands on her breasts, and his lips on her, and all the things he had said to her? How did he hide Luga from them all? Luga, when he washed her bloodied body? When she lay naked against him as he kissed her hair and held her with his tender arms, while his heart beat wildly in his chest. How did he hide his eyes? When they were alone, Alexander looked at Tatiana as if there were no one else in the world but her.</p><p>Was that the lie?</p><p>Was this the lie?</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s what grown-ups did. They kissed your breasts and then pretended it meant nothing. And if they could pretend really well, it meant they were really grown-up.</p><p>Or maybe they kissed your breasts and it really was nothing.</p><p>How was that possible? To touch another human being that way and have it mean nothing?</p><p>But maybe if you could do that, it meant you were really grown-up.</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t know, but she was baffled and humiliated by it \u2014 imagining herself in Alexander\u2019s hands when he could barely be bothered to call her by name.</p><p>Tatiana would lower her head and wish for them all to disappear. But every once in a while when Alexander would be sitting down at the table, and she was in the room, and everyone was talking while she was moving or picking up teacups, she would see him glance at her, and for a flicker she would see his true eyes.</p><p>All Tatiana had with Alexander were meaningless gestures. He would open the door for her, and as she walked by him, a bit of her brushed a bit of him, and that kept her going for a day. Or when she made him tea and handed him the cup, the very tips of his fingers would \u2014 accidentally? \u2014 touch the very tips of hers, and that kept her going for another day. Until the next time she saw him. Until the next time a part of him would brush against a part of her. Until the next time he said, \u201cHello, Tania.\u201d But one time, when Dimitri had already walked inside and Dasha was elsewhere, with a big smile on his face Alexander said, \u201cHello, Tania! I\u2019m home.\u201d And it made her laugh, though she didn\u2019t want to. And when she looked up at him, he was soundlessly laughing, too.</p><p>One night when Alexander tasted her cheese blinchiki, he said, \u201cTania, I think that\u2019s the best yet.\u201d And that lifted her spirits, until Dasha kissed him and said, \u201cTanechka, you really have been a godsend for us all.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t smile, and then she saw Dimitri watching her not smiling, and then she smiled but knew it was not enough. Later, when Dasha and Alexander were sitting together on the couch, Dimitri said, \u201cDasha, I must say that I have never seen Alexander as happy with anyone as he is with you,\u201d and everybody smiled, including Alexander, who did not look at an unsmiling Tatiana. Yes, and we have me to thank for it, she thought grimly, catching Dimitri\u2019s eyes.</p><p>She continued to learn to cook new things, how to make sweet pies because she saw that Alexander liked them, finishing them off in one sitting, followed by his tea and cigarettes.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what else I like?\u201d he said once.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s heart stopped for a moment.</p><p>\u201cPotato pancakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to make those.\u201d</p><p>Where was everyone else? Mama and Papa were in the other room. Dasha had gone to the bathroom. Dimitri was not there. Alexander smiled into her face, and his smile was contagious, and it was for her. \u201cPotatoes, flour, some onions. Salt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that from\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dasha came back.</p><p>The next day Tatiana made potato pancakes ladled with sour cream, and the whole family devoured them, saying they had never tasted anything so delicious. \u201cWhere did you learn to make that?\u201d asked Dasha.</p><p>The only small pleasure Tatiana had during her long days was feeding Alexander. The pleasure was most intense and most untinged by hurt in the hours before the family returned home, when she was making the food and looking forward to seeing his face. During dinner emotions were already gathering clouds, and soon after dinner two things happened: either Alexander left to go back to barracks, which was bad enough, or Dasha asked to be left alone with him, which was worse.</p><p>Where had they gone before they had a room of their own to go to? Tatiana could not conceive of the things Alexander had said to her in the hospital about alleys and benches. Dasha, always the protective older sister, certainly never talked to Tatiana about those things. Didn\u2019t talk to Tatiana about anything.</p><p>No one talked to Tatiana about anything.</p><p>Tatiana never saw Alexander alone.</p><p>He hid everything.</p><p>But one evening after dinner, when they all went out onto the roof, Anton asked Tatiana if she wanted to play their dizzy geography game. Tatiana said she was going to have trouble twirling on one leg.</p><p>\u201cCome on, try,\u201d said Anton. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tatiana said, wanting a bit of giddiness. She hopped around and around on her one good leg, while keeping her eyes closed. Anton\u2019s friendly hands were on her arms, and he laughed hysterically as she got all the countries in the world completely out of whack, and when she opened her eyes, she saw Alexander looking at her with such a black expression that it hurt her even to breathe, as if her ribs were rebroken. She straightened herself out and went to sit next to Dimitri, thinking that perhaps even grown-ups couldn\u2019t hide everything.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fun game, Tania,\u201d said Dimitri, putting his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Tania,\u201d said Dasha, \u201cwhen are you ever going to grow up?\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing.</p><p>Of all the small mercies Tatiana was grateful for, the one she was most grateful for was her broken leg\u2019s preventing her from going on solitary walks with Dimitri. She was also grateful for the constant buzz of people in the apartment that stopped her from being alone with Dimitri. But that night when they got back downstairs from the roof, Tatiana discovered to her panic that her parents had themselves gone for a walk in the balmy August night, leaving the two couples alone together.</p><p>Tatiana saw Dimitri\u2019s insinuating smile and felt his insinuating closeness. Dasha smiled at Alexander and said, \u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana could barely continue to stand on one leg.</p><p>It was Alexander who came to her rescue. \u201cNo, Dasha,\u201d he said, \u201cI have to be going tonight. Come on, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri said he didn\u2019t have to be going, not taking his eyes off Tatiana.</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cYes, you do, Dima. Lieutenant Marazov needs to see you tonight before taps. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was grateful for Alexander. Though it was a bit like the Germans cutting off your legs and then wanting you to be grateful to them for not killing you.</p><p>When Mama and Papa came back from their walk, Tatiana quietly asked them never to leave the apartment in the evening again, not even for a cold glass of beer on a warm August night.</p><p>During the days Tatiana went out for slow walks around the block to check the local stores for any food. She had begun to notice an absence of beef and pork. She could not find even the 250 grams of meat a week per person that was allotted them. Only occasionally did she find chicken.</p><p>Tatiana still found the ever-present cabbage, apples, potatoes, onions, carrots. But butter was more scarce. She had to put less in her yeast dough. The pies started tasting worse, though Alexander still ate them cheerfully. She found flour, eggs, milk. She couldn\u2019t buy a lot; she couldn\u2019t carry a lot. She would buy enough to make one pie for dinner, and then in the afternoons she would take a nap and study her English words before turning on the radio.</p><p>Tatiana listened to the radio every afternoon, because the second thing her father said when he came home was, \u201cAny news from the front?\u201d The first thing he said was, \u201cAny news?\u201d leaving out the unspoken. Any news about Pasha?</p><p>So Tatiana felt obliged to listen to the radio to find out the minimum about the Red Army\u2019s position, or about von Leeb\u2019s army\u2019s advance. She didn\u2019t want to hear it. On occasion, yes \u2014 listening to bleak reports from the front lifted her spirits. Even defeat at the hands of Hitler\u2019s men was better than what she had to endure inside herself every day. She turned on the radio in the hope that hopeless news elsewhere would cheer her up.</p><p>She knew if the announcer started listing open radio frequencies, then nothing extraordinary had happened that day. Usually there was some news. But even before the announcer came on, there was a series of dismal little rings and pauses, like a rat-ta-tat-tat of a typewriter. The radio information bulletin itself lasted a few seconds. Maybe three short sentences about the Finnish-Russian front.</p><p>\u201cThe Finnish armies are quickly regaining all the territory they lost in the war of 1940.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Finns are coming closer to Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Finns are at Lisiy Nos, only twenty kilometers from the city limits.\u201d</p><p>Then followed a few sentences about the German advance. The newsreader read slowly, stretching out the no-news bulletin to impart meaning that wasn\u2019t there. After he listed the cities south of Leningrad that were under German control, Tatiana had to go and open a map.</p><p>When she found out that Tsarskoye Selo was in German hands, she was shocked and even forgot about Alexander for the moment it took her to get her bearings. Tsarskoye Selo, like Peterhof, was a summer palace of the old tsars, it was the summer writing place of Alexander Pushkin, but the worst thing was that Tsarskoye Selo was just ten kilometers southeast of the Kirov factory, which was located on the city limits of Leningrad.</p><p>Were the Germans ten kilometers from Leningrad?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander said that night. \u201cThe Germans are very close.\u201d</p><p>The city had changed in the month Tatiana spent in Luga and in the hospital. The golden spires of the Admiralty and Peter and Paul\u2019s Cathedral had been spray-painted gray. Soldiers were on every street, and the NKVD militia in their dark blue uniforms were even more conspicuous than the soldiers. Every window in the city was taped against explosion; the people on the streets walked quickly and with a purpose. Tatiana sometimes sat on a bench near the church across the street and watched them. In the sky floated the ubiquitous airships, some round, some oval. The rations became slightly more restrictive, but Tatiana was still able to get enough flour to make potato pies, mushroom pies, and cabbage pies. Alexander often brought some of his rations with him when he came for dinner. There was chicken enough to make chicken soup with well-cooked carrots. Bay leaf was gone.</p><p>Dimitri got Tatiana out onto the roof while Dasha and Alexander were downstairs alone in Tatiana\u2019s room. Putting his arm around her, Dimitri said, \u201cTania, please. I\u2019m feeling so sad. How long am I going to wait? Just a little more tonight?\u201d</p><p>Placing her hand on his arm, Tatiana asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need a little comfort from you,\u201d he said, hugging her, kissing her cheeks, trying to bring his mouth to hers. There was something that felt almost unnatural in Dimitri\u2019s touching her. She couldn\u2019t put her finger on it. \u201cDima, please,\u201d she whispered, moving slightly away from him and motioning for Anton, who skipped over and chatted with them until Dimitri got fed up and left.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Anton,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell him to leave you alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnton, you wouldn\u2019t believe it, but the more I do, the more he comes around,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cOlder men are all like that, Tania,\u201d said Anton with authority, as if he knew about such things. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand anything? You have to give in. Then he\u2019ll leave you alone!\u201d He laughed.</p><p>Tatiana laughed, too. \u201cI think you may be right, Anton. I think that\u2019s how older men work.\u201d</p><p>She continued to busy Dimitri with cards or books, with jokes or vodka. Vodka, in particular, was good. Dimitri tended to have a little too much and then fall asleep on the small sofa in the hallway, and Tatiana would take her grandmother\u2019s cardigan and go up onto the roof without him and sit with Anton and think of Pasha, and think of Alexander.</p><p>She passed the time with Anton, told jokes, read Zoshchenko and War and Peace, and looked at the Leningrad sky, wondering how much longer for the Germans to get to Leningrad.</p><p>Wondering how much longer for everything.</p><p>And after the other kids left to go to sleep, Tatiana continued to sit by the kerosene lamp on the roof and mouth little English words to herself from the dictionary and the phrase book. She learned to say \u201cPen.\u201d \u201cTable.\u201d \u201cLove.\u201d \u201cThe United States of America.\u201d \u201cPotato pancakes.\u201d She wished she had two minutes alone with Alexander to tell him some of the amusing phrases she was learning.</p><p>One night at the very end of August, with Anton asleep next to her, Tatiana tried to think of a way to make her life right again.</p><p>Once it had been right. As right as it could be. Suddenly after June 22 there was such havoc, constant, cheerless, and unending. But not all of it cheerless.</p><p>Tatiana missed the evening hour with Alexander at Kirov more than she could admit even to herself. The evening hour when they had sat apart and together and ambled through the empty streets; when they talked and were silent, and the silence flowed into their words as Lake Ladoga flowed into the Neva that flowed into the Gulf of Finland that flowed into the Baltic Sea. The evening hour when they smiled and the white of his teeth blinded her eyes, when he laughed and his laughter flew into her lungs, when she never took her eyes off him and no one saw but him, and he was all right with it.</p><p>The evening hour at Kirov when they were alone.</p><p>What to do? How to fix this? Somehow she had to make herself right again inside. For her own sake, for her sister\u2019s, and for Alexander\u2019s.</p><p>It was two in the morning. Tatiana was cold, wearing only an old sundress with a cardigan over it. She was thinking that she would rather spend the rest of her life on the roof than downstairs with Mama and Papa\u2019s forlorn hope for Pasha, or with Dasha\u2019s supplicating whisper . . . Tania, go away so I can be alone with him.</p><p>Tatiana thought about the war. Maybe if the German planes came whizzing by and dropped a bomb on our building, I could save everyone else but die in the process. Would they mourn me? Would they cry? Would Alexander wish things were different?</p><p>Different how?</p><p>Different when?</p><p>She knew that Alexander already wished things were different. He wished they had been different from the start.</p><p>But even at the start, on the bus still, together, untouched by anything but each other, was there a place where Tania and Shura could have gone when they wanted to be alone for two minutes to speak English phrases to one another? Other than the walk home from Kirov?</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t know of such a place.</p><p>Did Alexander?</p><p>This was a pointless exercise, designed only to pummel herself further. As if she needed it.</p><p>All I want is some relief, Tatiana thought. Why is that too much to ask?</p><p>Nothing brought her relief. Not Alexander\u2019s aloofness, not his occasional short temper with Dasha, not his moodiness, not his winning at cards all the time \u2014 nothing eased either Tatiana\u2019s feeling for him or her need for him. He didn\u2019t have many nights off. He usually had to be back for taps, while other nights he had sky duty at St. Isaac\u2019s. He had only one or two evenings off each week, but it was one or two evenings too many.</p><p>And tonight was one of those evenings. Please, Tania, please go away so I can be alone with him.</p><p>She heard a distant rumble. Overhead the airships floated by.</p><p>The hours at night and at morning and at day before night break, again the hours. Something had to be done. But what?</p><p>Tatiana came downstairs. She made herself a cup of tea to warm her cold hands and was sitting exhausted on the kitchen windowsill, looking out onto the dark courtyard, when out of the corner of her eye she saw Alexander walk past the door. She heard his footsteps slow down and then trail back. He stood in the doorway. For a moment they did not speak.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>She said coolly and bravely, \u201cWaiting for you to leave, so I can go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Alexander walked tentatively into the kitchen.</p><p>She glared at him.</p><p>He came closer. The thought of being able to smell him made Tatiana\u2019s heart weak. He stopped short of that.</p><p>\u201cI hardly ever stay late,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>Now that no one was watching her, Tatiana stared unblinking at him.</p><p>Looking at her with remorse and understanding, Alexander said, \u201cTatiasha, it\u2019s been very hard for you, I know. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my fault. I blame myself. What did I tell you? I never should have come into your hospital room that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, because before it was bearable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was better than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, it was.\u201d Tatiana wanted to jump down from the sill and go to him. She wanted to ride the tram, to sit on the bench, to sleep in a tent with him. She wanted to feel him next to her again. On her again. But what she said was, \u201cTell me, did you arrange for Dima to be in Leningrad every night? Because every night that he is here, he tries to take liberties with me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander\u2019s eyes flared. \u201cHe told me he had taken some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Is that why Alexander had been so cold? \u201cWhat did Dima say?\u201d Tatiana was too tired to be angry at Dimitri. Alexander came closer. Just a little more, she thought, and I\u2019ll be able to smell you.</p><p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d said Alexander, sounding pained.</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought he was telling the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, you know what?\u201d She swung her legs off the sill and put down her cup.</p><p>Alexander came closer. \u201cNo, what, Tatia?\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Tatiana smelled his maleness, his shampoo, his soap. Wanly she smiled. Then her smile vanished. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said, \u201cdo me a favor and stay away from me. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my level best,\u201d he said, taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tatiana said, and broke off. \u201cWhy are you coming over?\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t continue with Dasha.\u201d She sighed deeply. \u201cLike after Kirov. Go ahead. Go fight your war. And take Dimitri. He won\u2019t take no for an answer, and I\u2019m getting sick and tired of all this.\u201d Of all of you, she wanted to say but didn\u2019t. \u201cSoon I\u2019m going to get tired of saying no to him,\u201d Tatiana added for effect.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI can\u2019t leave now. The Germans are too close. Your family is going to need me.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou are going to need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m going to be fine. Please, Alexander . . . this is just too hard for me. Can\u2019t you see that? Say good-bye to Dasha, say good-bye to me, and take your Dimitri with you.\u201d She paused. \u201cPlease, please, go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Alexander said, nearly inaudibly, \u201chow can I not come and see you?\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cWho is going to feed me, Tania?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana blinked again. \u201cWell, that\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, very upset. \u201cI\u2019ll be making dinner for you and having it off with your best friend while you\u2019re knocking my sister. Did I get the terms right this time? That is perfect, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned on his heels and walked out.</p><p>The first thing Tatiana did when she woke up the next morning was go and see Vera at Grechesky Hospital. While Vera was looking at her ribs, Tatiana asked, \u201cVera, is there anything for me to do around here? Is there any job for me at the hospital maybe?\u201d</p><p>Vera\u2019s kind face studied her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You look so sad. Is it because of the leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m . . .\u201d The kindness got to Tatiana, who nearly opened her mouth and poured her heartache on Vera\u2019s bleached and unsuspecting head. Nearly. She got hold of herself. \u201cI\u2019m all right. Just can\u2019t go anywhere. Bored to tears. I stay on the roof all night, looking for bombs. Tell me, is there anything for me to do?\u201d</p><p>Vera remained thoughtful. \u201cWe could use a hand around here.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana instantly perked up. \u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is so much to do. You can sit behind the desk and do paperwork, or you can serve food in the cafeteria, or you can bandage wounds or take temperatures or, when you get better, maybe even learn nursing.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana smiled broadly. \u201cVera, that\u2019s fantastic!\u201d Then she frowned. \u201cBut what will I do about Kirov? I\u2019m supposed to go back and make tanks there as soon as my cast comes off. When is it coming off, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana! The front is at Kirov,\u201d exclaimed Vera. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to Kirov. You\u2019re not that brave. They give you a rifle there now and train you in combat before you can continue to work. You got out just in time, you know. But here we\u2019re always shorthanded. Too many people volunteer, and not enough of them come back.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNot everyone can be lucky like you, having an officer dig you out of the rubble.\u201d</p><p>If Tatiana could have skipped home, she would have.</p><p>That night at dinner, barely able to contain her enthusiasm, Tatiana told her family she had found a job close to home.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Go to work,\u201d said Papa. \u201cFinally! You can eat lunch there instead of eating here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania can\u2019t go yet,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cHer leg will never heal, and she\u2019ll limp for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she can\u2019t continue doing nothing and getting a dependent ration!\u201d Papa exclaimed loudly. \u201cWe can\u2019t feed her. At work I heard they\u2019re about to lower rations again. It\u2019s only going to get harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to work, Papa,\u201d said Tatiana, still cheerfully. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll eat less, all right?\u201d</p><p>Alexander glared at her from across the table, stabbing the mashed potatoes with his fork.</p><p>Papa threw down his fork. \u201cTania, this is all your fault! You should have left with your grandparents! It would be easier on our food situation, and you wouldn\u2019t be placing yourself in danger by remaining in Leningrad.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou should have left with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa, what are you talking about?\u201d asked Tatiana, not cheerfully and a notch louder than she ever spoke to her father. \u201cYou know I couldn\u2019t have left with Deda because of my leg.\u201d She frowned.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Tania,\u201d said Dasha, putting her hand on Tatiana\u2019s arm. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>Mama threw down her fork. \u201cTania! If you hadn\u2019t gone and done something idiotic, you wouldn\u2019t have a broken leg in the first place!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana ripped her arm from under Dasha\u2019s and turned to her mother. \u201cMama! Maybe if you hadn\u2019t said you would rather I had died instead of Pasha, I wouldn\u2019t have gone and tried to find him for you!\u201d</p><p>Mama and Papa stared speechlessly at Tatiana, while everyone else in the room was mute as well. \u201cI never said that!\u201d Mama cried, standing up from the table. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama! I heard you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you! \u2018Why couldn\u2019t God have taken our Tania instead?\u2019 You remember, Mama? Remember, Papa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, come on,\u201d said Dasha in a trembling voice. \u201cThey didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tanechka,\u201d said Dimitri, placing his hand on Tatiana. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d shouted Papa. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk that way to us when this whole thing has been your fault!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana tried to take a deep breath, but she could not, and she could not calm down. \u201cMy fault?\u201d she yelled to her father. \u201cIt\u2019s your fault! You\u2019re the one who sent Pasha to his death and then sat and did nothing at all to get him back\u2014\u201d</p><p>Papa shot up and hit her across the face so hard that she fell sideways from her chair.</p><p>Alexander shot up and shoved Tatiana\u2019s father away. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d yelled Papa. \u201cThis is family business. Get the hell out!\u201d</p><p>Alexander helped Tatiana to her feet. They stood between the couch and the dining table, close to Dasha, who was holding her shaking head in her hands. She wouldn\u2019t get up. She and Dimitri continued to sit. Papa and Mama both stood next to each other and panted.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s nose was bleeding. But now Alexander was between her and her father. Pressing herself against Alexander and holding on to his sleeve, Tatiana shouted, \u201cPapa, you can hit me all you want. You can kill me, too, if you like! It still won\u2019t bring Pasha back. And nobody is leaving, because there is nowhere for us to go!\u201d</p><p>Screaming, Papa went for her again but couldn\u2019t get past Alexander. \u201cNo,\u201d Alexander said, shaking his head, one of his arms extended behind him holding Tatiana, one of his arms in front of Papa.</p><p>A wailing Dasha finally stood up and rushed to her father, grabbing his arms. \u201cPapochka, Papochka, don\u2019t, please.\u201d Whirling to Tatiana, Dasha cried, \u201cLook what you\u2019ve done!\u201d And tried to get around Alexander, who stopped her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>Uncomprehending, Dasha stared at him. \u201cWhat, you\u2019re defending her still? Look what she\u2019s done!\u201d</p><p>Mama was crying. Papa was still screaming, red in the face. Dimitri continued to stare into his plate. Tatiana was behind Alexander as he and Dasha squared off. \u201cStop it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t done anything. All of you, stop it. Maybe if you had listened to her back in June when you could have gotten Pasha out, you wouldn\u2019t all be standing here fighting each other, and your son and brother might still be alive. Now it\u2019s too late. But now you keep your hands off her.\u201d</p><p>Turning to Tatiana, Alexander asked, \u201cAre you all right?\u201d Taking a napkin off the table, he handed it to her and said, \u201cHold the bridge of your nose to stop the bleeding. Go on. Quick.\u201d</p><p>Then he faced Tatiana\u2019s father. \u201cGeorgi Vasilievich,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cI understand you were trying to save your son.\u201d He paused. \u201cBelieve me, I know what you were doing. But don\u2019t take it out on Tania.\u201d</p><p>Papa threw down his vodka glass, cursed, and stumbled into the next room. Mama followed him, slamming the door behind her. Tatiana heard Mama\u2019s sobs. \u201cIt\u2019s always like this,\u201d she said unsteadily. \u201cShe cries, and someone goes in to apologize. Usually it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Dasha was still standing glaring at Alexander. \u201cI cannot believe,\u201d she said, \u201cthat you just sided with her against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that shit, Dasha,\u201d Alexander said loudly. \u201cYou think I sided against you because I wouldn\u2019t let you hit your little sister who has a broken leg? Why don\u2019t you pick on someone your own size? Or why don\u2019t you hit me? I know why,\u201d Alexander went on angrily. \u201cBecause you\u2019d only be able to do it once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Dasha said, and tried to slap him.</p><p>He grabbed her hand, pushing it hard away. \u201cYou\u2019re out of control, Dasha,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri, who hadn\u2019t said a word, sighed, stood and left with Alexander.</p><p>As soon as they were out the door, Dasha went for Tatiana, who couldn\u2019t stand and fell onto the dining table, right against the mashed potatoes she had made an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cNow look what you\u2019ve done!\u201d Dasha yelled. \u201cLook what you\u2019ve done!\u201d</p><p>The door swung open, and Alexander came through. Grabbing Dasha by the arm and yanking her away from Tatiana, he said, \u201cTania, can you give us a minute, please?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana went out, shutting the door behind herself, still holding the napkin to her nose.</p><p>She heard Alexander shouting and then Dasha shouting.</p><p>She and Dimitri stood in the hallway and looked at each other dumbly. Shrugging, Dimitri said, \u201cHe\u2019s like that. He\u2019s got that foundling temper.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wanted to say that she had never seen him lose it before tonight but remained silent, trying to listen. Dimitri said, \u201cHe needs to stay out of it and let the family take care of its own business. Don\u2019t you think? Tomorrow it will all be better.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cReminds me of that old joke: \u2018Vasili, why do you beat me all the time? I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u2019 And Vasili replies, \u2018You should be thankful. If I knew what you were doing, I\u2019d kill you.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Dimitri laughed as if that were the funniest thing he had heard all day.</p><p>She heard Alexander\u2019s voice from inside the room. \u201cCan\u2019t you see?\u201d he was yelling at Dasha. \u201cShe isn\u2019t driving me away, you are \u2014 by your behavior. How do you think I can ever take your side when you hit your sister?\u201d</p><p>Dasha said something.</p><p>\u201cDasha, don\u2019t give me your stupid apologies. I don\u2019t need them.\u201d Pause. \u201cI can\u2019t continue, no.\u201d</p><p>From inside the door Tatiana heard hysterical sobbing. \u201cPlease, Alex, please don\u2019t go, please, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re right, my love, you\u2019re right. Please don\u2019t go. What can I do? Do you want me to apologize to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha, if you touch your sister again, I will finish with you instantly,\u201d Tatiana heard Alexander say. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never hit her again,\u201d Dasha promised.</p><p>Silence from the room.</p><p>Tatiana was dumbstruck.</p><p>Not knowing where to look, she wiped her bleeding nose and looked at Dimitri, shrugging her shoulders. \u201cCan\u2019t have a moment alone even to fight,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, at least that worked out.\u201d Her body began to slide down.</p><p>Dimitri picked her up, sat her on the sofa in the hallway, and wiped her face, patting her back. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he kept saying.</p><p>The Sarkovs knocked on their hall door, also wanting to know if everything was all right. One fight in the communal apartment and everyone knew. Everyone heard. Everything.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cJust a little argument. Everything is fine.\u201d</p><p>Summarily, Dasha walked out of the room and apologized sullenly to Tatiana. She went back inside to be with Alexander and closed the door. Tatiana asked Dimitri to go and then limped upstairs to the roof, where she sat and prayed for a bomb.</p><p>She saw Alexander walk out of the stairwell doors and come toward her. Tatiana was sitting talking to Anton, and though her heart had skipped a beat, she didn\u2019t acknowledge him. Her hands were in Anton\u2019s hands. Anton nudged her and stopped talking. Sighing, Tatiana turned to Alexander. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said unhappily.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>Loudly she said, \u201cAnton, you remember Dasha\u2019s Alexander? Shake hands, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Anton let go of Tatiana and shook hands with Alexander, who said, \u201cAnton, will you excuse us for a moment?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Anton scooted away on his haunches, still staying close enough to overhear.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move away from him,\u201d Alexander said to Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to move around so much. I\u2019m fine right here.\u201d</p><p>Without arguing further, Alexander picked Tatiana up and walked a few steps away to set her down in the corner of the roof where there was no Anton and no Mariska \u2014 the seven-year-old girl who practically lived on the roof because her parents were drunk down on the second floor.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hands, Tania.\u201d</p><p>Unwillingly Tatiana complied. Her hands were shaking. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cDoes this happen often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. It happens every once in a while.\u201d She shook her head, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never let anyone hurt you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut what good is it? Now they\u2019re all angry at me. You\u2019ve just had a bit of Dasha, you\u2019re going to leave, but I\u2019m still here, in that bed, in that room, in that hallway. I\u2019m still the trash.\u201d</p><p>His face was full of pity and feeling. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a bit of Dasha. I will not let them hurt you. I don\u2019t give a shit if Dasha finds out about us, or if Dimitri\u2014\u201d He broke off. Tatiana strained to listen. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit if I expose us to all the world. I will not let anyone hurt you.\u201d He paused, peering into her face. \u201cAnd you know it. So if you don\u2019t want to see me hang, or ruin your plans to spare Dasha from the truth, I suggest you be more careful around people who might hit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo they not do this in your America? Here in Russia, parents hit their children, and the children take it. Big sisters hit their little sisters, and the little sisters take it. That\u2019s just how it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut you\u2019re too small to let anyone hit you. Plus, he is drinking too much. It makes him more volatile. You must be more careful around him.\u201d</p><p>His hands were soothing and warm. Tatiana half-closed her eyes, imagining only one thing. Her mouth parted in a silent moan.</p><p>\u201cBabe, don\u2019t do that,\u201d Alexander said, his hands holding hers tighter.</p><p>\u201cShura, I\u2019m lost,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m completely lost.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she pulled her hands away and with her eyes motioned behind him. Dasha was coming toward them from the stairwell.</p><p>She stopped near them and said, \u201cI came to see my sister.\u201d She looked from Alexander to Tatiana. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were still here. You said you had to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did have to go,\u201d Alexander said, standing up. He gave Dasha a quick peck. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a few days, and you, Tania, go and get your nose looked at. Make sure it\u2019s not broken.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was barely able to nod.</p><p>After he left, Dasha sat next to her. \u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He wanted to see if I was all right.\u201d In that instant something overcame Tatiana, and before she opened her mouth and told Dasha everything, she said, \u201cYou know what, Dasha? You\u2019re my older sister and I love you, and I\u2019m going to be all right tomorrow, but right now you\u2019re the last person I want to talk to. I realize I do it too often \u2014 bow to you when you want me to talk, or to go away, or whatever. Well, tomorrow I will bow to you again, but right now I don\u2019t want to talk to you. I just want to sit here and think.\u201d Tatiana paused and said pointedly, \u201cSo please, Dasha, go away.\u201d</p><p>Dasha didn\u2019t move. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, Tania, I really am. But you shouldn\u2019t have said what you said to Papa and Mama. You know how broken up they are about Pasha. You know they already blame themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha, I don\u2019t want to hear your backhanded apology!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d asked Dasha. \u201cYou never talked that way before. To anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dasha, please. Go away.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana sat on the roof until morning, wrapped in the old cardigan, her legs cold, her face cold.</p><p>She was stunned by her unwavering intimacy with Alexander. Though they hadn\u2019t spoken much, though he had been cool to her, though the last words they had exchanged were bitter, she had no doubt as she laid into her mother and father that if she needed defending, the man who went to find her at Luga would stand up for her. That conviction had given her the strength to yell at Papa, to say the insulting thing to him, no matter how true it was. No matter how much she had wanted to say it, she never would have dared had she not felt Alexander\u2019s strength.</p><p>And when Tatiana stood behind him, she felt even braver, not caring for her bleeding nose, for her throbbing ribs. She knew he would not let even Dasha hurt her; she knew this as she knew her own heart, and that knowledge in the dark of night suddenly made her at peace with herself, at peace with her life, and at peace even with Dasha.</p><p>Dimitri, for all his purported feelings for Tatiana, had done nothing, as she knew he wouldn\u2019t. Her opinion of Dimitri hadn\u2019t changed a whit. Dimitri was a Soviet man. She did not blame Dimitri for this \u2014 for being true to his nature.</p><p>Yet she was using all her strength to deny her own: Tatiana knew that she belonged irrevocably to Alexander.</p><p>She thought she could extricate herself from him, that she could go on with her life somehow, that he could go on with his.</p><p>It was all a sham.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a way of getting over a passing crush on your older sister\u2019s swain. This was the moon of Jupiter and the sun of Venus aligning in the sky over her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>5</p><p>When Alexander walked into his quarters, Dimitri was lying down in his top bunk.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d said Alexander tiredly.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d said Dimitri.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. Didn\u2019t I just see you? I\u2019m going to sleep. I have to wake up at five tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to the point, then,\u201d Dimitri said, hopping off the bunk. \u201cI want you to end the charade you\u2019re playing with my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just have this one thing for myself? You already have a good life, don\u2019t you? Think about all the things you have that you want. You\u2019re a lieutenant in the Red Army. You have a company of men obeying your every order. I\u2019m not in your company\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you\u2019re in mine, Private,\u201d said Anatoly Marazov, jumping off the bunk next to Alexander\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s late, and we all have long days ahead of us. You shouldn\u2019t be here raising your voice. You\u2019re here by privilege.\u201d</p> <p>Dimitri saluted him. Alexander stood by quietly.</p><p>\u201cAt attention, Private,\u201d Marazov said, coming up to Dimitri. \u201cI thought when you came here you were just relaxing, waiting for your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a small matter between me and the lieutenant, sir,\u201d said Dimitri.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a small matter, Private, when I\u2019m not woken up out of a much-needed sleep. As soon as I\u2019m awake, it ceases to be a small matter and becomes something else entirely. Now, at ease.\u201d Marazov, who was in his long johns, walked around Dimitri, who was fully uniformed, and said, \u201cCan this small matter wait till morning?\u201d</p><p>Alexander stepped in. \u201cLieutenant, can you give us a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>Trying not to smile, Marazov bowed his head. \u201cAs you wish, Lieutenant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe will take it out in the hall.\u201d</p><p>They stepped out into the corridor; Alexander closed the door behind him. \u201cDima, what\u2019s the problem? Don\u2019t get yourself into trouble with your commanding officer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the shit. Tell me, when is it enough for you?\u201d Remaining at a distance from Alexander, Dimitri hissed, \u201cYou can have any girl in the world. Why do you want mine?\u201d</p><p>It took all of Alexander\u2019s strength not to ask Dimitri the same question. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. She was getting hurt. I helped her.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri continued, \u201cI\u2019m just a grunt. I have to follow everybody\u2019s orders and eat everybody\u2019s shit. She is the only one who treats me like a human being.\u201d</p><p>She can\u2019t help it. She treats everybody like that. \u201cBut, Dima,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cyou also have your life. Think of all the things you don\u2019t have that you don\u2019t want. You have not been sent down south, where men are falling into Hitler\u2019s meat grinder. Marazov\u2019s unit is staying here until the front comes to Leningrad. I\u2019ve taken care of that. To help you.\u201d He paused. \u201cBecause I\u2019m your friend.\u201d He took a step toward Dimitri. \u201cI have been very good to you over the years. What has happened to our friendship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove happened,\u201d snapped Dimitri. \u201cShe is more important to me now. I want to survive this f*cking war \u2014 for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dimitri,\u201d said Alexander and fell silent. \u201cSo survive \u2014 for her. Who\u2019s stopping you?\u201d</p> <p>Dimitri whispered, \u201cWhatever silly crush she might have, it\u2019s not real. How could it be? She doesn\u2019t know who you are.\u201d Dimitri paused. \u201cOr does she?\u201d</p><p>Alexander\u2019s heart skipped erratically before he answered. The lightbulb next to them was broken. The one down the hall flickered on and off. Sounds of men laughing came from some of the rooms. Water was running. And still they stood silently across from one another. Alexander wondered what Dimitri was referring to. His indiscreet past? America? He glared at Dimitri. \u201cOf course she doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said at last. \u201cShe knows absolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if she did, Alexander, it would make things very dangerous, don\u2019t you think? For us.\u201d</p><p>Alexander took a step toward Dimitri, who put out his palms and backed into the wall. \u201cDimitri,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cdon\u2019t f*ck with me. I told you, she knows nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt anyone,\u201d Dimitri said in a small voice, his hands up. \u201cI just want my chance with Tania.\u201d</p><p>His teeth clenched, Alexander turned away and went back to his quarters.</p><p>Lying on his bed with his arms behind his head, Marazov said casually, \u201cAlexander, you want me to take care of Chernenko for you? Is he giving you trouble?\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can handle him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could reassign him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already been reassigned. Four times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nobody wants him, so you give him to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to you, to Kashnikov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and Kashnikov is mine.\u201d</p><p>Getting out a flask and taking a swig of vodka, then passing it to Alexander, Marazov said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough men to throw in front of Hitler\u2019s tanks to hold Leningrad. We are going to have to surrender, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight on the streets with rocks, if we have to.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Marazov saluted him from across the bunks and fell down onto his pillow. \u201cLieutenant Belov, I haven\u2019t seen much of you off duty. You can\u2019t believe some of the girls that are coming to the club lately.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>Alexander grinned back and shook his head. \u201cNo more for me.\u201d</p><p>Marazov lifted his head in surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the words that are coming out of your mouth, Lieutenant. I hear you. I think you\u2019re speaking Russian, but I just can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing. What in f*ck\u2019s name is going on?\u201d</p><p>When Alexander didn\u2019t answer, Marazov said, \u201cWait, wait. You\u2019re not . . . oh, no!\u201d He laughed infectiously. \u201cNow I know you\u2019re full of shit. What happened to you? You\u2019re not dying, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping, that\u2019s for f*cking sure,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cWho can I wake up? I can\u2019t keep this to myself.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over his bunk and hit the sleeping soldier beneath him with a pillow. \u201cGrinkov, wake up. You won\u2019t believe it when I tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cF*ck off,\u201d Grinkov said, throwing the pillow to the floor and turning away.</p><p>Alexander laughed. \u201cStop it, you crazy bastard,\u201d he said to Marazov. \u201cStop it before I have you reassigned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Alexander, putting a pillow over his face.</p><p>\u201cWait, is it the girl you keep muttering about in your sleep?\u201d</p><p>Taking the pillow off his face, Alexander said with surprise, \u201cI don\u2019t mutter in my sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes you do,\u201d said Marazov. \u201cAnd how. Grinkov, what does Belov mutter when he is sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cF*ck off,\u201d Grinkov said again, turning to the wall.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s some girl\u2019s name. It\u2019s . . . it\u2019s . . . Alexander, you\u2019re a fiend for keeping it from your fellow officers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because you can be trusted,\u201d said Alexander, turning on his side.</p><p>Marazov clapped his hands. \u201cI want to meet this one,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to meet the girl who has taken our wandering Alexander\u2019s horse and cart.\u201d</p><p>Later, as he lay with a heavy chest, unable to sleep, Alexander knew that it was not as easy as a walk in the fields to reconstruct your heart. If his life in the Soviet Union had taught him anything, it had taught him that. But he was going to try \u2014 after he had spoken to her. Everything would be easier to carry after he had spoken to her.</p><p>Alexander knew that before he had light instead of darkness, he had to deserve light instead of darkness. The time for him had obviously not come. He still had to earn his stars. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>6</p><p>In the morning Mama asked Tatiana if she was pleased with herself. No, Tatiana replied. Not particularly.</p><p>After they had all left, she started to get ready to go to the hospital. There was a knock on the door, and when she opened it, she found Alexander standing outside.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you in,\u201d Tatiana said, pointing to Zhanna Sarkova, who walked out of her room and stood in the corridor looking suspiciously at them. Anxiety and excitement mixed in equal measure inside Tatiana. She couldn\u2019t let him inside, couldn\u2019t close the door, not with Sarkova standing watching them, yet\u2014</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Alexander said, striding in. \u201cI\u2019ve got a whole platoon waiting for me downstairs. We\u2019re going to barricade the southeastern streets.\u201d He paused. \u201cTerrible news. Mga fell to the Germans yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, not Mga.\u201d Tatiana remembered Alexander\u2019s words about the trains. \u201cWhat does it mean for us?\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s the end. I just wanted to make sure you were all right after yesterday. And,\u201d he said pointedly, \u201cthat you weren\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatia, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShura, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He raised his voice.</p><p>Glancing behind him, Tatiana said, \u201cI want you to know that that woman is definitely going to say something to my family about you coming by. I guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re going to give me my cap that I left here yesterday. During inspection this morning, I got fined. I need it.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana left the door open while Alexander went into the bedroom to retrieve his cap.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go to the hospital,\u201d he said, coming out and standing in the hallway.</p> <p>\u201cAlexander, I\u2019m going crazy. All day, every day. In the hospital at least I\u2019ll see some real suffering. It\u2019ll cheer me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour leg is never going to heal if you stand all day on it. You have a couple more weeks until the cast comes off. Go to work then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not staying here for another two weeks \u2014 the only hospital they\u2019ll put me in in two weeks will be a mental hospital!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish Kirov weren\u2019t on the front line,\u201d Alexander said softly. \u201cYou could go back to work there. I would meet you every day.\u201d He paused. \u201cLike I used to, remember?\u201d</p><p>Did she remember?</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s heart was pounding. But there was Sarkova standing in the corridor watching them through their open door.</p><p>Alexander muttered, \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m fed up,\u201d and shut the door.</p><p>Tatiana opened her mouth and then closed it again. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in more and more trouble.\u201d</p> <p>He came closer to her.</p><p>She backed away from him.</p><p>Alexander took another step toward her. \u201cHow is your nose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would you know?\u201d He came closer.</p><p>She put her palms out. \u201cShura, please.\u201d</p><p>There was a loud knock on the door. \u201cTanechka, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thank you,\u201d Tatiana called out.</p><p>The door knob turned, and Sarkova opened the door. \u201cI just wanted to know if you\u2019d like me to make you anything to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, Zhanna,\u201d said Tatiana, keeping a straight face.</p><p>Sarkova glared at Alexander, who turned to Tatiana and rolled his eyes. Tatiana nearly burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cWe were just leaving,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to work\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alexander whispered, \u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lieutenant Belov is going to build barricades.\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned to Zhanna. \u201cBarricades, Comrade Sarkova,\u201d he said, striding toward her. \u201cDo you know what those are? Structures nearly three meters high by four meters thick, stretching for twenty kilometers.\u201d</p><p>Sarkova backed away into the hall.</p><p>\u201cAnd each barricade is supplied with eight machine-gun rests, ten antitank positions, thirteen mortar positions, and forty-six machine-gun points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how we protect the city we love,\u201d Alexander said, slamming the door.</p><p>Tatiana stood behind him shaking her head, a smile of delight on her face. \u201cYou\u2019ve done it now.\u201d She grabbed her bag. \u201cLet\u2019s go, barricade-builder.\u201d</p><p>They went out, locking the door behind them and leaving Sarkova in the communal kitchen, grumbling into her tea.</p><p>As he was helping her down the stairs, Alexander took hold of her hand. Tatiana tried to pull away. \u201cAlexander\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He brought her to him on the stairwell landing.</p><p>Tatiana felt the rumbling inside her, the rumbling of wood crackling on the rack of fire. \u201cLook,\u201d she said, \u201cI will ask Vera to put me to work in the hospital canteen. Maybe you can come for lunch?\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll serve you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cThough few things give me more pleasure than to have you feed me\u201d \u2014 he smiled \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019ll be too far south. I won\u2019t be able to get back in time for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, let go of me. We\u2019re on a landing in my building . . .\u201d</p><p>He held onto her hand. Sensing something, she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Alexander hesitated, and his chocolate eyes melted sadness onto her. \u201cOh, Tania. I have to talk to you.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI have to talk to you about Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t now. I need to talk to you at length and alone. Come and see me tonight at St. Isaac\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s turbulent heart hammered in her chest. St. Isaac\u2019s! \u201cAlexander, I can barely walk to the hospital three blocks away. How am I going to get to St. Isaac\u2019s?\u201d But Tatiana knew: if she had to crawl dragging one leg behind her, she would get herself to the cathedral.</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t want you to walk all that way without help. The streets are safe, but you . . .\u201d He stroked her face. \u201cDo you have a friend who can take you up there?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot Anton. A female friend. A single female friend you can trust, who can help you and drop you off nearby? Then you can just walk a block or two by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was quiet. \u201cHow am I going to get back home?\u201d she said.</p><p>Alexander smiled, bringing her closer to him. \u201cAs always,\u201d he said, \u201cI will take you home myself.\u201d</p><p>She stared at his tunic buttons.</p><p>\u201cTania, we desperately need to have a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know it.\u201d</p><p>She knew it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will try. Now, go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLift your\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he stopped speaking, Tatiana raised her face to him. They kissed deeply. \u201cDo you have any idea what I feel?\u201d Alexander whispered, his hands in her hair.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tatiana replied, holding on to him, her legs numb. \u201cI only have an idea what I feel.\u201d</p><p>That night a miracle happened. Tatiana\u2019s cousin Marina\u2019s phone was working. Tatiana begged Marina to visit her, and Marina came, around eight. Tatiana couldn\u2019t stop hugging her. \u201cMarinka, you are living proof that there is indeed a God in the heavens. I needed you so much,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no God, you know that. Where have I been?\u201d Marina said, laughing. \u201cLet go of me. Where have you been? I heard all about your escapades in Luga.\u201d She blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about our Pasha.\u201d Brightening a bit, she said, \u201cWhy do you look like a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have so much to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Marina sat down at the table in the room where just yesterday Tatiana had stood behind Alexander. \u201cIs there anything to eat? I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d</p><p>Marina was a big-hipped, small-breasted, dark-eyed girl with short black hair and clusters of birthmarks on her face. She was nineteen and in her second year at Leningrad University. Marina was the closest thing Tatiana had to a best friend and a confidante. Marina, Tatiana, and Pasha had spent many summer days romping around Luga and nearby Novgorod. The difference in their ages had become apparent only a year or so ago. Tatiana simply no longer belonged with Marina\u2019s crowd.</p><p>Tatiana hastily gave Marina some bread, some cheese, some tea and said, \u201cMarina, eat quick, because I need to go for a walk, all right? You look pretty in that dress. How was your summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go for a walk. You can\u2019t walk. Look at you. Talk to me here.\u201d Mama and Papa were in the next room with Dasha, listening to the radio. Tatiana and Marina were alone in the room; Tatiana\u2019s family was not speaking to her after yesterday. Chewing, Marina looked Tatiana over. \u201cStart with the hair. What happened to your hair? And why is your skirt so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cut my hair. And the skirt hides the cast. Get up. We need to go.\u201d Tatiana pulled on Marina\u2019s arm. She was in a hurry. Alexander told her to come after ten, and here it was nearly nine, and she was still at Fifth Soviet. Was she prepared to tell Marina everything to get her to help? She pulled again at Marina\u2019s plump arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Enough eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to walk? You can barely hobble. And why do we need to go anywhere? When is the cast coming off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go for a hobble. The cast feels as if it\u2019s never coming off. How do I look?\u201d</p><p>Marina stopped eating and eyed Tatiana. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Marina said, wiping her mouth and standing up. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana Metanova! I know that something is seriously wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania! I\u2019ve known you for seventeen years, and you have never asked me how you looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if your phone were working more often, I would. Are you going to answer me, or can we just go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair is too short, your skirt is too long, your blouse is white and tight \u2014 what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Finally Tatiana got Marina out the door. They walked slowly down Grechesky, to Insurrection Square, where they took a tram down Nevsky Prospekt to the Admiralty. Tatiana walked supported by Marina\u2019s arm. She had a little trouble walking and talking at the same time. The walking took most of her energy.</p><p>\u201cTania, tell me, why did you jump off a moving train? Is that how you broke your leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not how I broke my leg,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cand I jumped off a moving train because that was what I had to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid a ton of bricks fall on you because they had to, too?\u201d Marina asked with a chortle. \u201cIs that how you broke your leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and are you going to stop?\u201d</p><p>Marina laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Pasha, Tanechka,\u201d she said, much more quietly. \u201cHe was the best boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI wish I had found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Marina paused. \u201cThis has not been a great summer. I haven\u2019t seen you since before the war started.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana nodded. \u201cYou almost saw me. I was very close to coming and visiting you the day the war started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wished she could have told Marina everything \u2014 about her emotion and her conscience, about her fear and confusion. What Tatiana did instead was tell Marina about Dasha and Alexander, and herself and Dimitri, and herself and Luga, and Alexander\u2019s search for her. What Tatiana didn\u2019t tell Marina was the truth.</p><p>Tatiana could barely trust herself not to slip in front of Dasha amid the ice of constant lies on which she skated. How could she trust Marina, who had nothing at stake? Tatiana didn\u2019t tell her, sensing that truth forged a chasm between her and all the people she loved. How can that be? Tatiana thought, as they came to the Admiralty Gardens and sat on a bench. How can it be that deceit and treachery and secrecy bonded her to other human beings instead of truth and trust and openness? How could it be that she could not trust a member of her own family with a personal matter? This life just seems to breed contempt for other human beings.</p><p>The Admiralty Gardens were laid out on the banks of the Neva, between the Palace Bridge and St. Isaac\u2019s. Tatiana was not far from Alexander. If she strained, she might be able to hear him breathe. She smiled. Tall leafy elms branched out over the footpaths and the benches much the same as they did in the Summer Garden. The difference was, in the Summer Garden Tatiana had walked and sat with him.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Marina said, \u201cis there a reason we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Marina,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cWe\u2019re just sitting and talking.\u201d She wished she had a watch. How late was it already?</p><p>\u201cI used to come to this park,\u201d Marina said. \u201cOnce I even brought you. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana, suddenly blushing, said, \u201cYes . . . I do.\u201d</p><p>Marina said, \u201cI\u2019ve had some good times in my life. They don\u2019t seem so far away. You think we\u2019ll have them again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Marinka,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI\u2019m counting on it. I haven\u2019t had any good times yet.\u201d She smiled at her cousin.</p><p>Marina laughed. \u201cNot even with Dima?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, not!\u201d Tatiana said, and didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>Marina put her arm around Tatiana. \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, Tania. You\u2019ll get out of this city somehow.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shook her head. \u201cNo. There are no more trains, Marinka. Mga fell.\u201d</p><p>Marina was quiet. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard from Papa for three days,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s been fighting at Izhorsk. That\u2019s near Mga, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tatiana said faintly. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>Marina held Tatiana closer. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is getting out of this city,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mama is so sick. My papa is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Tatiana, patting her cousin\u2019s leg. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it, Marina. We just have to be strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, especially you,\u201d Marina said, with a shake of her head, shuddering away her unhappy thoughts. \u201cWill you tell me why you brought me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have nothing to tell.\u201d</p><p>Marina tickled Tatiana\u2019s arm. \u201cTania, tell me about Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing to tell.\u201d</p><p>Marina giggled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you of all people are seeing a soldier!\u201d She looked askance at Tatiana. \u201cOh, no \u2014 you\u2019re not meeting him here later, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Tatiana cried. \u201cDima and I are just friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sure. Soldiers have only one way of being friendly, Tania.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Tatiana\u2019s turn to look askance at her cousin. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember I went out with a soldier last year?\u201d Marina made a derisive clicking sound with her tongue. \u201cI glimpsed the life he lived and said forget it, I want no part of it. But this summer I was seeing someone nice, another student. He enlisted and went down to Fornosovo.\u201d She stopped. \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from him since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cWhat did you want no part of with soldiers? War, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, not war. Women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen?\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cWomen \u2014 good-time girls, pick-me-up girls, garrison hacks, harlots \u2014 all kinds of women come to the bars and the clubs and the barracks offering themselves to garrison soldiers, and the soldiers accept. All of them. It\u2019s just what they do. Like having a smoke. Every time they\u2019re off duty, every time they have time off at the weekend, every time they get furlough.\u201d Marina shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re keeping Dimitri away. Easy women, difficult women, young girls like you, it\u2019s all the same to soldiers \u2014 just one big conquest party to them.\u201d</p><p>In a small, horrified voice, Tatiana said, \u201cMarinka, what are you talking about? Not in Leningrad. That\u2019s only in the West. In America.\u201d</p><p>Marina burst out laughing. \u201cTania, I love you,\u201d she said, putting an arm around her. \u201cI really do. You are just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not Alexander,\u201d muttered a shaken Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cWho? Oh, Dasha\u2019s guy. No? Ask Dasha.\u201d Marina laughed. \u201cHow do you think he met her?\u201d</p><p>Dasha did meet Alexander in Sadko. \u201cYou\u2019re not saying . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Dasha, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Tatiana was sorry she\u2019d ever called her.</p><p>When Tatiana remained silent, Marina continued. \u201cLook, the point I\u2019m making is that you have to be careful with a soldier like Dimitri, especially you of all people. They expect certain things. And when they don\u2019t get the things they expect, they take them anyway. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana kept quiet. How in the world had they started talking about this?</p><p>\u201cAre you still friendly with Anton Iglenko? He is a nice boy, and he really likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarina!\u201d Tatiana shook her head. \u201cAnton is my friend.\u201d She sat breathing heavily, keeping her hands steady on her lap. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>Marina smiled, ruffling Tatiana\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re adorable, Tania. And blind as always. Remember Misha? Remember how stuck on you he was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Tatiana strained to remember. \u201cMisha from Luga?\u201d</p><p>Marina nodded. \u201cFor three summers in a row. Pasha couldn\u2019t keep him away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d Tatiana and Misha used to hang upside down from trees together. She taught him how to do cartwheels. And Pasha, too.</p><p>Marina asked, \u201cTania, have you ever talked to Dasha about these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no!\u201d Tatiana exclaimed, trying to get up. She felt as if she were being stabbed repeatedly with a blunt kitchen utensil.</p><p>Marina helped her stand. \u201cWell, I suggest you do. She\u2019s your older sister. She should help you. But be careful with Dimitri, Tania. You don\u2019t want to be just another notch in some soldier\u2019s belt.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana tried to think of Alexander as she knew him. She knew nothing about that part of him. A vision of his head appeared, softly kissing the top of her breast when she lay wounded in his tent. She shook her head. What Marina was describing, that was not her Alexander.</p><p>Then Tatiana remembered Dimitri\u2019s comment about Alexander\u2019s extracurricular activities. She felt ill. \u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d she said dejectedly, and slowly they walked back to the tram stop on Nevsky. Tatiana told Marina that she didn\u2019t have to go all the way back home with her. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fine. I can walk home from Insurrection Square. Honestly. Look, your bus home will come any minute. Don\u2019t worry for a second about me.\u201d</p><p>Marina said she could not leave Tatiana alone at night in the middle of the city. It hadn\u2019t occurred to Tatiana that she should be afraid of anything. \u201cAlexander told us that violent crime has fallen off dramatically since war began. It\u2019s almost nonexistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, if Alexander told you . . .\u201d Marina said, peering at Tatiana\u2019s face. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. Go,\u201d Tatiana said, and then she saw a sad reluctance in Marina that she had not seen at first, so wrapped up was she in her own upset haze. Focusing, she studied Marina for a moment. She couldn\u2019t see. Reaching out, she touched Marina\u2019s face. Marina blinked. Tatiana saw. \u201cWho is home, Marina?\u201d Tatiana asked quietly. \u201cWho are you going home to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Marina replied, just as quietly. \u201cMama\u2019s in the hospital. Papa\u2019s gone. Down the hall, the Lublins\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarinka,\u201d Tatiana said softly, \u201cdon\u2019t stay by yourself. Come and live with us. We have room now. Deda and Babushka have left. You don\u2019t want to be alone. Come on. You\u2019ll sleep with Dasha and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Marina said.</p><p>Tatiana nodded. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, have you asked your parents about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to. Just pack your things and come. Your mother is my father\u2019s sister. He will not say no. Come, all right?\u201d</p><p>Marina gave Tatiana a hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling so alone in those rooms without Mama and Papa.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana patted Marina, and said, \u201cI know \u2014 Look! Your bus!\u201d</p><p>Waving to Tatiana, Marina ran across Nevsky to catch her bus, and Tatiana sat on the bench and waited for her tram to go back home.</p><p>She felt sick to her stomach.</p><p>Her tram came; the doors opened. The conductor looked at her. Tatiana shook her head. The tram left.</p><p>How could she not go to see him? She could not stay away from him.</p><p>Getting up, Tatiana limped past the Admiralty Gardens to St. Isaac\u2019s.</p><p>Two soldiers were walking toward her. Stopping in front of Tatiana, they banged their rifles on the pavement and asked where she was headed. She told them.</p><p>One soldier said St. Isaac\u2019s was closed this time of night. She said yes, but she was looking for a Lieutenant Belov. They knew him, and their serious faces relaxed. One soldier said, \u201cI told you, Viktor, that we should have enrolled in officers\u2019 school, and you didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it\u2019d be more work, not more\u2014\u201d He glanced at Tatiana and broke off. \u201cAnd who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis cousin from Krasnodar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Cousin,\u201d said Viktor. \u201cWell, come with us. We\u2019ll take you to him. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to get up to the observation arcade with that cast. It\u2019s about two hundred steps up a spiral staircase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it,\u201d Tatiana said.</p><p>St. Isaac\u2019s had never seemed so far away from Nevsky, even though it was less than a kilometer. By the time they got to the cathedral, she was panting and her leg was throbbing. In front of the cathedral on the banks of the Neva, Tatiana saw the shape of the statue of Peter the Great on his steed \u2014 the Bronze Horseman \u2014 a faint silhouette covered with a wooden form filled with canvas and sand. The Bronze Horseman was built by Catherine the Great as a tribute to Peter the Great for building Leningrad. Tonight nothing could be seen of the black horse or the majestic rider or his outstretched hand; just sandbags to protect the statue from the Germans.</p><p>Viktor said, \u201cTomorrow they\u2019re going to impose a curfew on the whole city. No more evening excursions. So make this meeting with Lieutenant Belov count, cousin.\u201d</p><p>They brought her inside the cavernous granite hall. She heard the light beating of the pendulum the Communists had placed inside the cathedral to turn the place of worship into a science museum.</p><p>The guard at the narrow opening to the staircase asked if Tatiana was clean.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think so. She\u2019s not carrying any bombs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you search her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d said Viktor. He ran his hands over her ribs, making Tatiana grimace. She felt an increasing anxiety. Being alone with three soldiers in a dark, ominous building, with Alexander high up and unable to hear her, made her fear things she could not imagine. It was an irrational fear, she told herself, as Viktor\u2019s hands moved down to her hips. He held her a little tighter, and suddenly her fear got the better of her. \u201cMaybe one of you can just,\u201d she said, trying to step away, \u201clet him know I\u2019m here.\u201d She took another breath. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019ll just be getting back. You can tell him I stopped by.\u201d</p><p>A voice coming down from the staircase said, \u201cLet go of her.\u201d It was Alexander, who appeared in the doorway with his rifle. Tatiana breathed immediate relief.</p><p>Viktor quickly let go. \u201cNothing to it, Lieutenant. We were just checking her for weapons. She says she is your cousin from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate!\u201d Alexander came up close to Viktor, towering over him. \u201cWe have standards, Private, even in the Red Army. These standards do not allow us to menace young girls. Unless you want to face disciplinary action, I suggest you don\u2019t let me catch you doing that again.\u201d He put his hand on Tatiana\u2019s back and said to his men, \u201cYou two, go back on the street where you belong. Corporal, you stay here until you\u2019re relieved by Petrenko and Kapov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the three soldiers said in unison. The corporal took his post by the doorway.</p><p>Alexander was trying not to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a hike up,\u201d he said, his hand on her back, prodding her to the staircase. \u201cCome on.\u201d When they were around a column and not seen by anyone\u2019s eyes, Alexander smiled broadly. \u201cTania . . .\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m so happy you came to see me.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, melting, warming, Tatiana said softly, \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they scare you? They\u2019re harmless,\u201d he said, stroking her hair.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re so harmless, why did you come down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard your voice and theirs. They\u2019re harmless, but you sounded scared.\u201d He was looking at her so . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tatiana said shyly.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Alexander crouched in front of her. \u201cGo on. Grab my neck. Remember how to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to carry me up two hundred stairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do after you came all this way. Can you hold my weapon?\u201d</p><p>Holding on to the rails, he propelled himself up with her hands around his neck. Hoping he wouldn\u2019t notice, Tatiana silently kissed the back of his military tunic.</p><p>Alexander brought her into a glassed-in circular arcade with five columns that partially obstructed the view of the horizon and the sky. Setting her down, he took his rifle from her and propped it against the wall of the gold dome. \u201cWe have to go out on the balcony for a clearer view. Will you be all right?\u201d He smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re very high up. You\u2019re not afraid of heights, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of heights, no,\u201d Tatiana said, looking up at him.</p><p>They walked out onto a narrow outdoor balcony deck circling the arcade above the rotunda. A short iron railing ran around the deck. The view from up here would have been quite striking, Tatiana thought, if only Leningrad weren\u2019t prepared for war. All the lights were extinguished, and in the black of night she could not make out even the white airships floating silently in the dark sky. The air was cool and smelled of fresh water.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Nice up here?\u201d Alexander said, coming up to her. Tatiana couldn\u2019t move if she wanted to. She was between him and the railing.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said, peering into the night, afraid to look at him, afraid to let him see her heart. \u201cWhat do you do here all by yourself, night in and night out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Sit on the floor. Smoke. Think.\u201d</p><p>Alexander threaded his arms around her waist and closed his hands on her stomach, pressing her into him. She felt his lips at her neck whisper, \u201cOh, Tatia . . .\u201d</p><p>How instant it was, desire. It was like a bomb exploding, fragmenting and igniting all her nerve endings.</p><p>Not desire.</p><p>Burning desire for Alexander.</p><p>Tatiana tried to move aside, but he held her too tightly. All she wanted was to sink to the ground. Why was that? Why, every time he touched her, did she want to lie down? \u201cShura, wait,\u201d she said, not recognizing her own voice, which, thick with longing, said, Come here, come, come. Tatiana closed her eyes, muttering, \u201cI don\u2019t see any planes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they coming?\u201d She moaned softly.</p><p>\u201cYes. The placards are finally right. The enemy is at the gates.\u201d He continued to kiss her under the wisps of her hair.</p><p>\u201cDo you think there is any chance we could get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. You\u2019re trapped in the city.\u201d His hot breath and his moist lips on her neck were making her shiver.</p><p>\u201cHow will it be?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to talk to me . . .\u201d Tatiana said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cTalk?\u201d Alexander said, holding her stomach tight against him.</p><p>\u201cYes, talk . . . to me . . . about . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t remember what. \u201cDimitri?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her blouse away and kissed her shoulder blade. \u201cI like your blouse,\u201d he whispered, his mouth on her skin.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Shura, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, rubbing against her back. \u201cI can\u2019t stop.\u201d He breathed into her hair. \u201cAny more than I can stop breathing.\u201d</p><p>Alexander\u2019s hands moved to rest below her breasts. Her healing ribs hurt slightly and exquisitely from his touch, and Tatiana couldn\u2019t help herself, she moaned. Squeezing her tighter, he turned her around to him, his mouth on her throat and whispered, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t make a sound. Everything carries downstairs. You can\u2019t let them hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take your hands off me,\u201d Tatiana whispered back. \u201cOr cover my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cover your mouth, all right,\u201d he said, kissing her fervidly.</p><p>After three seconds Tatiana was ready to pass out. \u201cShura,\u201d she moaned, grasping on to him. \u201cGod, you need to stop. How do we stop?\u201d The pulling in her stomach was fierce.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d he repeated, his lips on her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean . . . I mean, this? How do we ever get relief from this? I can\u2019t go through my days like this, thinking of you. How do we get relief?\u201d</p><p>Alexander pulled back from her lips. \u201cThe only thing I want in my whole life,\u201d he whispered hotly, \u201cis to show you how we get relief, Tania.\u201d His hands held her to him in a vise.</p><p>Tatiana remembered Marina\u2019s words. You are just a conquest to a soldier. And despite herself, despite the unflappable certainty in the things she believed to be true, despite the shining moment with Alexander at the top of the sacred cathedral up in the Leningrad sky, Tatiana\u2019s worst got the better of her. Not trusting her own instincts, scared and doubting, she pushed Alexander away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana fought for her courage, struggled for the right words, afraid of asking, afraid of hearing his answer, afraid of making him angry or upset. He didn\u2019t deserve it, and in the end she trusted and believed in him so much that it made her like herself less to think that she would give the cynical Marina any credit for her ill-chosen words. Yet the words sat in her chest and churned in her anxious, aching stomach.</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t want to burden Alexander. She knew he was already carrying plenty. At the same time she could not continue to let him touch her. His hands were tenderly caressing her from her hips up to her hair and back down again. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Alexander whispered. \u201cTania, tell me, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cShura, can you\u2014\u201d She limped sideways from him. \u201cWait, just stop, all right?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t come after her, and she was a couple of meters away in the arcade when she sank to the floor and gathered her knees to her chest.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me about Dimitri,\u201d she said, feeling slightly deflated.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alexander said, continuing to stand. He folded his arms. \u201cNot until you tell me what\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shook her head. She just couldn\u2019t have this conversation with him. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d She smiled. Did she manage a good smile? Not according to his long face.</p><p>\u201cJust \u2014 It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Looking down at her long brown skirt, at her toes peeking out from the cast, Tatiana took a few deep breaths. \u201cShura, this is very, very difficult for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, crouching where he stood, his arms coming to rest on his knees.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this to you,\u201d she said without lifting her head.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth and speak to me,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cLike always.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t find her nerve. \u201cAlexander, there are too many more important things for us to resolve, to discuss\u2014\u201d Tatiana managed a quick glance at him. He was studying her with curiosity and concern. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m wasting our minutes like this\u2014\u201d She stopped. \u201cBut . . .\u201d He said nothing. \u201cAm I . . . ?\u201d It was so stupid. What did she know of these things? She sighed. \u201cListen, you know who helped me get out to see you tonight? My cousin Marina.\u201d</p><p>Alexander nodded, unsmiling. \u201cGood. What does she have to do with us? Am I ever going to meet this girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not want to after I tell you what she told me . . .\u201d Tatiana paused. \u201cAbout soldiers.\u201d She lifted her eyes. Alexander\u2019s suddenly comprehending and upset face was filled with annoyance, and guilt.</p><p>That was not what she wanted to see. \u201cShe told me some interesting things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t talking about you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was trying to warn me about Dimitri, but she said that to soldiers all girls were just a big conquest party and notches in their belt.\u201d Tatiana stopped talking. She thought it was very brave of her to get out even this much.</p><p>Slowly Alexander moved over to Tatiana. He didn\u2019t touch her; he just sat by her quietly and finally said, \u201cDo you have a question for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ask you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t answer it. I said I didn\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wished she could look into Alexander\u2019s face. She just didn\u2019t want to see the guilt there again. And she thought, what if, after our summer, after Kirov, after Luga, after all the unfathomable, breath-dissolving things that I have felt \u2014 what if after all that, I will right now find out that Marina was right about Alexander, too? Tatiana could not ask. Yet to have so much of what she felt be built on a lie . . . How could she not?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your question?\u201d Alexander repeated, so softly, so patiently, so everything of what he had been to her, that Tatiana, strengthened by him, as always, opened her mouth and in her smallest voice said, \u201cShura, is that what I am . . . just another conquest to you? Just more difficult? Am I, too, just another young, difficult notch in your belt?\u201d She lifted her uncertain, vulnerable eyes to him.</p><p>Alexander enveloped her in his arms whole, all gathered together like a tiny bandaged package. Kissing her head, he whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I am going to do with you.\u201d Pulling away slightly, he cupped her face. His eyes sparkled. \u201cTatiasha,\u201d he said beseechingly, \u201cwhat are you talking about? Have you forgotten the hospital? Conquest? Have you forgotten that if I wanted to, that night, or the following night, or any night that followed, I could have taken it from you standing?\u201d He stared at her and said, even more quietly, \u201cAnd you would have given it to me standing. Have you forgotten that it was I who put a stop to our senseless desperation?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shut her eyes.</p><p>Alexander held her face firmly in his hands. \u201cCome on, open your eyes and look at me. Look at me, Tania.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mortified and emotional eyes to find Alexander gazing at her with unremitting tenderness. \u201cTania, please. You\u2019re not my conquest, you\u2019re not a notch in my belt. I know how difficult it is, what you are feeling. I wish you wouldn\u2019t worry yourself for a second with things you know to be plainly not true.\u201d He kissed her passionately. \u201cDo you feel my lips?\u201d Alexander whispered. \u201cWhen I kiss you\u201d \u2014 he kissed her tenderly \u2014 \u201cdon\u2019t you feel my lips? What are they telling you? What are my hands telling you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana closed her eyes and moaned. Why did she feel so helpless near him, why? It occurred to her that not only was he right, not only would she have given it to him then, but she would give it to him now, on the cold hard floor of the gilded rotunda. When she opened her eyes, Alexander was looking at her and smiling lightly. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said softly, \u201cwhat you should be asking me is not, are you another notch in my belt, but why aren\u2019t you another notch in my belt?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s hands were trembling as she held his sleeves. \u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Alexander laughed.</p><p>Tatiana cleared her throat. \u201cDo you know what else Marina told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that Marina,\u201d said Alexander, sighing and moving away. \u201cWhat else did Marina tell you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana curled back into her knees. \u201cMarina told me,\u201d she said, \u201cthat all soldiers have it off with garrison hacks nonstop and never say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, my,\u201d said Alexander, shaking his head. \u201cThat Marina is trouble. It\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t get off the bus to go and see her that Sunday in June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d said Tatiana, her face melting at the memory of them on that bus.</p><p>And his face melted back.</p><p>What was she even thinking? What was she even doing? Tatiana shook her head, upset at herself.</p><p>\u201cNow, listen to me. I didn\u2019t want to tell you any of this, but . . .\u201d Alexander drew a deep breath. \u201cWhen I first got into the army, I saw that genuine relationships with women were going to be very difficult because of the nature of our confinement\u201d \u2014 he shrugged \u2014 \u201cand the realities of Soviet life. No rooms, no apartments, no hotels for the Soviet man and the Soviet woman to go to. You want the truth from me? Here it is. I don\u2019t want you to be afraid of it or afraid of me because of it. On our weekend furlough, it is true, we would go out for some beers and often find ourselves in the presence of all kinds of young women, who were quite willing to . . . knock around with soldiers without any strings attached.\u201d Alexander stopped.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you\u201d \u2014 Tatiana held her breath \u2014 \u201cknock around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce or twice,\u201d Alexander replied. He didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cDon\u2019t be upset by this, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset,\u201d Tatiana mouthed. Stunned, yes. Torn with self-doubt, yes. Entranced by you, yes again.</p><p>\u201cWe were all just having a bit of youthful fun. I kept myself extremely unattached and detached. I hated entanglements\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d Alexander said tiredly.</p><p>\u201cWas Dasha . . . ?\u201d Tatiana couldn\u2019t get the words out.</p><p>\u201cTatia, please,\u201d said Alexander, shaking his head. \u201cDon\u2019t think about these things. Ask Dasha what kind of a girl she was. I\u2019m not the one to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, but Dasha is an entanglement!\u201d Tatiana exclaimed. \u201cDasha does have strings attached to her. Dasha has her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has you.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana sighed heavily. This was too hard for her \u2014 talking about Alexander and her sister. Hearing about Alexander and meaningless girls was easier than hearing about one Dasha. Tatiana sat with her hands around her knees. She wanted to ask him about the present time but couldn\u2019t get the words out. She didn\u2019t want to ask him about anything. She wanted to go back to how it was before the night in the hospital, before the wretched confusion of her body blinded her to the truth she felt about him.</p><p>Alexander rubbed her thighs. \u201cI can feel you\u2019re afraid.\u201d Quietly, he added, \u201cTania, I beg you \u2014 don\u2019t let stupidity come between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said with remorse.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let bullshit that has nothing to do with us keep you away from me. We already have so much keeping you away from me.\u201d He paused. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it all fall away, Tatiana. What are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of being wrong about you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cTania, how could you of all people be wrong about me?\u201d Alexander clenched his fists in frustration. \u201cCan\u2019t you see,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s exactly because of who I had been that I came to you? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t see my loneliness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely,\u201d Tatiana replied, clutching her hands to her chest, \u201cthrough my own.\u201d Falling back against the railing, Tatiana said, \u201cShura, I\u2019m surrounded by half-truth and innuendo. You and I don\u2019t have a moment to talk anymore, like we used to, a moment to be alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA moment of privacy,\u201d said Alexander, speaking the last word in English.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d She didn\u2019t know that word. She would have to look it up when she got home. \u201cWhat about now? Besides Dasha, are you still\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d said Alexander, \u201call the things you\u2019re worried about \u2014 they\u2019re gone from my life. Do you know why? Because when I met you, I knew that if I continued and a good girl like you ever asked me about them, I wouldn\u2019t be able to look you in the face and tell you the truth. I would have to look you in the face and lie.\u201d He was looking into her face. The wordless truth was in his eyes.</p><p>Tatiana smiled at him and breathed out, the tight, sick feeling in her stomach dissolving with her exhaled breath. She wanted him to come and hug her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Alexander,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for my doubt. I\u2019m just too young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too much of everything,\u201d he said. \u201cGod!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cHow insane this is \u2014 never to have the time to explain, to talk anything out, never to have a minute\u2014\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve had a minute, Tatiana thought. We had our minutes on the bus. And at Kirov. We had our minutes in Luga. And in the Summer Garden. Breathless minutes, we had. What we want, she thought, keeping herself from welling up, is eternity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Shura,\u201d Tatiana said, grasping his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, if only we could have a moment of privacy,\u201d Alexander said, again speaking the last word in English, \u201cyou would never doubt me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this privacy?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Alexander smiled sadly. \u201cBeing secluded from the view or from the presence of other human beings. When we need to be alone together to have intimacy, that\u2019s impossible in two rooms with six other people,\u201d he explained in Russian. \u201cWe say, we want some privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tatiana blushed. So that was the word she had been searching for, ever since she met him! \u201cThere is no word for anything like that in Russian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd there is a word for this in America?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cPrivacy.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana remained silent.</p><p>Alexander slid closer, putting both his legs around her. \u201cTania, when will we next have a moment alone?\u201d he asked, peering into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re alone now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhen will I next be able to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>But Alexander didn\u2019t. He said grimly, \u201cDo you know that it might be never? The Germans are here. Do you know what that means? Life, as you knew it, is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this summer?\u201d she asked. \u201cNothing\u2019s been quite the same since June 22.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut before today we were simply arming ourselves. Now it\u2019s war. Leningrad will be the battleground for your freedom. And at the end, how many of us will be left standing? How many of us will be free?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. \u201cIs that why you come every chance you get, even if it means dragging Dimitri with you?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>With a small nod and a large sigh, Alexander said, \u201cI\u2019m always afraid it\u2019ll be the last time I\u2019m going to see your face.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana swallowed, curled into her knees. \u201cWhy . . . do you always drag him with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cCan\u2019t you ask him to leave me alone? He doesn\u2019t listen to me. What am I going to do with him?\u201d</p><p>Alexander made no reply, and Tatiana anxiously tried to catch his eye. \u201cTell me about Dimitri, Shura,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWhat do you owe him?\u201d</p><p>Alexander looked at his cigarettes.</p><p>Faintly Tatiana said, \u201cDo you owe him . . . me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cDimitri knows who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she uttered almost inaudibly.</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you, you won\u2019t believe it,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cOnce I tell you, there will be no going back for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no going back for us now,\u201d Tatiana said, and wanted to mouth a prayer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do about him,\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>\u201cI will help you,\u201d said Tatiana, her heart scared and swelling. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander moved away on the narrow balcony to sit diagonally across from her against the wall, stretching his legs out to her. Tatiana continued to sit against the railing. She sensed he didn\u2019t want her too close. Taking off her one shoe, Tatiana stretched her bare feet out to his boots. Her foot was half the size of his.</p><p>Shuddering as if trying to stave off a beast, Alexander began. \u201cWhen my mother was arrested,\u201d he said, not looking at Tatiana, \u201cthe NKVD came for me, too. I wasn\u2019t even able to say good-bye to her.\u201d Alexander looked away. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about my mother, as you can imagine. I was accused of distributing some capitalist propaganda when I had been fourteen, still in Moscow, and going to Communist Party meetings with my father. So at seventeen, in Leningrad, I was arrested and taken right to Kresty, the inner-city prison for nonpolitical criminals. They didn\u2019t have room for me at Shpalerka, the Big House, the political detention center. I was convicted in camera in about three hours,\u201d Alexander said with scorn. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even bother with an interrogation. I think all their interrogators were tied up with more important prisoners. I got ten years in Vladivostok. Can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cYou know how many of us finally got on that train headed for Vladivostok? A thousand. One man said to me, \u2018Oh, I just got out, and now this again.\u2019 He told me the prison camp we were going to had 80,000 people in it. Eighty thousand, Tania! One camp. I told him I didn\u2019t believe it. I had just turned seventeen.\u201d Alexander looked at her. \u201cLike you are now.\u201d He continued, \u201cWhat could I do? I couldn\u2019t spend ten years of my youth in prison, could I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI had always believed, you see, that I was meant to live a good life. My mother and father believed in me. I believed in myself\u2014\u201d He broke off. \u201cPrison never entered into it. I never stole, I never broke windows, I didn\u2019t terrorize old ladies. I did nothing wrong. I wasn\u2019t going. So,\u201d he said, \u201cwe were crossing the river Volga, near Kazan, thirty meters up over a precipice. I knew it was either now or I was going to Vladivostok for what seemed to me like the rest of my life. I had too much hope for myself. So I jumped right into the river.\u201d Alexander laughed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even stop the train. They thought for sure I had died in the fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t know who they were dealing with,\u201d said Tatiana, wanting to put her arms around him, but he was too far away. \u201cWhen you jumped, was that when you found out you indeed could swim?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>Alexander smiled back. The soles of his boots were touching the soles of her feet. \u201cI could swim a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have anything on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapers? Money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Tatiana thought Alexander wanted to tell her something else, but he continued. \u201cIt was the summer of 1936. After I escaped, I made my way south on the Volga, on fishing boats, by foot, in the back of horse carriages. I fished, worked briefly on farms, and moved on south. From Kazan to Ulyanovsk, where Lenin was born \u2014 interesting city, like a shrine. Then to Saratov, downstream on the Volga, fishing, harvesting, moving on. Wound up in Krasnodar, near the Black Sea. I was headed down south into Georgia, and then Turkey. I hoped to cross the border somewhere in the Caucasus Mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you had no money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut I made some along the way, and I did think that my English, once I got into Turkey, would help me. But in Krasnodar, fate intervened.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cAs always. It was a brutal winter, and the family I was staying with, the Belovs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Belovs?\u201d exclaimed Tatiana.</p><p>Alexander nodded. \u201cA nice farming family. Father, mother, four sons, one daughter.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cMe. We all got typhus. The entire village of Belyi Yar \u2014 360 people \u2014 got typhus. Eight-tenths of the village population perished, including the Belovs, the daughter first. The local council from Krasnodar, with the help of the police, came and burned down the village, for fear that the epidemic would spread to the nearby city. All my clothes were burned, and I was quarantined until I either died or got better. I got better. The local Soviet councilman came to issue me new papers. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation I said I was Alexander Belov. Since they burned the village in its entire\u2014\u201d Alexander raised his eyebrows. \u201cOnly in the Soviet Union. Anyway, since they burned the village, the councilman could not confirm or deny my claim to be Alexander Belov, the youngest Belov boy.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana closed her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo I was issued a brand-new domestic passport and a brand-new identity. I was Alexander Nikolaevich Belov, born in Krasnodar, orphaned at seventeen.\u201d He looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your full American name?\u201d asked Tatiana faintly.</p><p>\u201cAnthony Alexander Barrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnthony!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cAnthony was for my mother\u2019s father. I myself was never anything but Alexander.\u201d He pulled out a cigarette. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he said, \u201cI returned to Leningrad and went to stay with relatives of the Belovs. I needed to be back in Leningrad\u2014\u201d Alexander hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why in a minute. I stayed with my \u2018aunt,\u2019 Mira Belov, and her family. They lived on the Vyborg side. They hadn\u2019t seen their nephews in a decade; it was ideal. I was like a stranger to them.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBut they let me stay. I finished school. And it was in this school that I met Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alexander,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI cannot believe what you lived through when you were so young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m far from finished. Dimitri was one of the kids I played with at school. He was spindly, unpopular, and never much fun. When we played war at recess, he was always the one taken prisoner. Dimitri POW Chernenko we used to call him. We said that for him alone the Soviet Union should have signed the 1929 Geneva Convention, because he was getting himself wounded or taken prisoner or killed every time we played, managing to get himself caught somehow without help from anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then I found out that his father was a prison guard at Shpalerka.\u201d Alexander stopped.</p><p>Tatiana stopped breathing. \u201cYour parents were still alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cSo I chose to become close to Dimitri. I hoped that maybe he could help me see my mother and father. I knew that if they were alive, they would be tortured by their worries about me. I wanted to let them know I was all right.\u201d He paused. \u201cMy mother particularly,\u201d he said, his voice controlled. \u201cWe had been very close once.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cWhat about your father?\u201d</p><p>With a shrug, Alexander said, \u201cHe was my father. We had some conflict in the last years. What can I say? He thought he knew everything. I thought I knew everything. So it went.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana did not blink as she stared at Alexander, transfixed. \u201cShura, they must have loved you so much.\u201d She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander said, taking a deep, pained drag of the cigarette. \u201cThey did once love me.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s heart was breaking for Alexander.</p><p>\u201cLittle by little,\u201d he continued, \u201cI gained Dimitri\u2019s confidence, and we became better and better friends. Dima really liked the fact that I picked him out of many to be my closest friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Shura,\u201d said Tatiana. She understood. Crawling to him, Tatiana wrapped her arms around Alexander. \u201cYou had to trust Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>With one arm he hugged her back. The other held his cigarette. \u201cYes. I had to tell him who I was. I had no choice but to trust him. Leave my parents to die, or trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trusted Dimitri,\u201d Tatiana repeated incredulously, letting go of him and sitting close by his side.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Alexander looked down into his large hands, as if trying to find the answer to his life in them. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to trust him. My father, the good Communist that he was, taught me never to trust anyone, and though it wasn\u2019t easy, I learned that lesson well. But it\u2019s a hard way to live, and I wanted to trust just one person in my life. Just one. I really needed Dimitri\u2019s help. Besides, I was his friend. I said to myself that if he did this for me and I got to see my mother and father, I would be his friend for life. And that\u2019s exactly what I told him. \u2018Dima,\u2019 I said, \u2018I will be your friend for life. I will help you in any way that I can.\u2019 \u201d Alexander lit another cigarette. Tatiana waited, the aching in her chest increasing.</p><p>\u201cDimitri\u2019s father found out that I was too late to see my mother.\u201d Alexander\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cHe told me what had happened to her. But my father was still alive, though apparently not for long. He\u2019d already been in prison for nearly a year. Chernenko got Dimitri and me inside Shpalerka, and then we had five minutes with the foreign infiltrator, Harold Barrington. Me, my father, Dimitri, his father, and another guard. No privacy for me and my father.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana took Alexander\u2019s hand. \u201cHow was that?\u201d</p><p>Alexander stared straight ahead. \u201cPretty much how you imagine it might be,\u201d he said, keeping his voice even. \u201cAnd bitterly brief.\u201d</p><p>In the small gray concrete cell, Alexander looked at his father, and Harold Barrington looked at Alexander. Harold did not move from his bed.</p><p>Dimitri stood in the center of the small cell, Alexander to the side. The guard and Dimitri\u2019s father were behind them. A single lightbulb hung from the ceiling.</p><p>In Russian, Dimitri said to Harold, \u201cWe are here for only a minute, comrade. You understand? Just for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d replied Harold in Russian, blinking back tears. \u201cThank you for coming to see me. I\u2019m happy to see two Soviet boys. Your name, son?\u201d he asked Dimitri.</p><p>\u201cDimitri Chernenko.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your name, son?\u201d His body shaking, Harold looked at Alexander.</p><p>\u201cAlexander Belov,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Harold nodded.</p><p>The guard said, \u201cAll right, enough gawking at the prisoner. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri said, \u201cWait! We just wanted the comrade to know that despite his crime against our proletarian society, he will not be forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing, his eyes on his father.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of his crime against our society that he will not be forgotten,\u201d said the guard.</p><p>Chewing his lips, Harold looked at Dimitri and Alexander, whose back was to the guard but whose face was to his father.</p><p>\u201cPopov, can I shake their hands?\u201d Harold asked the guard.</p><p>The guard shrugged, stepping forward. \u201cI\u2019m going to watch you do it. Make it quick.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard English before, Comrade Barrington. Can you say something for us in English?\u201d</p><p>Harold came up to Dimitri and shook his hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said in English.</p><p>Then he came up to Alexander and took his hand, holding it tightly between his. Alexander shook his head slightly, trying to will his father to stay calm.</p><p>In English, Harold whispered, \u201cWould that I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d</p><p>Alexander mouthed, Stop.</p><p>Letting go of Alexander\u2019s hand, Harold stepped slightly away, struggling not to cry and failing. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something in English,\u201d he said in Russian. \u201cA few corrupted lines from Kipling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d said the guard. \u201cI have no time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can bear to hear the truth you\u2019ve spoken,\u201d Harold said loudly in English, \u201ctwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools . . .\u201d Tears rolled down his face. \u201cOr watch the things you gave your life to, broken . . .\u201d He was down to a whisper. \u201cSon! \u2014 stoop and build them up with worn-out tools.\u201d Harold stepped back and made a small sign of the cross on Alexander.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d yelled the guard.</p><p>Alexander mouthed to his father, in English, \u201cI love you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Then they left.</p><p>Tatiana was crying. Alexander put his arm around her, and said, \u201cOh, Tania . . .\u201d He wiped her face. \u201cFrom the effort to remain composed,\u201d he told her, \u201cI cracked one of my side teeth. See?\u201d He showed her an upper bicuspid. \u201cNow you can stop asking me about it. So I did get to see my father once before he died, and I never would have been able to do it without Dimitri.\u201d With a heavy breath, he took his arm away.</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d said Tatiana, crouching beside him, \u201cyou did an unbelievable thing for your father.\u201d Her lips trembled. \u201cYou gave him comfort before his death.\u201d Feeling very shy, yet overwhelmed by her emotion, her throbbing heart overfilled with him, she took hold of Alexander\u2019s hand, bent her head to it, and kissed it. Blushing and clearing her throat, she let go of him and raised her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d he said with feeling, \u201cwho are you?\u201d</p><p>She replied, \u201cI am Tatiana.\u201d And gave him her hand. They sat silently.</p><p>\u201cThere is more.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe rest I know.\u201d Tatiana took Alexander\u2019s pack of cigarettes and pulled one out. She had needed just a little truth to see the whole. She knew the rest at the point Alexander told her that he gave Dimitri something Dimitri had never had before. It wasn\u2019t friendship, and it wasn\u2019t companionship, and it wasn\u2019t brotherhood. Tatiana\u2019s hands were shaking as she put the cigarette into Alexander\u2019s mouth, and reached for his lighter. Flicking it on, she brought it to his face, and when he inhaled, she kissed his cheek and extinguished the light.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Alexander said, smoking down half the cigarette before he continued. He kissed her. \u201cYou\u2019re not crazy about smoker\u2019s breath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your breath any way you give it to me, Shura,\u201d said Tatiana, blushing again. Then she spoke. \u201cLet me tell you the rest. You and Dimitri enrolled in university. You and Dimitri joined the army. You and Dimitri went to officers\u2019 school together. And then Dimitri didn\u2019t make it.\u201d She lowered her head. \u201cAt first he was all right with it. You remained best friends. He knew you would do anything for him.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd then,\u201d Tatiana said, raising her eyes, \u201che started asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cSo you do know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he ask you for, Shura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou name it.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t look at each other.</p><p>\u201cHe asks you to transfer him here, to make exceptions for him there, he asks you for special privileges and for special treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Alexander was mute for a few minutes. It was such a long time that Tatiana thought he had forgotten her question. She waited patiently. Finally Alexander said, his voice filled with something, \u201cVery occasionally, girls. You\u2019d think there was plenty for everyone, but every once in a while I would be with a girl Dimitri wanted to be with. He\u2019d ask me, and I\u2019d back off. I just went and found myself a new girl, and things went on as before.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stared ahead, her eyes the clearest sea green. \u201cAlexander, tell me something. When Dimitri asked you for a girl, he only asked for one you actually liked, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want just any of your girls. He asked you for girls that he saw you liked. That\u2019s when he asked. Right?\u201d</p><p>Alexander was pensive. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Tatiana said, \u201cSo when he asked you for me, you just backed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. What I did was show him my indifferent face, hoping that if he thought you didn\u2019t matter to me, he would leave you alone. Unfortunately, that has backfired.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana nodded, then shook her head, then started to cry. \u201cYes, you\u2019re not doing such a good job with your face, Shura. He won\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Alexander brought her into his arms. \u201cI told you this was a dire mess. I can back off you now as far as Japan for all he cares. Because now Dimitri has fallen for you and wants you for himself.\u201d He stopped.</p><p>Tatiana studied Alexander for a few moments and then pressed herself into him. \u201cShura,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something right now, all right? Are you listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath like that.\u201d She managed a smile. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m about to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m ill equipped to guess at the moment. Maybe you have a small child living with a distant aunt?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana laughed lightly. \u201cNo.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cDimitri has not fallen for me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander pulled away from her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. Not at all. Not even remotely. Believe me when I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does he want with you then? Don\u2019t even suggest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with me. All Dimitri wants \u2014 listen carefully \u2014 all he craves, all he desires, all he covets is power. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s important to him. That\u2019s the love of his life. Power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower over you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Alexander! Power over you. I\u2019m just a means to an end. I\u2019m just ammunition.\u201d</p><p>When he looked at her skeptically, she continued. \u201cDimitri doesn\u2019t have any. You have it all. All he has is what he has over you. That\u2019s his whole life.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHow sad for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad for him!\u201d Alexander exclaimed. \u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t speak for a moment. \u201cShura, look at you. And look at him. Dimitri needs you, he is fed and sheltered and grown by you, and if you\u2019re stronger, he becomes stronger, too. He knows that and depends on you blindly for so many things that you are glad to provide. And yet . . . the more you have, the more he hates you. Self-preservation may be his driving force, but all the same, every time you get a promotion, you go up in rank, you get a new medal, you get a new girl, every time you laugh with joy in the smoky corridor, it diminishes and lessens him. Which is why the more powerful you become, the more he wants from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d said Alexander, glancing at Tatiana, \u201che is going to want from me something I can\u2019t give. And then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoveting from you the best of what you have will eventually lead him into hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but me into death.\u201d Alexander shook his head. \u201cUnspoken underneath all his pleas and requests is that one word from him about my American past to the NKVD general at the garrison, one vague accusation, and I instantly vanish into the maw of Soviet justice.\u201d</p><p>Nodding sadly, Tatiana said, \u201cI know it. But maybe if he had more, he wouldn\u2019t want so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Tania. I have a bad feeling about Dimitri. I have a feeling he is going to want more and more from me. Until,\u201d Alexander said, \u201che takes it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong, Shura. Dimitri will never take all away from you. He will never have that much power.\u201d He might want to. He just doesn\u2019t know who he is dealing with, Tatiana thought, raising her venerating eyes to Alexander. \u201cBesides, we all know what happens to the parasite when something happens to the host,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Alexander gazed down at her. \u201cYes. He finds himself a new host. Let me ask you,\u201d he finally said, \u201cwhat do you think Dimitri wants the most from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you want most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Tania,\u201d said Alexander intensely, \u201cit\u2019s you that I want most.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana looked into his face. \u201cYes, Shura,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he knows it. As I said from the beginning \u2014 Dimitri has not fallen for me at all. All he wants is to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was quiet for a spate of eternity under the August sky.</p><p>So was Tatiana until she whispered, \u201cWhere is your brave and indifferent face? Put it on and he will back away and ask you to give him what you wanted most before me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander did not move and did not speak.</p><p>\u201cBefore me.\u201d Why was he so silent? \u201cShura?\u201d She thought she felt him shudder.</p><p>\u201cTania, stop. I can\u2019t talk to you about this anymore.\u201d</p><p>She could not steady her hands. \u201cAll of this \u2014 all this between us, and my Dasha, too, now and forever, and still you come for me every chance you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I cannot stay away from you,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Flinching with sadness, Tatiana said, \u201cGod, we need to forget each other, Shura. I can\u2019t believe how not meant to be we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d Alexander smiled. \u201cI will bet my rifle that your ending up on that bench two months ago was the most unlikely part of your day.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Most of all, Tatiana remembered the bus she had decided not to take so she could buy herself an ice cream. \u201cAnd you would know this how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cmy walking by that bench was the most unlikely part of mine.\u201d He nodded. \u201cAll this wedged between us \u2014 and when we do our best, and grit our teeth, and move away from one another, struggling to reconstruct ourselves, fate intervenes again, and bricks fall from the sky that I remove from your alive and broken body. Was that also not meant to be, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana inhaled a sob. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget that I owe you my life.\u201d She gazed at him. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget that I belong to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that,\u201d Alexander said, hugging her tighter.</p><p>\u201cRetreat, Shura,\u201d Tatiana whispered. \u201cRetreat and take your weapons with you. Spare me from him.\u201d She paused. \u201cHe just needs to believe you don\u2019t care for me, and then he will lose all interest. You\u2019ll see. He\u2019ll go away, he\u2019ll go to the front. We all have to get through the war before we get to what\u2019s on the other side. So will you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stop coming around?\u201d she asked tremulously.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI can\u2019t retreat that far. Just stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Her heart skipped. She clutched him.</p><p>\u201cAnd forgive me in advance for my cold face. Can I trust you to do that?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Tatiana rubbed her cheek against his arm, pressing her head to him. \u201cTrust me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTrust in me. Alexander Barrington, I will never betray you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but will you ever deny me?\u201d he asked tenderly.</p><p>\u201cOnly in front of my Dasha,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd your Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her face to him, with an ironic smile Alexander said, \u201cAren\u2019t you glad now that God stopped us at the hospital?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana smiled lightly back. \u201cNo.\u201d She sat wrapped in his arms. They stared at each other. She put her palm out to him. He put his palm against hers. \u201cLook,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cMy fingertips barely come up to your second knuckle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking,\u201d he whispered, threading his fingers through hers and squeezing her hand so hard that Tatiana groaned and then blushed.</p><p>Bringing his face to hers, Alexander kissed the skin near her nose. \u201cHave I ever told you I adore your freckles?\u201d he murmured. \u201cThey are very enticing.\u201d</p><p>She purred back. Their fingers remained entwined as they kissed.</p><p>\u201cTatiasha . . .\u201d Alexander whispered, \u201cyou have amazing lips . . .\u201d He paused and pulled away. \u201cYou are\u201d \u2014 reluctantly she opened her eyes to meet his gaze \u2014 \u201cyou are oblivious to yourself. It\u2019s one of your most endearing, most infuriating qualities . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what you mean . . .\u201d She had no brain left. \u201cShura, how can there be not a single place in this world we can go?\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cWhat kind of a life is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Communist life,\u201d Alexander replied.</p><p>They huddled closer.</p><p>\u201cYou crazy man,\u201d she said fondly. \u201cWhat were you doing fighting with me at Kirov, knowing all this was stacked against us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaging against my fate,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cIt\u2019s the only f*cking thing I ever do. I just refuse to be defeated.\u201d</p><p>I love you, Alexander, Tatiana wanted to say to him, but couldn\u2019t. I love you. She bowed her head. \u201cI have too young a heart . . .\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s arms engulfed her. \u201cTatia,\u201d he whispered, \u201cyou do have a young heart.\u201d He tipped her back a little and kissed her between her breasts. \u201cI wish with all of mine, I wasn\u2019t forced to pass it by.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he moved away and jumped to his feet. Tatiana herself heard a noise behind them in the arcade. Sergeant Petrenko stuck his head out onto the balcony, saying it was time for a shift change.</p><p>Alexander carried Tatiana down on his back, and then, with his arm around her, they hobbled through the city streets, back to Fifth Soviet. It was after two in the morning. Tomorrow their day would begin at six, and yet here they both were, clinging to each other in the last remaining hours of night. He carried her in his arms down Nevsky Prospekt. She carried his rifle. He carried her on his back.</p><p>They were very alone as they made their way through dark Leningrad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>7</p><p>The next evening after work Tatiana found her mother moaning in the room and Dasha sitting in the hallway, crying into her cup of tea. The Metanovs had just received a telegram from the long-defunct Novgorod command, informing them that on 13 July 1941 the train carrying one Pavel Metanov and hundreds of other young volunteers was blown up by the Germans. There were no survivors.</p><p>A week before I went to find him, thought Tatiana, pacing dully through the rooms. What did I do on the day that my brother\u2019s train blew up? Did I work, did I ride the tram? Did I even think once of my brother? I\u2019ve thought of him since. I\u2019ve felt him not being here since. Dear Pasha, she thought, we lost you and we didn\u2019t even know it. That\u2019s the saddest loss of all, to go on for a few weeks, a few days, a night, a minute, and think everything is still all right when the structure you\u2019ve built your life on has crumbled. We should have been mourning you, but instead we made plans, went to work, dreamed, loved, not knowing you were already behind us.</p><p>How could we not have known?</p> <p>Wasn\u2019t there a sign? Your reluctance to go? The packed suitcase? The not hearing from you?</p><p>Something we could point to so that next time we can say, wait, here is the sign. Next time we will know. And we will mourn right from the start.</p><p>Could we have kept you with us longer? Could we have all hung on to you, held you closer, played in the park once more with you to stave off the unforgiving fate for a few more days, a few more Sundays, a few more afternoons? Would that have been worth it, to have you for one more month before you were claimed, before you were lost to us? Knowing your inevitable future, would it have been worth it to see your face for another day, another hour, another minute before you were blink and gone?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Yes, it would have been worth it. For you. And for us.</p> <p>Papa was drunk, spread out on the couch, and Mama was wiping the couch, crying into the bucket of water. Tatiana offered to clean up. Mama pushed her away. Dasha was in the kitchen, crying while she was cooking dinner. Tatiana was filled with an acute sense of finality, a sharp anxiety for the days ahead. Anything could happen in a future forged by the incomprehensible present in which her twin brother was no longer alive.</p><p>As they prepared dinner, Tatiana said to Dasha, \u201cDash, a month ago you asked me if I thought Pasha was still alive, and I said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I pay any attention to you, Tania,\u201d snapped Dasha.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ask me?\u201d questioned a surprised Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to give me some comforting pat answer. Listen, I don\u2019t want to talk about it. You might not be shocked, but we all are.\u201d</p><p>When he came for dinner, Alexander raised his questioning eyebrows to Tatiana, who told him about the telegram.</p> <p>No one ate the cabbage with a little canned ham that Dasha had made, except Alexander and Tatiana, who, despite a small hope, had been living with a lost Pasha since Luga.</p><p>Papa remained on the couch, and Mama sat by his side listening to the tick-tock, tick-tock of the radio\u2019s metronome.</p><p>Dasha went to put the samovar on, and Alexander and Tatiana were left alone. He didn\u2019t say anything, just bent his head slightly and peered into her face. For a moment they held each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cCourage, Alexander,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cCourage, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>She left and went out onto the roof, looking for bombs in the chilly Leningrad night. Summer was over. Winter wasn\u2019t far off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Part Two</p><p>WINTER\u2019S FIERCE EMBRACE</p><p>BESET AND BESIEGED</p><p>WHAT did it cost the soul to lie? At every step, with every breath, with every Soviet Information Bureau report, with every casualty list and every monthly ration card?</p> <p>From the moment Tatiana woke up until she fell into a bleary sleep, she lied.</p><p>She wished Alexander would stop coming around. Lies.</p><p>She wished he would end it with Dasha. Alas. More lies.</p><p>No more trips to St. Isaac\u2019s. That was good news. Lies.</p><p>No more tram rides, no more canals, no more Summer Garden, no more Luga, no more lips or eyes or palpitating breath. Good. Good. Good. More lies.</p> <p>He was cold. He had an uncanny ability to act as if there were nothing behind his smiling face, or his steady hands, or his burned-down cigarette. Not a twitch showed on his face for Tatiana. That was good. Lies.</p><p>Curfew was imposed on Leningrad at the beginning of September. Rations were reduced again. Alexander stopped coming every day. That was good. More lies.</p><p>When Alexander came, he was extremely affectionate with Dasha, in front of Tatiana and in front of Dimitri. That was good. Lies.</p><p>Tatiana put on her own brave face and turned it away and smiled at Dimitri and clenched her heart in a tight fist. She could do it, too. More lies.</p><p>Pouring tea. Such a simple matter, yet fraught with deceit. Pouring tea, for someone else before him. Her hands trembled with the effort.</p><p>Tatiana wished she could get out from the spell that was Leningrad at the beginning of September, get out from the circle of misery and love that besieged her.</p> <p>She loved Alexander. Ah, finally. Something true to hold on to.</p><p>After news of Pasha, Papa worked sporadically, being frequently too intoxicated. His being home made it difficult for Tatiana to cook, to clean, to be in the rooms, to read. More lies. That\u2019s not what made it difficult. It\u2019s what made it unpleasant. Sitting on the roof was the only peace left to Tatiana, and even then peace was relative. There was no peace inside her.</p><p>While she was on the roof, she closed her eyes and imagined walking, without a cast, without a limp, with Alexander. They walked down Nevsky, to Palace Square, down the embankment, all around the Field of Mars. They meandered across the Fontanka Bridge, through the Summer Garden, and back out onto the embankment, and then to Smolny and then past Tauride Park, to Ulitsa Saltykov-Schedrin, past their bench, and on to Suvorovsky, and home. And as she walked with him, it felt as if she were walking into the rest of her life.</p><p>In her mind they had walked along the streets of their summer while she sat on the roof and heard the echo of gunfire and explosions. It was a small solace to think the gunfire wasn\u2019t as close as it had been at Luga. Alexander wasn\u2019t as close as he had been at Luga either.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s own visits became as truncated as Tatiana\u2019s rations. He was rationing himself the way the Leningrad Council was rationing food. Tatiana missed him, wishing for a second, a moment alone with him again, just to remind herself that the summer of 1941 had not been an illusion, that there had indeed been a time when she had walked along a canal wall, holding his rifle, while he was looking at her and laughing.</p><p>There was little laughing nowadays.</p><p>\u201cThe Germans aren\u2019t here yet, right, Alexander?\u201d asked Dasha over tea \u2014 the damned tea. \u201cWhen they come, will we repel von Leeb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander replied. Tatiana knew. More lies.</p> <p>Tatiana would grimly watch Dasha nuzzling Alexander. She would avert her eyes and say to Dimitri, \u201cHey, want to hear a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Tania? No, not really. Sorry, I\u2019m a little preoccupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d she would say, watching Alexander smile at Dasha. Lies, lies, and lies.</p><p>All that Alexander was doing wasn\u2019t enough. Dimitri wasn\u2019t leaving Tatiana alone.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tatiana hadn\u2019t heard from Marina about coming to live with them, and in the hospital Vera, along with the other nurses, was anxious about the war. Tatiana felt it herself \u2014 war was no longer something on the Luga River, something that had swallowed Pasha, something that was fought by the Ukrainians far away in their smoldering villages or by the British in their distant and proper London. It was coming here.</p><p>Well, something better come here, Tatiana thought, because I can\u2019t imagine continuing this way.</p><p>The city seemed to hold its collective breath. Tatiana certainly held hers.</p><p>For four nights in a row Tatiana cooked fried cabbage for dinner, with less and less oil each day.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you cooking for us, Tania?\u201d asked Mama.</p><p>\u201cYou call this cooking?\u201d Papa remarked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even dip my bread in the oil. Where is the oil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t find any,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>The radio offered only the most depressing news. Tatiana thought the announcers must deliberately wait until Soviet performance at the front was particularly awful and then begin broadcasting. After Mga fell at the end of August, Tatiana had heard that Dubrovka was under attack \u2014 her mother\u2019s mother, Babushka Maya, lived in Dubrovka, a rural town just across the river, right outside city limits.</p><p>And then Dubrovka fell on September 6.</p><p>Suddenly Tatiana got unexpectedly good news, and good news was becoming as hard to come by as oil. Babushka Maya was coming to live with them on Fifth Soviet! Sadly, Mikhail, Mama\u2019s stepfather, had died of TB a few days earlier, and when the Germans burned Dubrovka, Babushka Maya escaped to the city.</p><p>When Babushka came, she took one room, and Mama and Papa moved back in with Dasha and Tatiana. No more please, Tania, go away.</p><p>Babushka Maya had lived all her long life in Leningrad and said that it had never even occurred to her to evacuate. \u201cMy life, my death, all right here,\u201d she told Tatiana as she unpacked.</p><p>She had married her first husband back at the turn of the century and had Tatiana\u2019s mother. After her husband disappeared in the war of 1905, she never remarried, though she lived with poor tubercular Uncle Mikhail for thirty years. Tatiana had once asked Babushka why she never married Uncle Mikhail, and Babushka had replied, \u201cWhat if my Fedor comes back, Tanechka? I\u2019d be in quite a pickle then.\u201d Babushka painted and studied art; her paintings had hung in galleries before the revolution, but after 1917 she made her living by illustrating propaganda materials for the Bolsheviks. Everywhere in her house in Dubrovka, Tatiana would find sketchbooks filled with pictures of chairs and food and flowers.</p><p>After she arrived, Babushka told Tatiana that she didn\u2019t have time to get anything out of her house before it burned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tanechka. I\u2019ll draw you a nice new picture of a chair.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cMaybe you can draw me a nice apple pie instead? It\u2019s the season for them.\u201d</p><p>The following evening, on September 7, Marina finally arrived \u2014 just before dinner. Marina\u2019s father had died in the fighting around Izhorsk, died as an untrained assistant gunner in a tank he had made himself. Uncle Boris was beloved by the Metanovs, and his death would have been a terrible blow, had the family not been reeling from their own nightmare of losing Pasha.</p><p>Marina\u2019s mother remained hospitalized; unrelated to the war, she was slowly dying of renal failure. Tatiana\u2019s na?vet\u00e9 surprised even herself. How could anything that happened nowadays be unrelated to the war? First Uncle Misha, now Aunt Rita. There was something universally unfair about that \u2014 for people to be dying of causes unrelated to the trenches Alexander had been digging.</p><p>Papa looked at Marina\u2019s suitcase. Mama looked at Marina\u2019s suitcase. Dasha looked at Marina\u2019s suitcase. Tatiana said, \u201cMarinka, let me help you unpack.\u201d</p><p>Papa asked if she was staying for a while, and Tatiana said, \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa, her father is dead and your sister is dying. She can stay with us for a while, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Marina said, \u201chave you not told Uncle Georg that you invited me? Don\u2019t worry, I brought my ration card, Uncle Georg.\u201d</p><p>Papa glared at Tatiana. Mama glared at Tatiana. Dasha glared at Tatiana.</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cLet\u2019s unpack you, Marina.\u201d</p><p>That night there was a small problem with dinner. The girls had left the food on the stove for a moment, and when they came back to the kitchen, they found that the fried potatoes, onions, and one small fresh tomato had disappeared. The frying pan had been left empty and dirty. A few of the potatoes had stuck to the bottom, and there they remained, encrusted and covered with a bit of oil. Dasha and Tatiana looked around the kitchen incredulously and vacuously, even coming back inside, thinking maybe they had already brought the dinner in and simply forgotten.</p><p>The potatoes were gone.</p><p>Dasha, because that was her way, dragged Tatiana with her, knocking on every door of the apartment, asking about the potatoes. Zhanna Sarkova opened the door, looking unkempt and haggard, almost as if she were related to crazy Slavin.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d barked Zhanna. \u201cPotatoes \u2014 my husband\u2019s disappeared! You haven\u2019t seen him in Grechesky, have you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe he was wounded somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWounded where?\u201d Tatiana gently wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? And no, I haven\u2019t seen your stupid potatoes.\u201d She slammed the door.</p><p>Slavin was lying on the floor, muttering. His small room reeked of everything but fried potatoes.</p><p>\u201cHow is he going to feed himself?\u201d asked Tatiana as they walked by.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not our problem,\u201d said Dasha.</p><p>The Iglenkos were not even home. After the loss of Volodya alongside Pasha, Petr Iglenko spent all his days and nights at the factory that melted down old scrap metal for ammunition. They had just got more bad news. Petka, their eldest son, had been killed in Pulkovo. Only their two youngest, Anton and Kirill, remained.</p><p>\u201cPoor Nina,\u201d said Tatiana as they headed back down the corridor to their rooms.</p><p>\u201cPoor Nina!\u201d exclaimed Dasha. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about, Tania? She still has two sons. Lucky Nina.\u201d</p><p>When they returned to the door that led to their own hallway, Dasha said, \u201cThey\u2019re all lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all telling the truth,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cFried potatoes with onions are not easy to hide.\u201d</p><p>The Metanovs ate bread with butter for dinner that night and complained the whole time. Papa yelled at the girls for losing his dinner. Tatiana kept quiet, heeding Alexander\u2019s warning that she should be careful around people who were likely to hit her.</p><p>But after dinner the family wasn\u2019t taking any more chances. Mama and Babushka brought the canned goods, the cereals and the grains, soap and salt and vodka into the rooms, stacking it all in the corners and in the hallway behind the sofa. Mama said, \u201cHow fortunate we are that we have the extra door partitioning our corridor from the rest of the scavengers. We\u2019d never keep our food otherwise, I see that now.\u201d</p><p>Later that night, when Alexander came by and heard about the potatoes, he told the Metanovs to keep the rear entrance to the kitchen locked.</p><p>Dasha introduced Alexander to Marina. They shook hands and both stared at each other for longer than was appropriate. Marina, embarrassed, stepped away, averting her gaze. Alexander smiled, putting his arm around Dasha. \u201cDasha,\u201d he said, \u201cso this is your cousin Marina.\u201d Tatiana wanted to shake her head at him, while a perplexed Marina remained speechless.</p><p>Later on in the kitchen, Marina said to Tatiana, \u201cTania, why did Dasha\u2019s Alexander look at me as if he knew me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d said Dasha, who was heading past the girls to the bathroom, leaving Alexander in the corridor. \u201cWell, keep your hands off him,\u201d she added cheerfully. \u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d Marina whispered to Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cHelp me wash this frying pan, will you?\u201d</p><p>Adorable Alexander stood in the doorway, smoking and grinning at Tatiana.</p><p>Papa continued to grumble about Marina\u2019s arrival. Her student rations would bring little to the family, and another mouth to feed would only drain their resources further. \u201cShe just came here to eat my father\u2019s cans of ham,\u201d he said to Mama, gazing at the cans. Tatiana couldn\u2019t tell if Papa wanted to eat the cans or to kiss them. \u201cShe is your niece, Papa,\u201d Tatiana whispered, so Marina wouldn\u2019t overhear. \u201cShe is your only sister\u2019s only daughter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>The following day, on September 8, there was unrest in the city from early morning. The radio said, \u201cAir raid, air raid!\u201d</p><p>At work, Vera grabbed Tatiana\u2019s hand and exclaimed, \u201cDo you hear that noise?\u201d</p><p>They walked out the front entrance of the hospital on Ligovsky Prospekt, and Tatiana heard distant heavy thundering that didn\u2019t get closer, just increased in frequency. Calmly, Tatiana said to Vera, \u201cVerochka, it\u2019s just the mortars. They make that sound when they release the bombs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBombs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They set this machine in the ground \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly how it works \u2014 but it fires big bombs, little bombs, explosive bombs, short-fuse, long-fuse. Fragmentation bombs are the worst,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cBut also they have these little antipersonnel bombs. They fire them a hundred at a time. They\u2019re lethal.\u201d</p><p>Vera stared at Tatiana, who shrugged. \u201cLuga. Wish I hadn\u2019t gone. But . . . Listen, can you saw my leg off?\u201d</p><p>They went inside. Vera said, \u201cHow about if I just remove the cast? I think taking the leg off is a bit drastic.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time Tatiana had seen her leg in over six weeks. She wished she had more time to contemplate her peculiar, wilted limb without the cast, but as she was wobbling around, she heard a commotion down the hall at the nurses\u2019 station. All the nurses ran upstairs. Tatiana followed them limply. Her leg hurt when she put weight on it.</p> <p>On the roof she watched two formations of eight planes each fly above her. Half a city away there was an explosion, followed by fire and black smoke. She thought, it\u2019s really happening. The Germans are bombing Leningrad. I thought I had left it all behind in Luga. I thought what I had seen there was the worst I was ever going to see. At least I was able to leave Luga and come back to peace. Where can I go now?</p><p>Tatiana smelled acrid acidity and thought, what is that? \u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d she said to Vera. \u201cTo my family.\u201d But all she could think about was that smell.</p><p>By afternoon they knew. The Badayev storage warehouses supplying Leningrad with food had been bombed by the Germans and now lay in flaming ruins. The acrid smell was burning sugar.</p><p>\u201cPapa,\u201d asked Tatiana while they were sitting solemnly at the dining table, \u201cwhat\u2019s going to happen to Leningrad?\u201d</p><p>Papa had no answers. \u201cWhat happened to Pasha, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>Mama started to cry. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019ll scare the children.\u201d</p> <p>Dasha, Tatiana, and Marina looked at each other.</p><p>The bombing continued through late afternoon.</p><p>Anton came for Tatiana, and they both went out onto the roof. However odd it was to be walking without a cast, there was nothing odder than the sight of black smoky fragments in the sky over Leningrad.</p><p>Alexander was right, she thought, He has been right about everything. Everything that he told me would happen has come to pass. Her heart swelling with respect and affection, she made a mental note to listen to every word he uttered from now on, but then a tic of fear ran through her.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t Alexander told her there would be a battle to the death on the city streets?</p><p>Dimitri with his gun, Alexander with his grenade, and Tatiana with her rock.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t Alexander told her to buy food as if she were never going to see it again? Maybe he was exaggerating for effect, she thought, feeling only slightly relieved. Didn\u2019t he rail at her to get out of the city when he used to come to pick her up at Kirov? As the black smoke hung like a memorial canopy over Leningrad, Tatiana got a feeling of foreboding, a slight, aching darkness as she thought of her family\u2019s future.</p><p>Anton stood looking at the sky with expectant eyes. \u201cTania!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cEarlier I did it. One fell, an incendiary, and I put it out with this!\u201d He pointed to the stick in his hand, the bottom end of which was attached to a concrete half-circle that looked like a soldier\u2019s helmet.</p> <p>Jumping up and down and waving his fist to the sky, Anton squealed, \u201cI\u2019m ready for you, come on, come again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnton,\u201d said Tatiana, laughing, \u201cyou\u2019re as crazy as Slavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, much crazier,\u201d said Anton happily. \u201cHe\u2019s not on the roof, is he?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana could see fires in the direction of Nevsky, in the direction of the river.</p><p>Suddenly Mama stuck her head out the stairwell door, not daring to venture onto the roof herself, and yelled, \u201cTatiana Georgievna! Are you crazy? Come down this instant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Mama, I\u2019m on duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, come! Come this instant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come in about an hour, Mamochka. Go on, go downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Mama muttered angrily and left, but in ten minutes she returned, this time with Alexander and Dimitri.</p><p>Tatiana, standing high on the roof, shook her head. \u201cWhat are you doing, Mama, bringing reinforcements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d Alexander said, striding out to her, \u201ccome downstairs with us.\u201d Dimitri remained near the landing with Mama.</p><p>When Tatiana didn\u2019t move, Alexander said, raising his eyebrows, \u201cImmediately, Tania.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t leave Anton here by himself, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Tania!\u201d Anton yelled, waving his stick at the sky. \u201cI\u2019m ready for them.\u201d</p><p>As he was leaving, Alexander turned to Anton and remarked, \u201cPut the helmet on your head, soldier.\u201d</p><p>Downstairs in the room, Dimitri said, \u201cTania, dear, you really shouldn\u2019t go on the roof during an air raid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s not much point going on the roof at other times,\u201d she retorted mildly. \u201cUnless I wanted to get a suntan.\u201d She moved away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou live in the wrong city for a suntan,\u201d snapped Alexander. \u201cBut honestly, Tania, what are you thinking? Dimitri is right. Your mother is right. Do you want to leave your family without two of their three children? All bombs are not incendiaries; they don\u2019t land harmlessly at your feet like felled pigeons. Have you forgotten Luga? What do you think happens when a bomb explodes in midair? The explosive wave blows apart glass, wood, plastic. Why did we tape all the windows in the city? What do you think would happen to you if that wave hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Tatiana said dryly, \u201cwe can put a little tape on me, maybe a little palm tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it with your smart mouth!\u201d said Dasha. \u201cDon\u2019t cause more trouble. I\u2019m not having our brave boys dig you out again.\u201d She squeezed Alexander.</p><p>\u201cI really cannot take any credit for that,\u201d said Dimitri, his eyes flaring. \u201cCan I, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, you know what?\u201d said Mama. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and start dinner and leave us adults to talk a bit, all right? Marina, go help Tania with dinner.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana made potatoes with a little butter, and some beans and carrots on the side. That\u2019s really not enough food for everyone, she thought, and fried up one of Deda\u2019s cans of ham, which no one liked.</p><p>\u201cTania, your parents still don\u2019t like to talk in front of you, do they?\u201d said Marina.</p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe soldiers are quite protective of you. Especially Alexander,\u201d Marina remarked.</p><p>\u201cHe is protective of everybody,\u201d stated Tatiana. \u201cCan you go and get me more butter? I don\u2019t think this will be enough.\u201d</p><p>Dinner was a somber occasion that evening. Alexander and Dimitri were leaving for the front, and everyone was afraid to mention the unspeakable \u2014 Germans in the middle of their city and Alexander and Dimitri leaving for the front. Tatiana knew that, unlike Dimitri, Alexander was not going into front-line battle, but that was small comfort to her, imagining him commanding his artillery company.</p><p>Still somehow it was she who managed to ask brightly, \u201cWell, what now?\u201d as everyone was sipping black tea.</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cAll of you, use the bomb shelter you\u2019ve got downstairs. You\u2019re lucky to have one. Many buildings don\u2019t. Use it every day. And, Dasha, make sure your sister doesn\u2019t go on the roof. Tell her to let the boys take care of the bombs. Do you hear me, Dasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you, darling.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana heard him loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, was there much food in the burned-down warehouses?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Alexander shrugged. \u201cThere was sugar, some flour. Perhaps a couple of days\u2019 supply. It\u2019s not the Badayev warehouses we have to worry about. It\u2019s the Germans surrounding the city.\u201d</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cOh, Alexander, I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re here, in Leningrad! All summer they seemed so far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow they\u2019re here. The circle around Leningrad is nearly complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly a circle,\u201d muttered Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you to argue with an army lieutenant!\u201d yelled her intoxicated father.</p><p>Alexander lifted his hand and said calmly, \u201cYour father is right, Tania. Don\u2019t argue with me. Even if you are right.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana kept herself from smiling.</p><p>Alexander continued, also not smiling, \u201cUnfortunately, the Germans have geography on their side. We have too much water all around the city.\u201d Then he smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll rephrase that. With the gulf, Lake Ladoga, the river Neva, and the Finns up north, the circle around Leningrad is nearly complete.\u201d Looking at Tatiana, he asked, \u201cHow is that? Is that better?\u201d</p><p>She muttered unintelligibly and accidentally caught Marina\u2019s eye.</p><p>Dimitri sat closer to Tatiana, putting his arm around her and nuzzling in her hair. \u201cYour hair is growing out, Tanechka,\u201d he said. \u201cGrow it out all the way, will you? I loved it long.\u201d</p><p>Whatever Alexander is doing, Tatiana thought, is not enough. Whatever we\u2019re doing is not enough. How long can we continue? We need to stop talking to each other in front of Dima and Dasha and the rest of my family. Or soon there will be trouble. As if reading Tatiana\u2019s mind, Alexander moved his chair closer to Dasha\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d asked Dasha, \u201cthe Germans are not up the whole Neva, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround the city, yes. All the way up the river to Lake Ladoga, to Shlisselburg.\u201d</p><p>Shlisselburg was a small city built at the tip of Lake Ladoga, where the Neva spilled out of the lake and meandered seventy kilometers to Leningrad, emptying out into the Gulf of Finland.</p><p>\u201cIs Shlisselburg under German control?\u201d Dasha asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alexander said, sighing. \u201cBut tomorrow it will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we fight to keep the Germans out of Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s mother asked, \u201cNow that the warehouses have burned down, how is food going to get into the city?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri said, \u201cNot just food, but kerosene, gasoline, munitions.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cFirst, we stop the Germans from getting inside, then we worry about everything else.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri laughed unpleasantly. \u201cThey can come inside if they want. Every major building in Leningrad has been mined. Every factory, every museum, every cathedral, every bridge. If Hitler enters the city, he will die in its ruins. We are not going to be stopping Hitler, just dying alongside him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dimitri, we are going to be stopping Hitler,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cBefore the Germans get into the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Leningrad is now scorched earth, too?\u201d asked Tatiana. \u201cWhat about all of us?\u201d</p><p>No one replied.</p><p>Shaking his head, Alexander finally said, \u201cDimitri and I are headed for Dubrovka tomorrow. We will stop them if we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why is it that it\u2019s me and you who have to stand between the Germans and this city?\u201d Dimitri exclaimed. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just give Leningrad up? Minsk gave up. Kiev gave up. Tallinn gave up, having burned to the ground first. The entire Crimea gave up. All of the Ukraine happily gave up!\u201d He was getting himself into a terrible agitation. \u201cWhat the hell are we doing killing all of our men to stop Hitler from coming here? Let him come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Dimochka,\u201d said Mama, \u201cyour Tania is here. And Alexander\u2019s Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and let\u2019s not forget me,\u201d said Marina. \u201cEven though I belong to nobody, I\u2019m here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Dima,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cDo you want to step out of Hitler\u2019s way so he can get to your girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dima,\u201d exclaimed Dasha. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard what the Germans are doing to all the Ukrainian women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard; what are they doing?\u201d asked Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Tania,\u201d Alexander said gently. \u201cCan I please have some more tea?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stood up.</p><p>Dimitri looked down into his empty cup. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some tea, too, Dima,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>Marina said, looking down into her empty cup, \u201cMy poor Papa couldn\u2019t stop them. They seem unstoppable, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing.</p><p>\u201cThey are unstoppable!\u201d Dimitri exclaimed. \u201cWe have three pathetic army divisions. That\u2019s not going to be enough, even if every last man dies and if every last tank is destroyed!\u201d</p><p>Alexander stood from the table and saluted everyone. \u201cOn that note,\u201d he said, \u201cwe must be going. Forget my tea, Tania.\u201d Turning to Dimitri, he said, \u201cSoldier on, Private, and let\u2019s go. Your life stands between the Metanovs and Hitler.\u201d He did not glance at Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d mumbled Dimitri.</p><p>As they were leaving, Dasha cried, clinging to Alexander. \u201cWill you promise to come back alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do my best.\u201d And then he glanced at Tatiana.</p><p>Tatiana did not cry, nor did she extract the same promise from Dimitri. After they left, she had a piece of sweet biscuit, nursing it like a wound.</p><p>Marina said, \u201cI really like your Dima, Tania. He is more honest than anyone I know. I like that in a soldier.\u201d</p><p>Puzzled, Tatiana looked at her cousin. \u201cWhat kind of a soldier doesn\u2019t want to go and fight? You can have him, Marina.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>3</p><p>The next morning, as they were getting dressed, the Metanovs heard on the radio that an incendiary bomb had fallen on the roof of a building on Sadovaya Ulitsa and the roof patrol wasn\u2019t able to put it out in time. It exploded, killing everyone there, nine people, all of them under the age of twenty.</p><p>My brother was under the age of twenty, Tatiana thought, putting on her shoes. Her shin was throbbing.</p><p>\u201cYou see? What did I tell you?\u201d said Mama. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to be on the roof.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are in the middle of a city under siege, Mama,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to be everywhere.\u201d</p><p>The bombing started at precisely eight in the morning. Tatiana hadn\u2019t even gone to get her rations yet. The family all piled downstairs to the bomb shelter. Restlessly Tatiana bit her nails to the quick and drummed and drummed a tune on her knees, but nothing helped. They sat for an hour.</p><p>Afterward Papa gave Tatiana his ration book and asked her to get his rations for him. Mama said, \u201cTanechka, can you get mine, too? I\u2019ve got all this sewing to do before work. I\u2019m sewing extra uniforms for the army.\u201d She smiled. \u201cOne uniform for our Alexander, ten rubles for me.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana asked Marina to come with her to the store. Marina declined, saying she was going to help Babushka get dressed. Dasha was in the kitchen washing clothes in the cast-iron sink.</p><p>Tatiana went by herself. She found a large store on the Fontanka Canal near the Theatre of Drama and Comedy. The theatre was showing Shakespeare\u2019s Twelfth Night at seven that evening. The line at the store spilled down the embankment.</p> <p>She forgot all about Twelfth Night when she got to the counter and learned that after yesterday\u2019s burning of the Badayev warehouses the ration had been further reduced.</p><p>Papa got half a kilo of bread on his worker\u2019s ration card, but everyone else got only 350 grams each, and Marina and Babushka only 250 grams. Altogether they had about two kilos of bread for the day. Besides bread, Tatiana managed to buy some carrots, soybeans, and three apples. She also bought 100 grams of butter and half a liter of milk.</p><p>After running home, Tatiana told her family of the reduced rations. They weren\u2019t concerned. \u201cTwo kilos of bread?\u201d Mama said, putting away her sewing. \u201cThat\u2019s more than enough. That\u2019s plenty. No need to stuff ourselves like pigs in times of war. We can tighten our belts a little bit. Plus we have all that extra food just in case. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana divided the bread into two piles \u2014 one for breakfast, one for dinner \u2014 and then divided each of the piles into six portions. She gave Papa the most bread. She gave herself the least.</p><p>At the hospital gone was the pretense of training with Vera. Tatiana was reduced to cleaning the toilets and baths for the patients and then washing their soiled bedding. She served lunch and was herself able to eat. Sometimes soldiers came in to eat. While serving them, she always asked if they were stationed in Pavlov Barracks.</p><p>Intermittent bombing continued during the day.</p> <p>That night Tatiana had enough time to make dinner and clean up before the air-raid siren sounded at nine. Back to the bomb shelter. Tatiana sat and sat and sat. It\u2019s been only two days, she thought. How many more days of this? Next time I see Alexander, I\u2019m going to get him to tell me the truth about how long this is going to continue.</p><p>The shelter was long and narrow, painted gray, with two kerosene lamps for the sixty or so people, who sat on benches or stood leaning against the walls. \u201cPapa,\u201d Tatiana asked her father, \u201chow much longer do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be over in a few hours,\u201d he said wearily. Tatiana smelled vodka heavy on his breath.</p><p>\u201cPapa,\u201d Tatiana said in a tired voice, \u201cI meant . . . the fighting, the war. How much longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d he said, trying to stand up. \u201cUntil we\u2019re all dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, what\u2019s the matter with Papa?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tanechka, you can\u2019t be that blind. Pasha is the matter with Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not blind,\u201d muttered Tatiana, moving away. \u201cBut his family needs him.\u201d</p> <p>Edging closer to Dasha and Marina, Tatiana asked, \u201cDash, Marinka here told me that Misha in Luga had a crush on me. I told her she was crazy. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Marina looked at Tatiana and Dasha. \u201cYou are both crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you, Dasha, are one day going to eat your words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go, Tania,\u201d said Dasha, without even looking at her sister. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s Misha you need and not Dimitri.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>The next day was the same. This time Tatiana brought a copy of Dostoyevsky\u2019s Notes from the Underground with her.</p><p>The next day she said to herself, I can\u2019t do this anymore. I can\u2019t sit and drum out my life on my knees. So as her family was heading downstairs, Tatiana fell a little behind and then ran back through the apartment and up the rear stairs to the roof, where Anton, Mariska, and Kirill and a few other people she didn\u2019t know were watching the sky. Tatiana thought that with a bit of luck her family might not even notice her absence.</p><p>The bursting and whistling noise from the shelling was fearful on the roof. Tatiana stayed for two hours. No bombs landed near them, much to everyone\u2019s disappointment.</p><p>Tatiana had been right. No one realized she hadn\u2019t gone to the shelter. \u201cWhere did you sit, Tanechka?\u201d asked her mother. \u201cOn the other side next to the lamp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mama.\u201d</p><p>There was no word from Alexander or Dimitri. The girls were beside themselves. They could barely be civil to each other, much less to anyone else. Only Babushka Maya, unshakable to the last, kept quiet and continued to paint.</p><p>\u201cBabushka, where do you get your peace of mind from?\u201d asked Tatiana one evening, brushing Babushka\u2019s long hair that was just starting to go gray.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old to care, sunshine,\u201d replied Babushka. \u201cI\u2019m not young like you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live quite so much.\u201d She looked over her shoulder and touched Tatiana\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cBabushka, don\u2019t say that.\u201d She came around to the front and hugged her grandmother. \u201cWhat if Fedor comes back?\u201d</p><p>Stroking Tatiana\u2019s head, Babushka Maya said, \u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t want to live at all. I said not quite so much.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was a little worried about Marina. She was gone from the apartment from early morning until night, going to Leningrad University and then faithfully visiting her mother at the hospital.</p><p>At night Mama sewed. At night Papa drank. And screamed, and slept. At night Dasha and Tatiana listened to the radio for news. At night, there was bombing, and Tatiana sneaked out to the roof.</p><p>And during the day she heard the sound of war. It was never quiet in Leningrad. Shell fire came in two sounds, distant and nearby, stopping briefly for lunch in the afternoon and a sleep in the evening.</p><p>Tatiana worked, got bread, healed her leg, and acted as if her life had not stopped dead like the tram near the white-night Obvodnoy Canal.</p><p>Babushka Maya had a room all to herself. Mama slept alone on the sofa, and Papa slept alone on Pasha\u2019s cot. Tatiana, Marina, and Dasha slept in the same bed. Tatiana was almost grateful for the buffer between her and Dasha, the buffer that allowed her to face the crisis of bombings by averting her eyes from the crisis of her sister, who had the right during war to love Alexander.</p><p>Not enough of a buffer. Dasha one night climbed over Marina and put her arms around Tatiana. \u201cTania, darling, are you asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think about them dying?\u201d Dasha asked in the dark.</p><p>\u201cGirls, I have school tomorrow,\u201d said Marina. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tatiana heard Dasha\u2019s quiet whimpers.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019re dead now?\u201d asked Dasha, holding on to Tatiana.</p><p>Taking an aching breath, Tatiana inhaled for Alexander. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She did not want to be talking to Dasha about Alexander. Not now. Not ever. \u201cDasha, worry about yourself. Look at the conditions we\u2019re living in. Do you even see? In the hospital they asked me if I would mind leaving the kitchen and going upstairs to help with the bomb victims. I agreed, but then I saw what was left of them.\u201d Tatiana paused. \u201cDid you see that today across Ligovsky a whole building collapsed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl, seventeen . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you.\u201d Dasha squeezed her.</p><p>\u201cYes \u2014 was buried under the rubble. Her father was trying to help the firemen dig her out. All day they were digging. At six when I left the hospital, they had just succeeded. And she was already dead. Hole in her forehead.\u201d</p><p>Dasha didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Marina said, \u201cTania, did you just say you left the hospital at six? But there was bombing at six. You didn\u2019t go to the shelter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarinka,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cDon\u2019t even talk about that with her.\u201d She whispered into Tatiana\u2019s hair, \u201cIf you don\u2019t start going to the shelter, I\u2019m going to tell on you.\u201d</p><p>That night the sirens woke them up at three in the morning. The Germans obviously wanted to have a little fun. Tatiana turned to the wall and would have continued to sleep had her family not dragged her out of bed. They crowded on the landing behind the stairs, and Tatiana thought, it can\u2019t get much worse than this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>4</p><p>Alexander and Dimitri returned during the night of September 12, the first night and day there was no bombing at all. They had come back from Dubrovka for just one evening \u2014 to pick up more men from the garrison and more artillery weapons.</p><p>Alexander turned up, much to the tearful relief of Dasha, who would not let go of him for a second, refusing to help with dinner. Dimitri hung on to Tatiana in much the same way Dasha hung on to Alexander, but while Alexander was able to hug Dasha back, Tatiana stood like a skinned goose and looked helplessly around the room. \u201cAll right, now, all right,\u201d she said, trying very hard not to look at Alexander\u2019s black hair and large body, and failing. To see his shape in front of her eyes would have to be comforting enough. She would have to do without his arms around her.</p><p>When Dimitri went to wash and Dasha ran to make tea, Marina said, \u201cYou know, Tania, you could show a little more interest in the man who is fighting for you at the front.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m showing plenty of interest, thought Tatiana, barely able to glance away from Alexander.</p><p>\u201cYour cousin is right, Tania,\u201d said Alexander, grinning at her. \u201cYou can show at least as much interest as Zhanna Sarkova, who, as we walked by her slightly ajar door, was lying on her bed with a glass to your wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was?\u201d</p><p>Raising his voice, Alexander took his rifle, banged once very hard on the wall and said loudly, \u201cHave you heard this joke? A man showed a friend his apartment. The guest asked, \u2018What\u2019s the big brass basin for?\u2019 And the man replied, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s the talking clock,\u2019 and gave a shattering pound with a hammer.\u201d Alexander banged the wall hard again. \u201cSuddenly a voice on the other side of the wall screamed, \u2018It\u2019s 2 A.M., you bastard!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Tatiana laughed so loudly that Alexander put down his rifle and patted her gently on the back. \u201cThank you, Tania,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m starved. What\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p> <p>As Tatiana turned to go to the kitchen, she had to walk past Marina\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Tatiana fried two cans of ham with a bit of rice that Alexander had brought, and some clear broth, which once had chicken in it. While she was cooking, Alexander came out into the kitchen to wash. Tatiana held her breath. He came up to the stove and checked under all the lids. \u201cHmm, ham,\u201d he said. \u201cRice. What\u2019s this, water? Don\u2019t give me any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not water, it\u2019s soup,\u201d said Tatiana quietly. His bent head was very close to her arm. If she moved three centimeters, she could touch him.</p><p>Still holding her breath, she moved three centimeters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so hungry, Tania,\u201d Alexander said, raising his eyes to her, but before he could say another word, Marina came out to the kitchen and said, \u201cAlexander, Dasha wanted me to give you a towel. You forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Marina,\u201d said Alexander, grabbing the towel and disappearing. Tatiana stared into her clear soup, perhaps for a reflection.</p> <p>Marina came over to the stove, looked inside the pot, and said, \u201cAnything interesting in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Tatiana straightened up.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d said Marina, walking away. \u201cBecause there is plenty of interesting out here.\u201d</p><p>Over dinner Dasha asked, \u201cIs the fighting terrible?\u201d</p><p>Eating hungrily and happily, Alexander replied, \u201cYou know, strangely, no. It was the first two days, right, Dima? He knows. He was in the trenches for two days. The Germans were obviously trying to see if we would buckle. When we didn\u2019t, they stopped attacking, and our recon guys swore to us that it looked as if the Germans were building permanent trenches. Concrete trenches and bunkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermanent? What does that mean?\u201d asked Dasha.</p><p>Slowly Alexander said, \u201cIt means that they are probably not going to invade Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>The family rejoiced at this \u2014 everyone except Papa, who was half asleep on the couch, and Tatiana, who saw an ominous hesitation in Alexander\u2019s face, a reluctance to tell the truth.</p> <p>Biting her lip, Tatiana carefully asked, \u201cAre you happy about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dimitri replied instantly, as if she were talking to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, no,\u201d Alexander replied slowly. \u201cI thought we would fight,\u201d he stated. \u201cFight like men\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd die like men!\u201d interrupted Dimitri, banging on the table.</p><p>\u201cAnd die like men, if we had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, speak for yourself. I\u2019d rather the Germans sit in their bunkers for two years and starve Leningrad to death than endure their fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Alexander said, putting down his knife and fork and staring at Dimitri. \u201cThis wasting away in the trenches, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bit unbecoming? It\u2019s almost like cowardice.\u201d He gave Dimitri one more cold glance, wiped his mouth, and reached for the vodka. Tatiana pushed the bottle toward him from the other side of the table.</p><p>\u201cNot at all like cowardice,\u201d Dimitri declared. \u201cIt\u2019s smart. You sit and you wait. When the enemy weakens, you strike. It\u2019s called strategy.\u201d</p><p>Nervously picking at her ham, Mama said, \u201cDimochka, surely you don\u2019t mean starve Leningrad to death? Not in the literal sense, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right,\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cI meant figuratively.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana studied Alexander, who remained silent.</p><p>\u201cIs there any more vodka?\u201d Dimitri asked, lifting the nearly empty bottle. \u201cI feel like becoming senseless tonight.\u201d</p><p>Everyone glanced at Papa and glanced away.</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d Tatiana said in her cheerful voice. She liked being able to say his name out loud. \u201cNina Iglenko came by today asking us if we could spare some flour and some ham. We have plenty, so I gave her some. She said she wished she had been as forward-thinking as we were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Alexander interrupted, and she sat heavily back in her chair. Her feelings had been right. He knew too much. And he wasn\u2019t telling. \u201cDon\u2019t give a gram of your food away, for any reason, do you understand? Not even if Nina Iglenko seems more hungry than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not that hungry,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cYes, Alexander,\u201d said Dasha, \u201cwe\u2019ve had rations before. Where were you during the Finnish campaign of last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFighting the Finns,\u201d he said grimly. Tatiana wondered why Dasha always had to euphemize war into a campaign or a conflict. Was she writing propaganda for the radio?</p><p>\u201cDasha, all of you, listen to me. Hang on to your food as if it\u2019s the last thing between you and death, all right?\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to be so serious?\u201d Dasha asked sulkily. \u201cWhere\u2019s your famous sense of humor? We\u2019re not going to starve. The Leningrad council will get food in somehow, right? We\u2019re not completely surrounded by the Germans, are we?\u201d</p><p>Alexander lit a cigarette. \u201cDasha, do me a favor, save your food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, dearest. You have my word.\u201d She kissed him.</p><p>Alexander turned to Tatiana. \u201cYou, too, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Dearest. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d She didn\u2019t kiss him.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, how long was London bombed for in the summer of 1940?\u201d asked Dasha.</p><p>\u201cForty days and nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s going to be as long here?\u201d</p><p>There was the question Tatiana wanted. She didn\u2019t even have to ask it herself.</p><p>\u201cLonger,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cThe bombing will continue until Leningrad either surrenders or falls, or we push the Germans away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to surrender?\u201d asked Dasha. \u201cI\u2019ll fight the Nazis on the streets of Leningrad if I have to.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana thought that was brave talk from Dasha, the girl who sat in the bomb shelter every night.</p><p>Shaking his head, Alexander said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fight them, Dasha. A street war is devastating, not only for the besieged but also for the attacker. The loss of life is enormous. And while our beloved great leader might not set much store by the lives of his own men, Hitler maintains a surprisingly healthy interest in the lives of the Aryan race. I don\u2019t think he will risk his men for Leningrad.\u201d He glanced at Tatiana. \u201cI think Dima will get his wish after all,\u201d Alexander finished, with barely concealed contempt.</p><p>Tatiana looked at Dimitri \u2014 splayed on the couch, either asleep or in a stupor, next to her father \u2014 and went to get the cups for tea.</p><p>\u201cIs it going to be like London?\u201d Dasha said, throwing back her curly hair, her eyes gleaming. \u201cLondon was bombed, but the people still went on with their lives, and there were clubs, and young people went dancing. We saw pictures. It all looked so gay.\u201d She smiled at Alexander, stroking his leg.</p><p>\u201cDasha, where are you living? London?\u201d Alexander exclaimed, moving away from her. \u201cLondon might as well be Mars as far as you\u2019re concerned. We don\u2019t have dance clubs in Leningrad now. Do you think they will build them just for the blockade?\u201d</p><p>Dasha\u2019s face soured. \u201cBlockade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha! London was not blockaded. Do you understand the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we blockaded?\u201d asked Dasha.</p><p>Alexander did not reply.</p><p>Mama, Dasha, Marina, and Babushka were squeezed around the table, all devouring Alexander with their eyes, all except Tatiana, who was standing in the doorway, her hands full of cups and saucers.</p><p>She did not look at him when she said, \u201cWe are indeed blockaded. That\u2019s why the Germans have entrenched. They\u2019re not going to lose their own men. They are going to starve us to death. Right, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough questions for one evening. Just don\u2019t give your food away.\u201d</p><p>Mama said with disbelief, \u201cAlexander, I heard the Germans are at Peterhof Palace. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember we went to Peterhof, darling?\u201d Dasha murmured, holding his hand. \u201cOh, Alexander, it was the happiest day! It was the last young, carefree day we had. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Alexander said, not glancing at Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s been the same since that wonderful day,\u201d Dasha said sadly.</p><p>Turning to Mama, Alexander said, \u201cIrina Fedorovna, Peterhof is indeed in German hands. The Nazis have taken the carpets out of the palace and are lining their trenches with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d said Dasha, sipping her tea, \u201cmaybe Dimitri was right. There are three million people still left in Leningrad. That\u2019s too many to sacrifice, don\u2019t you think?\u201d She paused. \u201cHas the Leningrad command considered giving up?\u201d</p><p>Alexander studied Dasha. Tatiana was trying to figure out what was in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Dasha continued, \u201cif we give up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive up and then what?\u201d Alexander exclaimed. \u201cDasha, the Germans have no use for us. Certainly they will have no use for you.\u201d He paused. \u201cHave you read about what they have done to the Ukrainian countryside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to,\u201d said Dasha.</p><p>\u201cBut now I have,\u201d said Tatiana quietly.</p><p>Alexander continued. \u201cDimitri for a while there thought it might be a good idea to become a prisoner in a German camp. Until he learned how the Nazis shot the prisoners, looted and burned the villages, slaughtered the cattle, razed the barns, killed all the Jews and then all the women and children, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot before they raped all the women,\u201d Tatiana said.</p><p>Dasha and Alexander stared at her, dumbstruck.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d said Dasha, \u201cpass me the blueberry jam, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and stop reading so much, Tania,\u201d said Alexander quietly. He stared into his teacup.</p><p>Spooning some blueberry jam into her mouth, Dasha asked, \u201cWell, if we are blockaded, how is the food going to get into Leningrad?\u201d</p><p>Mama said, \u201cWe have plenty. We\u2019ve saved quite a lot.\u201d</p><p>Dasha stated firmly, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mama. I think I\u2019m with Dimitri on this. I think we should hand over\u2014\u201d</p><p>Looking bleakly at Tatiana, Alexander shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cRight, Tania? . . . We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end . . . We shall fight on the seas and the oceans. . . . In the air, we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall fight on the beaches,\u201d continued Tatiana bravely, her eyes all over Alexander. \u201cWe shall fight in the fields and in the streets . . . We shall fight in the hills.\u201d She swallowed a lump in her throat. \u201cWe shall never surrender,\u201d she finished, realizing her hands were trembling. \u201cChurchill.\u201d</p><p>Dasha heaved herself up in frustration and said, \u201cCan you just go and make us a little more tea, Churchill?\u201d</p><p>Marina came out to the kitchen to help Tatiana clean up and whispered, \u201cTania, I have never in my life seen anybody more dense and dumb than your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Tatiana said, pale and still.</p><p>A few days later Tatiana and Dasha counted what was left of their provisions, most of which Tatiana had purchased with Alexander\u2019s help on the first day of war.</p><p>Their ephemeral first day of war.</p><p>That day seemed so far away, as if it belonged in another life, in another time. Two months ago, and yet already so irretrievably in the past.</p><p>In the present the Metanovs had forty-three kilo cans of ham. They had nine cans of stewed tomatoes and seven bottles of vodka. Tatiana realized with a shock that they had had eleven bottles of vodka when the Badayev warehouses burned down eight days ago. Papa must be drinking more than they knew, she thought.</p><p>They had two kilos of coffee, four kilos of tea, and a ten-kilo bag of sugar divided into thirty plastic sacks. Tatiana also counted fifteen small cans of smoked sardines. They had a four-kilo bag of barley, six kilos of oats, and a ten-kilo bag of flour.</p><p>\u201cSeems like plenty, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Dasha. \u201cHow long can the siege possibly last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Alexander, until the end,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>They had seven boxes of 250 matches each.</p><p>Mama said that they also had 900 rubles in cash, enough to buy food on the black market. \u201cLet\u2019s go and buy some, Mama,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>The sisters went with their mother to a commercial store, which had opened in August in Oktabrski Rayon, near St. Nicholas\u2019s Cathedral. It took them over an hour to walk there, and they stared with disbelief at the prices of the few products on the shelves. There were eggs and cheese and butter and ham and even caviar. But sugar cost seventeen rubles a kilo. Mama laughed, turning toward the door until Tatiana grabbed her arm, and said, \u201cMama, don\u2019t be cheap. Buy the food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of me, idiot,\u201d said Mama roughly. \u201cWhat kind of fool do you think I am, buying sugar for seventeen rubles a kilo? Look at the cheese, ten rubles for a hundred grams. Are they joking?\u201d She yelled to the store clerk, \u201cAre you joking? That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have lines in this store, you know, unlike the regular Russian stores! Who will buy the food at these prices?\u201d</p><p>The young store clerk smirked and shook his head. \u201cGirls, girls. Buy or leave the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d said Mama. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t move. \u201cMama, do you remember what Alexander told us?\u201d She took out the rubles she had saved from her job at Kirov and the hospital. There wasn\u2019t much. She received only twenty rubles a week, and ten of it went to her parents. But she had managed to save a hundred rubles, and with that money she bought a five-kilo bag of flour for an outrageous forty rubles (\u201cWhat do we need more flour for?\u201d), four packets of yeast for ten rubles, a bag of sugar for seventeen, and one kilo of canned ham for thirty. She had three rubles left and asked what she could get. The clerk said a box of matches, 500 grams of tea, or some old bread that she could toast and make into crackers. Tatiana thought carefully and opted for the bread.</p><p>She spent the rest of Saturday cutting the bread into small pieces and toasting it in the oven, while Mama and Papa, and even Dasha, laughed at her. \u201cShe spent three rubles on stale bread, and now she is toasting it. She thinks we\u2019re going to eat it!\u201d Tatiana ignored them all, thinking only of Alexander\u2019s words in the Voentorg store. Buy the food as if you\u2019re never going to see it again.</p><p>That evening Alexander listened to the story and then said, \u201cIrina Fedorovna, you should\u2019ve spent every last kopeck of your nine hundred rubles buying up that stale bread.\u201d He paused. \u201cJust like Tania.\u201d</p><p>Thank you, Alexander, thought Tatiana. She was on the other side of the room, and the room was filled with people. She hadn\u2019t touched him in days. She was trying so hard to stay away from him, as he had asked her to.</p><p>Mama waved him off. \u201cI was not brought up to spend seventeen rubles on sugar. Right, Georgi?\u201d</p><p>Georgi was already asleep on the couch. He\u2019d had too much to drink again.</p><p>\u201cRight, Mama?\u201d</p><p>Babushka Maya was painting. \u201cI guess, Irina,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what if Alexander is the one who is right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>5</p><p>The Germans were virtuously punctual. Every evening at five the air-raid sirens went off and the radio\u2019s metronome pounded at 200 beats a minute.</p><p>The frightening monotony of the shells falling on Leningrad was surpassed only by the frightening monotony of the lies Tatiana was living with inside herself, and the unyielding fear for Alexander\u2019s life, and the frustration with Papa, who had so thoroughly left the family that he no longer even knew it was still September. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said one evening as the siren sounded. \u201cThey\u2019ve been bombing us for what seems like a thousand days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just eleven, Papa,\u201d said Tatiana quietly. \u201cJust eleven.\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana\u2019s frustration was not just with Papa these days. Mama had withdrawn into her work. Babushka painted as if the war were not going on. Marina was wrapped up in anxiety over her mother \u2014 and, besides, Tatiana didn\u2019t want to be talking too much to Marina. And Dasha . . . well, Dasha was wrapped up in Alexander.</p><p>Deda and Babushka were safely in Molotov. She had just received a letter from them. Pasha was gone.</p><p>Dimitri was brooding and unhappy, drinking more and more the few times he came over. One evening he had actually pushed Tatiana against the wall near the kitchen window, and if Dasha hadn\u2019t come out, Tatiana didn\u2019t know where that would have led.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s only comfort were her friends on the roof and Alexander.</p><p>When she came out onto the roof, little Mariska was hopping around as usual, hoping for more planes, more bombs. The seven-year-old semi-abandoned child ran around happily, waving at the plane formations. \u201cHere, here!\u201d she kept squealing, her curly hair bouncing with her.</p> <p>Anton stood at the ready with his cement cap on a stick to extinguish the incendiaries. \u201cBut, Anton,\u201d Tatiana said, sinking down onto the tar and pulling out a cracker, \u201cwhat if the bomb falls on your head? You\u2019re holding the cap on your stupid stick, but if the bomb falls on your poor head, what are you going to do then? Why don\u2019t you just put a helmet on your head right now and sit down next to me?\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t, as he continued to talk excitedly about the fragmentation bombs, which could slice you before you even lifted your head to see what was coming. Tatiana could swear Anton wanted to see someone sliced.</p><p>Tatiana watched Mariska \u2014 her little frame impossibly small \u2014 with tired amusement as she chewed her cracker.</p><p>Mariska ran up to Tatiana and said, \u201cHey, Tanechka, what are you chewing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a bread cracker,\u201d replied Tatiana, sticking her hand in her pocket. \u201cWant one?\u201d</p><p>Mariska nodded fervently and then grabbed the cracker out of Tatiana\u2019s hand, and before Tatiana could say, \u201cDon\u2019t snatch!\u201d the little girl swallowed the thing whole and said, \u201cGot any more?\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly Tatiana saw something in Mariska she had not seen before. She got up and took Mariska\u2019s hand. \u201cYour mama and papa, where are they?\u201d she asked, walking with the little girl to the stairs.</p><p>Shrugging, Mariska said, \u201cSleeping, I think.\u201d</p><p>Anton called after Tatiana, \u201cDon\u2019t, Tania. Leave her be.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana took Mariska downstairs to her room. \u201cMama, Papochka, look, someone here to see you,\u201d the girl said.</p><p>Mama and Papochka did not move from the one bed in the room. Both were facedown in the filthy pillows. The room smelled like Tatiana\u2019s communal toilet. \u201cCome upstairs with me, Mariska,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll find you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>The next morning at six-thirty Tatiana, already washed and dressed, stood over her sister\u2019s sleeping body. \u201cDashenka,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cmay I suggest that you don\u2019t use the eight o\u2019clock air-raid siren as your own personal alarm clock? Get up with me right now and come to the store.\u201d</p><p>Dasha barely stirred. \u201cWhy, Tania?\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so well by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Tatiana said, pulling back the covers on Marina and Dasha. \u201cCome and see the early show.\u201d</p> <p>The girls didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d said Tatiana, covering them back up, \u201cyou can just catch the main event promptly at five.\u201d</p><p>Dasha\u2019s and Marina\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t open.</p><p>\u201cIf you miss that, try for the late show,\u201d Tatiana said, leaving the room. \u201cNine o\u2019clock sharp.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Alexander is in Leningrad, Tatiana thought. Maybe he will come by tonight and talk to me as if he is still alive, as if I am still alive. Can\u2019t somebody talk to me? No one feels me near them anymore; they\u2019ve all disappeared inside themselves, as if I\u2019m no longer here. Come by, Alexander, Tatiana thought, as she buttoned her coat and walked briskly down Nekrasova to the ration store. Come by and remind me I am still living.</p><p>That evening, between air raids, Alexander did come by, bringing his rations and a very moody Dimitri with him. The room was filled with people, as always. Tatiana went out to the kitchen to make a dinner of beans and rice. Alexander followed her, and her heart beat faster, but then Zhanna Sarkova came into the kitchen, and Petr Petrov, and then Dasha and Marina. And Alexander left the kitchen.</p><p>During dinner the entire family was around the table except for Papa, who was intoxicated in the next room. Tatiana could speak to Alexander, but she could not look at Alexander, with all those eyes, all those faces. She looked at her food, or at Mama. She could not look at Dasha, or Marina, or Babushka \u2014 who seemed to have a sense about everything.</p><p>While talking about how badly prepared the Soviet Army was to defend the Neva from the Germans, Alexander said, \u201cTwo days ago my battalion went up the Neva, across from Shlisselburg, to dig some trenches. We got some mortars up, but, you know, nothing was in place. Even the\u201d \u2014 he lowered his voice a notch \u2014 \u201cthe ubiquitous NKVD barely had a presence there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t be everywhere at once,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cThey have too many functions. Border troops, Kirov factory guards, street militia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Gestapo,\u201d finished Alexander. \u201cOh, and let\u2019s not forget the ministers of all internal affairs and the guardians of internal safety.\u201d</p><p>They managed a small smile, she into her food. Tatiana needed to touch his hand to ease him away from his past and into their present. She could not touch him: her family was around the table, and so was Dimitri. But Alexander needed to be touched. In a moment she was going to get up and give him what he needed, and let the rest of them who needed nothing from her be damned.</p><p>Standing up, she started clearing the table. Coming around to take his plate, she pressed her hip into his elbow for one slow moment and then quickly moved on.</p><p>\u201cTania, you know, if the Germans had attacked properly in the first two weeks of September,\u201d Alexander continued, \u201cI think they would have been assured success. We had no tanks, no guns in place. The only armies we had across the river from Shlisselburg were remnants of the Karelian force, some underarmed People\u2019s Volunteers.\u201d He paused. \u201cHow well trained were the People\u2019s Volunteers in Luga, Tania? As we know, not everyone has Tania\u2019s presence of mind during a bombing.\u201d</p><p>Dasha interrupted, \u201cWhat are you talking to her about war for? She couldn\u2019t be less interested. Talk to her about Pushkin or something. Maybe cooking. She likes to cook now. She thinks the war is not even going on.\u201d</p><p>With a serious face Alexander said, \u201cAll right, Tania. Would you like to talk about Pushkin?\u201d</p><p>Flustered, Tatiana said, \u201cWait, speaking of cooking \u2014 of food, rather \u2014 where do you think a safe store for me to go to would be? No matter where I go to get rations, I\u2019m getting bombed. It\u2019s . . . inconvenient,\u201d she finished, and Alexander laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way of putting it,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere. Stay in the shelter during bombing.\u201d</p><p>No one said a word.</p><p>\u201cMy question is,\u201d Tatiana continued quickly in order not to let Dasha say a word, \u201cwhere are they shooting at me from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPulkovo Heights,\u201d replied Alexander. \u201cThey don\u2019t even need to fly the planes. Have you noticed how comparatively few planes we\u2019ve seen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, there were about a hundred last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, at night, because it\u2019s harder for us to hit their planes at night. But they don\u2019t want to waste their precious airpower. They\u2019re sitting very nicely and comfortably at Pulkovo Heights, and their bombs reach all the way to Smolny. You know where Pulkovo is, don\u2019t you, Tania? It\u2019s right by Kirov.\u201d</p><p>She blushed \u2014 into the dirty dishes she was carrying. He had to stop that. No, don\u2019t stop it. I need it to continue breathing. When she came back from the kitchen, Mama said, \u201cWell, thank God you don\u2019t work all the way in Kirov anymore, Tanechka.\u201d</p><p>Alexander suggested that Tatiana not go down Suvorovsky for her rations. Tatiana told him she didn\u2019t. \u201cI go to a store on Fontanka and Nekrasova,\u201d she said pointedly. \u201cI\u2019m there every morning promptly at seven. Right, Dasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Dasha said. \u201cI never go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t walk on any north-south roads if you can help it,\u201d Alexander repeated, glancing at Tatiana.</p><p>Dasha laughed. \u201cBut, darling! That\u2019s about half of the roads in Leningrad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d asked Tatiana mildly. \u201cYou don\u2019t go out until the bombing stops.\u201d</p><p>Putting her arms around Alexander\u2019s neck, Dasha stuck out her tongue at Tatiana. \u201cThat\u2019s because I have sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, Tania?\u201d Alexander asked quietly, holding Dasha\u2019s arms away from his face. \u201cDo you go out only when the bombing stops?\u201d</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cAre you joking? She\u2019s got absolutely no sense. Ask her how often she goes to the shelters.\u201d</p><p>There was a silence in the crowded room.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s eyes flashed.</p><p>\u201cOh, look,\u201d Tatiana said uncomfortably, \u201cI go.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cYesterday I sat under the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for three minutes. Alex, she can\u2019t sit still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been out on the roof, has she?\u201d</p><p>No one said anything. To avoid Alexander\u2019s gaze, Tatiana busied herself with the sewing machine. \u201cCan I go on Nevsky Prospekt?\u201d she asked him, not looking up.</p><p>\u201cNever. They\u2019re bombing that the heaviest. But they are being very careful not to hit the Astoria Hotel. You know where the Astoria is, Tania. It\u2019s right by St. Isaac\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s whole face turned red.</p><p>Alexander went on hurriedly. \u201cNever mind. Hitler booked the Astoria for his victory celebration after he marches with his flag down Nevsky. Stay away from Nevsky. And don\u2019t ever walk on the north side of an east-west street. You all understand?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was quiet. \u201cWhen is the celebration in the Astoria scheduled for?\u201d she asked at last.</p><p>\u201cOctober,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cHe thinks the people of Leningrad are going to abandon their city by October. But I will tell you that Hitler is going to be late.\u201d</p><p>Marina said, \u201cWhat would we all do without you, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>Dasha went over and, hugging him tight, said to Marina, \u201cStop it. Go and flirt with Tania\u2019s soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Marina, go ahead,\u201d muttered Tatiana, looking over at Dimitri, half conscious on the couch.</p><p>But Marina said, \u201cWhat do you think, Tania, should I go and flirt with your soldier?\u201d</p><p>Not far enough of a retreat, Alexander, Tatiana thought. Not far enough.</p><p>As she was cleaning up after tea, Dimitri awoke and in a stupor pulled Tatiana on top of him. \u201cTanechka,\u201d he muttered, \u201cTanechka . . .\u201d</p><p>Tatiana struggled to get up, but he was holding her to him. \u201cTania,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhen, when?\u201d His breath reeked. \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDima, come on, let me go,\u201d Tatiana said, starting to hyperventilate. \u201cI\u2019m holding a wet rag in my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Dima,\u201d said Mama. \u201cTania, I think he is having too much to drink.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana felt Alexander right behind her. She heard Alexander\u2019s voice right behind her. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, pulling Dimitri\u2019s arms away from Tatiana, and helping her stand. \u201cHe is definitely drinking too much.\u201d His hand remained on her long enough for him to squeeze her arm and let go.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him, Tania?\u201d inquired Mama. \u201cHe seems peculiar these days. Grumpy. Not talkative. And not as nice to you.\u201d</p><p>Out of breath, Tatiana watched Dimitri for a moment. \u201cHe is getting less interested in me,\u201d she said to her mother, \u201cthe closer he is feeling to his own death.\u201d She turned and went to the kitchen without glancing at Alexander, but catching Marina\u2019s eyes and Babushka\u2019s. Dasha was in the next room, tending to Papa. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>6</p><p>Tatiana thought she could take it. Tatiana thought she could take it all. But one night \u2014 two weeks after the burning of Badayev warehouses \u2014 when they all came home from work and instead of making dinner were sitting in the bomb shelter, hungry and tired, Dasha plopped down next to Tatiana and in a thrilled voice exclaimed, \u201cGuess what, everybody? Alexander and I are getting married!\u201d</p><p>The kerosene lamps gave too much light to hide what exploded inside Tatiana. Marina gasped. But the jubilant Dasha, who continued to smile while the bombs fell outside, remained oblivious to Tatiana\u2019s feelings.</p><p>Marina said, \u201cThat\u2019s great, Dasha. Congratulations!\u201d</p> <p>Mama said, \u201cDashenka, finally, one of my daughters is going to have a family of her own. When?\u201d</p><p>Papa, sitting next to Mama, mumbled something.</p><p>\u201cTania? Did you hear me?\u201d asked Dasha. \u201cI\u2019m getting married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you, Dasha,\u201d Tatiana said. Turning away, she was faced with Marina\u2019s sympathetic, pitying glance. Tatiana didn\u2019t know which was worse. She turned back to her smiling sister. \u201cCongratulations. You must be so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy? I\u2019m delirious! Can you imagine? I\u2019m going to be Dasha Belova.\u201d She giggled. \u201cAs soon as he gets a couple of days\u2019 furlough, we\u2019ll go to the registry office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d said Dasha with a wave of her healthy-looking arm. \u201cWorried about what? Alexander is not worried. We\u2019ll make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Dasha put her arm around Tatiana, who didn\u2019t know how she was still sitting. \u201cI won\u2019t kick you out of your bed. Babushka will give us her room for a couple of days.\u201d Dasha kissed her. \u201cMarried, Tania! Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Dasha exclaimed excitedly. \u201cI can hardly believe it myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s war. He could die, Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. Don\u2019t you think I know that? Don\u2019t be flip about him dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not flip,\u201d said Tatiana, trembling. About him dying. She shut her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank God, he\u2019s finally out of that awful Dubrovka and up across from Shlisselburg. It\u2019s quieter there.\u201d Dasha smiled. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what I do now \u2014 I close my eyes and I feel for him out there somewhere, and I know he\u2019s still alive.\u201d She added with pride, \u201cI have a sixth sense, you know.\u201d</p><p>Marina coughed loudly. Opening her eyes, Tatiana glared at Marina with an expression that instantly stifled Marina\u2019s coughing fit.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Dash?\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou want to be a widow, instead of just a dead soldier\u2019s girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said nothing. Where was relief going to come from? Not from the night, not from Mama or Papa, not from Deda and Babushka, far away, not from Babushka Maya, too old to care, not from Marina, who knew too much without knowing anything, not from Dimitri, who was mired in his own hell, and certainly not from Alexander, the impossible, maddening, unforgivable Alexander.</p> <p>The absence of comfort was so compelling that Tatiana could no longer continue to sit. She left the shelter in the middle of the raid, hearing only Dasha\u2019s puzzled voice: \u201cWhat is wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>How did she spend the night next to her wall, next to Marina, next to Dasha? How did she do it? She didn\u2019t know. It was the worst night of Tatiana\u2019s life.</p><p>The next morning she got up late and, instead of going to her regular store on Fontanka and Nekrasova, went to one on Old Nevsky, near her former school. She\u2019d heard they had good bread there. The air-raid siren sounded. She didn\u2019t even take cover.</p><p>Tatiana walked with her eyes to the ground. The whistling bombs, the wind-induced piercing shrieks, followed by the sound of brick exploding and then distant human cries were nothing compared to the screaming hurt inside her body.</p><p>Tatiana realized that war no longer scared her. This was new to her, the acknowledgment of the absence of fear. It was Pasha who had always been intrepid. Dasha was confident. Deda was ruthlessly honest, Papa was strict \u2014 and drunk \u2014 Mama bossy, and Babushka Anna arrogant. Tatiana carried everyone\u2019s hidden insecurities on her thin shoulders. Insecurities, yes. Timidity, yes. Their fears, yes again. But not her own. She wasn\u2019t afraid of random war. It was like being struck by lightning, even if the lightning did strike a thousand times a day. No, it wasn\u2019t war that terrified Tatiana. It was the resolute chaos of her broken heart.</p><p>She went to work, and when five o\u2019clock came, she stayed at work, and when six came, she stayed at work, and when seven came, she stayed at work. At eight o\u2019clock she was washing the floor in the nurses\u2019 station when she saw Marina come through the doors and head in her direction. Tatiana did not want to see Marina.</p><p>\u201cTania, what are you doing?\u201d Marina said. \u201cEverybody is worried sick about you. They think you\u2019ve been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been killed,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI\u2019m right here, washing the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s three hours past quitting time. Why aren\u2019t you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m washing the floor, Marina, can\u2019t you see? Step out of my way. Your shoes will get wet.\u201d Tatiana did not look up from the mop.</p><p>\u201cTania, they\u2019re all waiting. Dimitri is there, Alexander is there. You\u2019re being selfish. The family can\u2019t celebrate Dasha\u2019s betrothal, because they\u2019re so worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tatiana said through her teeth as she pushed the mop back and forth. \u201cYou found me. I\u2019m right here. Tell them not to worry and go and celebrate. I have work to do. I\u2019m doing a double shift. I\u2019ll be home later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d said Marina, \u201ccome on now, honey. I know it\u2019s hard. But you have to come home and raise a glass to your sister. What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working!\u201d Tatiana yelled. \u201cCan you leave me alone, please!\u201d And she looked back down at her soapy mop, blinded by her tears.</p><p>\u201cTania, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d repeated Tatiana. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Marina left.</p><p>Tatiana mopped the nurses\u2019 station, and the corridor nearby, and the bathrooms, and some of the patient rooms. And then a doctor asked her for help in bandaging five bomb victims, and Tatiana went with him. Four of the victims died within the hour. Tatiana sat with the last one, an old man of about eighty, until he died, too. He died holding her hand, and before he died, he turned to her and smiled.</p><p>By the time she came home, everyone was asleep, and Dimitri and Alexander were long gone. Tatiana slept on the small sofa in the hall, waking up before the rest of the family, washing, and again going to get their rations on Old Nevsky.</p><p>When she got home after work, Papa was in a fit. At first Tatiana couldn\u2019t figure out what it was that was making him upset, nor did she care to find out. As her father came into the room, still shouting, Tatiana concluded that he must be upset with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do now?\u201d she said tiredly. She couldn\u2019t have cared less.</p><p>He was slurring his words, but Mama, who was also angry \u2014 but sober \u2014 came in from the hallway and told Tatiana that last night when she was God knows where while the family was celebrating Dasha\u2019s imminent marriage, a little girl named Mariska came by, asking for some food. \u201cMariska said that someone named Tania has been feeding her for a week!\u201d Mama shouted. \u201cA week with our food!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tatiana looked at her parents. \u201cYes. Mariska\u2019s parents are both drunk, and they\u2019re not feeding her. She needed some food. I gave her a little. Mama, I thought we have plenty.\u201d She went into the kitchen to get a knife. Papa and Mama followed her, still shouting and shouting and shouting.</p><p>The following day Alexander and Dimitri came by after dinner to take the girls for a short walk before the air raid and curfew. Tatiana did not raise her eyes to Dimitri, nor to Dasha, and certainly not to Alexander.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you yesterday?\u201d Dimitri asked. \u201cWe were waiting forever for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was working yesterday,\u201d said Tatiana, grabbing her cardigan from the hook on the wall and walking out past Alexander, her eyes to the floor.</p><p>It was quiet in Leningrad that evening. The four of them walked in peace down Suvorovsky heading toward Tauride Park. Relative peace, for on Eighth Soviet a corner building was shattered and glass was spread like fractured ice all over the street.</p><p>Dimitri and Tatiana walked in front of Alexander and Dasha. Dimitri asked why Tatiana kept staring at the ground. Tatiana shrugged and said nothing, her growing-out blonde hair covering half her face.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it fantastic about Alexander and Dasha?\u201d Dimitri asked, putting his arm around Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana coldly and loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic about Alexander and Dasha.\u201d She did not look up, nor did she look back. She could feel Alexander\u2019s eyes on her, and she simply did not know how she was going to continue walking straight.</p><p>Dasha giggled and said, \u201cI sent Deda and Babushka a letter in Molotov. They\u2019ll be so happy. They\u2019ve always liked you, Alexander.\u201d There were some chuckling noises from behind Tatiana. She stumbled on the curb. Dimitri grabbed her arm.</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cTania is a little glum these days, Dima. I think she wants you to propose, too.\u201d</p><p>Squeezing her arm, Dimitri said, \u201cShould I, Tanechka? What do you think? Should I ask you to marry me?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana did not reply. They stopped at an intersection to let a tram pass. Tatiana said, \u201cWant to hear a joke?\u201d She continued before anyone had a chance to speak. \u201c \u2018Honey, when we get married, I\u2019ll be there to share all your troubles and sorrows,\u2019 says the man. \u2018But I don\u2019t have any, my love,\u2019 says the woman. \u2018I said, when we get married,\u2019 says the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nice, Tania,\u201d said Dasha from behind.</p><p>Tatiana laughed mirthlessly, and when she laughed, her hair bobbed back just long enough to reveal a black swollen bruise over her eyebrow. Dimitri gasped. Tatiana lowered her head, brushing her hair back into her face. Alexander said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Dima?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri didn\u2019t reply, but Alexander walked around and stood in front of Tatiana. She looked down at the pavement. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cCan you look up, please?\u201d Alexander demanded.</p><p>Tatiana wanted to look up and scream. But Dasha was standing on one side of her and Dimitri on the other, and she could not look up into the face she loved. Simply could not. The best she could do was repeat quietly that it was nothing.</p><p>\u201cAh, Tania,\u201d said Alexander, paling under the effort of keeping himself in check. \u201cAh, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s totally her fault,\u201d said Dasha, taking Alexander\u2019s arm. \u201cShe perfectly well knew that Papa was drunk. Yet she couldn\u2019t help talking back to him. He yelled at her a little bit for feeding a waif\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe yelled at me for Mariska, but he hit me for not washing his sheets,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cWhich was your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he open your brow like that?\u201d Dimitri asked with concern.</p><p>\u201cThat was my fault,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI lost my balance and fell. The kitchen drawer was open. It\u2019s not a big thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Tania,\u201d Alexander repeated again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d said Tatiana, raising her livid, broken eyes at him.</p><p>He lowered his gaze.</p><p>\u201cHey, listen,\u201d Dasha said, defending herself, \u201cI didn\u2019t care what Papa said. He was drunk. I wasn\u2019t going to get into a fight with him over nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean over me?\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cYou mean you weren\u2019t going to come forward and say, \u2018Papa, I should\u2019ve washed your sheets, and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for? He was drunk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always drunk!\u201d yelled Tatiana. \u201cAlways, and it\u2019s war, Dasha! Have we not got enough trouble, you think?\u201d She panted. \u201cBelieve me, we\u2019ve got enough trouble.\u201d She stared at her sister. \u201cForget it. Let\u2019s cross.\u201d</p><p>As they crossed the street, Tatiana could hear Alexander\u2019s seething breaths. \u201cDasha, let\u2019s go,\u201d he said suddenly, pulling her quickly by the arm down the street, away from Tatiana. He started running with Dasha beside him.</p><p>Dimitri and Tatiana were left on Suvorovsky, and Tatiana said, trying to smile, \u201cSo, Dima, how are you? I hear the Germans are completely entrenched. Has the fighting stopped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, you don\u2019t want to be talking about the fighting,\u201d said Dimitri.</p><p>\u201cNo, I do, I do. Tell me, is it true that Hitler has issued a directive to his men that Leningrad is to be wiped off the face of the earth?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, Dimitri said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Alexander about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard\u2014\u201d but then Tatiana stopped and realized something. \u201cYou know what, Dima? I think we better head back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to head back to the barracks. You don\u2019t mind, do you? I\u2019ve got\u201d \u2014 he paused \u2014 \u201cthings to do. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Dima,\u201d said Tatiana, staring at him standing next to her in his helpless, distant, pointless proximity. Could other people have interested him less? Tatiana didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to come by again,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cI hear my platoon is being sent over the river. I\u2019ll come by when I\u2019m back. If I\u2019m back. I\u2019ll write if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tatiana said good-bye to Dimitri on the street corner, watching him as he walked away from her. She didn\u2019t think she would be seeing him again soon.</p><p>She went home by herself, and when she was near her apartment building, she saw Alexander run out the front doors. She was maybe ten meters away from him. He stood for a moment trying to get his breath, and then saw her stopped dead on the pavement. Tatiana\u2019s control over herself was so fragile that she knew she could not face him. She turned around and started walking quickly in the opposite direction. \u201cTania!\u201d she heard him calling from behind, and in a moment he stood in front of her. Tatiana backed away and put her arms up. \u201cLeave me alone,\u201d she said in a faint voice. \u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Alexander asked quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming to the store on Fontanka and Nekrasova for three mornings in a row trying to catch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you caught me, all right,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cTania, look at you, how could you let him do that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ask myself that question over and over,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cAnd not just about him.\u201d</p><p>Alexander blinked. \u201cTania\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you right now!\u201d Tatiana screamed. And then, taking another step back, her lip shaking and her eyes filled with tears, she said, much more quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, can I just explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you for a second\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d She came up to him, her teeth gritted, and she couldn\u2019t believe herself: she wanted to hit him. She clenched her fists. She wanted to hit Alexander.</p><p>He stared at her fists and at her and said with upset incredulity, \u201cYou promised me you would forgive me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive you,\u201d Tatiana hissed through her teeth, tears streaming down her face, \u201cfor your brave and indifferent face, Alexander!\u201d She groaned in pain. \u201cNot your brave and indifferent heart.\u201d</p><p>Before he had a chance to respond or to stop her, Tatiana ran from him, through the doors, flying up three flights of stairs to her apartment.</p><p>At home Papa was lying on the floor in the hallway, still drunk, but also unconscious. Mama and Dasha were crying in the room. Oh, my God, thought Tatiana, wiping her own face. Will this never end?</p><p>Marina whispered to Tatiana, \u201cTania, what a mess! You cannot believe the things Alexander said when he stormed in here. Look what he did to the wall!\u201d She pointed with a thrill to some broken plaster in the hallway. \u201cAlexander said that with his drinking your Papa had turned his back on his family just when they needed him most. That he had failed in his responsibilities to the people he was supposed to protect, not harm. Alexander was like a growling tank!\u201d Marina said, looking extremely impressed. \u201cHe said, \u2018Where can she go if outside the Nazis are bombing her, and inside her own father is trying to kill her?\u2019 Tania, he was unstoppable!\u201d Marina exclaimed. \u201cHe told your mother to put your father in the hospital. He said, \u2018You are a mother, for God\u2019s sake \u2014 save your children!\u2019 \u201d Tatiana lowered her eyes away from Marina. \u201cYour father was very drunk and went to hit him, and Alexander grabbed him by both shoulders and shoved him against the wall and cursed and screamed and then stormed out. How he didn\u2019t kill him, I swear I don\u2019t know. Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can believe it,\u201d Tatiana whispered. Alexander carried his own father with him wherever he went. He carried his own father, his own mother, his own self. Tatiana was the only person in the world he trusted, and so she bore some of that cross with him. Not much of it, but just enough to remember him at this time. For a moment \u2014 but it was all that she needed \u2014 Tatiana stopped feeling for herself and felt for Alexander, and when she did, she became less angry with him.</p><p>\u201cHas he just passed out?\u201d Tatiana said, sitting down on the sofa and looking at her father.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think he fell from fear. Tania, did you hear me? Alexander looked ready to kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania,\u201d said Marina, lowering her voice to a whisper in the hallway, two meters away from one room, three meters away from another. \u201cTania, whatever are you two going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI, for one, am going to try to help Papa.\u201d</p><p>Papa remained unconscious, and the Metanovs became worried. Mama suggested that maybe they really should put Papa in the hospital for a few days to sober up. Tatiana thought it was a good idea. Papa had not been sober for many days.</p><p>Tatiana asked Petr Petrov down the hall for help with carrying Papa to the drunk ward at Suvorovsky Hospital. There were no beds available at Grechesky, where Tatiana worked.</p><p>The girls and Petr carried Papa to the hospital \u2014 on the north side of an east-west street \u2014 where he was admitted and put into a large room with four other drunk men. Tatiana asked for a sponge and some water and washed her father\u2019s face, and then sat with him for a few minutes, holding his flaccid hand. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Papa,\u201d she said.</p><p>She sat with him, holding his hand, every once in a while squeezing it and saying, \u201cPapa, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Finally he groaned in a way that told her maybe he could. He opened his unfocused eyes.</p><p>\u201cRight here, Papa,\u201d she kept saying. \u201cI\u2019m right here. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>His head bobbed on the pillow. She continued to hold his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re in the hospital for just a few days. Until you get sober. Then you\u2019ll come home. Everything will be all right then.\u201d Tatiana felt him squeeze her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to bring Pasha back for you. But you know, the rest of us are all still here.\u201d</p><p>She saw tears in his eyes. His mouth opened as he squeezed her hand again, whispering hoarsely, \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault . . .\u201d</p><p>Tatiana kissed him on the head and said, \u201cNo, darling Papa. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s just war. But you do need to get sober.\u201d He closed his eyes, and Tatiana went home.</p><p>At home Dasha was upset at Tatiana and shouted at her while Marina mediated. Tatiana sat on the sofa in the room and remained silent, imagining herself sitting peacefully between Deda and Babushka. At one point Dasha got herself so worked up that she leaned forward to hit Tatiana and was pulled away by Marina, who said, \u201cDasha, this is ridiculous. Stop it!\u201d</p><p>Dasha ripped herself from Marina\u2019s grasp, but Marina exclaimed, \u201cStop yourself. She is hurt enough! Can\u2019t you see she\u2019s hurt enough?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana watched Marina with soft eyes and Dasha with harder ones, and then she got up wearily and went to walk past them to the other room. She needed to lie down and never have another day like this one. Or like the last one. Or the one before. Dasha grabbed her. Tatiana twisted away, raised her face to her sister, and said, \u201cDasha, in one minute I\u2019m going to lose my patience. Stop and leave me alone. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes remained unblinking on her sister, who let go of her and left Tatiana alone.</p><p>Later that night in bed Marina stroked Tatiana\u2019s back, whispering, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Tania. It\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this how?\u201d Tatiana whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re bombed every day, we\u2019re blockaded, soon there will be no food, Papa can\u2019t stop drinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d whispered Marina.</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Tatiana whispered back, \u201cbut before you tell me, stop talking.\u201d</p><p>Dasha was not in bed.</p><p>Tatiana slept with her face to the wall, her hand on Alexander\u2019s The Bronze Horseman book, her brow throbbing. But in the morning it felt a little better. She dabbed some diluted iodine on the cut and went to work, her face discolored by the sienna antiseptic.</p><p>During her lunch hour she left the hospital and slowly walked to the Field of Mars. It had been made unrecognizable by the trenches dug around it and the concrete emplacements for artillery weapons erected around the perimeter. The field itself was mined; she could not walk there. All the benches had been removed. The only thing Tatiana could do was stand several hundred meters from the archway that led to Pavlov Barracks and watch smoking, laughing soldiers loudly filtering out.</p><p>She stood for half an hour. Then she went back to the hospital, thinking, not bombs nor my broken heart can take away from me walking barefoot with you in jasmine June through the Field of Mars. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>7</p><p>That evening during the post-dinner bombing show the Suvorovsky Hospital where Papa lay was hit.</p><p>Three bombs fell on the hospital, which caught fire and burned into the night, despite the efforts of the firefighters. The hospital was not made of brick, which resisted fire, but of wattle and daub, the early-eighteenth-century material out of which most of Leningrad was built. The whole building collapsed onto itself, then went up in flames. The few people who were able to move jumped from the windows, screaming as they fell.</p><p>Papa, at forty-three years old, having been born in the previous century, wasted on remorse, unable to sober up, never rose from his bed.</p> <p>Dasha and Tatiana and Marina and Mama ran down Suvorovsky and watched with unsteady, horrified impotence as the inferno conquered the firemen, the water hoses, the building, the night.</p><p>The girls helped to throw useless buckets of water on the ground-floor windows. They got sand from the rooftops of the surrounding buildings, but it was all just meaningless movement sustained by inertia. Tatiana wrapped charred bodies in wet sheets provided by Grechesky Hospital. She stayed until morning. Dasha and Marina went back home with Mama.</p><p>Only a handful of people had made it out alive. The firemen could not even find Papa\u2019s body and made no apologies as they put out the last of the flames. They were not taking bodies out of that hospital. \u201cLook at the building, girlie,\u201d said one fireman. \u201cDoes it look like we can get anything out? It\u2019s all cinder. Once it cools down, you\u2019ll be able to touch it and watch it turn to black ash.\u201d He patted her absentmindedly on the shoulder. \u201cTime to let go. Your father, is it? F*cking Germans. Comrade Stalin is right. Don\u2019t know how, but we\u2019re going to bring it all home to them.\u201d</p><p>As Tatiana walked slowly home at dawn, she thought of herself being buried beneath Luga station, feeling life ooze out of the three people she had crawled under. She hoped Papa had never woken up, never suffered.</p><p>At home she silently got the family\u2019s ration cards \u2014 all except Papa\u2019s \u2014 and went out to get bread.</p> <p>If life in the two communal rooms was difficult for Tatiana before, it became nearly impossible after the death of her father.</p><p>Mama was inconsolable and not talking to Tatiana.</p><p>Dasha was angry and not talking to Tatiana.</p><p>Tatiana wasn\u2019t sure if Dasha was angry because of Papa or if Dasha was angry because of Alexander. Dasha was certainly not saying. She wasn\u2019t talking to Tatiana at all.</p><p>Marina visited her mother daily in Vyborg and continued to level her understanding eyes on Tatiana.</p><p>And Babushka painted. She painted an apple pie that Tatiana said looked good enough to eat.</p> <p>A few days after Papa\u2019s death Dasha asked Tatiana to come with her to the barracks to tell Alexander about what had happened. Tatiana dragged Marina along for strength. She wanted to see him, and yet . . . there was so little to say. Or was there too much to say? Tatiana wasn\u2019t sure, couldn\u2019t figure it out without Alexander\u2019s help, and was afraid to face him.</p><p>Alexander was not at the barracks, and neither was Dimitri. Anatoly Marazov came into the passageway and introduced himself.</p><p>Tatiana knew of him well from Alexander. \u201cIsn\u2019t Dimitri under your command?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, he is under Sergeant Kashnikov, who has one of the platoons under my command, but they\u2019ve all been sent by powers higher than me to Tikhvin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTikhvin? On the other side of the river?\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cYes, in a barge across Ladoga. Not enough men up in Tikhvin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Alexander, too?\u201d Tatiana said, short of breath.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s up at Karelia,\u201d Marazov replied, looking Tatiana over appreciatively. \u201cSo are you the girl?\u201d Marazov smiled. \u201cThe girl he\u2019s forsaken all others for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot her,\u201d Dasha said rudely, coming up to Tatiana. \u201cMe. I\u2019m Dasha. Don\u2019t you remember? We met in Sadko back in early June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha,\u201d mumbled Marazov. Tatiana paled, leaning harder against the wall. Marina stared at her.</p><p>Marazov turned to Tatiana. \u201cAnd what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d she said.</p><p>Marazov\u2019s eyes flared and then dimmed. Dasha asked, \u201cDo you know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ve never met,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cJust for a moment you looked as if you recognized my sister.\u201d</p><p>Marazov left his gaze on Tatiana. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said slowly, but his eyes flickered a confused familiarity at her. He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Alexander you stopped by. I\u2019m going to join him in Karelia in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please tell him that our father has died,\u201d Dasha said. Tatiana turned and walked out of the passageway, pulling Marina with her.</p><p>The family was split apart like faulted earth. Mama could not move from her bed. Babushka took care of her. Mama didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with Tatiana, or her apologies, or her pleas for forgiveness. Finally Tatiana stopped pleading.</p><p>The emptiness Tatiana felt overpowered her; the sense of guilt, the anchor of responsibility weighed her down. It wasn\u2019t my fault, it wasn\u2019t my fault, she kept repeating to herself in the mornings as she cut the bread, put some on her plate, and ate it silently. It would take her maybe thirty seconds to eat her share, and she would pick up all the little crumbs with her forefinger, and then she would turn the plate over and shake it onto the table. All that \u2014 thirty seconds. And thirty seconds of, it wasn\u2019t my fault, it wasn\u2019t my fault.</p><p>After Papa died, his half-kilo-a-day bread ration stopped. Mama finally thrust 200 rubles into Tatiana\u2019s hand and told her to go and buy some more food. She came back home, having spent the money on seven potatoes, three onions, half a kilo of flour, and a kilo of white bread, which was as rare as meat.</p><p>Tatiana continued to get the rations, and once or twice as she stood in line for their food, she thought with shame that if only they hadn\u2019t told the authorities immediately that Papa had died, they could still be getting his ration until the end of September.</p><p>She thought it with shame, but she did not stop thinking it.</p><p>Because when September turned into October, and the rawness of her sorrow dulled yet the emptiness remained, Tatiana realized that the emptiness was not sorrow but hunger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>NIGHT SANK DOWN</p><p>EVEN during the warm months of the summer, the air in Leningrad carried a vague chill, as if the Arctic constantly reminded the northern city that winter and darkness were only a few hundred kilometers away. The wind carried ice in it, even in the pale nights of July. But now that October was here, now that the flat and forlorn city was shelled every day and stood barren and silent at night, the air wasn\u2019t just cold, and the wind carried on its breath more than the Arctic. It carried a distinct sense of desperation, a harried hopelessness. Tatiana bundled herself into a gray coat and put Pasha\u2019s old gray hat with earmuffs on her head and wrapped a ripped brown scarf around her neck and mouth, but she couldn\u2019t protect her nose from breathing in the icy daggers.</p><p>The bread ration had been reduced again, to 300 grams each for Tatiana, Mama, and Dasha and 200 grams each for Babushka and Marina. Less than a kilo and a half for all of them.</p><p>Besides bread, the stores weren\u2019t giving out or selling anything else. There were no eggs, no butter, no white bread, no cheese, no meat of any kind, no sugar, no oatmeal, no barley, no fruit, no vegetables. Once in early October, Tatiana bought three onions and made onion soup. It was fairly good. It would have been better with more salt, but Tatiana was very careful with her salt.</p> <p>The family hung on to their supplies of food, but every night they had to open a can of ham, saying a short word of thanks to Deda. They had to stop cooking it outside in the kitchen because the smell from the ham would permeate the communal apartment, and frequently Sarkova and Slavin and the Petrovs would come to the kitchen, stand near the stove, and say to Tatiana, \u201cYou think maybe there\u2019s a little for us?\u201d</p><p>Slavin would emit cackling noises as Dasha sent them all back to their rooms, cackling noises simmering with unrepressed glee. \u201cThat\u2019s right, eat the ham, girlie-burlie. Eat that ham. Because I just got the latest report, straight from the F\u00fchrer himself. Herr Hitler plans to coincide his troop withdrawal from Leningrad with your last can of ham.\u201d He laughed hysterically. \u201cOr haven\u2019t you heard?\u201d</p><p>The Metanovs bought a small freestanding cast-iron stove called a bourzhuika, which had an exhaust flue that Tatiana stretched to a small framed opening in the windowpane. The flat iron surface of the bourzhuika served as the cooktop. Only a little wood was needed to fire up the stove; the problem was that it only warmed up a small section of the room.</p><p>Alexander was still away in Karelia. Dimitri was in Tikhvin. No one had heard from either of them.</p><p>In the second week of October, Anton finally got his wish. A fragmentation bomb split over Grechesky, and a piece of metal flew from the sky, hitting Anton and slicing his leg. Tatiana wasn\u2019t on the roof. After Tatiana found out, she secretly brought a can of ham to Anton, and he ate the whole thing by himself in ravenous gulps. \u201cAnton,\u201d Tatiana said, \u201cwhat about your Mama?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe eats at work,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has soup. She has oatmeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Kirill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him, Tania?\u201d Anton snapped impatiently. \u201cDid you bring it for Kirill or for me?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t like the way Mariska was looking. Her curly hair started to fall out. Every day Tatiana secretly made Mariska oatmeal. But she knew she couldn\u2019t continue to feed Mariska; Tatiana\u2019s family was already unhappy with her. The oatmeal had a bit of salt and sugar, but it had no butter or milk. It wasn\u2019t oatmeal, it was gruel. Mariska would eat it as if it were her last meal. Finally Tatiana took her to the children\u2019s ward in Grechesky Hospital, carrying her for the last block.</p><p>When Tatiana was younger, she would sometimes forget to eat for half a day. And then suddenly remembering, she would say, \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m STAR-ving.\u201d An empty rumbling stomach, a salivating mouth. She would devour soup or pie or mashed potatoes, gorge herself, fall away from the table, and then she wouldn\u2019t be STAR-ving anymore.</p><p>This feeling that Tatiana experienced, faintly at the end of September, more distinctly at the beginning of October, was similar in that she had the empty rumbling stomach, she had the salivating mouth. She would devour the clear soup, the black thick mud bread, the oats, and when she was done, she would fall away from the table and realize she was still STAR-ving. She would have some of the crackers she had toasted. But the cracker bag was diminishing in size by the hour. The nights were just too long after work. Dasha and Mama began to take some crackers with them in their coat pockets on the way to work. First a couple, then more and more. Babushka nibbled on crackers all day while she painted or read. Marina took some crackers to university and some for her dying mother.</p> <p>After they bought the bourzhuika, Mama gave Tatiana the rest of her money \u2014 500 rubles \u2014 one cold morning and told her to go to the commercial store and buy anything she could get her hands on. The commercial store near St. Nicholas\u2019s Cathedral was far, and when Tatiana got there, she found a double irony. Not only was the store bombed out and abandoned, but there was a sign on the crushed window dated September 18 \u2014 NO FOOD LEFT.</p><p>Slowly she went home. September 18, four weeks ago, Papa still alive, Dasha planning to marry.</p><p>Marry Alexander.</p><p>At home Mama didn\u2019t believe Tatiana about the store and went to hit her in frustration and stopped herself, which Tatiana found so miraculous that she went to her mother, hugged her and said, \u201cMamochka, don\u2019t worry about anything. I will take care of you.\u201d Tatiana gave Mama back her money, put the ration bread on the table, taking just a small piece for herself, and swallowed it ravenously while she walked slowly to the hospital, thinking about nothing but lunchtime, when she would get her soup and maybe some oatmeal, too. Tatiana thought about little else but food. The acute hunger she experienced from morning until night defeated most other feelings in her body. While walking to Fontanka she thought about her bread, and while she worked she thought about lunch, and in the afternoon she thought about dinner, and after dinner she thought about the piece of cracker she could have before she went to bed.</p><p>And in bed Tatiana thought about Alexander.</p><p>Once Marina offered to get the rations instead of Tatiana.</p><p>Puzzled, Tatiana gave her the ration cards. \u201cWant my company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Marina said. \u201cI\u2019ll be glad to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Marina came back to her waiting family and put the bread on the table. There was maybe half a kilo.</p><p>\u201cMarina,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cwhere is the rest of the bread?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Marina said. \u201cI ate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ate a kilo of our bread?\u201d Tatiana did not believe it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was very hungry.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana looked at Marina in sharp surprise. For six weeks Tatiana had been going to get her family rations, and it had never even entered her head to eat the bread five people were waiting for.</p><p>And through it all Tatiana was STAR-ving.</p><p>And through it all she missed Alexander. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>One morning in the middle of October, as Tatiana neared the Fontanka embankment, feeling in her coat pocket for the ration cards, she saw an officer up ahead, and through her bleary, early-morning haze she wanted him to look like Alexander. She came closer. It couldn\u2019t be him, this man, looking much older, grimy, his trench coat and rifle covered in mud. Carefully she moved forward. It was Alexander.</p><p>When she came up to him and looked into his face, she saw sadness mixed with bleak affection. Tatiana came a little closer. Her gloved hand touched his chest. \u201cShura, whatever happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania,\u201d he said. \u201cForget about me. Look how thin you are. Your face, it\u2019s . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been thin. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your lovely round face,\u201d he said, his voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cThat was a different life, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cHow was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrutal,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cLook. Look at what I brought you.\u201d He opened his black rucksack, from which he pulled out a hunk of white bread and, wrapped in white paper, cheese! Cheese and a piece of cold pork meat. Tatiana stared at the food, breathing shallowly. \u201cOh, my,\u201d she said. \u201cWait till they see. They\u2019ll be so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Alexander said, giving her the white bread and the cheese. \u201cBut before they see, I want you to eat it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can and you will. What? Don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying,\u201d said Tatiana, trying very hard not to cry. \u201cI\u2019m just very . . . moved.\u201d She took the bread and the cheese and the pork and gulped down the food while he watched her with his molten copper eyes, warm, full of Alexander. \u201cShura,\u201d she said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how hungry I\u2019ve been. I don\u2019t even know how to explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they feeding you better in the army?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They feed the front-line troops adequately. They feed the officers a little better. What they don\u2019t give me, I buy. We get the food before it gets to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be,\u201d said Tatiana, her mouth so full, so happy.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cSlow down. You\u2019re going to give yourself a terrible stomachache.\u201d</p><p>She slowed down \u2014 a little. Smiling back \u2014 a little.</p><p>\u201cFor the family I brought some butter and a bag of white flour,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cAnd twenty eggs. When was the last time you had eggs?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana remembered. \u201cSeptember fifteenth. Let me have a little piece of butter now,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you wait with me? Or do you have to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see you,\u201d he said.</p><p>They stood looking at each other without touching.</p><p>They stood looking at each other without talking.</p> <p>At last Alexander whispered, \u201cToo much to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough time to say any of it,\u201d said Tatiana, looking at the long line of people in the store. She had stopped eating. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you,\u201d she said, keeping her voice calm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about me again,\u201d said Alexander with resigned finality.</p><p>Tatiana backed away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ve made it very clear that that\u2019s certainly what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He looked at her in confusion. \u201cYou have no idea what it\u2019s like out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only know what it\u2019s like in here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all dying. Even the ranking officers.\u201d Alexander paused. \u201cGrinkov died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s get in line.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was the only man getting rations. They stood together for forty-five minutes. It was quiet in the crowded store; no one else spoke. And they couldn\u2019t stop. They talked about public things: the cold weather, the waiting Germans, the food. But they couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, we have to get more food from somewhere. I don\u2019t mean me, I mean Leningrad. Where is it going to come from? Can\u2019t they fly some in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are already. Fifty tons a day of food, fuel, munitions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty tons . . .\u201d Tatiana thought. \u201cThat sounds like a lot.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer, she asked, \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>She could tell that Alexander was trying not to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d he replied at last.</p><p>\u201cNot enough by how much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said with mock cheeriness, \u201cI think that it must be good enough. Fifty tons. Sounds tremendous. I\u2019m glad you told me, because Nina has nothing for her family\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Alexander exclaimed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Tatiana said sweetly. \u201cNina doesn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty tons sounds like a lot to you, does it?\u201d he said. \u201cPavlov, our city food chief, is feeding three million people on a thousand tons of flour a day. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat he is giving us now amounts to a thousand tons?\u201d Tatiana said, startled.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander replied, shaking his head and looking at her with uneasy dismay.</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re bringing only fifty tons by plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes again. Fifty tons of not just flour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is the remaining nine hundred fifty tons getting here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLake Ladoga. Thirty kilometers north of the blockade line. Barges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cbut these thousand tons, if we didn\u2019t have our own supplies, we wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. We couldn\u2019t live on what they give us.\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Tatiana stared at him and then turned her head away. She wanted to go home instantly and count how many cans of ham they had left.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t they fly more planes in?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause all the planes in the army are being directed to the Battle of Moscow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Battle of Leningrad?\u201d Tatiana said faintly, not expecting an answer and not getting one.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the blockade will be lifted before the winter?\u201d she said in a small voice. \u201cThe radio reports keep saying we\u2019re trying to establish a foothold here, make a break there, pontoon bridges. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t answer, and Tatiana didn\u2019t look at him again until they left the store.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming home with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Tania,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI\u2019m coming home with you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cCome on then. With the butter you gave me, I\u2019ll make nice hot oatmeal for breakfast. I\u2019ll make you some eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have oatmeal left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I will say that it\u2019s getting harder and harder to keep them all away from the food between meals. I think Babushka and Marina are the biggest culprits. I think they eat the oatmeal uncooked right out of the bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, Tatia?\u201d Alexander asked. \u201cDo you eat oatmeal right out of the bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d replied Tatiana. She didn\u2019t mention how badly she wanted to. How she put her face inside the oat bag and smelled its sickly, slightly moldy aroma, wishing for butter and for sugar and for milk, and for eggs.</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>They walked slowly along the misty Fontanka Canal. It reminded Tatiana a little of Obvodnoy Canal during their Kirov summer days. Her heart hurt. Three blocks away from home, they both slowed down, then stopped and leaned against the cold building. \u201cI wish there were a bench,\u201d Tatiana said quietly.</p><p>Just as quietly, Alexander said, \u201cMarazov told me about your father.\u201d When Tatiana didn\u2019t answer, he continued. \u201cI am really sorry.\u201d Pause. \u201cWill you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing to forgive,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my helplessness,\u201d Alexander continued, his eyes filling with loud frustration. \u201cThere\u2019s just nothing I can do to protect you. And I tried. I tried from the very beginning. Remember Kirov?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana remembered.</p><p>\u201cAll I wanted then was for you to leave Leningrad. I failed there. Failed to protect you against your father.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHow is your brow feeling?\u201d He reached out and touched the healing bruise with his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Tatiana said, moving away from him. Alexander put his hands down, looking at her with rebuke.</p><p>\u201cHow is Dimitri?\u201d she asked. \u201cHave you heard from him?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Alexander said, \u201cWhat can I tell you about Dimitri? When I first went to Shlisselburg in mid-September, I said, come with me, come with my command. He refused. He said we were too unprotected there. All right, I said. Then I volunteered myself and a battalion of soldiers to go to Karelia and push the Finns back a bit.\u201d He paused. \u201cTo give our trucks breathing room as they brought food from Ladoga to Leningrad. The Finns were just too close. The skirmishes that flared up between them and the gun-happy NKVD border troops constantly resulted in the death of some poor hapless truck driver, who was just trying to get food into the city. I told Dimitri to come with me. Yes, it\u2019s dangerous, I said. Yes, it\u2019s attacking enemy territory, but if we succeed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be heroes,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cHave you succeeded?\u201d</p><p>Quietly Alexander said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head in wonder, Tatiana gazed up at him. She hoped it was not blatantly obvious what she was feeling at that moment. \u201cYou volunteered for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they promote you at least?\u201d</p><p>He saluted her lightly and said, \u201cI\u2019m now Captain Belov. And see my new medal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, stop it!\u201d she exclaimed, her mouth melting into a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Alexander asked, his eyes roaming all over her face. \u201cWhat? Are you . . . proud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Tatiana said, trying to stop smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhich was my whole point with Dima,\u201d continued Alexander. \u201cIf it worked out, he could have become a corporal. The higher up you go, the farther from the front line you are.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Tatiana said, \u201cHe is so shortsighted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd worse,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cBecause now he has been sent along with Kashnikov to Tikhvin. Marazov followed me. Became first lieutenant. But Dima was transported in a barge across Ladoga, and he is now part of tens of thousands of men, one and all cannon fodder for Schmidt.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana had heard about the town of Tikhvin. The Soviets took Tikhvin from the Germans in September and were now fiercely struggling to hold on to it, to allow themselves a continuous railroad passage to the Ladoga food barges. Without Lake Ladoga there would be no food getting into Leningrad at all.</p><p>She had long ago stopped smiling. Carefully she said, \u201cI wish you had succeeded with Dimitri. A promotion would have been good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe if he had become a hero,\u201d Tatiana went on evenly, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have to marry my sister.\u201d</p><p>His face falling, Alexander said, \u201cOh, Tatia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut as it is,\u201d she continued loudly, interrupting him, \u201cyou\u2019re a captain, and he\u2019s in Tikhvin. You\u2019ll have to marry Dasha now, won\u2019t you?\u201d She stared at him unremittingly.</p><p>Alexander rubbed his eyes with his blackened hands. Tatiana had never seen him so unclean. She had forgotten all about him, so busy was she thinking all about herself. \u201cOh, Shura. What am I doing?\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Come home. Look at you. Come. You\u2019ll wash.\u201d She said softly, \u201cYou can have a hot bath. I\u2019ll boil the water for you. I\u2019ll make you nice oatmeal. Come on.\u201d She wanted to add darling but didn\u2019t dare. Marry Dasha, Tatiana almost wanted to say. Marry her if it helps you live.</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t move from the wall.</p><p>\u201cPlease come, Shura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He bit his lip. \u201cAre you upset with me because of your father?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t fight, he didn\u2019t argue, he didn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t his fault. He just accepted responsibility and went on, as if it now was just another burden to be carried on his shoulders. Well, his shoulders were wide enough for several burdens, including some of Tatiana\u2019s, and, oddly, to see him square his chest made her own lighter. Relief came at Alexander\u2019s expense, but it was welcome relief nonetheless. She wanted comfort? There it was.</p><p>\u201cNo, Shura,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cNo one is upset. They\u2019ll be overjoyed you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>Alexander raised his eyes to her. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask about them. Are you upset with me?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana looked at him with compassion. Underneath his battle armor, the man who commanded an armored battalion needed her. If he was wounded, she could bandage him. If he was hungry, she could feed him. If he wanted to talk to her, there she was. But now her Alexander was sad. She wanted to tell him that it wasn\u2019t for her father she was upset with him. But she couldn\u2019t, because all she wanted was to give him comfort back. She didn\u2019t want him to be sad for another moment.</p><p>Reaching out, Tatiana took hold of his hand. He had dirt under his nails and bloody scratches, but his hand was warm and strong, and it squeezed hers gratefully.</p><p>\u201cNo, Shura,\u201d she said tenderly. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m not upset with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to be safe,\u201d he said, his back to the wall. \u201cThat\u2019s all. Safe from everything.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana came into Alexander\u2019s arms. \u201cI know. I\u2019m going to be just fine,\u201d she said into his coat, feeling so happy to be hugging him that she was afraid of falling down. Brushing the hair away from her forehead, Alexander pressed his lips to her healing brow and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t back away from me like before when I touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tatiana murmured, her eyes closed and her arms tight around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>3</p><p>\u201cLook who I found!\u201d Tatiana exclaimed as Alexander walked in behind her. Dasha shrieked, running to him.</p><p>Tatiana went to put the water on to boil for his bath. She found soap for him, and fresh towels, and a razor, and Alexander went and had a hot bath.</p><p>\u201cIs it warm enough?\u201d she called to him from the kitchen, boiling more water, just in case.</p> <p>His laughing voice carried from the bathroom. \u201cNo, not at all. Come, bring me another jug. Come in here, Tania.\u201d</p><p>Blushing and smiling, Tatiana went and asked Dasha to bring Alexander another jug of boiling water.</p><p>He came inside the room all scrubbed and flushed and clean-shaven, so warm, his black hair so damp and shiny, his teeth so white, his mouth so moist that Tatiana didn\u2019t know how she kept from flinging her arms around him. While he sat in his long johns and thermal shirt, Dasha went to wash his uniform. Marina, Babushka, and Tatiana clucked around him; everyone did except surly Mama.</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t tell Mama she had eggs. She was going to, but when she saw that Mama was not prepared to forgive Alexander for yelling at her and Papa, Tatiana was not prepared to share eggs with her. Forgiveness had to come first.</p><p>Alexander had given them a kilo of butter. Tania hid it under the sack of flour on the windowsill. Mama had a weak cup of tea with some bread and butter, gruffly thanked Alexander, and went to work.</p> <p>Babushka took some silverware, some silver candlesticks, some money, old blankets off the bed, and stuffed them all into a sack as she, too, got ready to leave.</p><p>Tatiana had to go and cook breakfast, but she remained in the room, sitting quietly in a chair, staring at Alexander.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she going?\u201d Alexander inquired.</p><p>\u201cOh, across the Aleksandr Nevsky Bridge to Malaya Ochta,\u201d said Dasha, coming into the room. Tatiana quickly lowered her gaze. \u201cShe\u2019s got friends there,\u201d Dasha continued, \u201cand she trades our things for potatoes or carrots. She was good to them when things were good, and now they\u2019re good to her when things are not. Your clothes won\u2019t dry for a while,\u201d she said to Alexander, smiling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, smiling back. \u201cI don\u2019t have to report to base for four days. Will they be dry by then?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s heart skipped with joy. Four days of Alexander!</p> <p>\u201cTania, are you going to go and make breakfast?\u201d Dasha asked, leaving again. Marina was in the other room, getting ready to go to university.</p><p>Alexander turned to Tatiana. \u201cTatiasha,\u201d he said, \u201ccan I have some tea?\u201d</p><p>Instantly she got up from the table. What was she thinking, sitting around? He must be so tired, so hungry. \u201cOf course.\u201d He was sitting and smoking, with his long legs stretching across the floor all the way to the couch. There was no room for Tatiana to walk past, and Alexander wasn\u2019t moving his legs. Tatiana stared at him. He was smiling.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana said quietly, trying very hard to keep a straight face.</p><p>\u201cStep over them,\u201d he said, lowering his voice. \u201cJust take care not to trip. Because then I\u2019d have to catch you.\u201d</p><p>Turning red, Tatiana raised her eyes and saw Marina watching her from the door. \u201cExcuse me, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana repeated, keeping her breathy voice even.</p><p>Reluctantly Alexander moved his legs. \u201cCome here, Marina,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cLet me take a look at you. How have you been keeping?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana brought Alexander a cup of tea, making it nice and strong and sweet for him, just the way he liked it. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, looking up at her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She gazed down at him.</p><p>\u201cMy legs still in your way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re too large for this room,\u201d Tatiana whispered.</p><p>Before he could reply, Dasha came back with some clean sheets. \u201cGirls, how does your Babushka do across the Neva?\u201d Alexander asked, taking his tea and looking away from Tatiana.</p><p>Folding sheets and putting them away, Dasha said, \u201cYesterday she brought five turnips and ten potatoes. But all of Mama\u2019s wedding dishes are now gone. After these candlesticks, I don\u2019t know what else she\u2019ll have to sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about those gold teeth you took from the dentist, Dasha?\u201d Tatiana asked. \u201cWould the farmers like some gold?\u201d She sat down at the table next to the wall, her back to Dasha, her eyes to Alexander.</p><p>\u201cWhat could they possibly do with gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would they do with candlesticks?\u201d</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cAh, have light. Have heat. Use them as weapons against the Germans.\u201d He turned to Tatiana. \u201cTania . . .\u201d He smiled. \u201cWhere is this promised oatmeal? Where are those promised eggs?\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the front door, and Tatiana went to answer it. It was Nina Iglenko wanting to know if they had any extra anything she could give Anton. Tatiana knew that Nina was having a hard time sustaining him on a dependent\u2019s ration after he was wounded on the roof. Alexander came out to the hallway, enormous and imposing, standing next to her small, sweater-wrapped body. His arm pressing into Tatiana\u2019s arm, Alexander said, \u201cComrade Iglenko, everyone collects the same dependent ration. I\u2019m sorry, we have nothing.\u201d And he shut the door, turning to Tatiana. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that Anton got wounded on the roof.\u201d He was still very close to her. Not only could she smell him, breathe him, inhale him, but in one moment his chest would touch her face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Tatiana said in a dismissive tone, trying not to breathe erratically. \u201cIt\u2019s just a scratch on his leg.\u201d She didn\u2019t want Alexander to worry.</p><p>\u201cTania, did you know that everyone collects the same dependent ration?\u201d Alexander said pointedly, edging forward and scaring Tatiana into the coat-rack.</p><p>\u201cI heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any more than Nina does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Excuse me. I have to go and make you breakfast.\u201d Tatiana couldn\u2019t spend another second standing with him in the narrow hallway while he was wearing his long johns. She walked out and caught up with Nina in the corridor, handing her a hunk of the butter.</p><p>\u201cGod bless you, Tanechka,\u201d said Nina. \u201cGod bless you as long as you live. You\u2019ll see. He will protect you all your life for your kind heart.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana returned to the kitchen and was making eggs and oatmeal, when Alexander came in and leaned against the stove, facing her.</p><p>\u201cCareful, your back will get burned,\u201d said Tatiana, not looking at him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything at first, but then a fierce whisper came out of him. \u201cTania, better than anyone else, I know what you are. I know what you\u2019re doing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m making oatmeal. And eggs.\u201d</p><p>Alexander put his finger under her chin and turned her face up to him. \u201cYou cannot give your food away, do you understand? There isn\u2019t enough for you and your family.\u201d</p><p>Opening her mouth and pretending to bite his finger, Tatiana nodded. Alexander left his fingers on her for a moment.</p><p>Tatiana made the oatmeal with a couple of tablespoons of milk, some butter, and a few teaspoons of sugar. And water. She made enough for four small bowls and divided it into four uneven parts, the largest one for Alexander, the next for Dasha, then Marina, and the smallest for her. He had brought them twenty eggs. She scrambled five of them with butter and salt. It felt as if they were having a feast.</p><p>Alexander took one look at his bowl and said he would not eat it. Dasha had already finished her oatmeal by the time he had stopped speaking. Marina, too. And her eggs.</p><p>Only Tatiana gazed down into her bowl as Alexander gazed down at his. \u201cWhat is the matter with you two?\u201d Dasha said. \u201cAlex, you need much more food than she does. You\u2019re a man. She is the smallest. She needs the least out of all of us. Now, eat. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana, still not looking up. \u201cYou\u2019re a man. I am the smallest. I do need the least. Now, eat. Please.\u201d</p><p>Alexander switched his bowl with Tatiana\u2019s. \u201cNow, you eat,\u201d he said. \u201cI can get food at the barracks. Eat.\u201d</p><p>Gratefully Tatiana ate every last bite in seconds. Then she finished her eggs.</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cOh, Alexander, how different things are since the last time you were here. It\u2019s a lot harder now. People are harder. Everyone is now only for themselves, it seems.\u201d She sighed, glancing away.</p><p>Alexander and Tatiana silently stared at Dasha.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting only three hundred grams of bread a day,\u201d she continued. \u201cHow much worse can it get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch worse,\u201d said Tatiana, sparing Alexander an answer. \u201cBecause our provisions will soon be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many cans of ham do you have left?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cbut four days ago we had eighteen. We ate six cans in four days. We\u2019ve been hungry at night.\u201d She wanted to add that they were hungry every waking and sleeping minute of every day but didn\u2019t.</p><p>The girls had to go to work. Tatiana watched Dasha come close to Alexander, who put his hands on her waist. \u201cOh, Alexander, I\u2019ve gotten so thin,\u201d Dasha said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to like me anymore, thin like this. Soon I\u2019ll start looking like Tania.\u201d She kissed him. \u201cAre you going to be all right while we\u2019re gone? What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Alexander smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going to fall down in your bed and not wake up until you come home.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana ran home at five o\u2019clock, bombing or no bombing.</p><p>At home it was toasty warm. Alexander came out of the room grinning happily at her, and Tatiana, grinning happily back, said, \u201cHello, Alexander, I\u2019m home!\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>She wanted to kiss him.</p><p>He had gone and retrieved a dozen bundles of wood from the basement and brought them upstairs. Dasha came in from the kitchen. \u201cIsn\u2019t it cozy in here, Tania?\u201d she said, hugging Alexander.</p><p>\u201cGirls,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will have to keep heating these rooms. It\u2019s getting too cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting heat from the central heating system, Alex,\u201d argued Dasha.</p><p>\u201cDash,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Leningrad Council is heating residential buildings to a maximum of ten degrees Centigrade. You think that\u2019s warm enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been so bad,\u201d said Tatiana, taking off her coat.</p><p>Alexander patted Dasha\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring you more wood from the basement and leave it for you. Heat your rooms with the big stove, not the little bourzhuika that can\u2019t warm up a penguin. All right, Tania?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly shivering, Tatiana said nothing at first. \u201cAlexander, these wood-burning stoves take a lot of wood,\u201d she said, and hurried out to make him dinner.</p><p>Babushka brought seven potatoes from Malaya Ochta. They ate one more can of ham and all of the potatoes. After dinner Alexander suggested that from now on they eat only half a can of ham a day. Dasha got upset. She said they could barely make it on the whole can. He said nothing.</p><p>When the air-raid siren sounded, he motioned for the family to go down into the shelter \u2014 everyone, including Tatiana. When Dasha asked him to come with them, Alexander looked at her thoughtfully and said, \u201cDasha, go on now, and don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d When she insisted, he said, more firmly, \u201cWhat kind of a soldier would I be if I ran for shelter every time there was a little bombing? Now, go. And, Tania, you, too. You haven\u2019t been on the roof, have you?\u201d</p><p>No one answered him as they filed out, certainly not Tatiana.</p><p>Later that night Dasha said, \u201cMarinka, can you sleep with Babushka tonight? Please? It\u2019s warm in her room, not like ours. I want Alexander to sleep next to me. Mama, you don\u2019t mind, do you? We are getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext to you and Tania?\u201d Marina gave Tatiana a look that Tatiana did not return.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dasha smiled, getting clean bedding out of the dresser. \u201cAlexander, you don\u2019t mind sleeping in the same bed as Tania?\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>\u201cTanechka, tell me,\u201d Dasha said teasingly, as she started to make the bed, \u201cshould I put him in the middle, between us?\u201d She laughed lightly. \u201cIt will be good for Tania. It\u2019ll be the first time she has slept with a man.\u201d Amused at herself, Dasha pinched Alexander\u2019s arm and said, \u201cThough, darling, maybe she shouldn\u2019t start with you.\u201d</p><p>Not looking at Tatiana, Alexander muttered that he really wouldn\u2019t be comfortable in the middle, and Tatiana, not looking at him, muttered that he was right, and Dasha said to him, \u201cRelax, you don\u2019t think I was really going to put you next to my sister?\u201d</p><p>At bedtime Tatiana climbed in next to her wall, Dasha climbed in next to her, and Alexander fitted in on the end in his thermals. There was no room to move, but it was warmer, and his presence so close, yet so far away, a whole heart away, softened Tatiana\u2019s eyes. Quietly they lay in bed listening to Mama as she cried on her sofa.</p><p>Then Tatiana heard Dasha whispering to Alexander, \u201cYou said before that we would get married \u2014 when, my love, when?\u201d</p><p>He whispered back, \u201cLet\u2019s wait, Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cWait for what? You said we would do it when you got leave. Let\u2019s get married tomorrow. We\u2019ll go to the registry office and get married in ten minutes. Tania and Marina can be our witnesses. Come on, Alexander, we have nothing to wait for.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana turned to the wall.</p><p>\u201cDasha, listen to me. The fighting is too intense. And haven\u2019t you heard? Comrade Stalin has made it a crime to be taken prisoner. It\u2019s now against the law to fall into German hands. To prevent me further from willingly giving myself up to the Germans, our great leader has decided to take away family rations from the Soviet POW. If I get taken by the Germans and we\u2019re married, you will lose your rations. You. Tania. Your mother, grandmother. All of you. I will have to get killed to keep you getting your bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alexander. Oh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a better time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there be a better time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Then they fell quiet.</p><p>Tatiana turned away from the wall, to Dasha, and stared at the back of Alexander\u2019s head. She was remembering lying in his arms, naked and broken in Luga, with his breath in her hair.</p><p>In the middle of the night Dasha got up to go to the bathroom. Tatiana thought Alexander was asleep, but he turned around and faced her. In the dark she made out his liquid eyes. Under the blanket his leg moved sideways and touched hers; she was wearing socks and two layers of flannel pajamas. When she heard Dasha in the outside hallway, she closed her eyes. Alexander moved his leg away.</p><p>The following evening Tatiana cooked only half a can of ham for all of them. It was about a tablespoonful each, but at least it was ham. Dasha grumbled that it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>\u201cAnton is dying,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cEat the ham. Nina Iglenko has not had ham since August.\u201d</p><p>After dinner Mama went to her sewing machine. Since the start of September she had been bringing work home. The army needed winter uniforms, and the factory offered Mama a bonus if she made twenty uniforms a day instead of ten. A bonus of a few rubles and one extra ration. Mama worked until one in the morning for 300 grams of bread and some rubles. This evening she went to her sewing seat, sat down, took her materials, and said, \u201cWhere is my sewing machine?\u201d</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhere is my sewing machine? Tania, where is my sewing machine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mama,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>Babushka limped forward and said, \u201cIrina, I sold it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI traded it in for those soybeans and oil you had tonight. They were so good, Ira.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d Irina screamed. She became hysterical. For minutes she sobbed into her hands. Tatiana stood and watched Alexander\u2019s pained expression as he went out into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cMama, how could you do that?\u201d Irina cried. \u201cYou know that every night they offer me work, and every night I kill myself on that thing to make something for myself, to bring something for my family, something just for us! Don\u2019t you know they were telling me I could get some oats every day, too, if I managed to get up to twenty-five uniforms. Oh, Mama, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana left the room herself. Alexander was sitting on the hallway sofa, smoking. Taking a pen, she went behind the sofa, knelt on the floor, and started lifting the bag of oats so she could mark its level. The oatmeal, the flour, the sugar just kept disappearing. Behind her she heard Alexander say, \u201cCome on, get up off the floor. It\u2019s too hard for you. Let me help.\u201d She moved out of his way, and he lifted the bag for her as she looked inside and drew a black line on the outside. \u201cWhat do you think, Tatia?\u201d Alexander said, calling her Tatia quietly. \u201cPrivate enterprise for your mother? Who would\u2019ve thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s everywhere, though,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201c\u2018Socialism in one country\u2019 seems not to work so well when the country is fighting a war.\u201d She motioned to the bag of flour.</p><p>Picking it up, Alexander nodded. \u201cJust like during the Russian civil war and right after. Have you noticed that during war, to preserve its own life, the beast subsides and lies low . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust long enough to get strong again and rear its head. Wait, hold the flour a little lower.\u201d Her hand with the pen touched his hand holding the bag. She did not look up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your Mama going to do, Tania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What\u2019s Babushka going to do? She\u2019s got nothing left to sell.\u201d Taking her hand away, Tatiana went into the kitchen to wash the dishes from dinner.</p><p>As she headed back to the room, Alexander entered the kitchen. They were alone. She went to walk past him, and he moved in front of her; she tried to go the other way, and he moved in front of her. Tatiana looked up at him and saw that his eyes were twinkling.</p><p>Her own eyes twinkling, she stood still for a moment and then moved right, left, and was around him. Glancing back and smiling, Tatiana said quietly, \u201cGot to be quicker than that, Shura,\u201d and he laughed loudly.</p><p>Alexander left after four days and went back to base. Everybody missed him when he went.</p><p>The good news was he was staying in Leningrad for another week or so, doing patrol work and base maintenance, building barricades and training new recruits. He couldn\u2019t stay over anymore, but he spent most evenings with them, and in the mornings he came at six-thirty and walked Tatiana to Fontanka to get her rations.</p><p>One morning when he came, he said, \u201cI heard Dimitri\u2019s been shot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did he go down in a blaze of glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shot himself in the foot with his Nagant sidearm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I forget,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cHe is not you.\u201d</p><p>Placing a hand on her coat, Alexander told her Dimitri was in a Volkhov hospital, indefinitely out of action. \u201cOn top of the foot wound, he\u2019s got dystrophy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana felt that Alexander almost did not want to tell her. \u201cDystrophy,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cis a muscle-mass disease, degenerative. Brought on by acute malnutrition.\u201d</p><p>Patting him lightly, Tatiana said in a weak voice, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Shura. I won\u2019t get it. I have no muscles.\u201d</p><p>They waited patiently for her rations.</p><p>Alexander kept looking down at her, trying to get her to meet his expectant gaze. Tatiana strongly sensed that he wanted something from her, but what it was she didn\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t guess at.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t? Or didn\u2019t want to?</p><p>Alexander\u2019s rations helped them stretch their food supplies a little longer. He got a king\u2019s ration \u2014 800 grams of bread per day! \u2014 more than half of what they were getting for the five of them. He also received 150 grams of meat and 140 of cereals and half a kilo of vegetables.</p><p>Tatiana was elated when he came for dinner, bringing with him his food for the day. Was it because she was happy to see him or was it because she was happy to eat better? Alexander would hand her the food, telling her to divide it into six portions. \u201cAnd, Tania,\u201d he would tell her every time, \u201csix equal portions.\u201d</p><p>The meat in his ration was not beef but some kind of pasty pork or sometimes an aged chicken leg with thick skin. It took all of Tatiana\u2019s mental strength not to give him the largest cut. She did what she could and gave him the best.</p><p>There were no more candlesticks to trade and no more dishes, except for the six plates the Metanovs kept for themselves and Alexander. Babushka wanted to trade their old blankets and coats, but Mama put her foot down. \u201cNo. Winter is cold here in the city. We will need them.\u201d The temperature had dropped below freezing in the third week of October. Only six sheets remained for three beds, only six towels. Babushka wanted to trade one of the towels, but Tania put her foot down, remembering that Alexander needed a towel, too.</p><p>Babushka Maya stopped going across the Neva. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>4</p><p>Tatiana was in the hallway when she heard Dasha, Alexander, Marina, Mama, and Babushka all arguing heatedly inside the room. She was about to open the door and walk in with the tea when she heard Alexander say, \u201cNo, no, you cannot tell her. This is not the time.\u201d</p><p>And Dasha\u2019s voice spilled through the crack in the door. \u201cBut, Alexander, she is going to have to know eventually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d said Mama. \u201cWhat does it matter? Tell her.\u201d</p><p>Babushka said, \u201cI agree with Alexander. Why weaken her now when she needs her strength?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana opened the door. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>Everyone fell mute.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Tanechka,\u201d Dasha said quickly, glaring at Alexander, who lowered his gaze and sat down.</p> <p>Tatiana was holding the tray of teacups, saucers, spoons, and a small teapot. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>Dasha\u2019s face was streaked with tears. \u201cOh, Tania,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania, what?\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>No one said anything. No one even looked at her.</p><p>Tatiana looked from her grandmother to her mother to her cousin to her sister and stopped on Alexander, who was smoking and looking at his cigarette. Someone lift your eyes to me, Tatiana thought.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, what don\u2019t you want them to tell me?\u201d</p> <p>He raised his eyes. \u201cYour grandfather died, Tania,\u201d he said. \u201cIn September. Pneumonia.\u201d</p><p>The tray with the teacups fell from Tatiana\u2019s hands, and the cups broke on the wood floor, and the hot tea spilled on her stockings. Tatiana knelt on the floor and picked up all the shards without saying a word to anyone, which was just as well, because no one could say a word to her. And then she put all the broken pieces on the tray, picked the tray up and went back out to the kitchen. As she was closing the door, she heard Alexander say, \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>Dasha and Alexander came out to the kitchen, where Tatiana was standing next to the window, numbly grasping the sill. Dasha went to Tatiana and said, \u201cHoney, I\u2019m sorry. Come here.\u201d She hugged Tatiana and whispered, \u201cWe all adored him. We are all devastated.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana hugged her sister back and said, \u201cDasha, it\u2019s a bad sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tanechka, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bad sign,\u201d Tatiana repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s as if Deda died because he couldn\u2019t bear to see what was about to happen to his family.\u201d</p><p>Both girls looked at Alexander, who stood nearby watching them and said nothing.</p><p>The next morning Alexander and Tatiana walked in silence to the ration store and waited in silence for their bread. When they were outside by the Fontanka Canal, Alexander stuck his hand into his coat pocket and said, \u201cI have to go back up tomorrow, Tania. But look. Look what I brought you.\u201d He held a small bar of chocolate. She took it from him and managed a weak smile. Her eyes filled up.</p> <p>Alexander took hold of Tatiana\u2019s hand and said soothingly, patting his chest, \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She stood for a long time \u2014 her face pressed into Alexander\u2019s chest, his arms around her \u2014 and cried.</p><p>Anton\u2019s leg was not getting better. Anton was not getting better.</p><p>Tatiana brought him a piece of Alexander\u2019s chocolate. Anton ate it, but listlessly.</p><p>She sat by his bed. They didn\u2019t speak for a while.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d he said, \u201cremember summer before last?\u201d His voice was weak.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Tatiana. She only remembered last summer.</p><p>\u201cIn August when you came back from Luga, me, you, Volodya, Petka, and Pasha played soccer in Tauride Park? You wanted the ball so much, you kicked my shin to get it? I think it was the same leg.\u201d A faint smile passed over Anton\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d Tatiana said quietly. \u201cShh, Anton.\u201d She took his hand. \u201cYour leg will heal, and maybe next summer we\u2019ll go to Tauride Park and play soccer again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, squeezing her hand and closing his eyes. \u201cBut not with your brother. Or my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you and I, Anton,\u201d whispered Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cNot even me, Tania,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>They\u2019re waiting for you, Tatiana wanted to say to him. They\u2019re waiting to play soccer with you again.</p><p>And with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>5</p><p>Tatiana used to leave at six-thirty to get the rations \u2014 herself as punctual as a German \u2014 so that even with waiting in line and the ration store being all the way on Fontanka, she could be back by eight when the bombing formations flew overhead and the air-raid sirens sounded. But she had noticed that either the raids were starting earlier or she was getting out later, because three mornings in a row she got caught in the shell fire while still on Nekrasova returning home.</p><p>Only because she had promised, sworn to Alexander that she would, Tatiana waited out the bombing in a shelter in someone else\u2019s building, holding her precious bread to her chest and wearing the helmet he had left her and made her promise and swear to wear when she went out.</p><p>The bread Tatiana was holding wasn\u2019t delicious bread; it wasn\u2019t white, and it wasn\u2019t soft, and it didn\u2019t have a golden crust, but still a smell emanated from it. For thirty minutes she sat while thirty pairs of eyes glared at her from all directions, and finally an old woman\u2019s voice said, \u201cCome on, girlie, share with us. Don\u2019t just sit there holding the loot. Give us a bite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for my family,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cThere are five of us, all women. They\u2019re waiting for me to bring it to them. If I give it to you, they will have no food today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much, girlie,\u201d the old woman persisted. \u201cJust a bite.\u201d</p><p>The shelling stopped, and Tatiana was the first one out. After that she made sure she didn\u2019t lag behind anymore.</p><p>But despite her best efforts she could not seem to get to the ration store and back before the bombs came.</p><p>To go at ten was impossible. Tatiana had to be at work; people depended on her there, too. She wondered if Marina would do better, or maybe Dasha. Maybe they could move faster than Tatiana. Mama was sewing uniforms by hand in the morning and at night. Tatiana couldn\u2019t possibly send her mother, who practically never looked up from her sewing nowadays, trying to finish a few uniforms so she could get some extra oatmeal.</p> <p>Dasha said she couldn\u2019t go because she had to do laundry in the morning. Marina also refused, which was just as well. She had nearly stopped going to university. Taking her ration card, she picked up her own bread and ate it immediately. At night when she came back to Fifth Soviet, she demanded more food from Tatiana. \u201cMarinka, it\u2019s just not fair,\u201d Tatiana would say to her cousin. \u201cWe\u2019re all hungry. I know this is hard, but you have to keep yourself in check\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like you keep yourself in check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tatiana said, sensing that Marina was not talking about the bread.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing well,\u201d Marina said. \u201cVery well, Tania. Keep it up.\u201d</p><p>But Tatiana didn\u2019t feel she was doing well.</p><p>She felt that she was doing worse than ever before, and yet her family was lauding her efforts. Something was not right with the world in which her family thought Tatiana was making a success out of a big botch. It wasn\u2019t that she felt herself to be slow that bothered her, but that she felt herself slowing down. All her efforts at haste, at deliberate speed, were met with an unknown resistance \u2014 resistance from her own body.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t moving as fast as it used to, and the inarguable proof of that lay with the German bombers, who at precisely eight o\u2019clock flew their planes over the center of the city and for two hours sounded the mortar clarion call, the high-explosive bugle, to disrupt the rush hour of the morning.</p><p>Sunrise came at eight also. Tatiana walked to the store and back in near-dark.</p><p>One morning Tatiana was walking on Nekrasova and without much thought passed a man walking in the same direction. He was tall, older, thin, wearing a hat.</p><p>Only when she passed him did it occur to Tatiana that she hadn\u2019t passed anyone in a long time. People walked at their own pace, but it was never an overtaking pace. Either I\u2019m walking faster, she thought, or he is even slower than me.</p><p>She slowed down, then stopped. As she turned around, she saw him drift down like a parachute by the side of the building and keel over to his side. Tatiana walked back to him, to help him sit up. He was still.</p><p>Nonetheless, she tried to straighten him up. She lifted his hat. His unblinking eyes stared at Tatiana. They remained open, as they were just minutes ago when he had been walking on the street. Now he was dead.</p><p>Horrified, Tatiana let go of the man and his hat and hurried on without turning around. On the way back with her rations, she decided to take Ulitsa Zhukovskogo instead so as not to walk by the corpse. The air raid had started, but she ignored it and walked on. If they wanted to take my bread in the shelter, there would be nothing I could do to stop them, Tatiana thought, pulling Alexander\u2019s helmet down over her head.</p><p>That morning she told her family she had seen a dead man on the street. They barely acknowledged it. \u201cOh?\u201d said Marina. \u201cWell, I saw a dead horse in the middle of the street, cut open, and a crowd of people helping themselves to the horse\u2019s flesh. And that\u2019s not the worst part. I walked up behind someone and asked if there was anything left for me.\u201d</p> <p>The man\u2019s face, his walk, his silly hat stayed in Tatiana\u2019s mind as she closed her eyes at night. It wasn\u2019t his death that tormented her, because, unfortunately, Tatiana had seen death before \u2014 in Luga, in the abject absence of Pasha, as she watched her father burn. But it was this man\u2019s walking gait that Tatiana saw when she closed her eyes, because when he died, he had been walking, and though he was walking slower than Tatiana, he was not walking slower by much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>6</p><p>\u201cHow many cans of ham do we have left?\u201d Mama asked.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d Tatiana replied.</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMama, we\u2019ve been eating it every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it can\u2019t be,\u201d said Mama. \u201cWe had ten just a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout nine days ago.\u201d</p><p>The next day Mama asked, \u201cHave we got any flour left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we have about another kilo. I\u2019ve been making pancakes with it every evening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that what those are? Pancakes?\u201d Dasha said. \u201cTastes like flour and water to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is flour and water.\u201d Tatiana paused. \u201cAlexander calls them sea biscuits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make bread out of it?\u201d demanded Mama. \u201cInstead of silly pancakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, bread? Out of what? We have no milk. We have no yeast. We have no butter. And we certainly have no more eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust mix it with a little water. We must have some soy milk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have three tablespoons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUse it. Put some sugar in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Mama.\u201d For dinner Tatiana made unleavened bread with sugar and the remaining milk. They had the last can of ham. It was October 31.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in this bread?\u201d Tatiana asked, breaking off a piece of the black crust and looking inside. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It was the start of November. Babushka was on the couch. Mama and Marina had already gone out for the day. Tatiana was procrastinating, trying to make her portion last. She didn\u2019t want to go to the hospital.</p><p>Dasha leaned over from her chair and shrugged. \u201cWho knows? Who cares? How does it taste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, revolting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat it. What, maybe you\u2019d like some white bread instead?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana picked at a little piece of something in the bread, poked it with her fingers, then put it on her tongue. \u201cDash, oh my God, you know what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sawdust.\u201d</p><p>Dasha paused in her own chewing, but only for a second. \u201cSawdust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and this here?\u201d Tatiana pointed to a brown fleck between her fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s cardboard. We\u2019re eating paper. Three hundred grams a day, and they\u2019re giving us paper.\u201d</p><p>Finishing every last crumb of her piece and looking hungrily at the one Tatiana was kneading between her fingers, Dasha said, \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have that. Can I open the can of tomatoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We have only two left. Besides, Mama and Marina are not here. You know if we open it, we\u2019ll eat it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t. We\u2019ll open it tonight for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dinner is that going to be? Tomatoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t eat all your cardboard in the morning, you\u2019d have some left for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Tatiana, putting the rest of the bread in her mouth and chewing it with her eyes closed. \u201cListen,\u201d she said when she had swallowed hard, \u201cI\u2019ve got some crackers left. Want to have some? Just three each?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The girls glanced at Babushka, who was sleeping.</p><p>They ate seven each. Only small remainders were left of what used to be whole pieces of toasted bread. Broken remainders with crumbs on the bottom.</p><p>\u201cTania, are you still getting your monthlies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d There was anxiety in Dasha\u2019s voice and anxiety in Tatiana\u2019s as she answered. \u201cNo. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Dasha was quiet. The sisters breathed shallowly.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried, Dasha?\u201d Tatiana said at last, with great reluctance.</p><p>Dasha shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about that. Alexander and I\u2014\u201d She glanced at Tatiana. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019m worried I\u2019m not getting it. That it just ceased to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Tatiana, relieved and sad for her sister at the same time. \u201cIt\u2019ll come back when we start to eat again.\u201d</p><p>Dasha raised her eyes at Tatiana.</p><p>Tatiana looked away.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Dasha whispered, \u201caren\u2019t you feeling it? Like your whole body is just shutting down?\u201d She started to cry. \u201cShutting down, Tania!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana hugged her sister. \u201cDearest,\u201d she said. \u201cmy heart\u2019s still beating. I\u2019m not shutting down, Dasha. And you\u2019re not either.\u201d</p><p>The girls were silent in the cold room. Hugging Tatiana back, Dasha said, \u201cI want that senseless hunger back. Remember last month when we were always starving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel that anymore, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d admitted Tatiana faintly.</p><p>\u201cI want it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get it back. When we start eating, it will all come back.\u201d</p><p>That night Tatiana came home with a pot of clear liquid they served in the hospital cafeteria. There was one potato floating in it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s chicken soup,\u201d Tatiana said to her family. \u201cWith some ham hock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the chicken? Where is the ham hock?\u201d Mama asked as she looked into the small pot.</p><p>\u201cI was lucky to get this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Tanechka, you were. Come, pour for us,\u201d Mama said.</p><p>It tasted like hot water with a potato. It had no salt, and it had no oil. Tatiana divided it into five portions because Alexander was still away.</p><p>\u201cI hope Alexander comes back soon so we can have some of his food. He\u2019s so lucky to have such a good ration,\u201d said Dasha.</p><p>I hope Alexander comes back soon, too, thought Tatiana. I need to lay my eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cLook at us,\u201d said Mama. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited for this dinner since our one o\u2019clock lunch. But someone has to help with the bombs, the fires, the glass, the wounded. We\u2019re not helping. All we want to do is eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the Germans want,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cThey want us to abandon our city, and we are ready to do it to have a potato.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go out there,\u201d said Mama. \u201cI\u2019ve got five uniforms to sew by hand.\u201d She glared at Babushka, who sat quietly, chewed her bread, and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t go out there,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cWe will sit and work and sew. But we are not abandoning our Leningrad. No one is leaving here.\u201d</p><p>No one else spoke.</p><p>When the air raid began, they all descended to the shelter, even Tatiana, who tripped over a woman who had died sitting up against the wall and whom no one had bothered to move. Tatiana sank down and waited out the darkness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>7</p><p>Dasha wrote to Alexander each day; every single day she wrote him a short letter.

A small group of soldiers has been holding that island since September, despite intense German shelling from the banks of Lake Ladoga just 200 meters away. You remember Oreshek? Lenin\u2019s brother Alexander was hanged there in 1887 for his part in the plot to assassinate Alexander III.</p><p>Now that war has started, the sailors and soldiers guarding the entrance to the Neva are lauded as heroes of the New Russia \u2014 the Russia after Hitler. We are all told that after we win, everything will be completely different in the Soviet Union. It will be a much better life, we are promised, but for that life we have to be prepared to die. Lay down your life, we are told, so your children can live.</p><p>All right, we say. The fighting doesn\u2019t end, even at night. Neither does the rain. We have been wet all day and all night for seven days. We can\u2019t dry out. Three of my men have died of pneumonia. It almost seems cosmically unfair to die from pneumonia, when Hitler is so intent on killing us himself. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not in Moscow right now. Have you heard much about what\u2019s going on there? I think that\u2019s what\u2019s saving us. Saving you. Hitler diverted a large part of his Army Group Nord, including most of his planes and tanks, away from Leningrad for his attack on Moscow. If Moscow falls, we\u2019re done for, but right now it\u2019s our only reprieve.</p><p>I\u2019m fine myself. I don\u2019t like being wet much. They still feed us officers. Each day I have meat I think of you.</p><p>Be well. Tell Tatiana to walk close to the sides of the buildings. Except when the bombs are falling; then tell her to stop walking and wait in a doorway. Tell her to wear the helmet I left.</p><p>Girls, under no circumstances give away your bread. Stay clear of the roof.</p> <p>And use the soap I left you. Remember that you always feel slightly better about things when you\u2019re clean. My father told me that. I will add it\u2019s impossible to keep yourself clean on the winter front. But on the plus side, it\u2019s so cold here that the lice that spread typhus can\u2019t live.</p><p>Believe me when I tell you I think of you every minute of every day.</p><p>Until I see you again, I remain distantly</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Alexander</p><p>Tatiana wore the helmet. She used the soap. She waited in the doorways. But for some reason all she could think about with a peculiar and prolonged aching, as she didn\u2019t take off her felt boots, her felt hat, and her quilted coat, which Mama had made in the days when there was a sewing machine, was Alexander being wet all day and night in his uniform on the icy Ladoga. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>PETER\u2019S DARKENED CITY</p><p>THERE was no longer any denying that what was happening to Leningrad was nothing like what they could have ever imagined.</p><p>Marina\u2019s mother died.</p><p>Mariska died.</p> <p>Anton died.</p><p>The shelling continued. The bombing continued. There were fewer incendiaries falling, and Tatiana knew this because there were fewer fires, and she knew this because as she walked to Fontanka, there were fewer places for her to stand and warm her hands.</p><p>As she was making her way to the store one November morning, Tatiana noticed two dead people lying in the street. On the way back two hours later there were seven. They weren\u2019t injured, and they weren\u2019t wounded. They were just dead. She made the sign of the cross as she walked past them, stopped and thought, what did I just do? Did I make the sign of the cross on dead people? But I live in Communist Russia. Why would I do that? She made the sign of the hammer and sickle as she slowly walked on.</p><p>There was no place for God in the Soviet Union. In fact, God clearly went against the principles by which they all lived their lives: faith in work, in living together, in protecting the state against nonconformist individuals, in Comrade Stalin. In school, in newspapers, on the radio, Tatiana heard that God was the great oppressor, the loathsome tyrant who had kept the Russian worker from realizing his full potential for centuries. Now, in post-Bolshevik Russia, God was just another roadblock in the way of the new Soviet man. The Communist man could not have an allegiance to God because that would mean his first allegiance was to something other than the state. And nothing could come before the state. Not only would the state provide for the Soviet people, but it also would feed them and it would give them jobs and protect them from the enemy. Tatiana had heard that in kindergarten, and through nine years of school and in the Young Pioneer classes she attended when she was nine. She became a Pioneer because she had no choice, but when it was time for her to join the Young Komsomols in her last year of school, she refused. Not because of God necessarily, but just because. Somewhere deep inside, Tatiana had always thought she would not make a very good Communist. She liked Mikhail Zoshchenko\u2019s stories too much.</p><p>As a child in Luga, Tatiana had known some religious women who were always trying to get their hands on her, to baptize her, to teach her, to make her believe. She would run from them, hiding behind the lilac tree in the neighbors\u2019 garden, and watch them shuffle down the village road, but not before they made airy crosses on her with benevolent smiles on their faces, every once in a while lovingly calling out to her, Tatia, Tatia.</p> <p>Tatiana made another sign of the cross, this time on herself. Why was that so conspicuously comforting?</p><p>It\u2019s as if I\u2019m not alone.</p><p>She went to sit inside the church across the street from her building. Do churches ever get bombed? she wondered. Did St. Paul\u2019s in London get bombed? If the Germans couldn\u2019t be smart enough to destroy the magnificently conspicuous St. Paul\u2019s, how were they ever going to find the little church she was in? She felt safer.</p><p>At the post office Tatiana had to step over a dead man to get inside. He had died on the doorstep. \u201cHow long has he been here?\u201d she asked the postmaster.</p><p>Toothlessly he grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you for another cracker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know that badly,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I\u2019ll give you a cracker anyway.\u201d</p> <p>In the dark no one could see what was happening to their bodies. No one could face what was happening to their bodies either. Dasha removed all the mirrors from their rooms and from the kitchen. No one wanted to catch even an accidental glimpse of themselves. They stopped looking at one another. No one wanted to catch even an accidental glimpse of someone they loved.</p><p>To hide her own body from herself and everyone else, Tatiana wore a flannel undershirt, a flannel shirt, her own wool sweater, Pasha\u2019s wool sweater, a pair of heavy stockings, long trousers, a skirt over them, and her quilted winter coat. She took off her coat to sleep.</p><p>Dasha mentioned that she had lost her breasts, and Marina said, breasts? I don\u2019t have a mother anymore, and you\u2019re talking about breasts? Wouldn\u2019t you trade breasts for your mother? I would. And Dasha apologized, but in the kitchen she broke down crying and said, \u201cI want my breasts back, Tanechka.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana gently rubbed Dasha\u2019s back. \u201cCome on, now,\u201d she said. \u201cCourage, Dasha. We\u2019re not doing too badly. Look, we have some oatmeal left. Go inside. I\u2019ll make you some.\u201d</p><p>After Aunt Rita died, Marina still went out every morning to university, even though, as she told Tatiana, the professors taught nothing, there were no books and no lectures. But there was some heat, and Marina could sit in the library for a few hours until she could go to the canteen and get her clear soup.</p><p>\u201cI hate soup,\u201d Marina said. \u201cHate it now. It\u2019s so meaningless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not meaningless. It\u2019s hot water,\u201d said Tatiana, as she crouched beside her dwindling bag of sugar. They still had some barley left. \u201cDon\u2019t touch the barley,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be our dinner for the next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is hardly a cupful in the bag!\u201d Marina exclaimed in disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you can\u2019t eat it raw,\u201d Tatiana said. But she was wrong. The next day there was less barley in the bag. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>The leaflets rained down as they had in Luga. First the leaflets, then the bombs. The difference was, there had been food then, and it was warm. The difference was, back then Tatiana had believed in many things. She had believed she would find Pasha. She had believed the war would soon be over. She had believed Comrade Stalin.</p><p>Nowadays she believed in only one faint but immutable thing.</p><p>In one immutable man.</p> <p>Now the leaflets that rained down from the Luftwaffe planes proclaimed to her in Russian: Women! Wear your white dresses. Wear your white dresses so when you walk along Suvorovsky to get your 250 grams of bread, we can see you from 200 meters in the sky, and not shoot you and not throw bombs your way.</p><p>Wear your white dress and live, Tatiana! was what the leaflets shouted to her.</p><p>Tatiana saved one, a few days before the twenty-fourth celebration of the Russian Revolution on November 7. She brought it home and carelessly dropped it on the table. There it stayed until the next day, when Alexander returned, thinner than he had been two weeks earlier, his face more gaunt. Gone was the twinkling glance, gone was the perpetual smile, gone the charm and the liveliness. Gone.</p><p>What was left was a man who hugged Dasha and even Mama, who hugged him back and said, \u201cGood to see you, dearest. Good to see you. We can\u2019t bear to think about you in that wet and cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s drier, but not much warmer here,\u201d said the man, who hugged Babushka standing against the wall in the hallway, because she could not stand unsupported anymore, and who pecked Marina on the cheek, and who, when he turned to Tatiana standing awkwardly by the door, holding on to the brass handle, could not bring himself to come over and touch her. Couldn\u2019t, despite the fact that his dark eyes lingered on her. He waved to her. That was something. Waved, turned and walked inside the room, put down his rifle, took off his heavy coat, sat, and asked for his soap. The girls twittered around him. Dasha brought him a piece of bread, which he swallowed whole. Marina stared at the bread before he ate it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Revolution Day tomorrow, Alexander. Will there be a little extra to celebrate with?\u201d Dasha asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you some food when I go back to the barracks. I\u2019ll bring some tomorrow, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about now? Do you have anything now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came straight from the front, Dasha. I have nothing today.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stepped forward. \u201cAlexander, do you want a cup of tea? I\u2019ll make you some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it!\u201d barked Dasha, and disappeared.</p><p>Taking out a cigarette, Alexander lit it and offered it to Tatiana. \u201cHave a smoke,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Tatiana looked at him, puzzled. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut it\u2019ll lessen your appetite.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat? What are you looking at me like that for?\u201d He smiled faintly. \u201cKeep looking,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Staring at him with her clear, affectionate eyes, Tatiana couldn\u2019t help herself. She placed her glove-clad hand on the back of his uniform and patted him softly. \u201cShura,\u201d she whispered, \u201cyou\u2019re still months behind us, aren\u2019t you? I have no appetite.\u201d She took her hand away. He put the cigarette into his own mouth.</p><p>Standing behind Alexander, Babushka and Marina watched them. Tatiana didn\u2019t care. His face was to her. Marina said, coming up to them, \u201cAlexander, offer me a cigarette, why don\u2019t you? To lessen my appetite.\u201d</p><p>Taking the cigarette out of his mouth, Alexander handed it to Marina, who took it and said to Tatiana, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want a smoke? It\u2019s just been in his mouth, Tania.\u201d</p><p>Alexander looked from Marina to Tatiana with a tired, slightly bemused expression. \u201cMarinka,\u201d he said, \u201chave the cigarette and leave Tania alone.\u201d</p> <p>Picking up the Nazi leaflet off the table, he said, \u201cTo celebrate the glorious revolution, Leningrad Party chief Zhdanov is trying to get a couple of tablespoons of sour cream for the children. There might be\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped talking. Reading the leaflet more carefully, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d said Tatiana, stepping closer to the table. Marina had sat down. Babushka continued to stand against the wall. Tatiana opened her coat and showed Alexander the white dress with the red roses she was wearing underneath.</p><p>Alexander paled. \u201cIs that your dress?\u201d he asked, his voice breaking.</p><p>Only Tatiana stood in front of Alexander, and only Tatiana could see what his eyes were filled with. Stepping away from him, she shook her head at him imperceptibly, to say, no, stop, this room is too small for us, stop.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s my dress,\u201d Tatiana said, looking at the dress hanging off her. She closed her coat.</p><p>Dasha came through, shutting the door behind her with her foot. \u201cAlex, here, have some tea. It\u2019s weak, but tea is something we still have. Not much else, mind you, not much\u2014\u201d She broke off. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Alexander looked back down at the leaflet. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Dasha looked at Marina quizzically, and Marina just shrugged as if to say, I\u2019ll be damned if I know.</p><p>Tatiana remained standing. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m wearing a white dress,\u201d she said to Alexander. \u201cTo avoid being hit.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shot up from his seat so fast that he spilled the hot tea all over himself. Holding the leaflet, he banged his fist hard on the table. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d he yelled at Tatiana. \u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>Dasha grabbed him by the sleeve. \u201cAlexander, are you crazy? What are you shouting at her for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d he yelled again, taking a lunging step toward her. Tatiana did not back away; she blinked.</p><p>Dasha got between them, pushing Alexander away. \u201cSit down, what\u2019s the matter with you? Why are you shouting?\u201d</p><p>Alexander sat down, never taking his eyes off Tatiana, who reached behind the sofa, got an old rag, came to the table, and started wiping up the spilled tea.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Dasha said, \u201cdon\u2019t come so close to him. Or in a minute he\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute I\u2019ll what, Dasha?\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>\u201cForget it, Dash,\u201d Tatiana said quietly. Picking up the empty teacup, she started toward the door.</p><p>Alexander grabbed her arm. \u201cTania, put the cup down and go change your dress.\u201d He didn\u2019t let go of her arm, but added, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana put the cup down.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d said Alexander, his eyes boring into her. How she wished he would stop holding her arm and looking at her. \u201cTania, do you know what the Germans did in Luga? You were there, didn\u2019t you see? They rained these leaflets down on the volunteer women and young girls, who were digging the trenches and potatoes. Wear your white dresses and white shawls, they said, and we\u2019ll know you\u2019re civilian women and we\u2019ll avoid shooting at you. The women said, oh, all right, and happily went to change and put on their best whites, and the Germans, as they were flying overhead, saw their dresses from 300 meters in the sky and slaughtered them all right there in the trenches. It made targeting them so much easier.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana pulled her arm from him.</p><p>\u201cNow, go and change. Put on something brown. And warm.\u201d Alexander got up. \u201cI\u2019ll make my own tea.\u201d Looking at Dasha, he added coldly, \u201cAnd, Dasha, do me a favor \u2014 don\u2019t ever confuse me with anyone who has hurt your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you stay?\u201d Dasha asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHave to report to the garrison by nine.\u201d</p><p>They ate soup with a bit of cabbage leaf. Black bread as heavy as brick, a few tablespoons of buckwheat kernels, and some unsweetened tea. They gave Alexander a shot of their precious vodka. He went and found wood in the basement and made a nice fire. It got warm in the room. How remarkable, Tatiana thought.</p><p>Alexander was at the table, with Dasha on one side and Mama on the other and Marina standing behind him. Babushka remained on the couch. And Tatiana was in the farthest corner, looking into her beige tea. Everyone was around Alexander, except for her. She couldn\u2019t even get close.</p><p>\u201cAlexander?\u201d Mama asked. \u201cDear, it must be so hard for you at the front thinking about food all the time, like us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrina Fedorovna,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a little secret.\u201d He bent his head to her. \u201cWhen I\u2019m at the front, I don\u2019t think about food at all.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing his arm, Mama spoke again. \u201cIs there any way you can get my girls out of Leningrad? We\u2019re almost out of food.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head and trying to disentangle himself from the women, Alexander said, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. Anyway, you know that I\u2019m not on the Ladoga command. I\u2019m below on the Neva, bombing the German positions across the river in Shlisselburg.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cThey\u2019re just relentless. But besides, the lake is not frozen over yet, and the barges \u2014 There are over two million civilians in Leningrad, and only a few thousand have been evacuated by barge out of the city, all of them children with their mothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are also children with our mothers,\u201d said Dasha.</p><p>\u201cSmall children with their mothers,\u201d Alexander corrected himself. \u201cAll of you work \u2014 who is going to let you go? You and Dasha are making uniforms for the army,\u201d he said to Mama, patting her. \u201cTania works in the hospital. How are you doing there, Tania?\u201d His eyes were on her. She had moved near the window, away from the dining table.</p><p>Tatiana shrugged. \u201cToday I sewed forty-two sacks. Still wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 seventy-eight people died. Mama, I wish I could bring a sewing machine home for you.\u201d</p><p>Mama turned around and glared at Babushka on the couch, who said in a defeated voice, \u201cYou used to like the potatoes I brought, daughter. Now I have nothing to give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cI will bring potatoes from the army store. I\u2019ll bring you a little white flour. I\u2019ll bring you everything I can. But I can\u2019t get you out. Did you hear about the gunboat Konstructor? It was crossing Ladoga with women and children on board, headed around the Ladoga horn to Novaya Ladoga, and it was hit. The captain avoided one bomb. The second one sank his ship, drowning all 250 people.\u201d</p><p>Dasha declared, \u201cI would rather take my chances here in Leningrad than die in the cold sea like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow have you all been holding up?\u201d Alexander said. \u201cMarina, are you hanging in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely,\u201d Marina said. \u201cLook at us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve looked better,\u201d Alexander agreed, glancing at Tatiana, who said emptily, without glancing at him, \u201cAnton died. Last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cMaybe now Nina will stop coming around asking you for food for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Anton died, Tania,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cYou\u2019re not giving away your food, are you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t reply. \u201cHave you heard from Dimitri?\u201d she asked, changing the subject. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard a word.\u201d</p><p>Lighting a cigarette and shaking his head, Alexander said, \u201cDimitri is in the Volkhov Hospital fighting for his life. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t have the energy to write.\u201d He and Tatiana glanced at each other.</p><p>The air-raid siren sounded. Alexander looked around the table. No one moved. \u201cDoes anyone go down to the shelter anymore, or has Tania corrupted each and every one of you?\u201d he asked over the shrill wailing sound.</p><p>Wrapping her cardigan tighter around herself, Dasha replied, \u201cMarina and I still go every once\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, when was the last time you went to the shelter?\u201d interrupted Alexander.</p><p>Tatiana shrugged. \u201cI went just last week,\u201d she said. \u201cI sat next to a woman who wasn\u2019t speaking to me. I struck up a conversation three times until I realized she was dead. And not recently dead either.\u201d Tatiana raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cTania, tell the truth,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cYou were there for five seconds, and the bombing went on that night for three hours. And when was the time before that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeptember,\u201d said Mama casually, getting up and going to get her sewing.</p><p>\u201cMama, you know what? You\u2019re a fine one to talk,\u201d exclaimed Dasha. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been there since September either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have work to do. I\u2019m trying to make extra money. You should do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Mama! I just take my sewing to the bomb shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I saw what you did to that uniform \u2014 attaching the arm upside down. Can\u2019t sew in the near-dark, Dasha.\u201d</p><p>While they were bickering, Tatiana watched Alexander, and he watched Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d he asked, \u201cyou haven\u2019t taken off your gloves all night. Why? It\u2019s so warm in the room. Stop standing by the window where it\u2019s cold. Come and sit down with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alexander!\u201d Marina exclaimed, putting her arm around him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe what your Tanechka did last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do?\u201d he asked, turning to Marina.</p><p>Dasha stepped in with, \u201cYour Tanechka? No, Alexander, we mean, you really won\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to tell it.\u201d Marina was petulant.</p><p>\u201cSomebody tell it,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Tatiana groaned. \u201cDo I have to stay for this?\u201d she said, walking over to the table and collecting the cups. \u201cMaybe Alexander can throw some more wood on the fire.\u201d</p><p>He immediately rose and went to the stove, saying, \u201cI can throw wood on the fire and listen.\u201d</p><p>Dasha continued for Marina. \u201cLast Saturday, Marinka and I were coming back from the public canteen on Suvorovsky. We had left Tania in the room, we thought peacefully sleeping, but as we\u2019re coming back, Kostia from the second floor is running toward us on the street, yelling, \u2018Hurry, your sister is on fire! Your sister is on fire!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Alexander came back to the table and sat down. His eyes were still on her, but Tatiana had noticed they had become considerably less warm.</p><p>\u201cTania, dear, why don\u2019t you tell Alexander the rest?\u201d Dasha said. \u201cI think it would be more fun coming from you. Tell him what happened.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana, her hair short, her eyes sunken, her frame withered away, her arms full of her family\u2019s dishes, said, \u201cNothing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me, Tatiana?\u201d said Alexander, glaring at her.</p><p>She tutted and stared at Marina with disapproval. \u201cKostia is too small to be on the roof by himself. I went up to help him. A very small incendiary exploded, and he couldn\u2019t put the fire out by himself. I helped him, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went out onto the roof?\u201d Alexander said quietly.</p><p>\u201cJust for an hour,\u201d she said, trying to be jovial, shrugging a little, managing a smile. \u201cIt was really nothing. There was a small fire. I used the sand, and in five minutes put it out. Kostia is a hysteric.\u201d She glared at Marina. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Tania?\u201d Dasha exclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t keep giving Marina the evil eye. A hysteric? Why don\u2019t you take off your gloves and show Alexander your hands.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was mute.</p><p>Tatiana moved toward the door with her load. \u201cLike he wants to see my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Alexander said, standing up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see anything. I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his rifle, his coat, his rucksack and was out the door without even brushing past Tatiana.</p><p>After he left, Dasha looked at Tatiana, at Marina, at Mama, at Babushka. \u201cWhat was wrong with him?\u201d she asked wearily.</p><p>No one spoke for a moment.</p><p>From the couch Babushka said, \u201cMuch, much fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarinka,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cwhy? You know he worries about all of us endlessly. Why worry him further with nonsense? I\u2019m fine on that roof, and my hands will be fine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania is right! And what did you mean by \u2018your\u2019 Tanechka anyway?\u201d Dasha demanded, whirling round to Marina.</p><p>\u201cYes, Marina, what did you mean?\u201d asked Tatiana, looking angrily at her cousin, who replied that it was just a figure of speech.</p><p>\u201cYes, a stupid figure of speech,\u201d said Dasha. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>3</p><p>That night Tatiana dreamed that she did not sleep, that the night lasted all year, and that in the dark his fingers found her.</p><p>In the early morning there was a knock on the door as she was getting up. It was Alexander. He had brought them two kilos of black bread and a cupful of buckwheat kernels. Everyone besides Tatiana was still in bed. He waited for her in the kitchen with his arms crossed and his eyes cold while she brushed her teeth over the kitchen sink. He mentioned that the toilet smelled worse than ever. Tatiana was beyond noticing.</p><p>She was already dressed. She slept dressed.</p> <p>\u201cShura,\u201d Tatiana said, \u201cdon\u2019t go out now. It\u2019s so cold. I can carry a kilo of bread. I think I can still do that. Give me your ration card, I\u2019ll get yours, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tatiana,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cthe day has not come when you\u2019ll be getting my rations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she snapped, moving toward him so quickly that he actually backed away a step. \u201cIf you can go to the front, Alexander\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I have any choice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I have any choice. I can get your rations for you. Now, give me your card.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me get your coat. How are your hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine,\u201d she said, showing them. She wanted him to take hold of them, to touch them, but he didn\u2019t. He just stared at her with the same cold eyes.</p><p>They went out into the bitterness together. It was minus ten degrees. At seven o\u2019clock the skies were still dark, and there was a shrieking wind that got underneath Tatiana\u2019s coat and into her ears, whistling its Arctic lament for ten blocks to the store. Inside the store was better, and there were only thirty people ahead of them. It might take only forty minutes this time, Tatiana thought.</p><p>\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Alexander said, his voice tinged with barely suppressed anger. \u201cThat here it is November, and you\u2019re still doing this by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t reply. She was too sleepy to reply. She shrugged, pulling her scarf tighter around her head.</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cWhy do you do this? Dasha is perfectly capable of going. At the very least she can come with you. Marina, too. Why do you continue to go alone?\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana didn\u2019t know what to say. First she was too cold, and her teeth were chattering. After a few minutes she warmed up, but her teeth were still chattering, and she thought, why do I go on my own, during air raids, and cold, and dark? Why don\u2019t we ever switch? \u201cBecause if Marina goes, she eats the rations on the way home. Because Mama sews every morning. Because Dasha does laundry. Who am I going to send? Babushka?\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t reply, but the anger didn\u2019t leave his face.</p><p>Tatiana touched his coat. He moved away. \u201cWhy are you upset with me?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause I went out onto the roof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d He broke off. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t listen to me.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not upset with you, Tatia. I\u2019m angry at them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt all just happened this way. I\u2019d rather be out here than washing laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, because Dasha is washing laundry so often? You could be sleeping late six days a week like she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, she is having a hard time with all this. I started going\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started going because they told you to, and you said all right. They said, oh, and can you cook for us, too, and you said all right, broken leg and all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlexander, what are you upset about? That I do what they tell me to? I also do what you tell me to.\u201d</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he said, \u201cYou do what I tell you to? Are you off the f*cking roof? Are you in the shelter? Have you stopped giving your food to Nina? Yes, you do what I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I listen to them more?\u201d Tatiana said incredulously. It wasn\u2019t their turn yet. A dozen people still ahead of them in line. A dozen people listening to them. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t upset with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset about that. You want to know what I\u2019m upset about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said tiredly. She didn\u2019t really.</p><p>\u201cEverything they ask of you, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say, go, you say, all right. They say, give me, you say, how much? They say, go away, you say, fine. They hit you, you defend them. They say, I want your bread, I want your milk, I want your tea, I want your\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly seeing where he was going, Tatiana tried to stop him. \u201cNo, no,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Through clamped teeth, trying to keep his voice quiet, Alexander continued. \u201cThey say, he\u2019s mine, and you say, all right, all right, he\u2019s yours, of course, take him. Nothing matters to me at all. Not me, not my food, not my bread, not my life, and not him either, nothing matters to me.\u201d He brought his face very close to hers and whispered angrily, \u201cI, Tatiana, fight for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana said, looking at him with intense reproach.</p><p>They fell silent until they got their rations. Alexander received potatoes, carrots, bread, soya milk and butter. And sour cream.</p><p>On the street he carried the bag with the food, and she walked mutely beside him. He was walking too fast; she couldn\u2019t keep up. First Tatiana slowed down, and when she saw that he did not shorten his stride, she stopped.</p><p>Turning around, Alexander barked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cGo ahead home. I can\u2019t walk that fast. I\u2019ll be along.\u201d</p><p>He came back and gave her his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said. \u201cTo celebrate our Russian Revolution, the Germans are going to start bombing in a few minutes, and mark my words, they will not end until late tonight.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana took his arm. She wanted to cry, and she wanted to keep up, and she wanted not to be cold. Snow seeped inside her ripped boots that were tied together with twine. Sorrow seeped inside her ripped heart that was tied together with twine.</p><p>They trod through the snow looking at their feet.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you away, Shura,\u201d Tatiana said finally.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d There was so much bitterness in his voice.</p><p>\u201cHow can you do that? How can you turn the right thing I did for my sister into a tragic flaw on my part? You should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am ashamed of myself,\u201d he said.</p><p>She held on tighter to his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be the strong one. I don\u2019t see you fighting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fight for you every day,\u201d said Alexander, walking faster again.</p><p>Pulling on him to slow down, Tatiana laughed soundlessly, the spirit taken away from her by the weakness of her body. \u201cOh, asking Dasha to marry you is fighting for me, is it?\u201d</p><p>From above, Tatiana heard the thunderous burst of clapping followed by a high-pitched warble, becoming more insistent, but not nearly as insistent as the sirens of her heart. \u201cNow that Dimitri is a wounded dystrophic and out of the picture, you\u2019re getting brave!\u201d Tatiana exclaimed. \u201cNow that you think you don\u2019t have to worry about him, you are allowing yourself all sorts of liberties in front of my family, and now you\u2019re getting angry with me over what\u2019s long passed. Well, I won\u2019t have it. You\u2019re feeling bad? Go and marry Dasha. That\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Alexander stopped walking and pulled her into a doorway.</p><p>They got caught in the downpour. Bombs bombs bombs.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask her to marry me!\u201d he yelled. \u201cI agreed to marry Dasha to get Dimitri off your back! Or have you forgotten?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana yelled, \u201cOh, so that was your grand plan! You were going to marry Dasha for me! How thoughtful of you, Alexander, how humane!\u201d</p><p>The words were coming out angry, hurled at him between her frozen breaths, and Tatiana grabbed his coat as she pulled her body against him and pressed her face into his chest. \u201cHow could you!\u201d she yelled. \u201cHow could you . . .\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou asked her to marry you, Alexander . . .\u201d Did she yell that or whisper it? Tatiana shook him \u2014 it was weak and pathetic \u2014 and she pounded his chest with her small mittened fists, but it wasn\u2019t pounding, it was tapping. Alexander grabbed her and hugged her to him so hard that the breath left her body.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d He didn\u2019t let go. She closed her eyes, her fists remaining on his chest.</p><p>Waiting it out in the doorway, she said, looking up at him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Shura? Are you afraid for me? Do you feel I\u2019m close to death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, not looking down at her.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a clear picture of me dying?\u201d she asked, pulling away and going to stand on the other side of the doorway.</p><p>When at last Alexander spoke, his choking voice revealed his emotion. \u201cWhen you die, you\u2019ll be wearing your white dress with red roses, and your hair will be long and falling around your shoulders. When they shoot you, up on your damn roof or walking alone on the street, your blood will look like another red rose on your dress, and no one will notice, not even you when you bleed out for Mother Russia.\u201d</p><p>Trying to swallow the lump in her throat, Tatiana said, \u201cI took the dress off, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Alexander stared onto the street. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Think about how little actually matters now. Look what\u2019s happening. Why are we even standing here? Let\u2019s walk home. Walk home, holding your 300 grams of bread. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t move.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. \u201cTania, why are we still pretending?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy? For whose sake? We have minutes left. And not good minutes. All the layers of our life are being stripped away, and most of our pretenses, too, even mine, and yet we still continue with the lies. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why! I\u2019ll tell you for whose sake!\u201d Tatiana exclaimed. \u201cFor her sake. Because she loves you. Because you want to comfort her in the minutes she has left. That\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Tania?\u201d Alexander asked, his voice cracking. He didn\u2019t say anything else for a moment, staring at her as if he wanted her to say something. She said nothing.</p><p>At last he spoke. \u201cDon\u2019t you want comfort in the minutes you have left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me or you and me anymore.\u201d She lowered her head. \u201cI can take it. She can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it either,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Tatiana raised her eyes and said intensely, \u201cYou can take it, Alexander Barrington. And more. Now, stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to promise me something.\u201d</p><p>His weary eyes blinked at her.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t what?\u201d Alexander asked from across the doorway. \u201cMarry her or break her heart?\u201d</p><p>A small tear ran down Tatiana\u2019s face. Gulping and pulling her coat tighter around herself, she whispered, \u201cBreak her heart.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her in disbelief. She couldn\u2019t believe herself either. \u201cTania, don\u2019t torture me,\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>\u201cShura, promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of your promises or one of mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hearing a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I promise, if you will promise me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you will never wear your white dress again, never give away your bread, never go out onto the roof. If you do, I will tell her everything instantly. Instantly, do you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear,\u201d Tatiana muttered, thinking that really wasn\u2019t very fair.</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d Alexander said, taking her hand and pulling her to him, \u201cthat you will never do any less than your best to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, looking up, her eyes pouring her heart into him. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that one of your promises or one of mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>He took her face in his hands. \u201cIf you stay alive, then I swear to you,\u201d Alexander whispered, pressing her to him, \u201cI won\u2019t break your sister\u2019s heart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>4</p><p>The following morning Tatiana went without him to the store. She had just gotten the family their kilo of bread, light even in her weak arms, and was about to walk out when suddenly she felt a blow to the back of her head and another blow to her right ear. She buckled and watched helplessly as a young boy of maybe fifteen grabbed her bread and before she could utter a sound, shoved it into his hyena mouth, his eyes wild and desperate. The other customers beat him with their purses, but under their blows he continued to swallow her bread until it was all gone, every last bite. One of the store managers came out and hit him with a stick. Tatiana yelled, \u201cNo!\u201d but he fell, and his eyes from the floor were still wild, a destroyed animal\u2019s eyes. Blood dripping out of her ear where he had hit her, Tatiana bent down to help him up, but he shoved her away, got up, and ran out the door.</p><p>The salesclerk couldn\u2019t give her more bread. \u201cPlease,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cHow can I go home with nothing?\u201d</p><p>The clerk, her eyes sympathetic, said, \u201cI can do nothing. The NKVD will shoot me for giving away bread. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged. \u201cFor my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanechka, I would give you bread, but I can\u2019t. The other day they shot three women for forging ration cards. Right on the street. And left them there. Go on, honey. Come back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back tomorrow,\u201d muttered Tatiana as she left the store.</p><p>She could not go home. In fact, she did not go home, but sat in the bomb shelter and then appeared at the hospital to work. Vera was gone; Tatiana\u2019s punch card was gone; no one cared. She went and slept in one of the cold rooms, and in the cafeteria she received some clear liquid and a few spoonfuls of gruel, but there was no extra for her to take home. She looked for Vera to no avail. She sat at the nurses\u2019 station, then went into one of the rooms and sat with a dying soldier. As she held his hand, he asked if she was a nun. She said no, not really, but you can tell me anything.</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to tell you,\u201d the man said. \u201cWhy are you bleeding?\u201d</p> <p>She began to explain, but really there was nothing to say, except \u201cfor the same reason you\u2019re lying here in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana thought of Alexander, how he kept trying to protect her. From Leningrad, from Dimitri, from working at the hospital \u2014 the brutal, infectious, contagious place. From the bricks in Luga. From the German bombs, from the hunger. He didn\u2019t want her to do duty on the roof. He didn\u2019t want her to walk to Fontanka alone or without the absurd helmet he had given her, or to sleep without all her clothes. He wanted her to clean herself, even with cold water, and he wanted her to brush her teeth even though they had no food on them. He wanted just one thing.</p><p>He wanted her to live.</p><p>That brought a bit of relief.</p><p>A bit of comfort.</p><p>That would have to be good enough.</p> <p>When she got home, around seven in the evening, she found her family frantic with worry. After she told them what had happened, they were upset that she hadn\u2019t just come home. \u201cWe would have understood,\u201d said Mama. \u201cWe don\u2019t care about the bread.\u201d</p><p>Dasha said she had sent Alexander out to look for her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop doing that, Dasha,\u201d said Tatiana wearily. \u201cYou\u2019re bound to get him killed.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was surprised her family was not more upset with her. Then she found out why. Alexander had brought them some oil \u2014 and soybeans \u2014 and half an onion. Dasha had made a delicious stew, adding a tablespoon of flour and a bit of salt. \u201cWhere is this stew?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot, Tanechka,\u201d said Dasha.</p><p>\u201cWe thought you\u2019d eat wherever you were,\u201d added Mama.</p><p>\u201cYou ate, right?\u201d asked Babushka.</p><p>\u201cWe were so hungry,\u201d said Marina.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tatiana said, deeply discouraged. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander came back around eight. He had been out for three hours. The first thing he said was, \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana told him.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been all day?\u201d he demanded, talking to her as if there were no one else in the room.</p><p>\u201cI went to the hospital. To see if they had some food there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. I did have some oatmeal.\u201d White water.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Alexander said, taking off his coat. \u201cThere\u2019s some stew.\u201d</p><p>Coughs. Averted eyes.</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t understand. He turned to Dasha. \u201cI brought you soybeans. Dasha? You said you were making stew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did, Alexander,\u201d said Dasha sheepishly. \u201cBut there was so little. We ate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ate it and didn\u2019t leave her any?\u201d He turned red.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, it\u2019s all right,\u201d said Tatiana anxiously. \u201cThey didn\u2019t leave you any either.\u201d</p><p>Dasha laughed nervously. \u201cYou can eat at the barracks, and she said she ate, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a liar!\u201d he screamed.</p><p>\u201cI did eat,\u201d Tatiana put in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar!\u201d Alexander screamed at her. \u201cI forbid you,\u201d he yelled to Tatiana, \u201cI forbid you to get their food for them. Give them back their ration cards and tell them all to get their own damn food. I never want to see you getting their bread for them if they can\u2019t save you some of the food I bring!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stood quietly, her entire heart so full that for a moment she did not need any bread at all.</p><p>Turning to Dasha, Alexander said, out of breath, \u201cWho is going to get your bread for you if she dies? Who is going to carry soup back home in a pail? Who is going to bring you porridge?\u201d</p><p>Mama said disagreeably, \u201cI bring porridge from the factory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou eat half of it before you set foot in the house!\u201d yelled Alexander. \u201cWhat, you think I don\u2019t understand? You think I don\u2019t know that Marina finishes her coupons before the month is out and then demands bread from Tania, who is getting beaten up while you\u2019re still sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping. I sew,\u201d said Mama. \u201cI sew every morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Alexander stated, glaring at her, \u201cyou are not getting them their rations again. Understand?\u201d Again he was talking to her as if there were no one else present.</p><p>Tatiana muttered that she was going to go and wash. When she came back, Alexander was sitting at the table smoking. He was calmer. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Marina was in the other room with Mama. Babushka was down the hall with Nina Iglenko.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Dasha?\u201d Tatiana said, moving slowly toward him. She saw his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGetting a can opener from Nina. Come closer.\u201d</p><p>Standing in front of him, Tatiana said quietly, \u201cShura, please. Where is your indifferent face? You promised me.\u201d</p><p>He stared into her sweater.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me feel worse,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d Reaching out, he placed his hand on her hip. A small groan of anguish escaped him. Tatiana leaned into him and pressed her forehead to his forehead.</p><p>For a moment they stood still.</p><p>She took her forehead away.</p><p>He took his hand away. \u201cLook what I have for you, Tania.\u201d He pulled out a small metal can from his coat.</p><p>Dasha came into the room, saying, \u201cHere\u2019s the can opener. What do you need it for anyway?\u201d</p><p>Alexander used it to open the small can and, taking a knife, cut the product inside into little morsels. He passed the can to Tatiana. \u201cGo ahead, try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, wanting to smile. It was the most delicious thing she had ever tasted. Not quite ham, not quite bologna, not quite pork, but all three, covered with lard and aspic. The can was small, maybe a hundred grams. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d she said, her eyes showing the delight that her body, her lips could not muster.</p><p>\u201cSpam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpam? What is Spam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike ham. In Russian it\u2019s tushonka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s much better than ham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I try it?\u201d asked Dasha.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Alexander didn\u2019t turn to Dasha. \u201cI want your sister to eat the whole can. Dasha, you already ate. You can\u2019t possibly want more after all that stew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want a little bite,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cTo taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania?\u201d Dasha said. \u201cPlease? I\u2019m sorry I ate your stew. I know you\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset, Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, though,\u201d said Alexander, turning to her. \u201cYou\u2019re a grown woman. I expect better from you.\u201d</p><p>Dasha said grumpily, \u201cI said I was sorry.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana took another bite, and another. Half a can left. \u201cAlexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>She had one more bite. Two small pieces left. Tatiana licked up all the lard and the aspic, and then she took one piece out of the can and handed it to Alexander. He shook his head. \u201cPlease,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cOne for you, one for Dasha?\u201d</p><p>Dasha snatched it out of Alexander\u2019s hand. Tatiana gave him the last piece, giving it one more glance. He ate it. Nodding, she licked out the can with her tongue. \u201cThis is the most wonderful thing. Where did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmericans, through Lend-Lease. A case of Spam for Leningrad and two of their army trucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have a case of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They\u2019re very good trucks.\u201d Alexander smiled.</p><p>Tatiana wanted to smile back. Looking away from him and to her sister, Tatiana said, \u201cDasha, honey, how is Nina holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible.\u201d</p><p>After a few minutes Alexander left to go back to the barracks. The next morning, when Tatiana got up to get the rations, Dasha came with her.</p><p>The following morning Dasha stayed in bed, but downstairs on the street a soldier was waiting for Tatiana. \u201cSergeant Petrenko!\u201d she said, managing a smile. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrders of the captain.\u201d He saluted, looking warmly at her. \u201cHe asked me to take you to the store.\u201d</p><p>The morning after that, Petrenko wasn\u2019t downstairs, but Alexander was waiting for Tatiana at Fontanka. He walked her home and went back to base. The next morning he came to the apartment.</p><p>On the way back from the store he had left her to help a lady struggling with two sleds that she was trying to pull by herself down Ulitsa Nekrasova. One had a body wrapped in a white sheet, and one had a bourzhuika. Alexander went to explain to the woman that she would have to come back for one or the other. He told Tatiana he was going to suggest taking the stove and coming back for the body.</p><p>Tatiana was waiting for him patiently and alone, leaning against a building, when she saw three boys approaching her with determined strides. She looked for Alexander, who was maybe a hundred meters away, with his back to Tatiana, pulling one of the sleds for the woman. \u201cAlexander!\u201d she yelled, but the wind was loud and her voice was weak. He didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>Tatiana turned to the boys. One of them she recognized as the boy who had taken her bread three days earlier. The street was deserted, and the snowdrifts were piled meters high on the road. In the snowdrifts lay dead bodies. There were no cars, no buses. Just Tatiana. She sighed. She thought of running across the street, but the effort, the effort. She couldn\u2019t move. She stood.</p><p>When they came close, she extended her and Alexander\u2019s bread to them without a word. Two of them grabbed her and pulled her into a doorway. She struggled, but there was nothing of her to struggle with. The third boy, the hyena from before, took her bread but then looked at her with his beastly eyes and said to the other two, \u201cReady? Let\u2019s go.\u201d A shiny metal blade flashed in front of Tatiana.</p><p>Without blinking or breathing, Tatiana looked the boy in the eye and said, \u201cGo, get away while you have time. Go on, now. He is going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>The boy looked at her and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Tatiana said, but in that instant a pistol handle came down hard on the boy\u2019s head and he dropped to the snow. The other two didn\u2019t have even a moment to let go of her. Alexander smashed his gun into one, then the other. In seconds they were all motionless on the ground.</p><p>Pulling Tatiana out of the doorway and behind him, he said, \u201cStep away,\u201d and cocked his gun, aiming it at her assailants.</p><p>Her hand came up from behind and rested on the gun. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>He pushed her hand away. \u201cTatiana, please. They are going to get up and terrorize someone else. Step back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, please. No. I saw their eyes. They won\u2019t last till morning. Don\u2019t let their deaths be at your hands.\u201d</p><p>Alexander reluctantly put away his gun, then picked up their bag of bread off the ground and, with his arm around Tatiana, walked her back home in the blistering cold. \u201cDo you know what would have happened to you if I hadn\u2019t been there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, wanting to look up at his face but not having the energy to look anywhere but down at the ground. \u201cSame thing that\u2019s happening to me when you are.\u201d</p><p>The next morning Alexander brought her a gun. Not his own standard-issue Tokarev, but a P-38 self-loading German pistol he had acquired near Pulkovo two months earlier.</p><p>\u201cRemember the boys are all cowards; they will only pick on you because they think they can. You don\u2019t have to use the gun. Just flash it at them. They won\u2019t come up to you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, I\u2019ve never used a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s war, Tania!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou remember how you played war with Pasha? Did you play to win? Well, play now. Just remember the stakes are higher.\u201d</p><p>Then he gave her a handful of rubles.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand rubles,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s half my monthly pay. There is no food, but you can still get something on the black market. Go, and don\u2019t even think about the prices. Just buy what you have to. In Haymarket they\u2019re still selling flour, maybe some other things. I\u2019m afraid to leave you, but I have to. Colonel Stepanov wants me to go with our trucks and men to Lake Ladoga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s face was drawn. \u201cThe girls need to go with you to the store, Tatia. Please don\u2019t go by yourself. I won\u2019t be back for a week, maybe ten days. Maybe longer.\u201d The unspoken hung in the crushing cold. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d He paused. \u201cBad news is we\u2019ve lost Tikhvin,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cDimitri shot himself just in time. Tikhvin was\u2014\u201d He broke off. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he continued. \u201cThere is no railroad going to the other side of the lake. The only way to bring food into Leningrad is by Ladoga, but now there\u2019s no way to get the food to Ladoga.\u201d He paused. \u201cThe bread you\u2019re getting \u2014 it\u2019s made from reserve flour. We have to get Tikhvin and the railroad back. Without them we have no realistic way of getting food into the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Meanwhile, the council has issued a command that we have to build a road through the barely inhabited villages up north near Zaborye that lead to the other side of the lake. There\u2019s never been a road there, but we have no choice. Either build the road or die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you get food from there across a barely iced lake?\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s brown eyes were sadder than a calf\u2019s. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get Tikhvin back, there will be no food to bring no matter how well iced the lake is. We have no chance without it,\u201d Alexander said, not touching Tatiana. \u201cNo chance at all.\u201d Reluctantly he added, \u201cHang on to whatever provisions you\u2019ve got left. The ration is going to be reduced again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much left, Shura,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>As they were walking to the corner of Nevsky and Liteyniy where he was going to say good-bye to her, Alexander said, \u201cYesterday you called me Shura in front of your family. You have to be more careful. Your sister is bound to notice that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tatiana said mournfully. \u201cI will have to be more careful.\u201d</p><p>On Haymarket, Tatiana bought less than half a kilo of flour for 500 rubles. Two hundred and fifty rubles a cup. She bought half a kilo of butter for 300 rubles, some soy milk, and a small package of yeast.</p><p>At home they still had a bit of sugar. She made bread.</p><p>That\u2019s what a thousand rubles bought the Metanovs \u2014 half of Alexander\u2019s monthly salary for defending Leningrad bought them a loaf of bread with a smear of butter. Dinner for one night. At least Alexander had gotten them some wood for the stove, and even a little kerosene.</p><p>They broke the bread Tatiana made into five portions, put it on their plates, and ate it with a knife and fork, and afterward Tatiana didn\u2019t know about anyone else, but personally she thanked God for Alexander. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>5</p><p>It was November, and the mornings were dark. They had covered their windows with blankets to keep out the cold, but in doing so they also kept out the light.</p><p>What light? thought Tatiana, as she slowly made her way from the bed to the kitchen with her toothbrush and peroxide one morning in the third week of November. She used to have peroxide and baking soda, but she had left the baking soda on the kitchen sill one evening, and someone had eaten it.</p><p>Tatiana turned on the tap. And turned. And turned.</p> <p>There was no water.</p><p>Sighing, she shuffled back to her room with her toothbrush and her peroxide and got back into bed. Dasha and Marina groaned a little.</p><p>\u201cThere is no water,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>When it was nine in the morning and there was light, Tatiana and Dasha walked to the local council office. An emaciated woman with sores on her face told them that a few days ago power had been cut from the Fifth City Electric Plant because Leningrad had run out of fuel.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it have to do with our water?\u201d asked Dasha.</p> <p>\u201cWhat pumps the water?\u201d asked the woman.</p><p>Dasha, slowly blinking, said, \u201cI give up. Is this a test?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana pulled her sister by the arm. \u201cCome on, Dasha.\u201d She turned to the woman. \u201cThe power will be restored, but the pipes will have frozen for good.\u201d She spoke in an accusing tone. \u201cWe won\u2019t have water till the spring thaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said the woman, going back to her business, \u201cnone of us will be alive in the spring.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana asked around the Fifth Soviet building and found out that the first floor had water \u2014 there just wasn\u2019t enough pressure to pump it all the way up to the third. So the next morning Tatiana went down to the street and got a bucket of snow to carry upstairs. She melted the snow on the bourzhuika and used that water to flush the toilet. Then she went back down to the first floor and got a bucket of clean cold water to wash herself and Dasha and Mama and Marina and Babushka.</p><p>\u201cDasha, can you get up and come with me?\u201d Tatiana said to her sister one morning.</p> <p>Dasha was still in bed under the covers. \u201cOh, Tania,\u201d Dasha mumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s so cold. It\u2019s too hard to get up these days.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t get to the hospital before ten, sometimes eleven, by the time she was done with the water and the ration store.</p><p>They had no more oatmeal left, just a little flour, a little tea and some vodka.</p><p>And three hundred grams of bread a day each for Tatiana, Dasha, and Mama, and two hundred grams of bread each for Marina and Babushka.</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cI\u2019m gaining weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, me, too,\u201d mouthed Marina. \u201cMy feet are three times their normal size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine, too,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cI can\u2019t fit them into my boots. Tania, I can\u2019t go with you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Dasha, my feet aren\u2019t swollen,\u201d said Tatiana.</p> <p>\u201cWhy am I swelling up?\u201d Dasha said in a desperate voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you?\u201d said Marina. \u201cWhy is it always about you? Everything is always about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d exclaimed Marina. \u201cWhat about Tania? That\u2019s the trouble with you, Dasha \u2014 you never see other people around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and you do, you bread-eater? You oatmeal-eater. Wait till I tell Tania how much oatmeal you stole from us, you thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be hungry, but at least I\u2019m not blind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls, girls!\u201d exclaimed Tatiana weakly. \u201cWhat is the point of this? Who is swelling the most? Who is suffering the most? You both win. Now, get into bed and wait for me to come back. And be quiet, both of you, especially you, Marina.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>6</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d said Mama one evening when Babushka was in the other room and the girls were all in bed.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d asked Dasha.</p><p>\u201cAbout Babushka,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that she doesn\u2019t go across the Neva anymore, she\u2019s home all day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Marina, \u201cand now that she\u2019s home all day, she eats what\u2019s left of Alexander\u2019s flour one spoonful at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarina, shut up,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cWe have no flour left. Babushka eats the sweepings from the bottom of the bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Marina changed the subject. \u201cTania, do you think it\u2019s true? Have all the rats left the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Marina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen any cats or dogs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any left,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cThat I know.\u201d She had looked.</p><p>Coming up to the girls\u2019 bed and crouching beside it, Mama shook her head. \u201cListen to me, all of you,\u201d she said. Mama\u2019s voice was not boisterous anymore; it was not strident, it was not loud. It was barely even a voice, certainly not a voice Tatiana recognized as being her mother\u2019s. The kerchief still tied Mama\u2019s hair back from her head. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the cold. She is here all day; do we have enough wood to heat the bourzhuika for her all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Dasha, propping herself up on one elbow. \u201cI know we don\u2019t. We need all the wood we have to heat the bourzhuika at night. We barely have enough for that. Look how long it\u2019s been since we properly heated our rooms from the big stove.\u201d</p><p>Since Alexander was here last, thought Tatiana. He always gets the wood and builds the fire and makes the room warm.</p><p>Wringing her hands, Mama said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to tell her to keep the bourzhuika on all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll tell her that Mama,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cbut soon we will have no wood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTania, she is freezing in the apartment. Do you see how slowly she is moving?\u201d</p><p>Dasha nodded. \u201cShe used to go to the public canteen and spend all day there waiting for some soup, some porridge. Today I never saw her get up from the couch once, not even to eat dinner with us. Tania, can we get her into your hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can try,\u201d said Tatiana from her wall. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there are any spare beds. The children have them all. And the wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try tomorrow, all right?\u201d said Mama. \u201cAt least in the hospital she\u2019ll be warmer. They\u2019re still heating the hospitals, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve closed three wings of the hospital,\u201d Tatiana replied, crawling out of bed. \u201cThey\u2019re keeping just one open. And it\u2019s full.\u201d</p><p>She went to see her grandmother. The blankets had fallen off Babushka Maya, who lay on the sofa covered by just her coat. Tania picked up the blankets and covered Babushka thoroughly, up to her neck, tucking the blankets all around her. She knelt on the floor. \u201cBabushka,\u201d she whispered, \u201ctalk to me.\u201d</p><p>Babushka groaned faintly. Tatiana put her hand on her grandmother\u2019s head. \u201cNo strength left?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot much . . .\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana managed a smile. \u201cBabushka, I remember sitting by you when you painted; the smells of the paint were very strong, and you were always covered with it, and I used to sit so close to you that I would become covered by it, too. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember, sunshine. You were the sweetest child.\u201d She smiled. Tatiana\u2019s hand remained on her.</p><p>\u201cYou taught me how to draw a banana when I was four. I had never seen a banana and couldn\u2019t draw one, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drew a very good banana,\u201d Babushka said, \u201ceven though you had never seen one. Oh, Tanechka . . .\u201d She broke off.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Babushka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, to be young again . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed,\u201d Tatiana whispered, \u201cbut the young ones aren\u2019t doing so well either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot them,\u201d Babushka said, opening her eyes briefly. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>The next morning Tatiana fetched the two buckets of water and then went to get the rations, and when she came back, Babushka was dead. She was lying on the couch, covered by Tatiana\u2019s blankets and a coat, still and cold. Marina, crying, said, \u201cI went in to wake her, and she wasn\u2019t moving.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana and her family stood over Babushka.</p><p>Sniffling, shrugging, turning toward the dining table, Marina said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>And Mama, nodding her head and turning herself, agreed. \u201cYes, let\u2019s have the morning bread. I already made a little chicory to drink. Sarkova warmed up the kitchen stove for breakfast with her own wood. There was a little heat left for me.\u201d</p><p>They sat down at the table, and Tatiana cut their ration into two halves \u2014 just over half a kilo for now, just over half a kilo for later. She divided the half-kilo into four pieces, and they ate, 125 grams each. \u201cMarina,\u201d Tatiana said firmly, \u201cbring your bread home, you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Babushka\u2019s share?\u201d said Marina. \u201cLet\u2019s divide it up and eat it now.\u201d And they did. And then Marina and Dasha and Mama ate the chicory grinds from which they had just made a liquid that looked and smelled like coffee. Tatiana said no to the grinds.</p><p>She told her mother she would go to the local Soviet council to notify them of Babushka\u2019s death so the burial crew could come and take her body. Mama placed her hand on Tatiana. \u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the council comes, they\u2019ll know she is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her rations? They\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana got up from the table. \u201cMama, we\u2019ll still have the coupons until the end of the month. That\u2019s ten more days of her bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but then what?\u201d</p><p>Clearing the table, Tatiana said, \u201cMama, you know what? I\u2019m not really thinking that far ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop clearing, Tania,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cThere is no water to wash anything with. Leave the dishes. All they had was bread on them. We\u2019ll reuse them tonight.\u201d Turning to her mother, Dasha said, \u201cBesides, Mama, if not the council, then who? We can\u2019t move her ourselves. We can\u2019t leave her here. Can we?\u201d She paused. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to eat dinner and sew with our grandmother on the couch.\u201d</p><p>Mama stared at Babushka. \u201cBetter for her to be here than lying out in the street,\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>Tatiana stopped clearing the table and went to get a white sheet from the dresser. \u201cMama, no, we can\u2019t leave her here. A body needs to be buried. Even in the Soviet Union,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cDasha, help me, will you? We need to wrap her before they take her. We\u2019ll wrap her in this.\u201d</p><p>Taking the coat and the blankets off Babushka, Dasha said, \u201cWe\u2019ll keep the blankets. We\u2019ll need them.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana looked around the room. She saw pockets of disarray: books off the shelves, clothes on the floor, plates on the table. Where was the thing she was looking for? Ah, there. She went to the window and picked up a small drawing. It was a charcoal sketch of a latticed apple pie that Babushka had drawn back in September. Tatiana picked it up and placed it gently on Babushka\u2019s chest. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s go,\u201d she said.</p><p>After the girls wrapped Babushka in the sheet, Mama sewed up the top and the bottom, making a sack. Tatiana crossed herself, quickly wiped her tears, and went to the council.</p><p>Later that afternoon two men from the council came. Mama paid them with two shots of vodka each. \u201cCan\u2019t believe you still have vodka, comrade,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cYou\u2019re the first one so far this month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know vodka is the number-one trading item?\u201d said the other man. \u201cYou can get yourself some nice bread if you\u2019ve got any more.\u201d</p><p>The Metanov women exchanged looks. Tatiana knew they had two bottles left. After Papa died, and with Dimitri away, no one drank the vodka except Alexander when he came, and he drank only a little.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking her?\u201d Mama asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll come with you.\u201d They had all stayed home from work.</p><p>The council men said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a full truck waiting outside. There is no room for you on this truck. We\u2019ll be taking her to the closest cemetery. That would be Starorusskaya. Go and see her there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a grave?\u201d Mama said. \u201cA casket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasket?\u201d The man opened his mouth and silently laughed. \u201cComrade, give me the rest of your vodka and I still won\u2019t be able to get you a casket. Who is going to make them? And out of what?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana nodded. She would take a casket and burn it for firewood herself before she used it to bury her grandmother. She shivered, buttoning up her coat.</p><p>\u201cWhat about a grave?\u201d asked Mama, her face ashen and her voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cComrade,\u201d the council man exclaimed, \u201chave you seen the snow, the frozen ground? Come outside with us, come and take a look, and while you\u2019re at it, take a look at our truck.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stepped forward, putting her hand on the man\u2019s arm. \u201cComrade,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cjust get her downstairs for us. That\u2019s the hardest thing. Get her downstairs and we\u2019ll take care of her from there.\u201d</p><p>She went to the attic, where once upon a time they used to hang their washing. There was no washing there now, but she did find what she was looking for \u2014 her childhood sled. It was a brightly painted blue sled with red runners. She carried it downstairs to the street, careful not to slip. Babushka\u2019s body had already been taken down and left on the snowy pavement. \u201cCome on, girls, on one-two-three,\u201d Tatiana said to Marina and Dasha. Marina was too weak to help. Tatiana and Dasha lifted Babushka onto the sled and pulled her three blocks to Starorusskaya, with Mama and Marina following. Tatiana did reluctantly glimpse in the back of the open council truck. The bodies were piled three meters tall, one on top of another.</p><p>\u201cThese are all the people who died today?\u201d she asked the driver.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just what we picked up this morning.\u201d He bent toward her. \u201cYesterday we picked up fifteen hundred bodies off the streets. Sell your vodka, girl, sell it and buy yourself some bread.\u201d</p><p>The entrance to the cemetery was barricaded with corpses, some in white sheets, some without.</p><p>Tatiana saw a mother with a young child who had been pulling their dead father to the cemetery when they themselves froze in the entrance, in the snow. Closing her eyes, Tatiana shook the image out of her head. She wanted to get home. \u201cWe can\u2019t get through. We can\u2019t clear the path. Let\u2019s leave our Babushka,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d She and Dasha took Babushka\u2019s body and laid it gently in the snow next to the cemetery gates. They stood over her for a few minutes.</p><p>Then they went home.</p><p>They sold their two bottles of vodka and received only two loaves of white bread for it on the black market. Now that Tikhvin had gone to the Germans, there was no bread even on the black market. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>7</p><p>A week passed. Tatiana could not flush the toilet. She could not brush her teeth. She could not wash. Alexander would not be happy with that, she thought. They hadn\u2019t heard from Alexander. Was he all right?</p><p>\u201cWhen do you think they will repair the pipes?\u201d Dasha asked one morning.</p><p>\u201cYou should hope not too soon,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re going to have to start doing laundry again.\u201d</p> <p>Dasha came over to Tatiana and hugged her. \u201cI love you. You\u2019re still making jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good ones,\u201d said Tatiana, hugging her sister back.</p><p>Living with small buckets of water was hard. The freezing of the water pipes was worse. But the worst was the spilling of the water that people carried upstairs from the first floor. The water splashed out of the buckets onto the stairs and froze. It was five to twenty degrees below zero every day, and the stairs remained perpetually covered with ice. Every morning, to get the water, Tatiana had to hold the bucket with one hand and the railing with the other, sliding down on her bottom.</p><p>Carrying the full bucket upstairs was much harder. She would fall at least once and have to go back for more water. The more water was spilled on the stairs, the more easily she fell and the thicker the ice on the stairs became. The back stairs were even more treacherous. A woman from the fourth floor fell down a flight, broke her leg, and could not get up. She froze on the stairs, into the ice. No one could move her, before or after.</p><p>Tatiana, Marina, Dasha, and Mama sat on the couch and listened to the radio\u2019s metronome pound its own relentless heartbeat over the airwaves, its frequencies open and occasionally interrupted by a steady stream of words, some sensible, like \u201cMoscow is fighting the enemy for its very life,\u201d some nonsensical, like \u201cThe bread ration is cut once again to 125 grams a day for dependents, 200 grams for workers.\u201d</p> <p>Other words sometimes followed: \u201closses,\u201d \u201cdamage,\u201d \u201cChurchill.\u201d</p><p>Stalin talked of opening a second front in Volkhov. But not until Churchill opened a second one of his own to distract the Germans in the North European countries. Churchill said he had neither the men nor the resources to open a second front, but said he was prepared to repay Stalin for the material losses he had suffered. To which Stalin tartly replied that he would be presenting that bill straight to the F\u00fchrer himself.</p><p>Moscow was in death throes, every last breath expended in the struggle against Hitler. The city was bombed as Leningrad was bombed.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t heard from Babushka Anna in a month,\u201d said Dasha one late November evening. \u201cTania, have you heard from Dimitri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I haven\u2019t,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be hearing from him again, Dasha.\u201d She paused. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard from Alexander for a while either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cThree days ago. I just forgot to tell you. Want to read his letter?\u201d</p> <p>Dear Dasha and all the girls,</p><p>I hope this letter finds you well. Are you waiting for me to return? I am waiting to come back to you.</p><p>My commander sent me up to Kokkorevo \u2014 a fishing village with no fishermen left. It\u2019s a bombed-out hole where the village used to be. We had practically no trucks on this side, certainly no fuel for the ones we do have. There were twenty of us standing around with a couple of horses. We were there to test the ice, to see if it could hold a truck with food and munitions, or at the very least a horse with a sledge filled with food.</p><p>We walked out onto the ice. It\u2019s so cold you\u2019d think the ice would have formed by now, but no. It was surprisingly thin in places. We lost a truck and two horses right away, and then we just stood on the banks of Lake Ladoga and looked at the ice spreading before us, and I said, forget this, give me the damn horse. I hopped on it and rode the mare for four hours \u2014 on ice \u2014 all the way to Kobona! Temperatures were a dozen degrees below zero. I said this ice will suffice.</p><p>As soon as I came back \u2014 with a sledge full of food, I was instantly put in charge of a transport regiment \u2014 another name for a thousand People\u2019s Volunteers. No one would spare real soldiers for this.</p><p>Before the ice got thick enough for the trucks, the volunteers had to ride the horses with the sledges to Kobona to pick up flour and other supplies and ride the horses back. I tell you, your Babushka would have done better than some of those men. They had either never ridden horses or never been out in the cold, or both, because I can\u2019t tell you how many accidents we had with men falling off their horses, falling through the ice, drowning. First day we lost a truck and a load of kerosene right off. We were trying to bring fuel into Leningrad. The fuel shortage is almost as bad as the food shortage. There is no petroleum to fire up the kilns to bake the bread.</p><p>We said, let\u2019s forget the trucks for a few days, let\u2019s just use the horses. Little by little, the horses from Kobona made the thirty-kilometer journey to Kokkorevo. One day we brought in over twenty tons of food. It\u2019s not nearly enough, but it\u2019s something. I\u2019m in Kobona now, loading food onto the sledges, having a hard time looking at flour and knowing you are in your apartment without any. The front-line troop rations have been reduced to half a kilo of bread a day. I heard the dependent ration fell to 125g. We\u2019ll try to get it back up.</p><p>I don\u2019t need to tell you that the Germans are not happy about our little ice road. They bomb it mercilessly, day and night. Less at night. During our first week we lost over three dozen trucks and much food with them. Finally it became clear that I couldn\u2019t be driving the trucks anymore; it was just not putting me to the best use. Now I\u2019m on the Kokkorevo side, as an artillery gunner against the German planes. I\u2019m behind a Zenith antiaircraft weapon. It shoots either machine-gun fire or bombs. It gives me a great feeling of satisfaction to know that I blew up a plane that was going to sink a truck that was bringing food to you.</p> <p>The ice is thick now except for a few weak patches, and we have some good trucks. They can go as fast as forty kilometers an hour across the lake. The other soldiers and I are calling the ice road the Road of Life. Has quite a ring to it, don\u2019t you think?</p><p>Still, without Tikhvin, we\u2019re unable to bring much into Leningrad. We must recapture Tikhvin. What do you think, Dasha, should I volunteer my services for that? Charge the Germans on my starving gray mare, with my brand-new Shpagin machine gun in my arms? I\u2019m just kidding, I think. The Shpagin is a superb gun, though.</p><p>I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be able to return to Leningrad again, but when I do, I\u2019m bringing food with me, so hang on and keep going.</p><p>Courage, all.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Alexander</p><p>Walk, walk, don\u2019t lift your eyes, Tatiana told herself. Pull that scarf over your face, pull it over your eyes if you have to, just don\u2019t look up, don\u2019t see Leningrad, don\u2019t see your courtyard where the bodies pile up, don\u2019t see the streets where the bodies are laid out on the snow, lift your foot and step over them. Walk around the corpse. Don\u2019t look \u2014 you don\u2019t want to see. That morning Tatiana saw a man freshly dead, lying in the street missing most of his torso. Not from a bomb. His flanks had been cut out with a knife. Feeling for Alexander\u2019s pistol in her coat pocket, Tatiana mutely moved through the snowdrifts, her gaze on the ground in front of her.</p><p>She had to brandish Alexander\u2019s pistol twice, out in the street by herself, in the dark of the early morning.</p><p>Thank God for Alexander.</p><p>At the end of November an explosive wave blew out the glass in the room where they ate. They covered the hole with Babushka\u2019s blankets. They had nothing else. The room temperature dropped by thirty degrees, from just above freezing to much below.</p><p>Tatiana and Dasha carried the bourzhuika into their room, placing it in front of Mama\u2019s couch, so when Mama sewed the uniforms she would be warm. Continuing to encourage private initiative, the factory paid her twenty rubles for every extra uniform she sewed above her norm. It took Mama the whole of November to sew five uniforms. Then she gave Tatiana a hundred rubles and told her to go and find something in the stores.</p><p>Tatiana returned with a glass of black dirt. It was the dirt into which the sugar had melted when the Germans bombed the Badayev warehouses in September. As cheerfully as she could, Tatiana said, \u201cOnce the dirt settles to the bottom, our tea will be sweet.\u201d</p><p>Step over, don\u2019t lift your eyes, Tatiana, just stand in line and keep your place; if you lose your place they won\u2019t have any bread for you, and then you\u2019ll have to scavenge the city for another store. Stay, don\u2019t move, someone will come and clear this up. A bomb had fallen into the street, into the line Tatiana was in, right on Fontanka, fell and blew apart half a dozen women. What to do? Take care of the living? Of her family? Or move the dead? Don\u2019t lift your eyes, Tatiana.</p><p>Don\u2019t lift your eyes, Tatiana, keep them peeled to the snow, and look at nothing but your falling-apart boots. Mama once could have made you another pair. But Mama can\u2019t even hand-sew one extra uniform nowadays, with or without Dasha\u2019s help, with or without your help, when in October she was sewing ten a day by machine.</p><p>Alexander! I want to keep my promise to you. I want to stay alive \u2014 but I just don\u2019t see how even I with my small needs and stunted metabolism can make it on 200 grams a day, of which 25 percent is edible cellulose \u2014 sawdust and pine bark. Bread doused with cottonseed cake, previously thought to be poisonous to humans \u2014 not anymore. Bread that is not bread but hardtack \u2014 flour and water. Sea biscuit, you called it? Bread that is as dark and heavy as a cobblestone. I cannot make it on 200 grams a day of that bread.</p><p>I cannot make it on clear soup. I cannot make it on watery porridge.</p><p>Luba Petrova could not. Vera could not. Kirill could not. Nina Iglenko could not. Can Mama and Dasha? Can Marina?</p><p>Whatever I have been doing so far is not enough.</p><p>To live is going to require something more from me, something not of this world. Some other force is needed that can crowd out want with nothing, cold with nothing. Hunger with nothing.</p><p>The desire for food gave way to a terminal malaise, a poxy pallid loss of interest in everything and everybody. The shelling Tatiana completely ignored. She had no strength to run from it, no strength to drop down, no strength to help move bodies or lift victims. A pervasive numbness, an encompassing apathy like a fortress permeated and surrounded her, a fortress broken into by only a spattering of twinges that resembled feeling.</p><p>Her mother tweaked her heart; Dasha stirred her affections. Marina \u2014 even Marina, despite her miserable greed \u2014 moved something inside Tatiana, who didn\u2019t judge her but was disappointed. Nina Iglenko had aroused some pity as she waited for her last son to die before she died herself.</p><p>Tatiana had to stop feeling. Already she set her teeth to get through her day. She would have to set them harder. Because there was no food anymore.</p><p>I won\u2019t shudder, and I won\u2019t flinch from my short life, I won\u2019t lower my head. I will find a way to lift my eyes.</p><p>Keep everything out. Except for you, Alexander. Keep you in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>FORTRESS PIECES</p><p>THE flip side of white nights \u2014 Leningrad\u2019s December. White nights \u2014 light, summer, sunshine, a pastel sky. December \u2014 darkness, blizzards, cloud cover, a hunkering sky. An oppressive sky.</p><p>Bleak light appeared at around ten in the morning. It hovered around until about two, then reluctantly vanished, leaving darkness once more.</p><p>Complete darkness. In early December the electricity was turned off in Leningrad not for a day but seemingly for good. The city was plunged into perpetual night. Trams stopped running. Buses hadn\u2019t run in months because there was no fuel.</p> <p>The workweek was reduced to three days, then two days, then one day. Electricity was finally restored to a few businesses essential to the war effort: Kirov, the bread factory, the waterworks, Mama\u2019s factory, a wing in Tatiana\u2019s hospital. But the trams had stopped running permanently. There was no electricity in Tatiana\u2019s apartment and no heat. Water remained only on the first floor, down the icy slide.</p><p>These days brought a pall with the morning that blighted Tatiana\u2019s spirit. It became impossible to think about anything but her own mortality \u2014 impossible as it was.</p><p>At the beginning of December, America finally entered the war, something about the island of Hawaii and the Japanese. \u201cAh, maybe now that America is on our side . . .\u201d said Mama, sewing.</p><p>A few days after news of America, Tikhvin was recaptured. Those were words Tatiana understood. Tikhvin! It meant railroad, meant ice road, meant food. Meant an increase in ration?</p><p>No, it didn\u2019t mean that.</p> <p>A hundred and twenty-five grams of bread.</p><p>When the electricity went out, the radio stopped working. No more metronome, no more news reports. No light, no water, no wood, no food. Tick tock. Tick tock.</p><p>They sat and stared at each other, and Tatiana knew what they were thinking.</p><p>Who was next?</p><p>\u201cTell us a joke, Tania.\u201d</p><p>Sigh. \u201cA customer asks the butcher, \u2018Can I have five grams of sausage, please?\u2019</p> <p>\u201c \u2018Five grams?\u2019 the butcher repeats. \u2018Are you mocking me?\u2019</p><p>\u201c \u2018Not at all,\u2019 says the customer. \u2018If I were mocking you, I would have asked you to slice it.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Sighs. \u201cGood joke, daughter.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was coming back to the rooms dragging her bucket of water behind her through the hall. Crazy Slavin\u2019s door was closed. It occurred to Tatiana that it had been closed for some time. But Petr Petrov\u2019s door was open. He was sitting at his small table trying unsuccessfully to roll a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help with that?\u201d she asked, leaving her bucket on the floor and coming in.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tanechka, yes,\u201d he said in a defeated voice. His hands were shaking.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Go to work, there\u2019ll be something there for lunch. They still feed you at Kirov, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Kirov had been nearly destroyed by German artillery from just a few kilometers south in Pulkovo, but the Soviets had built a smaller factory inside the crumbled fa?ade, and until a few days ago Petr Pavlovich took tram Number 1 all the way to the front.</p> <p>Tatiana faintly remembered tram Number 1.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Tanechka. You\u2019ve got enough to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d She paused. \u201cIs it the bombs?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot the food, not the bombs?\u201d She looked at his bald shrunken head and went to close the door to his room. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, quieter.</p><p>Petr Pavlovich told her that he was moved to Kirov only recently to fix the motors of tanks that had broken down. There were no shipments, no new parts, and no actual tank motors.</p><p>\u201cI figured out a way to make airplane motors fit the tanks. I figured out how to repair them to use in the tanks, and then I fix them for airplanes, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d she said. \u201cFor that you get a worker\u2019s ration, right?\u201d She added, \u201cThree hundred and fifty grams of bread?\u201d</p><p>He waved at her and took a drag of the cigarette. \u201cThat\u2019s not it. It\u2019s the Satan spawn, the NKVD.\u201d He spit with malice. \u201cThey were ready to shoot the poor bastards before me who couldn\u2019t fix the engines. When I was brought in, they stood over me with their f*cking rifles to make sure I could fix the equipment.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana listened to him, her hand on his back, her bones chilled, her heart chilled. \u201cBut you did fix them, comrade,\u201d she breathed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, but what if I didn\u2019t?\u201d he said. \u201cIsn\u2019t the cold, the hunger, the Germans enough? How many more ways are there to kill us?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana backed away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your wife,\u201d she uttered, opening the door.</p><p>That afternoon as she was coming back home, his door was still open. Tatiana glanced in. Petr Pavlovich Petrov was still sitting behind his desk, the half-smoked cigarette Tatiana had rolled for him in his hands. He was dead. With trembling fingers Tatiana made the sign of the cross and closed the door.</p><p>They stared at each other from the couch, from the bed, across the room. The four of them. They slept and ate in one room now. They would put the plates on their laps and they would have their evening bread. And then they would sit in front of the bourzhuika and watch the flames through the small window in the stove. That was the only light in the room. They had plenty of wick, and they had matches, but they had nothing to burn. If only they had some\u2014</p><p>Nothing to burn. Oh, no. Tatiana remembered.</p><p>The motor oil. The motor oil Alexander had told her to buy on the Sunday in June when there was still ice cream, and sunshine, and a glimmer of joy. He had told her \u2014 and she hadn\u2019t listened.</p><p>And now look.</p><p>No tick tock, tick tock anymore.</p><p>\u201cMarina, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Marina was peeling the wallpaper off the wall one December afternoon. Ripping off a chunk, she went to the bucket of water, dipped her hand in it, and moistened the backing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tatiana repeated.</p><p>Taking a spoon, Marina started to scrape off the wallpaper paste. \u201cThe woman in front of me in line today said some of the wallpaper paste was made with potato flour.\u201d She was scraping frantically at the paper.</p><p>Carefully Tatiana took the paper away from Marina. \u201cPotato flour and glue,\u201d Tatiana said.</p><p>Marina ripped the paper back from Tatiana. \u201cDon\u2019t touch that. Get your own.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana repeated, \u201cPotato flour and glue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlue is poison.\u201d</p><p>Marina laughed soundlessly, scraping off the damp paste and spooning it into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cDasha, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lighting the bourzhuika.\u201d Dasha was standing in front of the stove window, throwing books onto the flames.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re burning books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? We have to be warm.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana grabbed Dasha\u2019s hand. \u201cNo, Dasha. Stop. Don\u2019t burn books, please. We haven\u2019t been reduced to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania! If I had more energy, I would kill you and slice you open and eat you,\u201d Dasha said, throwing another book onto the fire. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dasha,\u201d Tatiana said, holding on to her sister\u2019s wrist. \u201cNot books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no wood,\u201d said Dasha matter-of-factly.</p><p>As quickly as she could, Tatiana went and checked under her bed. Her Zoshchenko, John Stuart Mill, the English dictionary. She remembered that on Saturday afternoon she had been reading Pushkin and had carelessly left the precious volume by the couch. She turned to Dasha, who kept relentlessly throwing more books onto the fire.</p><p>In horror, Tatiana saw The Bronze Horseman in her sister\u2019s hands. \u201cDasha, no!\u201d she screamed, and lunged at her sister. Where did she find the strength to scream, to lunge? Where did she find the strength for emotion?</p><p>She grabbed it, YANKED it out of Dasha\u2019s hands. \u201cNo!\u201d She clutched her book to her chest. \u201cOh, my God, Dasha,\u201d Tatiana said trembling. \u201cThat\u2019s my book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all our books, Tania,\u201d Dasha said apathetically. \u201cWho cares now? To stay warm is everything.\u201d</p><p>Licking her lips, Tatiana couldn\u2019t speak for a while, she was so shaken. \u201cDasha, why books? We have the whole dining room set. A table and six chairs. It will last us the winter if we\u2019re careful.\u201d She wiped her mouth and stared at her hand. It was streaked with blood.</p><p>\u201cYou want to saw up the dining room set?\u201d Dasha said, throwing Karl Marx\u2019s Communist Manifesto onto the fire. \u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>Something was happening to Tatiana. She didn\u2019t want to scare her mother or her sister. She knew that Marina was beyond fear. Tatiana waited for Alexander. She would ask him what was happening to her. But before he came back and she had a chance to ask him, she noticed that Marina, too, was bleeding from her mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Marina,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Finally a doctor came to take a look at them. \u201cScurvy,\u201d the doctor said flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s scurvy, girls. Everybody has it. You\u2019re bleeding from the inside out. Your capillaries are getting too thin, and they\u2019re breaking. You need vitamin C. Let\u2019s see if we can get you a shot.\u201d</p><p>They both got a shot of vitamin C.</p><p>Tatiana got better.</p><p>Marina didn\u2019t.</p><p>In the night she whispered to Tatiana, \u201cTania, you listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Marinka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d she whispered, and if she could have cried, she would have. She was barely able to emit a low wail. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die, Tania! If I hadn\u2019t stayed here with Mama, I would be in Molotov right now with Babushka, and I wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die,\u201d said Tatiana, putting her hand on Marina\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d whispered Marina, \u201cand not feel just once what you feel.\u201d She struggled for her breath. \u201cJust once in my life, Tania!\u201d</p><p>As if from a distance, Dasha\u2019s voice came at them. \u201cWhat does Tania feel?\u201d</p><p>Marina didn\u2019t reply. \u201cTanechka . . .\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does what feel like?\u201d asked Dasha. \u201cIndifference? Cold? Wasting away?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana continued to gently caress Marina\u2019s forehead. \u201cIt feels,\u201d she whispered, \u201cas if you\u2019re not alone. Now, come on, where is your strength? Do you remember us with Pasha, me rowing and you and Pasha swimming alongside trying to keep up? Where is that strength, Marinka?\u201d</p><p>The next morning Marina lay dead beside Tatiana.</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cWe have her rations until the end of the month,\u201d barely blinking at the sight of her dead cousin.</p><p>Tatiana shook her head. \u201cAs you know, she has already eaten them. It\u2019s the middle of the month. She\u2019s got nothing left until the end of December.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wrapped her cousin in a white sheet, Mama sewed up the top and bottom, and they slid Marina down the stairs and onto the street. They tried to put her in the sled, but they couldn\u2019t lift her. After Tatiana made the sign of the cross on Marina, they left her on the snowy pavement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>One more day, another shot of vitamin C. Another two hundred grams of blackened bread. Tatiana pretended to go to work so she could continue to receive a worker\u2019s ration, but there was nothing for her to do at work, except sit by the dying.</p><p>A week after Marina died, Tatiana, Dasha, and Mama were sitting on the sofa in the quiet night in front of a nearly extinguished bourzhuika. All the books were gone, except for what Tatiana hid under her bed. The embers did not light up the room. Mama was sewing in the dark.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sewing, Mama?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Mama said. \u201cNothing important. Where are my girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha, remember Luga?\u201d</p><p>Dasha remembered.</p><p>\u201cDashenka, remember when Tania got a fish bone stuck in her throat, and we couldn\u2019t get it out for anything?\u201d</p> <p>Dasha remembered. \u201cShe was five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho got it out, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPasha. He had such small hands. He just stuck his hand in your throat and pulled it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Dasha said, \u201cremember when our Tania fell out of the boat in Lake Ilmen, and we all jumped after her, because we thought she couldn\u2019t swim, and she was already dog-paddling away from the boat?\u201d</p><p>Mama remembered. \u201cTania was two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Tatiana said, \u201cremember how I dug that big hole in our yard to trap Pasha and then forgot to fill it up, and you fell in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d said Mama. \u201cI\u2019m still angry about that.\u201d</p><p>They tried to laugh.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d said Mama, her hands moving on her sewing work, \u201cwhen you and Pasha were born, we were in Luga, and while the whole family was clucking around our new boy Pasha, saying what a great boy he was and what a fine boy, Dasha over here, all seven years of her, picked you up and said, \u2018Well, you can all have the black one. I\u2019m taking the white one. This baby is mine.\u2019 And we all teased her and said, \u2018Fine then. Dasha, you want her? You can name her.\u2019 \u201d Mama\u2019s voice cracked once, twice. \u201cAnd our Dasha said, \u2018I want to name my baby Tatiana . . . \u2019 \u201d</p><p>One more day, one more shot of vitamin C for Tatiana, whose fingers trickled blood onto the two hundred grams of bread she cut up for her mother and sister.</p><p>One more day, a bomb fell in the corner of the Fifth Soviet roof. No Anton to put it out, no Mariska, no Kirill, no Kostia, and no Tatiana. It caught fire and burned through the fourth floor, which faced the church on Grechesky Prospekt. No one came to put it out. It smoldered for a day and then gradually burned itself out.</p><p>Was it Tatiana\u2019s imagination, or was the city quieter? Either she was going deaf or there was less bombing. There was still some every day, but shorter in duration, milder in intensity, almost as if the Germans were bored with the whole thing. And why not? Who was left to bomb?</p><p>Well, Tatiana.</p><p>And Dasha.</p> <p>And Mama.</p><p>No, not Mama.</p><p>Her hands still held the white camouflage uniform she was sewing, and underneath her wool hat she wore her kerchief. In front of the frail fire from the small bourzhuika, Mama said, \u201cI can\u2019t anymore. I just can\u2019t.\u201d Her hands stopped moving, and her head, too. Her eyes remained open. Tatiana could see short spasms of breath leaving her mouth, short, brief, then gone.</p><p>Tatiana and Dasha kneeled by their mother. \u201cI wish we knew a prayer, Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know part of something called the Lord\u2019s Prayer,\u201d said Dasha.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s back was to the fire, and her back was warm, but her front was cold. \u201cWhich part do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the part with Give us this day our daily bread.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana placed her hand on her mother\u2019s lap. \u201cWe\u2019ll bury Mama with her sewing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to bury her in her sewing,\u201d Dasha said, and her voice was weak. \u201cLook, she was sewing herself a sack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Lord,\u201d said Tatiana, holding her mother\u2019s cold leg. \u201cGive us this day our daily bread . . .\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat else, Dasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I know. What about Amen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>For dinner they cut the bread into three pieces. Tatiana ate hers. Dasha ate hers. They left their mother\u2019s on her plate.</p><p>That night Tatiana and Dasha held each other in their bed. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me, Tania. I can\u2019t make it without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to leave you, Dasha. We are not going to leave each other. We can\u2019t be left alone. You know that we all need one other person. One other person to remind us we are still human beings and not beasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the only two left, Tania,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cJust you and me.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana held her sister closer. You. Me. And Alexander. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>3</p><p>Alexander returned a few days later. The dark circles around his eyes and his thick black beard gave him a robber baron look, but otherwise he seemed to be holding up. That made Tatiana warmer on the inside. Seeing him, in fact . . . well, what could she say? Dasha stood in the hallway, and his arms were around Dasha, while Tatiana stood back and watched them. And he watched her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u2018How are my girls?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cNot so good, Alexander,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cNot so good. Come, look at our mother. She\u2019s been dead for five days. The council doesn\u2019t come anymore. We can\u2019t move her.\u201d</p><p>Behind Dasha, Alexander walked past Tatiana and glided his gloved hand across her face.</p><p>He placed their mother in the white camouflage uniform cape and carried her \u2014 taking care not to slip on the ice \u2014 down the stairs, put her on Tatiana\u2019s red and blue shiny sled, and pulled her to the cemetery on Starorusskaya as the girls walked beside him. He moved the frozen bodies at the entrance gate to make way for the sled and pulled Mama all the way inside, where he gently laid her in the snow. He broke off two small branches and held them in front of Tatiana, who with a piece of twine tied them together in a cross, which they laid on top of Mama.</p><p>\u201cDo you know a prayer, Alexander?\u201d asked Tatiana. \u201cFor our mother?\u201d</p><p>Alexander stared at Tatiana, then shook his head. She watched him cross himself and mutter a few words under his cold breath.</p> <p>As they were walking out, Tatiana asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t know a prayer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in Russian,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>Back in the apartment he was almost cheerful. \u201cGirls,\u201d he said, \u201cyou won\u2019t believe what goodies I have for you.\u201d He paused. \u201cJust for you.\u201d</p><p>He had brought them a sack of potatoes, seven oranges he had found God knows where, half a kilo of sugar, a quarter kilo of barley, linseed oil, and, smiling with all his teeth at Tatiana, three liters of motor oil.</p><p>If she could have, Tatiana would have smiled back.</p><p>Alexander showed her how to make light with the motor oil. After pouring a few teaspoons of the oil between two saucers, he placed a moistened wick inside, leaving the end out, and lit the wick. The oil illuminated an area big enough to sew or read by. Then he went out and returned half an hour later with some wood. He said he had found the broken beams in the basement. He fetched them water.</p> <p>Tatiana wanted to touch him. But Dasha was taking care of that. Dasha was not leaving his side. Tatiana couldn\u2019t even meet his eyes. She got a pot and made some tea and put sugar in it; what a revelation. She cooked three potatoes and some barley. She broke their bread. They ate. Afterward she warmed up the water on the bourzhuika, asked Alexander for some soap, and washed her face and neck and hands.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Alexander,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cHave you heard from Dimitri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd no, I haven\u2019t. You?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, my hair has started to fall out,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cLook.\u201d She pulled out a black clump.</p><p>\u201cDash, don\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, turning back to Tatiana. \u201cHas your hair begun to fall out, too?\u201d His eyes on her were so warm, almost like a bourzhuika.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered softly. \u201cMy hair can\u2019t afford to fall out. I\u2019ll be bald tomorrow. I\u2019m bleeding, though.\u201d She glanced at him and wiped her mouth. \u201cMaybe an orange will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat all seven of them, but slowly. And, girls, don\u2019t go out in the street at night. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd always lock your doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how come I waltzed right in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania did it. She left it open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop blaming your sister. Just lock the damn doors.\u201d</p><p>After dinner Alexander retrieved a saw from the kitchen and sawed the dining-room table and the chairs into small pieces to fit into the bourzhuika. As he was working, Tatiana stood by his side. Dasha sat on the couch, bundled in blankets. The room was cold. They never went into this room anymore. They slept and ate and sat in the next room, where the windows weren\u2019t broken.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, how many tons of flour are they feeding us on now?\u201d asked Tatiana, taking the sawed pieces from him and stacking them in the corner.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander.\u201d</p><p>Great sigh. \u201cFive hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive hundred tons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cFive hundred sounds like a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many tons of flour did they give us during the July rations?\u201d Tatiana wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I, Leningrad food chief Pavlov?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me. How many?\u201d</p><p>Great sigh. \u201cSeventy-two hundred.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said nothing, glancing at Dasha sitting on the couch. Dasha is withdrawing, Tatiana thought, her unblinking eyes focusing on Alexander. Putting on her most chipper voice, Tatiana said tremulously, \u201cLook on the bright side \u2014 five hundred tons goes a lot further than it used to.\u201d</p><p>The three of them sat huddled on the couch in semidarkness in front of the bourzhuika that had just a bit of light coming out from its little metal door. Alexander was between Tatiana and Dasha. Tatiana wore her quilted coat that Mama had sewn for her and quilted trousers. She pulled her hat over her ears and her eyes. Only her nose and mouth were exposed to the air in the room. A blanket lay across their legs. At one point Tatiana thought she was going to sleep and leaned her head to the right \u2014 on Alexander. His hand came to rest on her lap.</p><p>Alexander spoke. \u201cThe saying goes, \u2018I\u2019d like to be a German soldier with a Russian general, British armaments, and American rations.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI would just like to have American rations,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cAlexander, now that the Americans are in the war, will it be easier for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this for a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Now that the Americans are in the war, there is hope.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana heard Dasha\u2019s voice. \u201cIf we come out of this, Alexander, I swear we are leaving Leningrad and moving to the Ukraine, to the Black Sea, somewhere where it isn\u2019t ever cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo place like that in Russia,\u201d he replied. He wore his quilted khaki coat on top of his uniform, and his shapka covered his ears. Dasha insisted. Alexander said, \u201cNo. We\u2019re too far north. Winters are cold in Russia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a place on earth where it doesn\u2019t get below freezing in the winter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArizona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArizona. Is that somewhere in Africa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mildly he sighed. \u201cTania, do you know where Arizona is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerica,\u201d Tatiana replied. The only warmth was coming from the little window in the stove. And from Alexander. She pressed her head into his arm.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a state in America,\u201d he said. \u201cNear California. It\u2019s desert land. Forty degrees in the summer. Twenty degrees in the winter. Every year. Never freezes. Never has snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cYou\u2019re telling us fairy tales. Tell it to Tatiana. I\u2019m too old for fairy tales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth. Never.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed, Tatiana listened to the resonant lilting of Alexander\u2019s voice. She never wanted him to stop talking. You have a good voice, Alexander, she thought. I can imagine myself drifting off, hearing only your voice, calm, measured, courageous, deep, spurring me on to eternal rest. Go, Tatia, go.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cWhat do they do in the winter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wear a long-sleeved shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cNow I know you\u2019re making it up.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana pulled up her hat and stared into the flickering copper light of the stove.</p><p>\u201cTatia?\u201d Alexander said quietly. \u201cYou know I\u2019m telling the truth. Would you like to live in Arizona, \u2018the land of the small spring\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Her voice flat and apathetic, Dasha asked, \u201cWhat did you call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>Dasha shook her head. \u201cNo. The accent was in the wrong place for Tatiana. T\u00e1tia. I\u2019ve never heard you call her that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Alexander,\u201d said Tatiana, pulling the hat over her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>Dasha struggled up. \u201cI don\u2019t care. Call her anything you want.\u201d</p><p>She stepped out to go to the bathroom.</p><p>Tatiana continued to sit next to Alexander, but her head was not resting on him anymore.</p><p>\u201cTatia, Tatiasha, Tania,\u201d he whispered, \u201ccan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hear you, Shura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPress your head into me again. Go on.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He took her mittened hand and kissed it. \u201cCourage, Tatiana. Courage.\u201d</p><p>I love you, Alexander, thought Tatiana.</p><p>The following day Alexander came back in the evening and said happily, \u201cGirls! You know what day today is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>They looked at him blankly. Tatiana had gone to the hospital for a few hours. What she did there, she could not remember. Dasha seemed even more unfocused. They attempted to smile, and failed. \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d asked Dasha.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>They stared.</p><p>\u201cCome, look, I brought us three cans of tushonka.\u201d He grinned. \u201cOne each. And some vodka. But only a little bit. You don\u2019t want to be drinking too much vodka.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana and Dasha continued to stare at him. Tatiana finally said, \u201cAlexander, how will we even know when it\u2019s New Year? We have only the wind-up alarm clock that hasn\u2019t been right in months. And the radio is not working.\u201d</p><p>Alexander pointed to his wristwatch. \u201cI\u2019m on military time. I always know precisely what time it is. And you two have got to be more cheerful. This is no way to act before a celebration.\u201d</p><p>There was no table to set anymore, but they laid their food out on plates, sat on the couch in front of the bourzhuika, and ate their New Year\u2019s Eve dinner of tushonka, some white bread and a spoonful of butter. Alexander gave Dasha cigarettes and Tatiana, with a smile, a small hard candy, which she gladly put in her mouth. They sat chatting quietly until Alexander looked at his watch and went to pour everyone a bit of vodka. In the darkened room they stood up a few minutes before twelve and raised their glasses to 1942.</p><p>They counted down the last ten seconds, and clinked and drank, and then Alexander kissed and hugged Dasha, and Dasha kissed and hugged Tatiana, and said, \u201cGo on, Tania, don\u2019t be afraid, kiss Alexander on New Year\u2019s,\u201d and went to sit on the couch, while Tatiana raised her face to Alexander, who bent to Tatiana and very carefully, very gently kissed her on the lips. It was the first time his lips had touched hers since St. Isaac\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>Dasha was on the couch with her eyes closed, a drink in one hand, a cigarette in the other. \u201cHere\u2019s to 1942,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to 1942,\u201d echoed Alexander and Tatiana, allowing themselves a glance before he went to sit next to Dasha.</p><p>Afterward they all lay down in the bed together, Tatiana next to her wall, turned to Dasha, turned to Alexander. Are there any layers left? she thought. There is hardly life left, how can anything be covering our remains?</p><p>The day after New Year\u2019s, Alexander and Tatiana slowly made their way to the post office. Every week Tatiana still went to check if there were any letters from Babushka and to send her a short note. Since Deda died, they had received just one letter from her, telling them she had moved from Molotov to a fishing village on the mighty Kama.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s letters were brief; she could not get out more than a few paragraphs. She wrote to Babushka about the hospital, about Vera, about Nina Iglenko, and a little about crazy Slavin, who before his inexplicable disappearance two weeks earlier had spent the days and nights, as always, on the floor of the corridor, halfway in, halfway out, indifferent to the bombing and the hunger, his only nod to winter being a blanket over his sunken frame. Slavin, Tatiana could write about. Herself, she could not; even less about the family. She left that to Dasha, who always seemed to manage to write a bright sentence to tack onto Tatiana\u2019s grim paragraph. Tatiana didn\u2019t know how to hide the Leningrad of October, November, December 1941. Dasha, however, hid it all, constantly and cheerfully writing only about Alexander and their plans for marriage. Well, she was a grown-up. Grown-ups could hide so well.</p><p>The letter Tatiana was carrying today did not have an addendum from Dasha, who had been too tired yesterday to write.</p><p>Alexander and Tatiana made their careful way in the snow, their faces down and away from the choking wind. The snow was getting inside Tatiana\u2019s shredded boots and not melting. Holding on to Alexander\u2019s arm, she was thinking about her next letter. Maybe in the next letter she could write about Mama. And Marina. And Aunt Rita. And Babushka Maya.</p><p>The post office was on the first floor of the old building on Nevsky. It used to be on the ground floor, but high explosives blew out the windows on the ground floor, and the glass could not be replaced. So the post office moved upstairs. The problem with upstairs was that it was hard to get to. The stairs were covered with ice and bodies.</p><p>At the foot of the stairs Alexander said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, I have to go. I have to report back at noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s many hours till noon,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, it\u2019s eleven. It took us an hour and a half to get here.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana felt even colder. \u201cGo, Shura, get out of the cold,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Fixing her scarf, Alexander said, \u201cDon\u2019t go to any stores. Go straight home. I already gave you my ration. And we spent all my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you coming back tonight?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving tonight. I\u2019m going back up. My replacement gunner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. You promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatia, I\u2019m going to try to get you and Dasha out of Leningrad on one of the trucks. You hang on until I can do it, all right?\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. She wanted to tell him she was grateful to be able to look into his face but didn\u2019t have the energy. Nodding, she turned to walk up the stairs. Alexander remained at the bottom. She slipped on the second step and stumbled backward. Putting his hands out, Alexander caught her, straightening her up. She grabbed on to the railing and then turned around to him. Something resembling a smile passed over her face. \u201cI really am all right without you,\u201d she said. \u201cI can manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the ravenous boys who follow you home?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana warmed her eyes, so she could look at him with the truth that was inside her. \u201cI really am not all right without you,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cHold on to the rail.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Tatiana walked up the slippery stairs. At the top she turned around to see if Alexander was still there. He was, looking up at her. She pressed her gloved hand to her lips.</p><p>The morning after the post office Dasha could not get up. \u201cDasha, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. You go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will go, but, Dasha, I don\u2019t want to go by myself. Alexander is not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana fixed the blankets and coats on top of her. Even as she begged Dasha to get up, Tatiana knew that her sister wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Dasha\u2019s eyes were closed, and she was lying in the same position in which she had fallen asleep the night before. Dasha had also been very quiet the night before. Very quiet except for a cough. \u201cPlease get up. You need to get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get up later,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cI just can\u2019t right now.\u201d Her eyes were closed.</p><p>Tatiana went to fetch water from downstairs. That took her an hour. She lit the fire in the bourzhuika, putting a chair leg in it, and when the fire was started, she made Dasha some tea.</p><p>After she had fed Dasha small spoonfuls of the barely brown, barely sweet liquid, she left by herself to go to the ration store. It was ten in the morning but still dark. At eleven it would be light, Tatiana thought. When I\u2019m coming back with the bread it will be light. \u201cGive us this day our daily bread,\u201d she whispered to herself. I wish I had known that earlier. I could have said that prayer every day since September.</p><p>It\u2019s dark all the time now. Was it late? Was it early? Was it evening or night? She looked at the alarm clock. She couldn\u2019t make out the hands in the dark. I don\u2019t see light. In the morning it\u2019s dark, and when I drag the bucket of water up the stairs, it\u2019s dark, and when I wash Dasha\u2019s face and go to the store and the bombs fly, it\u2019s dark. Then a building explodes and burns brightly, and I can go and stand in front of it and warm up a bit. The fire reddens my face, and I stand \u2014 for how long? Well, today, I stood until around noon. I didn\u2019t get to the hospital until one. Tomorrow maybe I can go and find another fire somewhere. But at home it\u2019s dark. Alexander\u2019s oil and wick in the little plate help, I can sit and look at a book, maybe, or at Dasha\u2019s face.</p><p>Dasha \u2014 why is she staring at me like that? She has not been herself for five days. She hasn\u2019t gotten out of bed for the last three. Her eyes are darker \u2014 what\u2019s in them? She is staring as if she doesn\u2019t know who I am.</p><p>\u201cDasha? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>Dasha staring, not replying. Not moving.</p><p>\u201cDasha!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you screaming at?\u201d Dasha said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana came and kneeled by Dasha\u2019s face. \u201cWhat, honey?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Up in Ladoga?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is he coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Maybe tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Dasha staring.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Even in her own half-extinguished life, Tatiana was aghast. \u201cOf course not. You\u2019re my sister. We all need a second person to remain human, Dasha, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my second person, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who is yours?\u201d whispered Dasha.</p><p>There it is.</p><p>Tatiana blinked. \u201cYou,\u201d she said. Inaudibly.</p><p>ACROSS THAT FORMIDABLE SEA</p><p>I saw you, Tatiana,\u201d said Dasha in the darkness. \u201cI saw you and him together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Tatiana\u2019s heart stopped.</p><p>\u201cI saw you. You didn\u2019t know I was watching you. But I saw you five days ago at the post office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat post office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went to the post office.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana, kneeling by Dasha\u2019s head, thought back. Post office, post office. What happened at the post office? She could not remember. \u201cYou know we went to the post office. We told you we were going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that. He goes with you everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe goes to protect us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dasha, us. He is very worried about us. You know why he goes with me. Did you forget about the food he brings us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about any of that,\u201d Dasha said.</p><p>\u201cBecause of him, no one takes our bread. No one takes our ration cards. How do you think I\u2019ve fed you? He has kept the cannibals from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d</p><p>But Tatiana did. \u201cDasha, he brings me bread from dead soldiers to give to you, and when he can\u2019t find that, he gives me half of his ration to give to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana, he brings it to you so you will love him.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, Tatiana said, \u201cWhat?\u201d Recovering quickly, she said, \u201cWrong again. He gives it to you so you will live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania, nothing. Why did you follow me to the post office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt guilty for not writing to Babushka. She looks forward to my notes. You are too depressing for her. You just can\u2019t hide the truth like I can. Or so I thought,\u201d Dasha said. \u201cI wrote her a cheery note. I didn\u2019t follow you. I saw you already at the post office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went to the store first.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana got up to put another chair leg in the fire. The chair leg wasn\u2019t going to last all night, but they had to ration themselves. When Alexander sawed up the table for them, Tatiana didn\u2019t realize how much they wanted to be warm. The whole table was gone. Four chairs remained.</p><p>When Alexander brought them food, Tatiana didn\u2019t realize how much they wanted to be full. The potatoes were gone. The oranges were gone. Only a bit of the barley remained.</p><p>When Tatiana came back to bed, she pulled the blankets and coats higher over Dasha and climbed in herself, wanting to turn to the wall. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak for a few minutes. Dasha slowly turned around to face Tatiana. \u201cI want him to die at the front,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d said Tatiana, wanting to cross herself but unable to lift her cold arm out of the warm blanket. She was too weak for inflection. Soon the fire would go out. They would be plunged into black again. They were both spent and done. Tatiana thought they were too weak for heartbreak.</p><p>But when Dasha said, \u201cI saw you and him, I saw the way you looked at each other,\u201d Tatiana realized, no, they weren\u2019t too weak.</p><p>\u201cDashenka, what are you talking about? There was no look. My hat was covering half my face. I don\u2019t even know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stood at the bottom of the stairs. You stood two steps up. He stopped you from tripping on the ice. He said something to you, and you looked down and nodded. And then you looked at each other. You walked up the stairs. He stood at the bottom and watched you. I saw it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha, darling, you\u2019re worrying yourself over nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I? Tania, tell me, how long have I been completely blind?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head in the night, Tatiana whispered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I been blind from the very beginning? From the day I walked into the room and saw him standing in front of you? Since then and through all the days that followed? Oh, God, tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, I may have been blind, but I\u2019m not stupid. What do you think, I can\u2019t tell? I have never seen that look in his eyes. He watched you go up the stairs with such longing, such tenderness, such possessiveness, such love, I turned away and would have thrown up in the snow had I had something to throw up.\u201d</p><p>Weakly, Tatiana repeated, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I? And when you were looking at him at the post office, what was in your eyes, sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the post office. He walked me there. We said good-bye. I walked up. Good-bye was in my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t good-bye, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha, stop. I\u2019m your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he owes me nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is just protective over me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot protective, Tania. Consumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me. It\u2019s a simple question. Have you been with Alexander? Have you made love to Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha, of course I haven\u2019t. Look, this is just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lied to me for so long. Are you lying to me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen? Then? Now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot then. Not now,\u201d Tatiana said, barely able to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Dasha closed her eyes. \u201cOh, God, I can\u2019t take it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t take it. All those days, those nights, those hours we have spent together, slept in the same bed and ate out of the same bowl \u2014 how can all of that have been a lie, how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a lie! Dasha, he loves you. Look how he kisses you. How he touches you. Didn\u2019t he used to make sweet love to you?\u201d Those words were difficult to get out.</p><p>\u201cKissed me. Touched me. We haven\u2019t been together since August. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha, please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not for touching these days,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cYou\u2019re not either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese days will be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and me along with them.\u201d Dasha coughed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, what are you going to do when I\u2019m gone? Will it be easier for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019re my sister . . .\u201d Tatiana, if she could have, would have wept. \u201cI haven\u2019t left, haven\u2019t gone away! I\u2019ve stayed here with you. I\u2019m not anywhere else. I\u2019m not leaving you. And we are not dying. He loves you.\u201d Tatiana put her hands on her chest to stifle a lingering groan.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dasha said brokenly, \u201cbut what I want is for him to love me the way he loves you.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said nothing. She was listening to the wood burning in the ceramic stove, estimating how long they had before the chair leg burned to ashes, her hands on her heart. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love me,\u201d she said in a hollow voice. How can he love me, but plan to marry you?</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Dasha said, \u201chow long were you going to keep this from me?\u201d</p><p>Until the end. \u201cNothing to keep from you, Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania.\u201d Dasha fell quiet. \u201cHow is it possible that at a time like this, in the dark, so close to the other world, you still have the energy to lie and I still have the energy to be angry? I can\u2019t even get up anymore. But anger, yes; lies, oh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cYou\u2019re warmer for it. Feel it. Hate me if you need to. Hate me with all your might if it helps you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I hate you?\u201d Dasha\u2019s mouth barely moved. \u201cIs there reason for me to hate you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Tatiana, turning to the wall. Lies to the last. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>The next day Dasha still could not get up. She wanted to, she just could not. Tatiana got the blankets off her and the coats. It was nine in the morning, and the girls once again had slept through the eight o\u2019clock air-raid siren.</p><p>Tatiana finally left by herself and went to the store. She got there about noon and found there was no more bread. They had gotten a small shipment in, which had all gone by eight in the morning.</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything at all you can give me? Is there anything you can do to help me?\u201d asked Tatiana of the woman behind the glass counter. The woman could not even answer.</p> <p>Tatiana left and walked to find the only one who could help her.</p><p>To the sentry at the gate to the barracks she said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for Captain Belov. Is he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelov?\u201d The guard, whom Tatiana had not seen before, looked at his roster schedule. \u201cYes, he\u2019s here. But I don\u2019t have anyone to go and fetch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cPlease. There was no bread today, and my sister is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, the captain has bread for you? He doesn\u2019t have any bread. Get out of here.\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana didn\u2019t move. \u201cMy sister is his fianc\u00e9e,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very good,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me the rest of your life story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCorporal Kristoff,\u201d he said. \u201cCorporal,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very good, Corporal,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI know you can\u2019t leave your post. Can you please let me go and see the captain?\u201d</p><p>He said, \u201cLet you go on base? You are crazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana, holding on to the gate. She felt as though she were about to fall down, having walked too far. But she wasn\u2019t going home without food for her sister. \u201cYes, I am crazy. But look at me. I\u2019m not asking you to give me food out of your mouth. I\u2019m not even asking you to move if you don\u2019t want to. All I\u2019m asking you to do is let me see Captain Belov. Please help me in this small way. Small way,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI\u2019m not asking too much, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, girlie, I\u2019m done talking to you,\u201d Kristoff said, taking the rifle off his shoulder. \u201cYou better move on out of here. You get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>Clinging to the gate, Tatiana wanted to shake her head but couldn\u2019t. Only her lips moved. \u201cCorporal Kristoff, I will wait right here. Sergeant Petrenko, Lieutenant Marazov, Colonel Stepanov \u2014 they all know me. Go on and tell them you are turning away Captain Belov\u2019s dying fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d Kristoff asked in disbelief, raising his weapon.</p><p>\u201cCorporal!\u201d An officer walked across the yard. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? Is there trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust telling this girl to get the hell out of here, sir,\u201d said Kristoff.</p><p>The officer looked at Tatiana. \u201cWho are you here for?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Belov, sir,\u201d Tatiana said.</p> <p>The officer said to Kristoff, \u201cCaptain Belov is upstairs. Have you called him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen the gate.\u201d</p><p>The officer pulled Tatiana through. \u201cCome, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana . . .\u201d the officer said. \u201cWas Kristoff giving you trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him. He is just overeager. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>The officer went into Alexander\u2019s quarters. Alexander was sleeping. He had been on barracks patrol all night. \u201cCaptain,\u201d the officer said loudly.</p><p>Alexander woke up with a start.</p><p>\u201cThere is a young lady waiting for you outside, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s against the rules. Can I send her in? A girl named Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>Before he finished, Alexander was already up and getting dressed. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDownstairs. I brought her in, I thought you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bastard Kristoff was ready to fire at her. I barely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lieutenant.\u201d He was out the door.</p><p>Tatiana was sitting on the bottom stair, her head pressed to the wall.</p><p>\u201cTatia?\u201d He came to stand in front of her. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha can\u2019t get up. There was no bread at the store.\u201d She couldn\u2019t even look up.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d He extended his hand. She took it but couldn\u2019t pull herself up. He had to place both his arms around her to lift her. \u201cYou walked too far,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cCome to the mess.\u201d Alexander found Tatiana a piece of black bread with a teaspoon of butter, half a cooked potato with some linseed oil, and even real coffee with a bit of sugar. She ate gratefully and drank. \u201cWhat about Dasha?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEat. I have food for Dasha.\u201d</p><p>He gave her another hunk of black bread, half a potato, and a handful of beans that she stuffed in her coat pocket. \u201cI wish I could come with you,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t leave the barracks today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Tatiana said, and thought, I don\u2019t think I can make it back. I don\u2019t think I can. It was after lunch hour in the mess, and it was quiet. Only a few soldiers were sitting at the tables.</p><p>Tatiana wanted to ask Alexander about his week, about Petrenko, whom she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time, and about Dimitri. She wanted to tell him about Kristoff. She wanted to tell him Zhanna Sarkova had died. It was time to go to the post office again, but she couldn\u2019t walk there by herself anymore.</p><p>Tatiana wanted to tell him about Dasha. But the effort required to continue that conversation was too great even in Tatiana\u2019s head. To make the words come out of her mouth, and then follow them up with more words and more thoughts, was unimaginable to her now, when she couldn\u2019t find the energy to chew the bread she needed to live. She couldn\u2019t think past the black bread in front of her. I\u2019ll tell him another time.</p><p>They both remained utterly silent.</p><p>Alexander walked her to the gate. She stumbled on flat ground and nearly fell. \u201cOh, my God, Tatia,\u201d he said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, but his calling her Tatia made her heart beat faster. She wanted to answer him. Straightening up, she leaned on his arm and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be all right. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait here.\u201d He sat her on a bench near the gate and strode off. A few minutes later he came back with a sled and said, \u201cCome. I\u2019ll take you home. Stepanov let me have two hours.\u201d He put his arm around her. \u201cCome. You won\u2019t have to do anything. I\u2019ll do everything. You just sit.\u201d</p><p>Alexander signed himself out in the roster at the sentry gate. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry about before,\u201d the corporal said to Tatiana, throwing a fearful look in Alexander\u2019s direction. Alexander opened his mouth to say something, but Tatiana pulled him by the sleeve of his coat. She didn\u2019t shake her head, didn\u2019t say a word, just pulled him, and he prodded her away a little, closed his mouth, clenched his fist, and punched Kristoff in the face. The corporal fell to the ground. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in two hours, Corporal,\u201d he said, \u201cand then I\u2019ll deal with you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander told Tatiana to sit. She lay down instead. She thought, I don\u2019t want to lie down. I\u2019m not a corpse yet. Not yet. But she couldn\u2019t help it. She couldn\u2019t sit up.</p><p>Tatiana lay on her side, and Alexander pulled the sled through the snow, through the quiet, snowed-in streets of Leningrad in the middle of an afternoon. Tatiana thought, it\u2019s too heavy for him. It\u2019s always him. When we first met, he carried my food for me down these streets. And now he is carrying me. She wanted to reach out and touch the bottom of Alexander\u2019s coat. Instead she fell asleep.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, Tatiana saw Alexander crouching beside her, his warm bare hand on her cold bare cheek. \u201cTatia,\u201d he whispered, \u201ccome on, we\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to die with Alexander\u2019s hand on my face, Tatiana thought. That is not a bad way to die. I cannot move. I can\u2019t get up. Just can\u2019t. She closed her eyes and felt herself drifting.</p><p>Through the haze in front of her she heard Alexander\u2019s voice. \u201cTatiana, I love you. Do you hear me? I love you like I\u2019ve never loved anyone in my whole life. Now, get up. For me, Tatia. For me, please get up and go take care of your sister. Go on. And I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d His lips kissed her cheek.</p><p>She opened her eyes. He was very close to her, and his eyes looked true. Did she just hear him? Or did she dream that? She had dreamed of him saying he loved her for so many nights facing the wall, she had longed for those words, longed for them since Kirov. Was she just wishing for the white-night sun again?</p><p>Tatiana got up. He couldn\u2019t carry her up the slippery stairs on his back. But he put his arm around her, and by holding on to him and the railing she made it upstairs. They walked through the long apartment, but at the door to their hallway Tatiana stopped. \u201cGo in,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll wait here. Go and see if she\u2019s . . .\u201d Tatiana couldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>Alexander brought her inside and then went into the bedroom. \u201cYes, Tania,\u201d she heard his voice. \u201cDasha is fine. Come in.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana came in and knelt by the bed. \u201cDasha,\u201d she said, \u201clook, he brought you food.\u201d</p><p>Dasha, her eyes two large brown saucers, two large brown empty saucers, moved her lips soundlessly, her stilted gaze traveling from Tatiana\u2019s face to Alexander\u2019s and back again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cGo early tomorrow to get your bread. There is enough here for you until then. Have you girls already eaten all your barley?\u201d He kissed Dasha on the head. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you more tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her arm to him. \u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d said Dasha.</p><p>\u201cI have to. You\u2019ll be all right. Just get your rations. I\u2019ll come and see you very soon. Tania, do you need help? Can you get up off the floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get up,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, and put his hands under her arms. \u201cUp we go.\u201d</p><p>She stood up. She wanted to look at him, but she knew that Dasha was watching, so instead she looked at Dasha. It was easier; her head was already bent down. \u201cThank you, Sh \u2014 Alexander.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>3</p><p>They lay under their blankets in semiconsciousness. During the night Tatiana woke up hearing a knock on the door. It took her many minutes to get out of bed from under the coats and blankets. Unsteadily she walked through the dark hallway.</p><p>Alexander stood at the door dressed in his white battle uniform. Over his ears and head was a quilted hat, and in his hands he held a blanket.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she said, putting her hand on her chest. Seeing him, Tatiana\u2019s heart pulsed a beat faster, even in the middle of the night. Her eyes opened a bit wider; she was awake. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cGet yourself and Dasha ready; where is she? She needs to get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going? Dasha can\u2019t get up,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cYou know that. She is coughing badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will get up,\u201d Alexander replied. \u201cCome on. There is an armament truck leaving the garrison tonight. I will get you to Ladoga, and then you will go to Kobona. Tania! I will get you out of Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>He walked through the hallway and came into the bedroom. Dasha was lying under her blankets and coats. Her lips were not moving, her eyes would not open.</p><p>\u201cDasha,\u201d Alexander whispered. \u201cDashenka, dear, wake up. We\u2019ve got to leave. Right now, we\u2019ve got to go. Quick.\u201d</p> <p>Without opening her eyes, Dasha muttered, \u201cI can\u2019t get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get up, and you will get up,\u201d he said. \u201cAn armament truck is waiting at the barracks. I will get you to Lake Ladoga. Then we will get you across the lake. Tonight. You\u2019ll get to Kobona, where there is food, and then you girls can go to your Babushka in Molotov. But you have to get up right now, Dasha. Now, let\u2019s go.\u201d He moved the blankets off her.</p><p>Dasha whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t get to the barracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania has a sled. And look!\u201d He opened his coat and took out a piece of white bread with a crust. Breaking off a hunk of the soft inside, he put it to Dasha\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhite bread! Eat. It will give you strength.\u201d</p><p>Dasha opened her mouth. She chewed listlessly without opening her eyes and then coughed. Tatiana stood nearby, wrapped in her own coat with a blanket over her shoulders, looking at the piece of bread the way she once used to look at Alexander. Maybe Dasha won\u2019t finish it all. Maybe there will be some left for me.</p><p>It was only a little piece. Dasha ate everything. \u201cIs there more?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cOnly the crust,\u201d Alexander replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t chew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll swallow it whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDasha . . . maybe your sister can have it?\u201d he asked with feeling.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s standing, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Alexander looked up at Tatiana, who was standing next to him. Shaking her head, she said, looking longingly at the crust, \u201cGive it to her. I\u2019m standing.\u201d</p><p>Breathing in deeply, Alexander gave the crust to Dasha and then, rising to his feet, said to Tatiana, \u201cLet\u2019s get going. What do you need to do to get ready? Can I help you pack?\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana stared at him with empty eyes. \u201cI have nothing. I\u2019m ready now. My boots are on. My coat is on. We\u2019ve sold everything and burned everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d he asked her in the darkness \u2014 one word, brimming with the past.</p><p>\u201cI have . . . the books\u2014\u201d She broke off.</p><p>\u201cBring them,\u201d Alexander said and, leaning closer to her, continued, \u201cCheck out the back cover of Pushkin when you\u2019re feeling particularly down on your luck. Where are they?\u201d</p><p>Alexander crawled under the bed to get her books, while Tatiana found Pasha\u2019s old backpack. Then he lifted Dasha and forced her to stand up. In the dark the three silhouettes struggled in silence, with only Dasha\u2019s intermittent moans and chesty coughing breaking the night into shards. Finally Alexander picked her up and carried her out of the apartment, and they slid down the stairs. Outside in the bitter night he laid Dasha across the sled, covering her with the blanket he had brought. Alexander and Tatiana picked up the reins and slowly pulled Dasha down the streets through the snow in the girls\u2019 childhood blue sled with bright red runners.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to Dasha?\u201d Tatiana said quietly.</p><p>\u201cIn Kobona there is food and a hospital. Once she is better, you will go to Molotov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds bad.\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she coughing like that?\u201d Tatiana said, and coughed herself.</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from Babushka in so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is fine. She is better off than you,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cIs it hard for you to pull? Just walk beside me. Let go of the sled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was a tremendous effort. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave your strength.\u201d He made her release the rope. Tatiana let go and walked alongside him.</p><p>\u201cHold on to my arm,\u201d Alexander told her. She did.</p><p>The night was so cold, Tatiana stopped feeling her feet. Leningrad was still and silent and almost completely dark. In the sky the translucent banded lights of the aurora borealis streaked green through the blackness. Tatiana turned around to look at Dasha, who lay motionless in the sled.</p><p>\u201cShe seems so weak,\u201d Tatiana said.</p><p>\u201cShe is weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you manage?\u201d she asked in a low voice. \u201cHow do you manage to carry your weapon, to stand guard, to go and fight, to be strong for all of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give you,\u201d said Alexander, glancing at her, \u201cwhat you need most from me.\u201d</p><p>They trod mutely through the snow. Alexander got slower. Tatiana took the second rope from his hands. He did not protest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feel better knowing you two are out of Leningrad. I\u2019ll feel better knowing you\u2019re safe,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it will be better?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t reply. Better to eat, yes. Better for Dasha to eat, yes.</p><p>But not better for Alexander, not better for her. Not better to stop seeing him. She said none of these things. And then she heard his soft \u201cI know.\u201d And wanted to cry, but she knew crying was impossible. Her eyes exposed to the black frost, sore from the wind, half shut from the cold, were dry.</p><p>When they finally got to the barracks an hour later, the army truck was minutes away from leaving. Alexander carried Dasha inside the covered vehicle. There were six soldiers sitting on the floor, and a young woman holding a small infant sitting next to a man who looked barely alive. He looks much worse than Dasha, Tatiana thought, but when she looked at Dasha, she saw that her sister could not even sit up by herself. Every time Alexander sat her up Dasha would tilt to one side. Tatiana needed help getting inside the truck. She could not jump up or pull herself up by her arms. She needed someone to lift her. All the people inside the truck were oblivious to her, including Alexander, who was trying anxiously and solicitously to get Dasha to open her eyes. Someone from the outside shouted, \u201cGo!\u201d And the truck started slowly moving forward in the snow. \u201cShura!\u201d Tatiana cried.</p><p>Alexander crawled across the floor of the truck, grabbing Tatiana\u2019s arms and pulling her in.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget about me?\u201d she asked and saw Dasha\u2019s open eyes watching them.</p><p>The door closed, and it became very dark, and in the dark, on her hands and knees, Tatiana made her way to Dasha.</p><p>In silence they drove toward Lake Ladoga.</p><p>Alexander sat on the floor next to his rifle. Dasha lay on the sawdust-covered floor with her head in his lap. Tatiana picked up her sister\u2019s feet and slid under them, closer to Alexander. Dasha now lay nearly on top of them. Alexander had her head, Tatiana had her feet. Alexander leaned against the wall of the cabin, and Tatiana leaned against the wall of the truck. She picked up a piece of sawdust and put it in her mouth. It tasted like bread. She had another piece.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t eat that, Tania,\u201d said Alexander. How could he see her? \u201cIt\u2019s filthy.\u201d</p><p>Time passed. In the occasional flicker of light, Tatiana would catch Alexander staring at her. Their eyes met and held until the light from the passing vehicle dimmed. Without saying a word, without touching each other, they sat on the floor and in every lit moment caught each other\u2019s gaze.</p><p>Endless minutes passed.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it, do you know?\u201d Tatiana asked quietly.</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cTwo in the morning. We\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana wanted to eat, and she wanted to stop being cold. She wanted her sister to get better, to get up. At the same time, leaving for Molotov seemed so final.</p><p>She waited for another light so she could catch Alexander\u2019s eye for a second or two. Her eyes got used to the dark, and she could make out his silhouette, his head and hat, the shape of his arms that lay around Dasha to keep her warm. Tatiana squeezed Dasha\u2019s legs, first softly, then harder. She shook Dasha\u2019s legs, first softly, then harder. Dasha stirred a bit and coughed. Relieved, Tatiana closed her eyes, only to instantly open them again. She didn\u2019t want to close her eyes. In a little while she would be across the Ladoga ice, away from him. If I reach out, I can almost touch him, she thought.</p><p>\u201cTania?\u201d she heard his voice.</p><p>\u201cYes \u2014 Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the village your grandmother lives in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLazarevo.\u201d She stretched out her hand to him. He stretched out his hand to her.</p><p>\u201cLazarevo.\u201d Passing light. Alexander and Tatiana touched each other. Darkness again.</p><p>Alexander fell asleep. Dasha was asleep. All the people in the truck had their eyes closed, except for Tatiana, who could not take her eyes off Alexander\u2019s sleeping form. Maybe I\u2019m dead, she thought. Dead people can\u2019t close their eyes. Maybe that\u2019s why I can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m dead. But she could not close her eyes. She watched him. Both his hands were on Dasha\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, why didn\u2019t you buy yourself an ice cream, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you looking so longingly at mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking longingly at your ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Would you like a taste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He bent and had a lick of her creamy ice cream.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo good, Tania.\u201d</p><p>Finally the truck stopped. Alexander opened his eyes. The other people stirred. The woman with the baby got up first and whispered to her husband, \u201cLeonid, come on, dear, time to get across, get up, darling.\u201d</p><p>Alexander moved out from under Dasha, stood, and gave his arm to Tatiana. \u201cGet up, Tatia,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d He pulled her up. She swayed from weakness.</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat am I going to do with Dasha in Kobona? She can\u2019t walk. And I\u2019m not you, I can\u2019t carry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. There will be soldiers and doctors to help you. Look at that woman,\u201d he whispered to her. \u201cShe carries her baby, but her husband can\u2019t hold himself up, just like Dasha. She\u2019ll manage. You\u2019ll see. Come, I\u2019ll help you down.\u201d</p><p>Jumping down, he extended his arms to Tatiana, who could not have jumped down if she wanted to. Alexander lifted her and brought her down to stand in front of him. He did not let go.</p><p>\u201cGo get Dasha, Shura,\u201d Tatiana whispered.</p><p>\u201cCome on! Let\u2019s move it!\u201d a sergeant shouted behind them. Alexander let go of Tatiana and grimly turned around. The sergeant quickly apologized to the captain.</p><p>Tatiana saw four other trucks with their lights on, shining down on the snow-covered field ahead. She realized that it wasn\u2019t a field. It was Lake Ladoga. It was the Road of Life.</p><p>\u201cCome on, come on, comrades! Walk down to the lake. There is a truck waiting there for you. Come on, the quicker you get inside, the quicker we can go. It\u2019s thirty kilometers, a couple of hours on the ice, but there\u2019s butter on the other side, and maybe even some cheese. Hurry!\u201d</p><p>The woman with the baby was already walking down the hill with her husband limping beside her.</p><p>Dasha was in Alexander\u2019s arms. \u201cStand her up, Shura,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cLet\u2019s get her to walk.\u201d</p><p>He put Dasha down, but her legs buckled under her. \u201cCome on, Dasha,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cWalk with me. There\u2019s butter on the other side, did you hear?\u201d</p><p>Dasha groaned. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at the Road of Life. Now, come on. In just a little while we\u2019re going to eat, and we\u2019re going to be all right. A doctor will look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming with us?\u201d Dasha asked Alexander.</p><p>He supported her with his arm. \u201cNo, Dasha, I stay. My Zenith is just up ahead. But write to me as soon as you get to Molotov, and when I get furlough, I\u2019ll come and see you.\u201d Alexander said it without glancing at Tatiana, but Tatiana couldn\u2019t hear it without glancing at Alexander.</p><p>Dasha moved a few meters by herself and then sank to the snow. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can, and you will,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cCome on. Show him your life means something. Show him you can walk to the truck to save yourself. Come on, Dasha.\u201d They lifted Dasha to her feet.</p><p>She walked another few meters and stopped. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Holding Dasha up between them, Alexander and Tatiana walked down the slope to the lake, where the army truck was waiting.</p><p>Alexander lifted Dasha and laid her on the floor of the truck. Then he hopped down to help Tatiana, who could barely stand. She leaned against the tarpaulin, heard shouts. The truck revved its engines.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tania, I\u2019ll help you inside,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cYou have to be strong for your sister.\u201d He came close to her.</p><p>\u201cI will be,\u201d she thought she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the bombing,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cIt\u2019s usually quieter at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Tatiana said, coming into his arms.</p><p>He hugged her. \u201cBe strong for me, Tatiana,\u201d Alexander said hoarsely. \u201cSave yourself for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I do, Shura,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI save myself for you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander bent to her, but she couldn\u2019t even look up. He kissed the top of her hat. They held on for a few more seconds.</p><p>\u201cTime!\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>Alexander helped Tatiana inside the truck. He hopped in himself to get the two girls comfortable, moving Dasha\u2019s head to rest on top of Tatiana\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cIs this all right?\u201d he asked, and both sisters answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Kneeling down in front of Dasha, Alexander said, \u201cNow, remember, when they offer you food in Kobona, eat small bites. Don\u2019t gulp it down, it can tear your stomach. Eat small and eat slow. You\u2019ll get used to it, and then you can eat more. Drink soup in small spoonfuls. All right?\u201d</p><p>Dasha took hold of his hand. He kissed her on the forehead. \u201cSo long, Dasha. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye\u2014\u201d whispered Dasha. \u201cWhat did my sister call you? Shura?\u201d</p><p>Alexander glanced at Tatiana. \u201cYes, Shura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Shura,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana closed her eyes so as not to look at him speak. If she could have covered her ears, she would have.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Alexander said to Dasha. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to write.\u201d</p><p>After he stood up, Dasha said, \u201cSay good-bye to Tania. Or did you already say good-bye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Tatiana,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye,\u201d she replied, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you get to Molotov, I want to hear from you. Promise?\u201d Alexander said, hopping off the truck.</p><p>\u201cAlexander!\u201d Dasha called after him.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he leaned in.</p><p>\u201cTell me, how long have you loved my sister?\u201d</p><p>Alexander glanced from Tatiana\u2019s face to Dasha\u2019s and back again. He opened his mouth to speak and then closed it with a shudder of his head.</p><p>\u201cHow long? Tell me. Look at us all \u2014 what secrets can we possibly have left? Tell me, darling. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>Setting his jaw, Alexander said forcefully, \u201cDasha, I never loved your sister. Never. I love you. You know what we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me that next summer maybe we would get married,\u201d said Dasha weakly. \u201cDid you mean it?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he replied, \u201cOf course I meant it. Next summer I will come and we will get married. Now, go.\u201d</p><p>He blew Dasha a kiss and disappeared, not even glancing at Tatiana. And she desperately wanted just one small last glance, almost in the dark, his soft eyes on her, so she could see a bit of truth. But he didn\u2019t look at her. She didn\u2019t see any truth. She saw Alexander not even breathe her way. She saw Alexander deny her.</p><p>The tarpaulin was closed, the truck was off, and they were in the dark again. Except that now there was no Alexander between the darkness and the light, and no moon, just gunfire and the sound of bursting in the distance that Tatiana could barely hear, so loud was the sound of bursting inside her chest. Finally she closed her eyes, so that Dasha, who was lying with her eyes open, couldn\u2019t look up and see what must have been so plain on Tatiana\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cTania?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Her nose was hurting from breathing the freezing air. She parted her lips and breathed through her mouth.</p><p>\u201cTanechka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dasha, dear?\u201d she whispered at last. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, sister.\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOpen them.\u201d</p><p>She opened them. \u201cDasha, I\u2019m very tired. You\u2019ve kept your eyes closed for hours. Now it\u2019s my turn. I\u2019ve pulled your sled and held your legs and helped you down the hill. Now you\u2019re lying on me, and I just want to close my eyes for a second, for a minute. All right?\u201d</p><p>Dasha didn\u2019t say anything but looked at Tatiana with lucid clarity. Tatiana held her sister\u2019s face and closed her eyes, listening to Dasha\u2019s wet cough.</p><p>\u201cHow did it feel, Tania, hearing him say he never loved you?\u201d</p><p>With the greatest effort Tatiana stopped herself from a groan of pain. \u201cFine,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cAs it should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did your body recoil as if he had hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Tatiana said faintly.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Dasha spoke. \u201cYou love him unbearably, don\u2019t you? How did you manage to hide it from me, Tania? You couldn\u2019t love a man more.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t love a man more. \u201cDasha,\u201d said Tatiana with finality and grace, \u201cI love you more.\u201d She never opened her eyes as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t hide it from me,\u201d said Dasha. \u201cNot at all. You put your love for him on a shelf, not in a cupboard. Marina was right. I was just blind.\u201d She closed her own eyes, but her voice carried across the truck, to the woman with her baby and husband, to Tatiana, to the truck driver. \u201cYou left it for me to see in a thousand places. I see every bitter one of them now.\u201d She started to cry, breaking into a coughing fit. \u201cBut you were a child! How could a child love anyone?\u201d Dasha fell quiet and then groaned.</p><p>I grew up, Dasha, thought Tatiana. Somewhere between Lake Ilmen and the start of war, the child had grown.</p><p>Outside there was a distant sound of cannons, of mortar fire. Inside the truck was silent.</p><p>Tatiana wondered about the baby that was held by the mother, a young woman with sallow skin and sores on her cheeks. Her husband was leaning on her shoulder; in fact, he was more than leaning, he was falling on his wife, and no matter how hard she pulled at him to sit upright, he would not sit up. The woman started to cry. The baby never made a sound.</p><p>Tatiana spoke to the woman. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you\u2019ve got your own problems,\u201d said the woman brusquely. \u201cMy husband is very weak.\u201d</p><p>Dasha said, \u201cI\u2019m not a problem. Pull me up, Tania, and lean me against the wall. My chest hurts too much to keep lying down. Go, help her.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana crawled across the truck to the woman and her husband. The woman was clutching her baby with both arms and not letting go.</p><p>Tatiana shook the man a bit, pulled him up briefly, but he fell back down, and this time he fell to the floor of the truck. He was heavily wrapped in a scarf, and his coat was buttoned to his neck. It took Tatiana ten minutes to unbutton him. The woman kept talking to her nonstop.</p><p>\u201cHe is not doing well, my husband. And my daughter is not much better. I have no milk for her. You know, she was born in October, what luck! Huh, what bad luck for a baby to be born in October. And when I got pregnant last February, we were so happy. We thought it was a sign from God. We just got married the September before. We were so excited. Our first baby! Leonid was working at the city public transportation department; he couldn\u2019t leave and his ration was quite good, but then the trams stopped, and there was nothing for him to do \u2014 why are you unbuttoning him?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, the woman continued. \u201cI\u2019m Nadezhda. My daughter was born, and I had no milk for her. What to give her? I\u2019ve been giving her soy milk, but it gave her terrible diarrhea, so I had to stop. And my husband really needed the food. Thank God, we finally got on the truck. We\u2019ve been waiting to get out for so long. Now it will all be all right. Kobona will have bread and cheese, someone said. What I would do to see a chicken, or something hot. I\u2019ll eat horsemeat, I don\u2019t care. Just something for Leonid.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana took her two fingers off the man\u2019s neck and very carefully buttoned him up again and wrapped the scarf around his neck. She moved him slightly so he was not lying on top of his wife\u2019s legs and went back to sit by Dasha. The truck was deathly quiet. All Tatiana could hear was Dasha\u2019s shallow breathing broken by bursts of coughing. That, and Alexander saying he never loved her.</p><p>Both sisters closed their eyes so as not to look at the woman and her dead baby and her dead husband. Tatiana put her hand on Dasha\u2019s head. Dasha did not push it away.</p><p>They got to Kobona at daybreak \u2014 daybreak, a purple haze on the dark horizon. The features on Dasha\u2019s face became dim instead of vague. Why was Tatiana noticing Dasha\u2019s rasping breathing all of a sudden?</p><p>\u201cCan you get up, Dasha?\u201d Tatiana asked. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>Nadezhda was shouting for someone to help her and her husband. No one came. Rather, a soldier came, lifted the tarpaulin off the back of the truck, and grunted, \u201cEverybody off. We\u2019ve got to load up and drive back.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana pulled at Dasha. \u201cCome on, Dasha, get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo and get help, Tania,\u201d Dasha said. \u201cI can\u2019t move anymore.\u201d</p><p>Yanking at her sister, Tatiana pulled Dasha up on all fours. \u201cYou crawl to the edge, and I\u2019ll help you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you help my husband down?\u201d said Nadezhda plaintively. \u201cHelp him, please. You\u2019re so strong. You see he is sick.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s too big for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, you\u2019re moving. Help us, will you? Don\u2019t be selfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI\u2019m going to help my sister down, and then I will help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone,\u201d Dasha said to Nadezhda. \u201cYour husband is dead. Leave my poor sister alone.\u201d</p><p>Nadezhda shrieked.</p><p>Dasha crawled, pulling herself like a soldier across the truck floor. At the edge Tatiana swung Dasha around, lowering her off the truck, legs first. Dasha\u2019s legs hit the ground, and the rest of her body followed and fell. She remained in the snow.</p><p>\u201cDasha, come on, please. I can\u2019t pull you up by myself,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>The driver of the truck came around and in one motion lifted Dasha to her feet. \u201cStand up, comrade. Stand up and walk to the field tent. They\u2019re giving you food and hot tea. Now, go.\u201d</p><p>From inside the truck Nadezhda shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t you forget me in here!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t want to stay to hear Nadezhda discover the truth about her husband and baby. Turning to Dasha, she said, \u201cUse me as a crutch. Put me under your arm and walk with me.\u201d She pointed up a shallow slope. \u201cLook, we\u2019re at the river Kobona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t walk with you and Alexander downhill on the other side, I can\u2019t walk uphill with just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a hill. It\u2019s a slope. Use that anger you feel at me. Use it, and walk up the damn slope, Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo easy for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Dasha.</p><p>\u201cIs that what it is?\u201d Tatiana shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSo easy. You just want to live, and that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>I do want to live. But that\u2019s not all. They stumbled through the snow, Dasha holding on to Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cAnd you? Don\u2019t you want to live?\u201d</p><p>Dasha made no reply.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so well. There is nobody to help us.\u201d She squeezed her sister and whispered intensely, \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me, Dasha! The soldiers are busy, the other people are all helping their own. Like I am. And you do so want to live. In the summer Alexander will come to Molotov, and you will get married.\u201d</p><p>Dasha summoned enough strength to laugh softly. \u201cTania, you never stop, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>Dasha fell in the snow and would not get up.</p><p>Swirling around in despair, Tatiana spotted Nadezhda walking up the hill alone, no baby, no husband. She went up to her. \u201cNadezhda, please help me. Help me with Dasha. She\u2019s fallen in the snow.\u201d</p><p>Nadezhda ripped her arm away from Tatiana\u2019s hold. \u201cGet away from me. Can\u2019t you see, I\u2019ve got no one with me now.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana saw. \u201cPlease help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t help me. And now they\u2019re all dead. Leave me alone, will you?\u201d Nadezhda walked away.</p><p>Suddenly Tatiana heard a familiar voice. \u201cTatiana? Tatiana Metanova?\u201d</p><p>Turning in the direction of the voice, she saw Dimitri hobbling to her, supported by his rifle.</p><p>\u201cDimitri!\u201d She walked up to him. He hugged her. \u201cHelp me, Dima, please. My sister! Look, she has fallen.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri quickly got to Dasha. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still wounded. I can\u2019t carry her myself. I\u2019ll get you another soldier.\u201d He turned to Tatiana and gave her another long hug. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we ran into each other like this.\u201d Smiling. \u201cIt must be destiny,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dimitri got someone else to lift Dasha and carry her to the hospital field tent as Tatiana trudged after them in the mauve light of the sky.</p><p>In the hospital tent near the Kobona River, a doctor came to see Dasha. He listened to her heart, to her lungs, felt her pulse, opened her mouth, shook his head, stood, and said, \u201cGalloping consumption. Forget about her.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana took a step toward the doctor. \u201cForget about her? What are you talking about? Give her something, some sulfa\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doctor laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re all the same, all of you. You think I\u2019m going to be giving away my precious sulfa on a terminal case? What are you, crazy? Look at her. She doesn\u2019t have an hour to live. I wouldn\u2019t waste a piece of bread on her. Have you seen how much mucus she\u2019s bringing up? Have you listened to her breathing? I\u2019m sure the TB bacteria has traveled to her liver. Go and get some soup and porridge for yourself in the next tent. You might actually make it, if you eat.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana studied the doctor for a few moments. \u201cAm I all right?\u201d she asked. \u201cCan you listen to my lungs? I don\u2019t feel all right.\u201d</p><p>The doctor opened Tatiana\u2019s coat and pressed the stethoscope to her chest. Then he turned her around and listened through her back. \u201cYou need some sulfanilamide yourself, girl. You\u2019ve got pneumonia. Let me have the nurse take care of you. Olga!\u201d Before he left, he turned to Tatiana and said, \u201cDon\u2019t go near your sister anymore. TB is contagious.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana lay on the ground, while Dasha lay in the clean bed. After a while she became too cold. Tatiana lay down on her side in the narrow cot very close to her sister. \u201cDasha,\u201d she whispered, \u201call my life whenever I had nightmares, I would nestle like this with you, in our bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Tania,\u201d whispered Dasha. \u201cYou were the sweetest child.\u201d</p><p>Outside wasn\u2019t light so much as blue. Dark blue tints on Dasha\u2019s trembling face. She heard Dasha\u2019s hoarse voice. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe . . .\u201d</p><p>Tatiana knelt on the ground in front of the bed, opened Dasha\u2019s mouth, and blew into it, blew into it cold, brusque, stunted, pitiful breath, breath without soil, without roots, without food. She breathed from her own lungs into her sister\u2019s. Tatiana tried to breathe deeply, but she couldn\u2019t. For endless minutes Tatiana breathed into Dasha\u2019s mouth, into Dasha\u2019s lungs, the shallow whisper of life.</p><p>A nurse came up to them and pulled Tatiana away. \u201cStop it,\u201d she said in a kind voice. \u201cDidn\u2019t the doctor tell you to leave her alone? Are you the sick one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d whispered Tatiana, holding Dasha\u2019s cold hand.</p><p>The nurse gave Tatiana three white pills, some water, and a hunk of black bread. \u201cIt\u2019s dipped in sugar water,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d gasped Tatiana between pain-soaked breaths.</p><p>The nurse put her arm on Tatiana\u2019s back. \u201cDo you want to come with me? I\u2019ll try to find you a place to lie down before breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give her any of the bread. Eat it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs it more than I do,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cNo, darling,\u201d the nurse replied. \u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the nurse left, Tatiana crushed the sulfa tablets against the bed frame, crumbling them into her hand and then into the water, and after taking a small gulp, lifted Dasha\u2019s head slightly off the pillow and made her drink the dissolved medicine.</p><p>Tatiana broke off a little piece of the bread and fed it to Dasha, who swallowed with obvious pain and choked. Spluttering, she coughed up blood onto the white sheet. Tatiana wiped Dasha\u2019s mouth and chin and then blew her breath into Dasha\u2019s mouth again.</p><p>\u201cTania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this dying? Is this what dying feels like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dasha\u201d was all Tatiana could reply.</p><p>She stared into Dasha\u2019s muted, blinking eyes.</p><p>\u201cTania . . . darling, you\u2019re a good sister,\u201d whispered Dasha.</p><p>Tatiana continued to breathe into Dasha\u2019s mouth.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hear her sister\u2019s painful labored breathing, only her own.</p><p>Tatiana felt a warm hand on her back, and a voice behind her said, \u201cCome. You won\u2019t believe what I have for you. It\u2019s breakfast time. I have buckwheat kasha and bread and a teaspoon of butter. You will have tea with some sugar, and I will even find you some real milk. Come. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave my sister,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>The nurse said in a sympathetic voice, \u201cCome, my dear. My name is Olga. Come, breakfast won\u2019t last forever.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana felt arms lifting her. She stood up, but one look at Dasha and she sank back down on the floor.</p><p>Dasha\u2019s mouth remained open as Tatiana had left it open. Her eyes were open, too, staring upward to the violet sky beyond the cloth of the tent, beyond Tatiana.</p><p>Bending and broken, Tatiana kissed Dasha\u2019s eyes closed and made the sign of the cross on her forehead. She struggled up, took Olga\u2019s hand, and left.</p><p>In the adjoining mess she sat down at a table and looked into an empty plate. Olga brought her some buckwheat. Tatiana ate half the small bowl. When Olga asked her to eat more, Tatiana said she couldn\u2019t because she was saving the rest for Dasha, and fainted.</p><p>Tatiana awoke in a bed.</p><p>Olga came, offering her a piece of bread and some tea. Tatiana refused.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t eat, you will die,\u201d said Olga.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to die,\u201d said Tatiana weakly. \u201cGive it to Dasha, my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister is dead,\u201d said Olga.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me. Let me take you to her.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana walked to a back room with Olga, where she saw Dasha lying on the floor next to three other bodies.</p><p>Tatiana asked who was going to bury them. Olga said with a laugh, \u201cOh, girl, what are you thinking? Nobody, of course. Did you take the drugs the doctor gave you?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Tatiana said, \u201cOlga, can you bring me a sheet? For my sister.\u201d</p><p>Olga brought Tatiana a sheet, some more medicine, a cup of black tea with sugar, and bread with a chunk of butter. This time Tatiana took the drugs and ate, sitting in a low metal chair in a room full of corpses. After she finished, she laid the sheet on the ground and rolled Dasha into it.</p><p>Tatiana held her sister\u2019s head in her hands for a long time.</p><p>After wrapping Dasha tightly with the sheet, ripping the tattered ends and tying them together, Tatiana left the tent and went to find Dimitri. In Kobona, the small seaside town in the dark of January, Tatiana found many soldiers, but not him. She needed to find him. She needed his help. She went back to the Kobona River. Stopping an officer, she asked him where Dimitri Chernenko might be. He did not know. She asked ten soldiers, but none of them knew. The eleventh one looked at her and said, \u201cTania? What the hell is the matter with you? I am Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>She did not recognize him. Without emotion she said, \u201cOh. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you recognize me, Tania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>He limped with her, his arm lightly around her shoulder. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask me about my leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a bit, all right,\u201d Tatiana said, leading him to the partitioned room and showing him Dasha\u2019s body wrapped in a sheet surrounded by uncovered corpses. \u201cWill you help me bury Dasha?\u201d she asked, the strands of her voice barely holding together.</p><p>Dimitri sucked in his breath. \u201cOh, Tania,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>She continued. \u201cI can\u2019t take her with me. But I can\u2019t leave her here either. Please help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d he said, opening his arms. She backed away from him. \u201cWhere are we going to bury her? The ground is frozen solid. An earthmoving machine couldn\u2019t dig this dirt.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stood and waited. For sunshine, for a solution.</p><p>\u201cThe Nazis are bombing the Road of Life, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ice on the lake gets broken, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His face registered gradual understanding.</p><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. If I can, you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDima, you don\u2019t understand. I can\u2019t let her lie in the back room, now, can I? I won\u2019t be able to leave her, and I won\u2019t be able to save my own life.\u201d Tatiana came up to stand in front of him. \u201cTell me, Dimitri, when I\u2019m dead, will you even know how to sew a sack for me? When I\u2019m dead, will you put me in the back room on top of the other bodies? What will you do with me?\u201d</p><p>Banging his rifle on the ground, he said, \u201cOh, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Help me.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he barely shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t. Look at me. I\u2019ve been in the hospital for nearly three months. They just let me out, put me on the Kobona detail, and now I have to walk around for hours. It hurts my foot, and the Germans bomb the lake all the time. I\u2019m not going out there. I can\u2019t run if the shelling starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me a sled, will you? Can you do that for me?\u201d she said coldly, going to sit by Dasha.</p><p>\u201cTania\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDimitri, just a sled. Surely you can do that?\u201d</p><p>He came back after some time with a sled. Tatiana got up off the ground. \u201cThank you. You can go,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Dimitri exclaimed. \u201cShe is dead. Who cares now? Don\u2019t worry about her anymore. This f*cking war can\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Raising her eyes at him, Tatiana said, \u201cWho cares? I care. My sister did not die alone. I\u2019m still here. And I will not turn from her until I bury her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what are you going to do? You don\u2019t sound too good yourself. Are you going to go ahead to your grandparents? Where were they again? Kazan? Molotov? You probably shouldn\u2019t go, you know. I keep hearing horror stories about the evacuees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d She added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>As he was leaving, she called after him. \u201cDimitri?\u201d</p><p>He turned around.</p><p>\u201cWhen you see Alexander, tell him about my sister.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOf course, I will, Tanechka. I\u2019m going to see him next week. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be of more help.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana turned sharply away.</p><p>After he left, she got Olga to help her lift Dasha\u2019s body onto the sled and then pushed the sled down the slope and walked after it. On the Kobona River she took the reins, and under the seeping silent gray sky, Tatiana pulled Dasha, wrapped in a white hospital sheet, on Lake Ladoga. It was early afternoon and nearly dark. There were no German planes overhead. About a quarter of a kilometer out, Tatiana found a water hole. She kept tugging at Dasha\u2019s body until it slid down onto the ice.</p><p>Tatiana knelt next to it and put her hand on the white sheet.</p><p>Dasha, do you remember when I was five and you were twelve, teaching me how to dive into Lake Ilmen? You showed me how to swim underwater, saying you loved the feeling of water all around you because it was so peaceful. And then you taught me to stay under longer than Pasha, because you said that girls always had to beat boys. Well, you go and swim underwater now, Dasha Metanova.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s wet face was turning to ice in the Arctic wind. She whispered, \u201cI wish I knew a prayer. I need a prayer right now, but I don\u2019t know one. Dear God, please let my only sister Dasha swim in peace and not ever be cold again, and please . . . can you let her have all the daily bread she can eat, up in Heaven . . . ?\u201d</p><p>On her knees Tatiana pushed Dasha\u2019s body into the ice hole. In the waning light the white sack looked blue. Dasha went in reluctantly, as if unwilling to part with life, and then disappeared. Tatiana continued to kneel on the ice. Eventually she got up and, coughing into her mittens, slowly pulled the empty sled back to shore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Book Two</p><p>THE GOLDEN DOOR</p><p>Part Three</p><p>LAZAREVO</p> <p>SCENTING SPRING</p><p>ALEXANDER went to Lazarevo on faith.</p><p>He had nothing else. Literally nothing else, not a letter, not a single piece of correspondence from either Dasha or Tatiana to let him know they had arrived in Molotov. He had grave doubts about Dasha, but he had seen Slavin survive the winter, so anything was possible. It was the absence of letters from Dasha that worried Alexander. While she was in Leningrad, she wrote to him constantly. Here the rest of January and February sped on, and not a word.</p><p>A week after the girls had left, Alexander had driven a truck across the ice to Kobona and searched for them among the sick and dispossessed on the Kobona shores. He found nothing.</p><p>In March, anxious and depressed, Alexander wrote a letter to Dasha in Molotov. He also had telegraphed the Soviet office in Molotov asking them for information on a Daria or a Tatiana Metanova but did not hear back until May and by regular post. A one-sentence letter from the Molotov Soviet informed Alexander that there was no information on a Daria or a Tatiana Metanova. He telegraphed again, asking if the Lazarevo village Soviet could receive telegraphs. Here the two-word telegram came the next day: no. stop.</p> <p>Every off-duty hour he got, Alexander went back to Fifth Soviet, letting himself in with the key Dasha had left him. He cleaned the rooms, swept and washed the floors, and washed the linen when the city council repaired the pipes in March. He installed new glass panes in the second bedroom. He found an old photo album of the Metanovs and started looking through it, then suddenly closed it and put it away. What was he thinking? It was like seeing ghosts.</p><p>That\u2019s how Alexander felt. He saw their ghosts everywhere.</p><p>Each time he was back in Leningrad, Alexander went to the post office on Old Nevsky to see if there were any letters to the Metanovs. The old postmaster was sick of the sight of him.</p><p>At the garrison, Alexander constantly asked the sergeant in charge of the army mail if there was anything for him from the Metanovs. The sergeant in charge of the army mail was sick of the sight of him.</p><p>But there was nothing for Alexander, no letters, no telegrams, and no news. In April the Old Nevsky postmaster died. No one had been notified of his death, and, in fact, he remained in his chair behind the desk, with mail on the floor, and on the counter, and in boxes, and in unopened mail sacks.</p><p>Alexander smoked thirty cigarettes as he searched through all the mail. He found nothing.</p> <p>He went back to Lake Ladoga, continued protecting the Road of Life \u2014 now a water road \u2014 and waited for furlough, seeing Tatiana\u2019s ghost everywhere.</p><p>Leningrad slowly came out of the grip of death, and the city council became afraid \u2014 with good reason \u2014 that the proliferation of dead bodies, of clogged sewers, of raw sewage on the streets would result in a mass epidemic once the weather warmed up. The council initiated a full frontal assault on the city. Every living and able person cleared the debris from the bombing and the bodies from the streets. The burst pipes were fixed, the electricity restored. Trams and then trolleybuses began running. With new tulips and cabbage seedlings growing in front of St. Isaac\u2019s Cathedral, Leningrad seemed to be temporarily reborn. Tania would have liked to see the tulips in front of St. Isaac\u2019s, Alexander thought. The civilian ration was increased to three hundred grams of bread for dependents. Not because there was more flour. Because there were fewer people.</p><p>At the start of war, on June 22, 1941, the day Alexander met Tatiana, there were three million civilians in Leningrad. When the Germans blockaded the city on September 8, 1941, there were two and a half million civilians in Leningrad.</p><p>In the spring of 1942 a million people remained.</p><p>The ice road over Ladoga had so far evacuated half a million people from the city, leaving them in Kobona to their dubious fate.</p><p>And the siege was not over.</p><p>After the snow melted, Alexander was put in charge of dynamiting a dozen mass graves in Piskarev Cemetery, to which nearly half a million corpses were transported on Funeral Trust trucks and eventually buried. Piskarev was just one of seven cemeteries in Leningrad to which the bodies were carried like cordwood.</p><p>And the siege was not over.</p> <p>American foodstuffs \u2014 courtesy of Lend-Lease \u2014 were slowly making their twisted way into Leningrad. A few times during spring, Leningraders received dehydrated milk, dehydrated soup, dehydrated eggs. Alexander picked up some items himself, including an English-Russian phrase book he bought from a Lend-Lease truck driver in Kobona. Tania might like a new phrase book, he thought. She had been doing so well with her English.</p><p>The city rebuilt Nevsky Prospekt with false fronts to cover up the gaping holes left by German shells, and Leningrad went on slowly, neatly, and mostly quietly, into the summer of 1942.</p><p>German shelling and bombing continued daily and unabated.</p><p>January, February, March, April, May.</p><p>How many months could Alexander not hear? How many months of no news, of not a word, of not a breath? How many months of carrying hope in his heart and of admitting to himself that the inevitable and the unimaginable could have happened, might have happened, and \u2014 finally \u2014 must have happened? He saw death everywhere. At the front most of all, but hopeless death on the streets of Leningrad, too. He saw mutilated bodies and mangled bodies, frozen bodies and famished bodies. He saw it all. But through it all Alexander still believed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>In June, Dimitri came to see him at the garrison. Alexander was shocked and hoped his face didn\u2019t show it. Dimitri looked older by years, not just by months. He walked with a distinct limp, hunched over a little on his right side. His body looked wearied and thin, and there was a tremor in his fingers Alexander had not seen before.</p><p>And when Alexander stared at Dimitri, he thought, Dimitri survived, why not Dasha and Tania, too? If he could, why not them? If I could, why not them?</p><p>\u201cMy only good foot is now the left foot,\u201d Dimitri told him. \u201cWhat stupidity on my part, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He smiled warmly at Alexander, who reluctantly invited him to sit on one of the bunks. He had been hoping he was done with Dimitri. No such luck, he could see. They were alone, and Dimitri had a thoughtful flare in his eye that Alexander did not care for.</p> <p>\u201cAt least,\u201d Dimitri said cheerfully, \u201cI\u2019ll never have to see real combat again. I much prefer it this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cIt\u2019s what you wanted. To work in the rear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome rear,\u201d Dimitri snorted. \u201cDo you know that first they put me on evacuation detail in Kobona\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKobona!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dimitri drew out slowly. \u201cWhy? Does Kobona have some special significance other than the American Lend-Lease trucks that come through there?\u201d</p> <p>Alexander studied Dimitri. \u201cYes. I didn\u2019t know you worked in Kobona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had fallen a little out of touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you there back in January?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even remember anymore,\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cThat was such a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Alexander got up and came toward him. \u201cDima! I got Dasha and Tatiana out through the ice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey must be so grateful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re grateful. Did you see them, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me if I saw two girls in Kobona, through which thousands of evacuees came?\u201d Dimitri laughed.</p><p>\u201cNot two girls,\u201d Alexander said coldly. \u201cTania and Dasha. You\u2019d recognize them, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, I would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see them?\u201d He raised his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cStop shouting. But I must say . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cTo put two helpless girls in a truck to try to make it to \u2014 Where were they headed again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEast, somewhere.\u201d He wasn\u2019t about to tell Dimitri where they had been headed.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere deep in the country? I don\u2019t know, Alexander, what were you thinking?\u201d Dimitri chuckled. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you wanted them to die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDimitri, what are you talking about?\u201d Alexander snapped. \u201cWhat choice did I have? Have you not heard what happened to Leningrad last winter? What\u2019s still happening now?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri smiled. \u201cI heard. Wasn\u2019t there something else you could have done? Couldn\u2019t Colonel Stepanov do anything for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he couldn\u2019t.\u201d Alexander was fed up. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, Alexander, the evacuees that came our way were all at death\u2019s door. I know Dasha is made of strong stuff, but Tania? I\u2019m surprised she made it long enough for you to get her across the ice.\u201d Dimitri shrugged. \u201cI thought she\u2019d be the first to \u2014 I mean, even I got dystrophy. And most of the people coming through Kobona were sick and starved. Then they were forced to get on more trucks to be transported sixty kilometers to the nearest trains, which were all cattle trains.\u201d Lowering his voice, Dimitri said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but I heard through the grapevine that seventy percent of all the people we put on the trains died of either cold or disease.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAnd you wanted Dasha and Tania to go through that? Some future husband you are!\u201d Dimitri laughed.</p><p>Alexander clenched his teeth.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m out of there,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cDidn\u2019t like Kobona much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d said Alexander. \u201cWas Kobona too dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t it. The trucks were usually backed up onto the Ladoga ice, because the evacuees were so damn slow. We were expected to go out and help unload them. But they couldn\u2019t walk. They were all near death.\u201d Staring at Alexander, Dimitri said, \u201cJust last month the Germans blew up three of the six trucks on the ice.\u201d He sighed. \u201cSome rear. Finally I asked to be transferred into supplies.\u201d</p><p>Turning his back to Dimitri, Alexander began folding his clothes. \u201cSupplies is not the safest thing either. On the other hand,\u201d he said, thinking to himself, what am I saying? Let him go into f*cking supplies, \u201csupplies might be good for you. You\u2019ll be the guy selling the cigarettes. Everybody will love you.\u201d The yawning chasm between what had been between them and what was now was too great. There were no boats and no bridges. Alexander waited for Dimitri either to leave or to ask after Tatiana\u2019s family. He did neither.</p><p>Finally Alexander couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cDima, are you even remotely interested in what happened to the Metanovs?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, Dimitri said, \u201cI figured the same thing that happened to most of Leningrad. Everybody died, no?\u201d He could have been saying, everyone went shopping, no? Alexander lowered his head.</p><p>\u201cThis is war, Alexander,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cOnly the strongest survive. That\u2019s why I finally had to give up on Tania. I didn\u2019t want to, I quite liked her, and I still do; I have fond memories of her, but I had barely enough strength to keep myself going. I couldn\u2019t be worrying about her, too, without food or warm clothes.\u201d</p><p>How clearly Tatiana saw right through Dimitri. He never did care for her at all, Alexander thought, putting his clothes into his locker and avoiding Dimitri\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, speaking of surviving, there is something I wanted to talk to you about,\u201d Dimitri began.</p><p>Here it comes. Alexander did not look up while he waited for it.</p><p>\u201cSince the Americans have joined the war \u2014 it\u2019s better for us, yes?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Alexander replied, \u201cCertainly. Lend-Lease is a great help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Getting up off the bed, Dimitri said in an excited and anxious voice, \u201cI don\u2019t mean for us, I mean for you and me. For our plans.\u201d</p><p>Getting up off the floor, Alexander faced Dimitri. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen too many Americans on this side,\u201d he said slowly, pretending not to understand.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d exclaimed Dimitri, \u201cbut they\u2019re all over Kobona! They\u2019re trucking and shipping supplies, tanks, jeeps, boots, through Murmansk and down the whole east coast of Lake Ladoga, to Petrozavodsk, to Lodeinoye Pole. There are dozens of them in Kobona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true? Dozens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not dozens. But Americans!\u201d He paused. \u201cMaybe they can help us?\u201d</p><p>Alexander came up closer to Dimitri. \u201cIn what way?\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>Smiling, and keeping his thin voice low, Dimitri said, \u201cIn what way? In that American way. Perhaps you can go to Kobona\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDima, go to Kobona and what? Who am I going to talk to? The truck drivers? You think if a Soviet soldier starts talking English to them, they\u2019ll just say, oh, sure, come with us on our steamer. We\u2019ll take you back home.\u201d Alexander paused, taking a drag on his cigarette. \u201cAnd even if somehow that were not impossible, how do you suggest we get you out? Even if a stranger was willing to risk his neck for me because of what you perceive as some American bond, how do you think that would help you?\u201d</p><p>Taken aback, Dimitri said hastily, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good plan. But it\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDima, you\u2019re injured. Look at you.\u201d Alexander looked him up and down. \u201cYou are in no condition to fight, nor are you in any condition to . . . run. We need to forget our plans.\u201d</p><p>In a frantic voice, Dimitri said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I know you still want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDimitri!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? We have to do something, Alexander,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cYou and I had plans\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDimitri!\u201d Alexander exclaimed. \u201cOur plans involved fighting through NKVD border troops and hiding out in the mined swamps in Finland! Now that you\u2019ve shot yourself in the foot, how do you think that will be possible?\u201d</p><p>Alexander was grateful that Dimitri did not have any immediate answers. He backed away.</p><p>Dimitri said, \u201cI agree, maybe the Lisiy Nos route is harder, but I think we have a good chance of bribing the Lend-Lease delivery boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not delivery boys!\u201d Alexander said angrily. He paused. It was not worth it. \u201cThese men are trained fighters, and they subject themselves to submarine torpedoes every day as they trudge 2,000 kilometers through the Arctic and North Russia to bring you tushonka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and they are the very men who can help us. And, Alexander\u201d \u2014 Dimitri stepped closer \u2014 \u201cI need somebody to help me.\u201d He stepped closer still. \u201cAnd very soon. I have no intention whatsoever of dying in this f*cking war.\u201d He paused, his slit eyes on Alexander. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will die if I have to,\u201d said an unyielding Alexander.</p><p>Dimitri studied him. Alexander hated to be studied. He lit a cigarette and stared icily at Dimitri, who retreated. \u201cDo you still have your money on you?\u201d Dimitri asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you get to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Alexander. He took out another cigarette. This conversation was over.</p><p>\u201cYou have an unsmoked one in your mouth,\u201d Dimitri remarked dryly.</p><p>Alexander received a generous furlough of thirty days. He asked Stepanov for more time. He got a little more time, from June 15 until July 24.</p><p>\u201cIs that enough time?\u201d asked Stepanov, smiling lightly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either too much time, sir,\u201d replied Alexander, \u201cor not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain,\u201d said Stepanov, lighting a cigarette and giving one to Alexander, \u201cwhen you come back . . .\u201d He sighed. \u201cWe can no longer stay at the garrison. You see what has happened to our city. We cannot spend another winter like the last one. It simply cannot happen.\u201d He paused. \u201cWe are going to have to break the blockade. All of us. This fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, Alexander? Have you seen what\u2019s happened to our men at Tikhvin and Mga last winter and this spring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard what\u2019s been happening to our men in Nevsky Patch across the river from Dubrovka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Alexander said. Nevsky Patch was a Red Army enclave inside enemy lines \u2014 a place the Germans used for daily target practice. Russian soldiers were dying there at a rate of 200 a day.</p><p>Shaking his head, Stepanov said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to move across the Neva in pontoon boats. We have limited artillery \u2014 you. We have single-shot rifles\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, sir, I have a Shpagin machine gun. And my rifle is an automatic.\u201d Alexander smiled.</p><p>Smiling himself, Stepanov nodded. \u201cI\u2019m making it sound brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain, don\u2019t get scared off by the good fight, an unequal fight though it may be.\u201d</p><p>Alexander, raising his eyes to Stepanov and squaring his shoulders, said, \u201cSir. When have I ever?\u201d</p><p>Coming up to him, Stepanov said, \u201cIf we had more men like you, we would have won this war long ago.\u201d He shook Alexander\u2019s hand. \u201cGo.

Sixteen hundred kilometers of the Obvodnoy Canal, of coming to see her at Kirov, of his tent in Luga, of her holding on to his back, of the hospital room, of St. Isaac\u2019s, of her eating ice cream, of her lying in the sled as he pulled her, nearly out of life. Sixteen hundred kilometers of her giving her food to everyone, of her jumping up and down on the roof under German planes. There were some memories of last winter from which Alexander flinched, recalling them all nonetheless. Her walking alongside him after burying her mother. Her standing motionless in front of three boys with knives.</p><p>Two images continually sprang to his mind in a restless, frantic refrain.</p><p>Tatiana in a helmet, in strange clothes, covered with blood, covered with stone and beams and glass and dead bodies, herself still warm, herself still breathing.</p><p>And</p> <p>Tatiana on the bed in the hospital, bare under his hands, moaning under his mouth.</p><p>If anyone could make it, would it not be the girl who every morning for four months got up at six-thirty and trudged through dying Leningrad to get her family their bread?</p><p>But if she had made it, how could she not have written to him?</p><p>The girl who kissed his hand, who served him tea, and who gazed at him, not breathing as he talked, gazed at him with eyes he had never seen before \u2014 was that girl gone?</p><p>Was her heart gone?</p><p>Please, God, Alexander prayed. Let her not love me anymore, but let her live.</p> <p>That was a hard prayer for Alexander, but he could not imagine living in a world without Tatiana.</p><p>Unwashed and undernourished, having spent over four days on five different trains and four military jeeps, Alexander got off at Molotov on Friday, June 19, 1942. He arrived at noon and then sat on a wooden bench near the station.</p><p>Alexander couldn\u2019t bring himself to walk to Lazarevo.</p><p>He could not bear the thought of her dying in Kobona, getting out of the collapsed city and then dying so close to salvation. He could not face it.</p><p>And worse \u2014 he knew that he could not face himself if he found out that she did not make it. He could not face returning \u2014 returning to what?</p><p>Alexander actually thought of getting on the next train and going back immediately. The courage to move forward was much more than the courage he needed to stand behind a Katyusha rocket launcher or a Zenith antiaircraft gun on Lake Ladoga and know that any of the Luftwaffe planes flying overhead could instantly bring about his death.</p><p>He was not afraid of his own death.</p><p>He was afraid of hers. The specter of her death took away his courage.</p> <p>If Tatiana was dead, it meant God was dead, and Alexander knew he could not survive an instant during war in a universe governed by chaos, not purpose. He would not live any longer than poor, hapless Grinkov, who had been cut down by a stray bullet as he headed back to the rear.</p><p>War was the ultimate chaos, a pounding, soul-destroying snarl, ending in blown-apart men lying unburied on the cold earth. There was nothing more cosmically chaotic than war.</p><p>But Tatiana was order. She was finite matter in infinite space. Tatiana was the standard-bearer for the flag of grace and valor that she carried forward with bounty and perfection in herself, the flag Alexander had followed sixteen hundred kilometers east to the Kama River, to the Ural Mountains, to Lazarevo.</p><p>For two hours Alexander sat on the bench in unpaved, provincial, oak-lined Molotov.</p><p>To go back was impossible.</p><p>To go forward was unthinkable.</p><p>Yet he had nowhere else to go.</p><p>He crossed himself and stood up, gathering his belongings.</p><p>When Alexander finally walked in the direction of Lazarevo, not knowing whether Tatiana was alive or dead, he felt he was a man walking to his own execution. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>4</p><p>Lazarevo was ten kilometers through deep pine woods.</p><p>The forest wasn\u2019t just pine; it was mixed with elms and oaks and birches and nettles and blueberries all drifting their pleasing way into his senses. Alexander walked carrying his rucksack, his rifle, his sidearm and ammunition, his large tent and blanket, his helmet, and a sack filled with food from Kobona. He could hear the nearby rush of the Kama River through the trees. He thought of going and washing, but by this point he needed to keep moving forward.</p><p>He picked a few blueberries off the low bushes as he walked. He was hungry. It was very warm, very sunny, and Alexander was suddenly filled with a pounding hope. He walked faster.</p> <p>The woods ended, and in front of him was a dusty village road, flanked on both sides by small wooden huts, overgrown grasses, and old falling-down fences.</p><p>To the left, past pines and elms, he could see the glimmer of the river, and past the river, past more voluminous, voluptuous forest, the round-topped, evergreen-covered Ural Mountains.</p><p>He inhaled deeply. Did Lazarevo smell of Tatiana? He smelled firewood burning and fresh water and pine needles. And fish. Alexander saw the smokestack of a fishing plant on the outskirts of the village.</p><p>He continued down the road, passing a woman sitting on the bench outside her house. She stared at him; he understood. How often did these people see a Red Army officer? The woman got up and said, \u201cOh, no! You\u2019re not Alexander, are you?\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t know how to answer that. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI am Alexander. I\u2019m looking for Tatiana and Dasha Metanova. Do you know where they live?\u201d</p> <p>The woman started to cry.</p><p>Alexander stared at her. \u201cI\u2019ll just ask someone else,\u201d he muttered, walking on.</p><p>The woman ran after him in small steps. \u201cWait, wait!\u201d She pointed down the road. \u201cOn Fridays they have a sewing circle in the village square. Straight ahead, over there.\u201d Shaking her head, she walked back.</p><p>\u201cSo they are alive?\u201d Alexander said in a weak voice, flooded with relief.</p><p>The woman could not answer. Covering her face, she ran back to her house.</p><p>She said they? They meaning . . . he asked for two sisters; she replied they. Alexander slowed down, lighting a cigarette and taking a drink out of his flask. He walked on but stopped before he got to the village square thirty meters ahead.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t come straight up the road. Not yet.</p><p>If they were alive, then in a moment he was going to have different problems from the ones he had imagined, and he thought he had imagined them all. He would deal with this one as he dealt with everything, but first\u2014</p><p>Alexander walked through someone\u2019s garden, apologizing hastily, opened the back gate, and was on the village back path. He wanted to come a roundabout way to the square. He wanted to see Tatiana for a moment without her seeing him. Before there was Dasha, he wanted an instant of being able to look at Tatiana the way he wanted to look at her, without hiding.</p><p>He wanted proof of God before God looked upon the man with His own eyes.</p><p>The elms were standing tall in a green canopy around the small square. A group of people sat beneath the trees at a long wooden table. Most were women; there was, in fact, only one young man. It was a sewing circle, thought Alexander, moving nearer to the table to get a better look.</p><p>He was obstructed from their view by a fence and a sprawling lilac tree. The flowers got into his face and nose. Breathing in their ripe fragrance, he peeked out. He did not see Dasha anywhere. He saw four old women seated around the table, a young boy, an older girl, and a standing Tatiana.</p><p>At first Alexander could not believe it was his Tania. He blinked and tried to refocus his eyes. She was walking around the table, gesturing, showing, leaning forward, bending over. At one point she straightened out and wiped her forehead. She was wearing a short-sleeved yellow peasant dress. She was barefoot, and her slender legs were exposed above her knee. Her bare arms were lightly tanned. Her blonde hair looked bleached by the sun and was parted into two shoulder-length braids tucked behind her ears. Even from a distance he could see the summer freckles on her nose. She was achingly beautiful.</p><p>And alive.</p> <p>Alexander closed his eyes, then opened them again. She was still there, bending over the boy\u2019s work. She said something, everyone laughed loudly, and Alexander watched as the boy\u2019s arm touched Tatiana\u2019s back. Tatiana smiled. Her white teeth sparkled like the rest of her. Alexander didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>She was alive, that was obvious.</p><p>Then why hadn\u2019t she written him?</p><p>And where was Dasha?</p><p>Alexander couldn\u2019t very well continue to stand under a lilac tree.</p><p>He went back out onto the main road, took a deep breath, stubbed out his cigarette, and walked toward the square, never taking his eyes off her braids. His heart was thundering in his chest, as if he were going into battle.</p><p>Tatiana looked up, saw him, and covered her face with her hands. Alexander watched everyone get up and rush to her, the old ladies showing unexpected agility and speed. She pushed them all away, pushed the table away, pushed the bench away, and ran to him. Alexander was paralyzed by his emotion. He wanted to smile, but he thought any second he was going to fall to his knees and cry. He dropped all his gear, including his rifle. God, he thought, in a second I\u2019m going to feel her. And that\u2019s when he smiled.</p><p>Tatiana sprang into his open arms, and Alexander, lifting her off her feet with the force of his embrace, couldn\u2019t hug her tight enough, couldn\u2019t breathe in enough of her. She flung her arms around his neck, burying her face in his bearded cheek. Dry sobs racked her entire body. She was heavier than the last time he felt her in all her clothes as he lifted her into the Lake Ladoga truck. She, with her boots, her clothes, coats, and coverings, had not weighed what she weighed now.</p><p>She smelled incredible. She smelled of soap and sunshine and caramelized sugar.</p><p>She felt incredible. Holding her to him, Alexander rubbed his face into her braids, murmuring a few pointless words. \u201cShh, shh . . . come on, now, shh, Tatia. Please . . .\u201d His voice broke.</p><p>\u201cOh, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana said softly into his neck. She was clutching the back of his head. \u201cYou\u2019re alive. Thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tatiana,\u201d Alexander said, hugging her tighter, if that were possible, his arms swaddling her summer body. \u201cYou\u2019re alive. Thank God.\u201d His hands ran up to her neck and down to the small of her back. Her dress was made of very thin cotton. He could almost feel her skin through it. She felt very soft.</p><p>Finally he let her feet touch the ground. Tatiana looked up at him. His hands remained around her little waist. He wasn\u2019t letting go of her. Was she always this tiny, standing barefoot in front of him?</p><p>\u201cI like your beard,\u201d Tatiana said, smiling shyly and touching his face.</p><p>\u201cI love your hair,\u201d Alexander said, pulling on a braid and smiling back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re messy . . .\u201d</p><p>He looked her over. \u201cAnd you\u2019re stunning.\u201d He could not take his eyes off her glorious, eager, vivid lips. They were the color of July tomatoes\u2014</p><p>He bent to her\u2014</p><p>With a deep breath Alexander remembered Dasha. He stopped smiling, letting go of Tatiana and stepping slightly away.</p><p>She frowned, looking at him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dasha, Tania?\u201d he asked.</p><p>What Alexander saw pass through her eyes then . . . there was hurt and sadness and grief and guilt, and anger \u2014 at him? \u2014 all of it, and in a blink it was all gone, and then an icy veil clouded her eyes. Alexander watched something in Tatiana shut against him. She looked at him coolly, and though her hands were still trembling, her voice was steady and low. \u201cDasha died, Alexander. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Alexander reached out to touch her, but she backed away from him. She didn\u2019t just back away from him. She staggered away from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, perplexed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, I\u2019m really sorry about Dasha,\u201d Tatiana said, unable to meet his eyes. \u201cYou came all this way . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking\u2014\u201d</p><p>But before he had a chance to continue or Tatiana a chance to respond, the other members of her sewing circle surrounded them. \u201cTanechka?\u201d said a small, round salt-and-pepper woman with small, round eyes. \u201cWho is this? Is this Dasha\u2019s Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cThis is Dasha\u2019s Alexander.\u201d Glancing at him, she said, \u201cAlexander \u2014 meet Naira Mikhailovna.\u201d</p><p>Naira started to cry. \u201cOh, you poor man.\u201d She didn\u2019t just shake Alexander\u2019s hand, she hugged him. Poor man? He stared at Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cNaira, please,\u201d Tatiana said, backing farther away from him.</p><p>Sniffling, Naira whispered to Tatiana, \u201cDid he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know. But he does now,\u201d replied Tatiana. That provoked a sustained wail out of Naira.</p><p>Tatiana made further introductions. \u201cAlexander, meet Vova, Naira\u2019s grandson, and Zoe, Vova\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Vova was precisely the kind of strapping lad Alexander hated to think about. Round-faced, round-eyed, round-mouthed, a dark-haired version of his small and compact grandmother, Vova shook Alexander\u2019s hand.</p><p>Zoe, a large, black-haired village girl, hugged him, shoving her big breasts into his uniform tunic. She held Alexander\u2019s hand in hers and said, \u201cWe\u2019re so pleased to meet you, Alexander. We\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d said a bright, curly-haired woman, whom Tatiana introduced as Naira\u2019s older sister, Axinya. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard everything about you,\u201d Axinya said energetically and vocally. She hugged Alexander, too.</p><p>Then two more women moved front and center. They were both gray-haired and frail. One of them had a shaking disorder. Her hands shook, her head shook, her mouth shook as she spoke. Raisa was her name. Her mother\u2019s name was Dusia, who was taller and broader than her daughter and wore a large silver cross over her dark dress. Dusia made the sign of the cross on Alexander, and said, \u201cGod will take care of you, Alexander. Don\u2019t you worry.\u201d</p><p>Alexander wanted to tell Dusia that having found Tatiana alive, he had nothing to worry about, but before he could say anything, Axinya asked Alexander how he was feeling, which was followed by a second round of hugs and a second round of tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling fine,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cReally, there is no need to cry.\u201d</p><p>He might as well have been speaking English. They continued to cry.</p><p>Alexander looked at Tatiana perplexed. But not only did she stand off to the side, but Vova stood by her.</p><p>\u201cYou are just the \u2014 oh, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I just can\u2019t,\u201d cried Naira.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t, Naira Mikhailovna,\u201d Tatiana said mildly. \u201cHe is all right. Look. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania is right,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear man,\u201d said Naira, grabbing his sleeve. \u201cYou\u2019ve traveled so far. You must be exhausted.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t until five minutes ago. He looked at Tatiana and said, \u201cI am a little hungry.\u201d And smiled.</p><p>She did not smile back when she said, \u201cOf course. Let\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><p>Nothing was making any sense to a tired and hungry Alexander, who found himself suddenly losing his patience. \u201cExcuse me, please,\u201d he said, extricating himself from Axinya, who was standing in front of him, and making his way through the sea of people to Tatiana. \u201cCan I talk to you for a second?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana backed away from him, averting her face. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll make you dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we\u201d \u2014 Alexander found himself having trouble getting the words out \u2014 \u201cjust for a moment, talk, Tania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, of course,\u201d said Naira. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk. Come, dear, come to our house.\u201d She took him by the arm. \u201cThis must be the worst day of your life.\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t know what to think about this day.</p><p>\u201cLet us take care of you,\u201d Naira continued. \u201cOur Tania is a very good cook.\u201d</p><p>Their Tania? \u201cI know,\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll eat, you\u2019ll drink. We\u2019ll talk. We\u2019ll talk plenty. We\u2019ll tell you everything. How long are you here for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Alexander said, not even trying to catch Tatiana\u2019s eye anymore.</p><p>They started walking, amid all the commotion forgetting their sewing. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Tatiana blankly and went back to the table. Alexander followed her. Zoe ran alongside him, and he said, \u201cZoe, I need a moment alone with Tania,\u201d and without even waiting for a response, hurried to catch up with Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d he said to her.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was your trip here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. It was fine. Why didn\u2019t you write to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you write to me?\u201d</p><p>Taken aback, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were alive either,\u201d she replied, almost calmly, if only he didn\u2019t see through the veil. Under it there was a storm she was not letting him near.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to write to me and tell me you made it here safely,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cRemember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tatiana said pointedly. \u201cDasha was supposed to write to you and tell you. Remember? But she died. So she couldn\u2019t.\u201d She gathered up the material \u2014 the needles, the thread, the beads and buttons and paper patterns \u2014 stuffing it all into a bag.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about Dasha, I\u2019m so sorry. Please.\u201d Alexander touched her back.</p><p>Tatiana flinched from him and blinked back tears. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her? Did you make it out of Kobona?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Tatiana said quietly. \u201cShe didn\u2019t. She died the morning we got there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t look at each other, and they were silent.</p><p>Dragging Dasha down the slope to Ladoga, begging her to hold on, to walk, while Tania herself could not keep upright, yet pushing her sister forward, willing her to live.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tatia,\u201d Alexander whispered.</p><p>\u201cSeeing you,\u201d Tatiana said, \u201cbrings it all back, doesn\u2019t it? The wounds are still so raw.\u201d That\u2019s when she raised her eyes and looked at him. And Alexander saw the wounds.</p><p>Slowly they walked back to everyone else.</p><p>Vova slapped Alexander on the shoulder and asked, \u201cSo how\u2019s the war going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe war is good, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hear our guys are not doing so great. The Germans are near Stalingrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThe Germans are very strong.\u201d</p><p>Vova slapped Alexander\u2019s shoulder again. \u201cI see they have to keep you fit in war. I\u2019m joining. I\u2019m seventeen next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the Red Army will make a man out of you,\u201d Alexander said, trying to sound more cheerful. He watched Tatiana carry the large bag of sewing. \u201cWant me to carry that?\u201d Alexander asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right. You\u2019ve got enough of your own things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Tatiana didn\u2019t look at him when she said it.</p><p>What was going on? He said quizzically, \u201cTania . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d Naira said, \u201ctomorrow is our day to go to the banya. Can you wait until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll wash tonight in the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you can wait one day?\u201d said Naira.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been on trains for four days. I haven\u2019t had water on me for too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour days!\u201d exclaimed Raisa, shaking. \u201cThe man has been on trains for four days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d cried Naira, wiping her face, \u201cand for what, for what? Oh, what a wasteland this war is, what waste, what tragedy.\u201d The other ladies sniffled in agreement.</p><p>Alexander heard a small muffled groan escape Tatiana. He wanted her to look at him. He wanted to look into her face. He wanted her to tell him what was wrong. He wanted to touch her bare arms. He wanted to touch her so badly that . . . but his hands were full of his things. \u201cTatia . . .\u201d he whispered, leaning deeply into her, nearly touching her hair with his mouth.</p><p>He heard her breath stop for a moment, and then she moved away.</p><p>In slight frustration he straightened up, noticing that Vova did not stray far from Tatiana\u2019s side, and she did not appear to move away from him.</p><p>They ambled down the road. From the small village houses, neighbors poured out in milky lines, some shaking their heads, some pointing, some dabbing their eyes. Many saluted him. One middle-aged lady came over and gave Alexander a sympathetic hug. One old man said, \u201cYou make us all proud.\u201d Why did Alexander think it wasn\u2019t for his effort in the war? \u201cThe way you came here for your Dasha.\u201d The man pumped his hand. \u201cAnything you need, anything at all, you come to me. I\u2019m Igor.\u201d</p><p>Alexander asked quietly, \u201cTania, why do I feel as if everybody knows me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, because they all do,\u201d Tatiana said flatly, staring straight ahead. \u201cYou are the captain in the Red Army, who has come to marry my sister. They all know that. Unfortunately, she has died. And they all know that, too. And everyone is very sorry.\u201d Her voice remained almost steady.</p><p>Sobs from Dusia from behind and Naira from the front. \u201cAlexander,\u201d Naira said, \u201cat home we\u2019ll give you plenty of vodka, and we\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d He glanced at Tatiana. He was hoping the we wasn\u2019t going to be more than two. Why did he suspect it might be?</p><p>\u201cTania, how have you been?\u201d Alexander asked. \u201cHow did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s been great,\u201d Vova interrupted, putting his arm around Tatiana. \u201cShe\u2019s much better now.\u201d</p><p>Alexander stared straight ahead, his gaze clouding. The tick inside him was multiplying.</p><p>It was at that moment \u2014 when he set his teeth and turned his face away \u2014 that Tatiana moved away from Vova to Alexander and put her hand on him. \u201cYou must be exhausted, hmm?\u201d she said gently, peering into his face. \u201cFour days on trains. Have you eaten today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the morning,\u201d he replied, not looking at her.</p><p>Tatiana nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better once you\u2019re clean and fed,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cAnd shaved.\u201d She squeezed his arm.</p><p>He felt better and smiled back. He was going to have to talk to her about Vova. Alexander saw unresolved things in Tatiana\u2019s eyes. The last time they had peace or energy to resolve anything was St. Isaac\u2019s. A moment with her alone and things would get better, but first he had to talk to her about Vova.</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d Axinya echoed, \u201cwe pulled our Tanechka right out from the jaws of death.\u201d There was a loud wail.</p><p>Alexander looked at Tatiana walking next to him, feeling a liquid warmth ooze through him. \u201cPlease, let me carry that,\u201d he said.</p><p>She was about to give him her sewing bag when Vova intercepted it, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll carry it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Alexander asked, \u201cyou didn\u2019t by any chance run into Dimitri in Kobona, did you?\u201d</p><p>Naira quickly turned around and hissed at Alexander, her eyes bright imploring cups. \u201cShh. We don\u2019t talk about Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bastard!\u201d exclaimed Axinya.</p><p>\u201cAxinya, please!\u201d said Naira, turning to Alexander and nodding. \u201cShe is right, though. He is a bastard,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Alexander stared at them all, wide-eyed. \u201cTania,\u201d he said, \u201cam I to assume that you did run into Dimitri in Kobona?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, and nothing else.</p><p>Alexander shook his head. He was a bastard.</p><p>Zoe on his left leaned in and said in a conspiratorial whisper, \u201cAnother reason we don\u2019t talk about Dimitri is because our Vovka\u2019s got a big thing for Tania.\u201d</p><p>Moving away from Zoe and toward Tatiana, Alexander muttered, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Naira\u2019s house at the top end of the village toward the river was white, wooden, and square. And small. \u201cYou all live here?\u201d Alexander asked, glancing at Tatiana, who walked ahead.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Naira said, \u201cjust us and our Tania. Vova and Zoe live with their mother on the other side of Lazarevo. Their father was killed in the Ukraine last summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabushka,\u201d said Zoe, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be room in your house for Alexander.\u201d</p><p>Alexander looked at the house. Zoe may have been right. In the front garden there were two goats, and three chickens in a wire coop. It looked as if they had plenty of room.</p><p>Following Tatiana inside, Alexander walked up a couple of wooden steps into a roomy glassed-in porch that had two small couches at one end and a long, rectangular wooden table at the other. Coming through the porch, he stood in the doorway looking into the darkened parlor room in the middle of which stood a wood-burning stove.</p><p>Taking up nearly the entire back of the room, the stove had a long cast-iron hearth and three compartments \u2014 the center for burning wood and two side ones for baking. The chimney went up and to the left. Above the stove was a flat surface covered with quilts and pillows. In many village huts across the Soviet Union, the top of the stove was frequently used as a bed. After the fire below went out, it was very warm up there.</p><p>In front of the hearth stood a high table for food preparation, and at the back was a sewing machine on a desk, and a black trunk. On the right were two doors, leading to what Alexander guessed were bedrooms.</p><p>Tatiana was by his side. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d he said to her. \u201cYou sleep up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied without meeting his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable. Come inside for a minute.\u201d She walked through to the desk on the side of the stove.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d said Naira from behind. \u201cZoechka is right. We really don\u2019t have much room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, I have my tent,\u201d said Alexander, following Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cNo, no tent,\u201d said Naira. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay with Vova and Zoe? They have room for you; they have a nice bedroom they could put you in. With a proper bed and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Alexander, turning around to Naira. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanechka, don\u2019t you think it would be more comfortable for him? He could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaira Mikhailovna,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201che already said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d said Axinya, walking through the porch. \u201cBut it really would be more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d repeated Alexander. \u201cI will sleep in my tent, right outside. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana motioned him to her. He couldn\u2019t get to her fast enough. They were alone long enough for her to say, \u201cSleep here, on top of the stove. It\u2019s very warm.\u201d</p><p>He kept his voice even when he said, \u201cAnd where are you going to sleep?\u201d</p><p>Her face turned red, and he couldn\u2019t help himself \u2014 he burst out laughing and kissed her cheek. That made her even more red.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re the funniest girl.\u201d</p><p>She backed away practically into the porch.</p><p>Smiling at her, he said, \u201cListen, I\u2019m going to go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo with Zoe and Vova?\u201d said Naira, coming into the room. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea. I knew our Tanechka could convince you. She can talk the devil into a new dress. Zoe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d exclaimed Tatiana.</p><p>Alexander wanted to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cNaira Mikhailovna, he\u2019s not going,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t come all this way to stay with Vova and Zoe. He\u2019ll stay here. He\u2019ll sleep up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Naira said, her breath taken out of her a bit. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>Could she keep herself from blushing? No, she couldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, if he\u2019s staying, why don\u2019t you change the linen on your bed so he\u2019ll have fresh sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d agreed Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch them,\u201d whispered Alexander.</p><p>Saying she was going to get Alexander fresh towels, Naira disappeared to her room.</p><p>Instantly they turned to each other. She couldn\u2019t manage to look up at him, but she was turned to him and close to him, and \u2014 was she smelling him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go and wash, and I will be right back,\u201d said Alexander, smiling. He didn\u2019t know what to do with his hands. He wanted to take hold of hers. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here. Do you need soap?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cGot plenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do. But look what else I\u2019ve got.\u201d Out of her desk drawer she pulled out a small bottle of shampoo. \u201cFound it in Molotov. Cost me twenty rubles.\u201d She handed it to him. \u201cReal shampoo for your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spent twenty rubles on a bottle of shampoo?\u201d he said, mock aghast, taking it from her and grabbing her fingers.</p><p>\u201cBetter than two hundred and fifty rubles on a cup of flour,\u201d she replied, quickly pulling her fingers away and trying to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cWas that twenty of my rubles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThe rubles in your book came in very handy. Thank you.\u201d She did not look at him. \u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad they did, and you\u2019re welcome. For everything.\u201d He could not tear his eyes away from her. \u201cTatiasha, you\u2019ve gotten so blonde.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged casually. \u201cIt\u2019s the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so freckled\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me point you to the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Look what I\u2019ve brought for you.\u201d Crouching near his bag, he showed her many cans of tushonka, some coffee, a large bag of lump sugar, rock salt, cigarettes, and bottles of vodka. \u201cAnd I got you another English-Russian book,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you been practicing your English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Tatiana replied. \u201cI haven\u2019t had time. I can\u2019t believe you carried all that. It must have been so heavy.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cBut thank you. Come on outside.\u201d</p><p>Taking a towel from Naira, they walked through the porch and down the steps to the back garden. Alexander stood as close to Tatiana as possible without his body actually touching hers. He knew that six pairs of eyes were on them from the porch. Tatiana pointed. Alexander wasn\u2019t even looking at where she was pointing. He was looking at her blonde eyebrows. He wanted to touch them with his fingers.</p><p>He wanted to touch her with his fingers.</p><p>Missing a breath, he touched the faint scar above the brow where she had been injured during the fight with her father. \u201cThat\u2019s almost gone,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cCan\u2019t even see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t see it,\u201d Tatiana said lightly, \u201cthen why are you touching it?\u201d She didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cAlexander,\u201d she said, \u201ccan you look where I\u2019m pointing? It\u2019s right through the pines. Will you look? Just cross the road, and there\u2019s a path between the trees. Walk down a hundred meters into the clearing. I do the laundry there. You can\u2019t miss it. The Kama is a big river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get lost, for sure,\u201d said Alexander, bending to her ear and lowering his voice. \u201cCome and show me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania has to cook dinner,\u201d said Zoe, coming up to them. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tatiana said, backing away. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Zoe show you? I really do have to start cooking if we\u2019re to eat tonight.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cNo, Zoe. Excuse us,\u201d and he pulled Tatiana away. \u201cCome with me to the river,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou can tell me what\u2019s upsetting you, and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana whispered. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he let go of her and went by himself. When he returned, clean and shaven, dressed in his Class-Bs, he saw that Zoe was shamelessly interested in him. Alexander wasn\u2019t surprised. In a town with no young men, he could have had one eye and no teeth and Zoe would have been interested. Tatiana was another story. She obstinately avoided meeting his eyes. While leaning over the hearth and her frying pans, she said, \u201cYou\u2019ve shaved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d He was staring at her back and hips as she leaned over in her yellow dress. Her waist tapered into her tight, round-as-a-moon hips, and the backs of her bare thighs peeked out below the short hem. He was pulsing inside. \u201cTania, this village life agrees with you,\u201d Alexander said after a few moments.</p><p>Straightening up, she was about to walk to the porch when he grabbed her hand and put it to his cheek. \u201cDo you like it better smooth?\u201d He rubbed her hand back and forth against his face and then kissed her fingers.</p><p>Gently she pulled her hand away. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen much of you clean-shaven,\u201d she muttered. \u201cEither way is fine. I\u2019m covered in onions, Alexander,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get you all messy. You just got so nice and . . . clean.\u201d She cleared her throat and averted her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTatia,\u201d he said, not letting go of her floury hand, \u201cit\u2019s me. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyes to him and blinked, and he saw hurt in her eyes, hurt, and warmth, and sadness, but hurt foremost, and he started to say, \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, dear, come in here with us. Let Tania finish making dinner. Come, have a drink.\u201d</p><p>He went out to the porch. Naira handed him a shot of vodka. Shaking his head, Alexander said, \u201cI\u2019m not drinking without Tatiana. Tania! Come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll drink the next one with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019ll drink the first one with us. Tania, come out here.\u201d</p><p>She came out, smelling sweetly of potatoes and onions, and stood next to him.</p><p>Naira said, \u201cOur Tanechka doesn\u2019t even drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to Alexander,\u201d Tatiana said. Alexander handed her his vodka glass, his fingers touching hers. Naira poured him another. They raised their glasses. \u201cTo Alexander,\u201d said Tatiana, her voice breaking. Her eyes were filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cTo Alexander,\u201d they echoed. \u201cAnd to Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to Dasha,\u201d Alexander said quietly.</p><p>They drank, and Tatiana went back inside.</p><p>A dozen people from the village came by before dinner, all wanting to meet Alexander, all bringing small gifts. One woman brought an egg. One old man a fishhook. Another man a fishing line. One young girl a few hard candies. Every one of them shook his hand, and some bowed, and one woman got on her knees, crossed herself, and kissed the glass he was holding. Alexander was moved and exhausted. He took out a cigarette.</p><p>Vova said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take that outside? Our Tania has a hard time with smoke in the house.\u201d</p><p>Alexander put away his cigarette, swearing under his breath. To have Vova look out for Tania\u2019s welfare was too much. But before he could say another word, he felt Tatiana\u2019s hand on his shoulder and her face right in front of him as she put an ashtray on the table. \u201cSmoke, Alexander, smoke,\u201d she said.</p><p>Petulantly Vova said, \u201cBut, Tania, the smoke bothers you. That\u2019s why we all go outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I said that, Vova,\u201d Tatiana declared. \u201cBut Alexander didn\u2019t come all the way from the war to smoke outside. He\u2019ll smoke where he pleases.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Alexander said, \u201cI don\u2019t need to smoke.\u201d He wanted her hand on his shoulder and her face in front of him again. \u201cTania, do you need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can help by getting up and eating my food. It\u2019s dinnertime.\u201d</p><p>The four ladies sat on one side of the long table that was flanked by two benches. \u201cUsually Tatiana sits on the end. So she can get up and get stuff, you know?\u201d Zoe smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI\u2019ll sit next to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually I sit next to her,\u201d said Vova.</p><p>Shrugging and not interested in dealing with Vova, Alexander looked at Tatiana and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>She wiped her hands on a towel and said, \u201cHow about if I sit between Alexander and Vova.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d said Zoe. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll sit on the other side of Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Tatiana had made a cucumber and tomato salad and cooked some potatoes with onions and tushonka. She opened a jar of marinated mushrooms. There was white bread, some butter, milk, cheese, and a few hard-boiled eggs.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you, Shu\u2014?\u201d asked Tatiana, sliding in next to him. \u201cDo you want some salad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>She stood up. \u201cWhat about some mushrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana spooned food onto his plate, standing near him. The only reason Alexander let her continue and didn\u2019t get the food himself was because her bare leg was touching his trousers and her hip was pressing into his elbow. He was going to have her get him seconds and thirds to keep her standing this close to him. His urge was to put his arm around her waist. He took his fork instead. \u201cYes, please, some potatoes, too. Yes, that\u2019s plenty. Some bread, yes, that\u2019s good, butter, yes.\u201d</p><p>Alexander thought she would sit down, but no, she walked around the table and ladled out food for the old ladies.</p><p>And then she served Vova. Alexander\u2019s heart tightened when he saw her serve Vova with casual familiarity. Vova thanked her, and she smiled lightly, looking right at him.</p><p>At Vova she looked. At Vova she smiled. For God\u2019s sake, thought Alexander. The only thing that prevented him from feeling worse about it was that in Tania\u2019s eyes he saw nothing for Vova.</p><p>Finally she sat down.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see food in front of you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she replied.</p><p>The rooms were so dark that he could not see her well, but he could see blood trickling from her mouth as she cut the black bread for him, for Dasha, and, last, for herself. Now she was eating white bread, and butter, and eggs. \u201cMuch better, Tatia,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and nearly inaudibly, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Zoe\u2019s annoying elbow intermittently and purposefully rubbed against Alexander\u2019s. Zoe played the game very well. Alexander wondered if Tatiana even noticed Zoe.</p><p>Moving away from Zoe, Alexander scooted closer to Tatiana. \u201cJust to give you a bit more room, Zoe,\u201d he said with an indifferent smile.</p><p>\u201cYes, but look,\u201d said Naira, who was sitting across from them, \u201cnow poor Tanechka is all squished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Tatiana. Under the table her leg was flush with his. He nudged her once.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Alexander said, eating hungrily, \u201chave I had enough to drink for you to tell me what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Tears. Not from Tatiana, from the four ladies. \u201cOh, Alexander! We don\u2019t think you\u2019ve had enough to drink to hear it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I hear some of it?\u201d</p><p>Naira said, \u201cTania doesn\u2019t like us to talk about it, but, Tanechka, for Alexander, can we tell him what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Alexander, yes, tell him what happened.\u201d Tatiana sighed.</p><p>\u201cI want Tania to tell me what happened,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cDo you want more vodka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, pouring one for him. \u201cAlexander, there is really not much to tell. Like I told you, we got to Kobona. Dasha died. I came here and was sick for a while\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear death, I tell you!\u201d exclaimed Naira.</p><p>\u201cNaira Mikhailovna, please,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI was a little sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick?\u201d Axinya cried. \u201cAlexander, that child got to us in January and was at death\u2019s door until March. What didn\u2019t she have? She had scurvy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was bleeding from the inside out!\u201d mouthed Dusia. \u201cJust like our former Tsarevich Alexis. Just like him. Bled and bled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s scurvy for you,\u201d said Alexander gently.</p><p>\u201cThe Tsarevich did not have scurvy,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cHe had hemophilia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten about her double pneumonia?\u201d cried Axinya. \u201cBoth her lungs collapsed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAxinya, please,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cIt was only one lung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the pneumonia that almost killed her. She couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d Naira stated, sticking her hand across the table for Tatiana to pat.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pneumonia that nearly killed her!\u201d Axinya exclaimed. \u201cIt was TB. Naira, you\u2019re so forgetful. Don\u2019t you remember her coughing up blood for weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Tania,\u201d whispered Alexander.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, I\u2019m fine. Really,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI had a mild case of TB. They cured it even before I got out of the hospital. The doctor said soon I should be as good as before. The doctor said by next year the TB would be all gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were going to let me smoke inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d she said. \u201cYou always smoke inside. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d cried Axinya. \u201cTania, you were in an isolation tent for a month. We sat by her, Alexander, as she lay, coughing, spitting blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell him how you got TB?\u201d said Naira loudly.</p><p>Alexander felt Tatiana shudder next to him. \u201cThat I\u2019ll tell him later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen later?\u201d whispered Alexander out of the corner of his mouth. She did not whisper back.</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d exclaimed Axinya. \u201cTell Alexander about what you had to go through to get here. Tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, Tania,\u201d he said, looking at her with feeling. The food she made was so good; otherwise he would have lost his appetite.</p><p>As if it was a great effort to her, Tatiana said, \u201cLook, me and hundreds of others were piled on into trucks and then driven to the train, near Volkhov . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him about the train!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best of trains. There were a lot of us . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him how many!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cWe were . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when the people died on the trains?\u201d said Dusia, crossing herself.</p><p>\u201cOh, they just threw them out. To make more room.\u201d</p><p>Naira said, sniffling, \u201cThere was more room when they got to the Volga River.\u201d</p><p>Axinya exclaimed, \u201cAlexander, the railroad bridge across the Volga had been blown up, and the train couldn\u2019t get across. All the evacuees, including our Tanechka, were told they had to cross the ice on foot in their frightful condition. What about that?\u201d</p><p>Alexander blinked and blinked again. He didn\u2019t take his eyes off Tatiana\u2019s bemused and slightly wearied face.</p><p>\u201cHow many people crossed that, Tania? How many people died on the ice? Tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Axinya. I wasn\u2019t counting . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody,\u201d said Dusia. \u201cI\u2019m sure nobody survived it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Tania survived it,\u201d said Alexander, his elbow pressing into Tatiana\u2019s arm, his leg pressing into hers.</p><p>\u201cAnd other people survived it,\u201d said Tatiana. Lowering her voice, she added, \u201cNot many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, tell him,\u201d Axinya exclaimed, \u201chow many kilometers you had to walk, tubercular, pneumatic, in the snow, in the blizzard, to the next rail station because there weren\u2019t enough trucks to carry all of you sick and starving to the train. Tell him how many.\u201d She widened her eyes. \u201cIt was, like, fifteen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dear,\u201d Tatiana corrected. \u201cIt was maybe three. And there was no blizzard. It was just cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they give you anything to eat?\u201d Axinya demanded. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI had a little food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d cried Axinya. \u201cTell him about the train, tell him how there was no place for you to lie down, how you stood for three days from Volkhov to the Volga!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stood for three days,\u201d said Tatiana, stabbing her food with a fork. \u201cFrom Volkhov to the Volga.\u201d</p><p>Wiping her eyes, Dusia said, \u201cAfter the Volga crossing, so many people died that Tatiana had a shelf on the train to lie down on, right, Tania? She lay down\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd never got up again!\u201d stated Axinya.</p><p>\u201cDear,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cI did eventually get up.\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Axinya. \u201cThere I\u2019m not exaggerating. You didn\u2019t. The conductor asked where you were going, and he couldn\u2019t wake you to ask you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut finally he woke me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally, yes!\u201d cried Axinya. \u201cBut he thought you were dead.\u201d</p><p>Raisa added, \u201cShe got off the train at Molotov and asked how far Lazarevo was, and when she heard it was ten kilometers, she . . .\u201d</p><p>Loud crying from all four ladies.</p><p>Tatiana said to Alexander, \u201cSorry you have to hear all this.\u201d</p><p>Alexander stopped eating. He placed his hand on her back, patting her gently. When he saw she didn\u2019t move away and didn\u2019t flinch and didn\u2019t blush, he left his hand on her for another long moment. Then he picked up his fork again.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, do you know what she did when she heard Lazarevo was ten kilometers from Molotov?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d said Alexander, smiling. \u201cShe fainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! How did you know?\u201d asked Axinya, studying him.</p><p>\u201cI faint all the time,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI\u2019m a big wimp.\u201d</p><p>Naira said, \u201cAfter she came out of isolation, we sat next to her hospital bed, holding her oxygen mask to her face to help her breathe.\u201d Wiping her face, she said, \u201cWhen her grandmother died\u2014\u201d</p><p>The fork dropped from Alexander\u2019s hand. Involuntarily. Mutely he sat and looked into his plate, unable to turn his head even to Tatiana. It was she who turned her head to him, gazing at him with softness and sorrow. \u201cWhere is that vodka, Tania?\u201d Alexander said. \u201cClearly I haven\u2019t had enough.\u201d</p><p>She poured it for him and poured a small glass for herself, and then they lifted their glasses, clinking lightly, and stared at each other, faces full of Leningrad, and Fifth Soviet, and her family and his family, and Lake Ladoga, and night. Tatiana whispered, \u201cCourage, Shura.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t reply. He swallowed the vodka instead.</p><p>The rest of the people at the table fell quiet until Alexander asked, \u201cHow did she die?\u201d</p><p>Naira wiped her nose. \u201cDysentery. Last December.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cPersonally, I think that after she lost Tania\u2019s grandfather, she just didn\u2019t want to go on.\u201d Naira glanced at Tatiana. \u201cI know Tania agrees with me.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana nodded. \u201cShe wanted to,\u201d she said. \u201cShe just couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Naira poured Alexander another drink. \u201cWhen Anna was dying, she said to me, \u2018Naira, I wish you could see all my granddaughters, but you\u2019re probably never going to see our baby Tania. She\u2019ll never make it here. She is so frail.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d said Alexander, downing the vodka, \u201cwas not such a good judge of her granddaughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said to us,\u201d Naira continued, \u201c \u2018If my granddaughters come, please make sure they\u2019re all right. Keep my house for them \u2014 \u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cHouse?\u201d asked Alexander, instantly perking up. \u201cWhat house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they had an izba\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is this izba?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in the woods a bit. By the river. Tania can show you. When Tania got better and came to Lazarevo with us, she wanted to live in that house,\u201d Naira said, widening her eyes meaningfully, \u201call by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was she thinking?\u201d questioned Alexander.</p><p>Beaming, the ladies all loudly agreed, scoffing and snorting in unison. Naira said, \u201cNo granddaughter of our Anna is going to live by herself. What kind of nonsense is that? Who lives by themselves? We said, you are our family. Your beloved Deda was my first husband\u2019s cousin by marriage. You come and live with us. It\u2019s so much better for you here. And it is, isn\u2019t it, Tanechka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Naira Mikhailovna.\u201d Tatiana served Alexander some more potatoes. \u201cAre you still hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m not sure what I am anymore,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI will certainly continue to eat.\u201d</p><p>Naira said, \u201cOur Tania is better now, but she has to watch herself. She still goes to Molotov every month to get checked out. TB can come back at any time. That\u2019s why we all smoke outside\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d piped up Vova, putting his arm on Tatiana\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Alexander was going to have to talk to Tatiana about Vova, and soon.</p><p>Axinya said, \u201cAlexander, you have no idea how thin she was when she came to us . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some idea,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cDon\u2019t I, Tania?\u201d</p><p>She whispered, \u201cSome idea, Shura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was skin and bones,\u201d said Dusia. \u201cChrist Himself almost could not save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that we don\u2019t live in a collective farming village like our cousin Yulia, right, Naira?\u201d said Axinya. \u201cYulia lives in Kulay near Archangelsk, and though she is fifty-seven, she works in the field all day, and then the Kolkhoz takes her food away. Here they just take our fish, but we can barter our eggs and goat milk for some butter or cheese or even some white flour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Yulia,\u201d sniffed Naira. \u201cBut look at our Tanechka.\u201d</p><p>Axinya smiled and looked affectionately at Tatiana. \u201cWe\u2019ve fattened you up, haven\u2019t we, honey? Eggs every day. Milk. Butter. We\u2019ve fattened her up good, don\u2019t you think, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d said Alexander, reaching underneath the table and lightly squeezing Tatiana\u2019s thigh.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s like a warm bun,\u201d added Axinya.</p><p>\u201cA warm bun?\u201d Alexander repeated, his grinning face turning to Tatiana, who was a deep red. Her short dress wasn\u2019t long enough to cover her thighs. His bare hand caressed her bare leg, under the table, during dinner, in front of six strangers. Alexander had to take his hand away. Had to. He lost his breath, along with his reserve, and his self-control.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, want more?\u201d Tatiana said, standing and picking up the frying pan. Her hands were unsteady. \u201cThere is plenty.\u201d She smiled at him, breathing through her parted mouth. \u201cPlenty.\u201d Her face was flushed.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll have a drink instead,\u201d Alexander said, unable to look up at her for a change.</p><p>Axinya said, \u201cAlexander, we want you to know that we weren\u2019t happy with Tanechka. We want you to know we were on your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, what did you do to upset these nice women?\u201d said Alexander lightly.</p><p>Why did Tania stop smiling and glare at Axinya?</p><p>Naira, mouth full of fried potatoes, said, \u201cWe told her to write to you and tell you what happened to Dasha so you wouldn\u2019t come all this way expecting to marry your longtime love and be devastated. We told her. Spare him a trip to the middle of the country. Write to him and tell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she refused!\u201d Axinya exclaimed.</p><p>Alexander, the fire in his heart unsubsided, but the temper in his heart also unsubsided, stared at Tatiana. \u201cWhy did she refuse, Axinya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t say. But let me tell you, the thought of you coming here for your Dasha was killing us. We could talk about nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing else, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cMore drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you had written to me, they would have stopped talking,\u201d he said, less friendly. \u201cAnd yes, more drink.\u201d</p><p>She poured it for him so fast she nearly spilled it.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s head was swimming.</p><p>\u201cWe read all of Dasha\u2019s letters to Anna,\u201d said Naira. \u201cThe way that girl raved about you.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou were her shining knight, you know.\u201d</p><p>He finished his glass of vodka in two swallows.</p><p>\u201cTania, we told you to write to him!\u201d Dusia exclaimed. \u201cBut our Tania can be very stubborn sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes?\u201d Alexander took the glass from Tatiana and finished her vodka, too.</p><p>Dusia crossed herself. \u201cI said, you can do it, you can write that letter. But she said no. Not even with God\u2019s help she couldn\u2019t.\u201d She looked at Tatiana with disapproving eyes. \u201cAlexander, we were hoping maybe God would spare you pain and let you die at the front.\u201d</p><p>Alexander raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou were hoping I would die at the front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania and I prayed for your soul every day,\u201d said Dusia. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want you to suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I think,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cTania, were you praying for my death every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Alexander,\u201d she replied quietly, unable to be cold, unable to be insincere, unable to lie, or to look at him, or to touch him. Unable. Whatever sat inside her rendered her unable to deal with him. He looked around the crowded table.</p><p>\u201cOh, Alexander!\u201d exclaimed Axinya. \u201cThat was some letter you wrote to Dasha. You\u2019re a poet. It was so full of love! When we read that nothing was going to stop you from coming and marrying her this summer, you just about broke our hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Alexander,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cRemember that poetic letter?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly when he looked into her face\u2014</p><p>He studied her. He was starting to lose focus in his brain. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. He had written that letter wanting to reassure Dasha. He didn\u2019t want Tatiana to face her sister by herself. \u201cShould\u2019ve written back, Tania,\u201d he said with reproach. \u201cAnd told me about Dasha.\u201d</p><p>Bolting up, Tatiana started clearing the table.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Alexander said with a shrug. \u201cPerhaps Tania was too busy? Who\u2019s got time to write nowadays? Especially during village life. There are sewing circles, there is cooking\u2014\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his plate. \u201cHow was your dinner, Alexander?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>Too many things to say.</p><p>Nowhere to say them.</p><p>Just like before.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you. More drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she snapped. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Vova asked, \u201cAlexander, so now what are you going to do? Are you going back?\u201d</p><p>Another sharp intake of breath from Tatiana. Alexander held his own breath for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay as long as you like,\u201d declared Naira. \u201cWe love you like family. You might as well already be Dasha\u2019s husband, that\u2019s how we feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is not,\u201d said Zoe adamantly and flirtatiously, placing her hand on Alexander\u2019s arm and smiling. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Alexander. We\u2019ll cheer you up around here. How long is your furlough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201chow is your good friend Stepan? Are you seeing him later tonight?\u201d</p><p>Zoe took her arm away from Alexander, who, smiling and amused, glanced at Tatiana. So she is not entirely oblivious to Zoe, he thought.</p><p>She was clearing the table. Alexander looked around. No one else moved. Not even Zoe or Vova. As he started to stand up, Tatiana asked, \u201cWhere are you going? Smoke at the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo help you clear up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d cried a chorus of voices. \u201cWhat are you thinking? No. Tatiana does it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she does,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want her to do it by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Naira with genuine surprise.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t travel all this way to clear the table.\u201d</p><p>Alexander sat back down, turned to Zoe, and said, \u201cI admit I\u2019m a little tired. Could you help her?\u201d He didn\u2019t smile at her. Zoe seemed to like that even better, giving him a large smile, as big as her breasts, and reluctantly going to help.</p><p>Tatiana made tea and poured a cup for Alexander first, and then for the four ladies and then for Vova and then for Zoe, and then for herself. She brought out the blueberry jam and was just climbing in to sit next to Alexander when Vova said, \u201cTanechka, before you sit, pour me another cup of tea, will you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana, legs straddling the bench, took Vova\u2019s cup when Alexander grabbed her wrist. The cup rattled on the saucer. \u201cYou know what, Vova?\u201d Alexander said, lowering Tatiana\u2019s hand to the table. \u201cThe kettle of water is on the hearth, the teapot is right in front of you. Sit down, Tania. You\u2019ve done plenty. Vova can pour his own tea.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana sat down.</p><p>Everybody at the table stared at Alexander.</p><p>Vova went and poured his own tea.</p><p>Finally it was time for Zoe and Vova to go home. The time couldn\u2019t come fast enough for Alexander, until Vova said, \u201cTania? Walk me out?\u201d</p><p>Without acknowledging Alexander, Tatiana went outside with Vova. Alexander pretended to listen to Zoe and to Naira, but he watched Tatiana outside.</p><p>He wished he had had less vodka. He really needed to talk to Tania. When she came back, Alexander wanted her to look at him. She did not.</p><p>Zoe said, \u201cAlexander, want to go for a smoke and a walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow a group of us are going swimming down in the hole. You want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said noncommittally. He didn\u2019t even look up. Soon she left.</p><p>\u201cTania, come and sit down,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cSit down next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. You want something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You to sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about something else to drink? We have a little cognac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>Carefully she sat down on the bench next to him. He moved over to her. \u201cYou must be so tired,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWant to come outside with me? I need a smoke.\u201d</p><p>Before Tatiana could reply, Naira said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, Alexander, it was very hard for our Tania at first.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana got up with a sigh and disappeared into one of the bedrooms.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want us to talk about it,\u201d said Axinya in hushed tones.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Alexander said. He didn\u2019t either.</p><p>They continued unheeded. \u201cShe was in a bad way. She was just an apparition.\u201d The women all bent their heads toward him, clucking with tears in their eyes. He would have been almost amused by them, if only they weren\u2019t stopping him from getting two words alone with his horse and cart. Naira said, \u201cNo, but can you just imagine, losing your whole\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d Alexander interrupted. He did not want to be talking to these women about it. He stood up, about to excuse himself and go after Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, and that\u2019s not even the half of it,\u201d Naira whispered. \u201cTania really doesn\u2019t like us to talk about what happened in Kobona. We didn\u2019t want to tell you before, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but that Dimitri is a right bastard!\u201d Axinya exclaimed again.</p><p>Alexander sat back down. \u201cTell me quickly.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana came back with a slam of the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tanechka,\u201d Axinya said, \u201cbut I just want to beat that man with a stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop talking about Kobona,\u201d Tatiana said.</p><p>Dusia said, \u201cWoe betide Dimitri. Someday he is going to fall alone, and no one will be there to help him up.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Tatiana left again with another slam of the door.</p><p>Axinya said, \u201cI think that bastard broke her heart. I think she loved him.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was finding it difficult to remain upright.</p><p>Dusia shook her head vehemently. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never would have fooled her for a second. Our Tania sees through people right from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does, doesn\u2019t she, Dusia?\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Axinya lowered her voice and said, \u201cWe still think there\u2019s another story to this, maybe some kind of love thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a love thing,\u201d said Alexander, widening his eyes.</p><p>Naira shook her head. \u201cYou think so, Axinya. But I say no. I disagree. The girl lost everyone. She was devastated. There was no love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there was,\u201d said Axinya firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Naira said.</p><p>\u201cOh? Then why does she keep going to the post office to see if there is any mail for her?\u201d Axinya asked triumphantly. \u201cShe\u2019s got no one left, who is she waiting for mail from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d said Alexander. Was he about to go do something? He couldn\u2019t remember. The day had been too long. Right now he couldn\u2019t remember the last thing anyone had said.</p><p>Axinya said, \u201cAnd have you noticed how during the sewing circle at the square she always picks a place to sit so she can see the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes!\u201d agreed the other three ladies. \u201cYes, she does do that. She watches that road obsessively, as if she is waiting for somebody.\u201d</p><p>Alexander lifted his gaze. Tatiana stood behind the old ladies, her expressive, eternal eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cAre you, Tatiasha?\u201d he asked emotionally, his voice full. \u201cAre you waiting for somebody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d she replied emotionally, her voice just as full.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d said Naira with satisfaction. \u201cI told you there was no love thing!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana sat down next to Alexander.</p><p>Naira said, \u201cTanechka, you don\u2019t mind that we gossip about you, do you? You know you\u2019re the most interesting thing that\u2019s happened to Lazarevo in years. Vova certainly thinks so.\u201d She laughed and to Alexander said, \u201cMy grandson has quite a crush on Dasha\u2019s little sister, you know.\u201d</p><p>Without a word Alexander blinked at Tatiana. He would have said a word, if he could have found one in his head.</p><p>All Alexander wanted was two seconds, maybe one conscious second alone with Tatiana \u2014 why was that too much to ask? Maybe conscious was out of the question, but why was putting his two hands somewhere on her repaired, fed, warm body out of the question?</p><p>He went outside to smoke, to wash. When he returned, he wanted to undress, to take off his boots. Instead he heard a constant stream of \u201cTanechka, darling, can you get me my medicine?\u201d \u201cTanechka, dear, can you come and fix my blankets?\u201d \u201cTanechka, sweetheart, can you get me a glass of water?\u201d Finally he couldn\u2019t wait anymore. He took off his boots. \u201cTania, honey,\u201d he said, and then put his head down on the table and was instantly asleep. He woke up to feel himself being lightly shaken, lightly stroked. It was dark. \u201cCome on, Shura,\u201d her voice whispered. She was trying to get him to stand up. \u201cCome on, can you make it up? Please, wake up and go lie down. Please.\u201d</p><p>He got up on the hearth, hopped up onto the bed on top of the warm stove, and was asleep in his uniform. Through semiconsciousness he felt her taking off his socks, unbuttoning his tunic, unbuckling his belt and pulling it out from the loops. He felt her soft lips on his eyes, on his cheek, on his forehead. He felt fine feathers on his face. It must have been her hair. He wanted to wake up, but it was impossible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>5</p><p>The next morning Alexander opened his eyes and looked at his watch. It was late \u2014 eight in the morning. He looked around for Tatiana. She was nowhere, but he was covered by her quilt and he was lying on her pillow. Smiling, he turned on his stomach and pressed his face into the pillow. It smelled of soap and fresh air and her.</p><p>He went outside. It was a chirping and sunny rural morning; the air was as still as peacetime; the cherry tree blossoms and the lilacs filled the yard with their overripe scent. The lilacs made Alexander especially cheerful \u2014 the Field of Mars was full of lilacs in late spring. He could smell them all the way from the barracks. It was one of his favorite smells, lilacs in the Field of Mars. Not his favorite smell: of an alive Tatiana\u2019s breath as she kissed his unconscious face last night. Lilacs could not compete with that smell.</p><p>The house was quiet. After quickly washing, Alexander went to look for her, finding her on the road, returning home carrying two pails full of warm cow\u2019s milk. Alexander knew it was warm because he stuck his fingers in the pail. Tatiana\u2019s shiny white-blonde hair was left down, and she was wearing a blue wraparound skirt and a small white shirt that came up above her navel, exposing her stomach. The round outlines of her high breasts were clearly visible. Her face was a lovely flushed pink color. Alexander\u2019s heart stopped in his chest when he saw her. He took the milk pails from her. They walked for a minute in silence. He felt himself getting short of breath.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose after this you\u2019re going to go and fetch water from the well,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGoing to?\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cAnd what did you shave with this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho shaved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you brush your teeth?\u201d She smiled lightly.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYes, with your water from the well. Tania, after breakfast,\u201d he said, lowering his already husky voice, \u201cI want you to show me your grandparents\u2019 house. Is it far?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too far,\u201d she said and her face was inscrutable.</p><p>Alexander was not used to Tatiana being inscrutable. His job was to make her scrutable. He smiled. \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to see it for? It\u2019s all padlocked shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring the key. Where did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the couch in the porch,\u201d she replied. \u201cWere you comfortable? I didn\u2019t think so. You were in all your clothes. But I couldn\u2019t wake you up for anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you try?\u201d asked Alexander in a measured tone.</p> <p>\u201cI had to practically shoot your pistol in the air to get you to climb up onto the stove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, don\u2019t shoot it up in the air,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThe bullet has to come down.\u201d Remembering her lips on his face, he added, \u201cYou removed my socks and my belt.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou should have gone the extra step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t lift you,\u201d Tatiana said, blushing. \u201cHow are you feeling this morning? After all that vodka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, surreptitiously looking him over. \u201cDo you have any clothes to wear besides your uniforms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wash your Class-As for you today,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re planning to stay for a little while, I have some regular clothes for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stay for a little while?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Tatiana replied, her voice measured. \u201cYou came all this way. No point in going back so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Alexander said, walking close to her, knocking into her gently, \u201cnow that I\u2019m lucid again, tell me about Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t. I will, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, do you know that I saw him two weeks ago, and he didn\u2019t tell me he saw you in Kobona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I asked him if he saw you or Dasha, and he said, no, he had not.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Tatiana gazed straight ahead and faintly said, \u201cOh, he saw me and Dasha, all right.\u201d</p><p>Some of the milk spilled to the ground.</p><p>As they walked, Alexander told her about Leningrad, about Hitler and his losses. He told her about the vegetables growing all over the city. \u201cTania,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019ve planted cabbage and potatoes right in front of St. Isaac\u2019s.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd yellow tulips. What do you think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s great,\u201d she said in a tone that conveyed no connection to St. Isaac\u2019s whatsoever. Inscrutable.</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t want her to feel sad this morning. Were there just too many things for them to get past before he could get a morning smile out of her?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the ration up to now?\u201d Tatiana asked, her eyes to the ground.</p><p>\u201cThree hundred grams for dependents. Six hundred for workers. But soon there might be white bread. The council promised white bread this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly easier to feed one million people than it is to feed three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFewer than a million now. They\u2019re being evacuated by barges across the lake.\u201d He changed the subject. \u201cI see you have plenty of bread here in Lazarevo.\u201d Alexander eyed her. \u201cPlenty of everything here in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody been buried?\u201d</p><p>He sighed imperceptibly. \u201cI supervised the excavation of graves at Piskarev Cemetery myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcavation?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t miss a thing. \u201cWe used military mines to dynamite\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMass graves?\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cTania . . . come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, let\u2019s not talk about it. Oh, look, we\u2019re home.\u201d She rushed ahead.</p><p>Disappointed they were already home, Alexander caught up with her. \u201cCan you show me those clothes? I\u2019d like to put something else on.\u201d</p><p>Inside the house she pulled out her trunk from near the stove and was about to open it when Dusia\u2019s voice sounded from one of the bedrooms. \u201cTanechka? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>Naira came out and said, \u201cGood morning, dear. I didn\u2019t smell the coffee this morning. I woke up, sweetheart, because I didn\u2019t smell the coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it now, Naira Mikhailovna.\u201d</p><p>Raisa came out of her bedroom and said, \u201cWhen you have a minute, dear, could you help me to the outhouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tatiana started to close the trunk. \u201cI\u2019ll show you later,\u201d she whispered to Alexander.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tatiana,\u201d Alexander said impatiently. \u201cYou will show me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, I can\u2019t now,\u201d she said, pushing the trunk back against the wall. \u201cRaisa has a hard time going to the bathroom by herself. You see how she shakes. But you can sit for five minutes, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>What, he hadn\u2019t been patient enough? \u201cI can sit for longer than that,\u201d he said. \u201cI sat all night yesterday with you and your new friends.\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lip.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAll right, all right. Do you have a mortar and pestle?\u201d Alexander couldn\u2019t help himself; his spirits were too high, and he was too crazed by her to remain exasperated for long. Trying to keep the double meaning out of his voice, he asked, \u201cWould you like me to grind your coffee beans for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Tatiana replied. She was not playing. \u201cThat will be a big help. I\u2019ll get you the cheesecloth, too.\u201d She paused. \u201cCould you fire up the stove, please? So I can make breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Tania.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana took Raisa to the outhouse and then gave her her medicine.</p><p>She dressed Dusia.</p><p>She made all the beds, and then she fried some eggs with potatoes. Alexander watched it all. As he was sitting on the bench outside and smoking, Tatiana came up to him with a cup of coffee in her hands, and asked, \u201cHow do you like it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes twinkling, Alexander looked up at her standing in front of him, so lavender fresh and young and alive. \u201cHow do I like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like my coffee,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cwith thick, warm cream and lots of sugar.\u201d He paused. \u201cGet the cream right from the pail, Tatiasha, right off the top. But warm. And lots of it.\u201d</p><p>The cup in her hands started to shake.</p><p>Scrutable.</p><p>It was all Alexander could do not to laugh out loud, not to grab her, not to pull her to him.</p><p>After breakfast he helped her clear the table and wash the dishes. Her hands were immersed in a pan of sudsy water when Alexander, having watched her for a while, put his own hands in and felt for hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said innocently. \u201cI\u2019m helping you with the dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not a very good helper, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Tatiana said, but she did not take her hands away, and as Alexander watched her face, he finally saw something dissolving against her wall of pain. He rubbed intently between her fingers, getting fixated and inflamed by the fine blonde down on her forearms and by her blonde eyebrows. \u201cI think the dishes are going to be very clean,\u201d he said, glancing at the four women, who were sitting in the morning sunshine and chatting within a few meters of them. In the warm, soapy water, Alexander stroked Tatiana\u2019s fingers one by one, from the first knuckle down to the fingertip, and with his thumbs circled the palms of her slippery hands, while Tatiana stood, barely breathing through her parted lips, her eyes glazed over.</p><p>The fire raged in Alexander\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cTatia,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cyour freckles are so pronounced. And,\u201d he added, \u201cvery enti\u2014\u201d</p><p>Axinya came up to Tania, pinching her bottom. \u201cOur Tanechka is freckled as if she\u2019s been kissed by the sun.\u201d Damn it. Alexander couldn\u2019t even whisper to her without them overhearing. But when Axinya turned her back, Alexander leaned forward and softly kissed Tatiana\u2019s freckles. He let her pull her fingers away from him and walk off, wet hands and all. Without drying his own hands, he followed her. \u201cIs now a good time for you to show me those clothes?\u201d</p><p>Going inside and opening her trunk, Tatiana pulled out a large white cotton button-down shirt with short sleeves, a knitted cotton shirt, a cream linen shirt, and three pairs of drawstring trousers made out of bleached linen. She also had a couple of sleeveless tops for him, and some drawstring cotton shorts. \u201cTo go swimming in,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are great.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made them?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMama taught me how to sew. It wasn\u2019t hard. What was hard was trying to remember how big you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you remembered quite well,\u201d Alexander said slowly. \u201cTania, you . . . made clothes for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know for sure you were coming, but if you were, I wanted you to have something comfortable to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinen is expensive,\u201d he said, very pleased.</p><p>\u201cThere was a lot of money in your Pushkin book.\u201d She paused. \u201cI bought a few things for everybody.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Less pleased. \u201cIncluding Vova?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana guiltily glanced away.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Alexander said, dropping the clothes into the trunk. \u201cYou bought Vova things with my money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some vodka, and cig\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d Alexander took a deep breath. \u201cNot here. Let me change,\u201d he said, turning away from her. \u201cI\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>She went outside while he changed into the trousers and the white cotton shirt that was slightly tight around his chest but otherwise fit fine.</p><p>When Alexander stepped down from the house, the old women clucked at how nice he looked. Tatiana was gathering clothes into a basket. \u201cI should have made it a little bigger. You do look nice.\u201d She swallowed and lowered her eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you often in civilian clothes.\u201d</p><p>Alexander looked around. Here it was, his second day with her, and they were still clucking around four old women, and he was still unable to get to whatever was bothering her, to all the things that were bothering him, much less to her ample blondeness. That was it. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen me in civilian clothes once,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Peterhof. Perhaps you\u2019ve forgotten Peterhof.\u201d He extended his hand. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stepped up to him but did not take his hand. He had to reach down and take hold of her hand himself. Being so close to her made him a little light-headed. \u201cI want you to show me where the river is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where the river is,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou went there yesterday.\u201d She took her hand out from his. \u201cShura, I really can\u2019t. I\u2019ve got to hang yesterday\u2019s laundry and then wash today\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her with him. \u201cNo. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, no, please!\u201d</p><p>Alexander stopped. What the hell was that in her voice? What did that sound like? That wasn\u2019t anger. Was that . . . fear? He peered into her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he said. She was flustered, and her hands were shaky. She couldn\u2019t look at him. Letting go of her hand, he took hold of her face, lifting it to him. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, please,\u201d Tatiana whispered, trying to look away from his eyes, and then Alexander saw, and he knew.</p><p>Letting go of her, he backed away and smiled. \u201cTania,\u201d he said, in a soothing voice, \u201cI want you to show me your grandparents\u2019 house. I want you to show me the river. A field, a f*cking rock, I don\u2019t give a shit. I want you to take me to two square meters of space where there is no one around us, so we can talk. Do you understand? That\u2019s all. We need to talk, and I\u2019m not talking \u2014 I\u2019m not doing anything \u2014 in front of your new friends.\u201d He paused, keeping the smile away. \u201cAll right?\u201d</p><p>Deeply flushed, she did not raise her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He pulled her by the hand.</p><p>Naira said, \u201cTanechka, where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to pick some blueberries for tonight\u2019s pie,\u201d Tatiana yelled back.</p><p>\u201cBut, Tanechka, what about the clothes?\u201d</p><p>Raisa yelled, \u201cWill you be back at noon to give me my medicine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will we be back, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re fixed, Tatiana,\u201d he said. \u201cTell her that. When Alexander fixes me, then I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think even you can fix me, Alexander,\u201d said Tatiana, and her voice was cold.</p><p>He was walking with all deliberate speed away from the house.</p><p>\u201cWait, I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one more . . .\u201d She tried to pull her hand away. He wasn\u2019t having any of it. She tried again.</p><p>Alexander wasn\u2019t letting go. \u201cTania, you can\u2019t win this,\u201d he said, staring at her and squeezing her hand harder. \u201cYou can win a lot of things, but you can\u2019t win a physical struggle with me. Thank God. Because then I\u2019d really be in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Naira yelled after them, \u201cTania, but Vova is coming for you soon! When shall I tell him you\u2019ll be back?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana looked at Alexander, who stared back coldly, shrugged indifferently, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s me or the laundry. You\u2019re going to have to decide. I know the choice is tough. Or it\u2019s me or Vova.\u201d He let her hand drop. \u201cIs that choice tough, too?\u201d He\u2019d just about had enough. They had stopped walking and were standing facing each other, a meter apart. Alexander folded his arms across his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be, Tania? The choice is yours.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana yelled back to Naira, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a while! Tell him I\u2019ll see him later!\u201d Sighing, she motioned for Alexander to come.</p><p>He was walking too quickly, and she couldn\u2019t keep up.</p><p>\u201cWhy so fast?\u201d</p><p>Temper was flaring up in Alexander, like the sizzle of an antipersonnel grenade before it exploded. He breathed in and out deeply to calm himself, to shove the pin back up the hole. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want trouble, you will have to tell Vova to leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t reply, Alexander stopped walking and pulled her to him. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d he said, raising his voice. \u201cOr perhaps you\u2019d like to tell me to leave you alone? Because you can do that right now, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>Not raising her eyes and not trying to get away from him, Tatiana said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Vova. Don\u2019t be upset. You know perfectly well I just don\u2019t want to hurt his feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander said pointedly, \u201cnobody\u2019s but mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana said, and this time she looked up at him with sullen reproach. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt yours most of all.\u201d</p><p>He was not letting go of her. \u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d He squeezed her arm. \u201cOne way or another, he will have to leave you alone \u2014 permanently\u2014\u201d Alexander said, \u201cif we\u2019re to fix what\u2019s wrong between us.\u201d</p><p>Weakly prying his fingers off her, Tatiana said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you worry about him . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, if I\u2019ve got nothing to worry about, then show me. But I\u2019m not playing these games anymore. Not here. Not in Lazarevo. I will not do it here for strangers, do you understand? I will not be guarding Vova\u2019s feelings the way I guarded Dasha\u2019s. Either you tell him, which would be best, or I tell him, which would be worst.\u201d</p><p>When Tatiana, biting her lip shut, didn\u2019t say anything, Alexander continued. \u201cI don\u2019t want to grapple with him. And I don\u2019t want to have to pretend to Zoe as she brushes her tits against me. I won\u2019t do it just to keep peace in this house.\u201d</p><p>That made Tatiana look up. \u201cZoe does what?\u201d Shaking her head, she muttered, \u201cVova doesn\u2019t go around brushing anything against me.\u201d</p><p>Standing very close against her, Alexander said, \u201cNo?\u201d He paused. His breath quickened. Tatiana\u2019s breath quickened. And very lightly Alexander brushed against Tatiana. \u201cYou will tell him to leave you alone, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d she said faintly. He let go of her, and they resumed walking.</p><p>\u201cBut frankly,\u201d she continued, even more faintly, \u201cI think Vova is the least of our problems.\u201d</p><p>Alexander walked faster down the village road. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to see my grandparents\u2019 house.\u201d</p><p>Alexander let out his breath and laughed without much humor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d Tatiana did not sound amused herself.</p><p>Neither was Alexander. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t, after what I had seen at Fifth Soviet, but somehow you managed to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Tatiana said, no longer faintly.</p><p>\u201cExplain to me how,\u201d he snapped. \u201cHow did you manage to find and surround yourself with people even more needy than your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about my family that way, all right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does everyone flock around you, why? Can you explain it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you submerge yourself in their life this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not discussing this with you. You\u2019re just being mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you even have a moment to yourself in that f*cking house?\u201d Alexander exclaimed. \u201cA moment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a moment!\u201d Tatiana retorted. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>They walked in resentful silence the rest of the way, through the village, past the banya and the village Soviet, past the tiny hut that said \u201cLibrary\u201d and a small building with a gold cross on top of a white kupola.</p><p>They walked into the woods and down the path leading to the Kama. Finally they came to a wide, slightly sloping clearing surrounded by tall pines and clusters of leaning white birches. Willows and poplars framed the sparkling, streaming river.</p><p>On the left side of the clearing under the pines stood a boarded-up izba, a wooden cabin. It had a small covering on the side that served as a woodshed, but there was no wood.</p><p>\u201cThis is it?\u201d Alexander said, walking around the cabin in thirty long strides. \u201cIt\u2019s not very big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were only two of them,\u201d said Tatiana, walking around with him in fifty short ones.</p><p>\u201cBut they were waiting for three grandchildren. Where would you all have fit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would have fit,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cHow do we fit in Naira\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtremely tightly,\u201d declared Alexander, reaching into his rucksack. He pulled out his trench tool and started to break off the boards on the windows.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see what\u2019s inside.\u201d</p><p>Alexander watched her walk to the sandy riverbank, sit down, and take off her sandals. He lit a cigarette and continued to break off the boards.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring a key for the padlock?\u201d he called to her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear her response. Fed up, he strode over and said loudly, \u201cTatiana, I\u2019m speaking to you. Did you bring the key for the padlock, I asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I replied to you,\u201d she snapped without glancing up. \u201cI said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said, getting out his semiautomatic from his belt and pulling back the breechblock. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t bring the key, I will shoot the f*cking padlock off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d she said, tutting and taking a rope from her neck on which the key hung. \u201cHere. Don\u2019t snatch!\u201d She turned away. \u201cYou\u2019re not at war, you know. You don\u2019t have to bring that gun everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I do.\u201d He started to walk away and glanced back \u2014 at her blonde hair, at her back exposed at the waist, at her shoulders. Alexander dropped the padlock key into his trouser pocket and, holding his pistol in one hand and his trench tool in the other, strode into the water, still in his boots, stood in front of her with his feet apart, and said in a determined voice, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave what?\u201d Still sitting down, she backed away from him slightly on her haunches.</p><p>\u201cHave what?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhy are you upset? What did I do, or not do? What did I do too much of, or not enough of? Tell me. Tell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you talking to me like that?\u201d Tatiana said, jumping to her feet. \u201cYou have no right in the world to be upset with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right in the world to be upset with me!\u201d he said loudly. \u201cTania, we are wasting our precious breath. And you\u2019re wrong \u2014 I have plenty of right to be upset with you. But unlike you, I\u2019m too grateful you\u2019re alive and too happy to see you to be too upset with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have more reason to be upset with you.\u201d Tatiana paused. \u201cAnd I am grateful you are alive.\u201d She couldn\u2019t look at him when she spoke. \u201cI am happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to tell, your wall against me is so thick.\u201d When she didn\u2019t reply, Alexander said, \u201cDo you understand that I came all the way to Lazarevo without hearing from you once in six months?\u201d He raised his voice. \u201cNot once in six months! I should have just thought you both were dead, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you thought, Alexander,\u201d said Tatiana, looking past him at the river.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you what I thought, Tatiana. In case it\u2019s not clear. For six months I didn\u2019t know if you were alive or dead, because you couldn\u2019t be bothered to pick up a f*cking pen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you wanted me to write to you,\u201d Tatiana said, grabbing a couple of pebbles and tossing them past him into the water.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d he repeated. Was she mocking him? \u201cWhat are you talking about? Hello, Tatiana. I\u2019m Alexander. Have we met before? You didn\u2019t know I would have wanted to hear that you were all right, or perhaps that Dasha had died?\u201d</p><p>He saw her recoil from his words, and from him.</p><p>\u201cI am not talking about Dasha with you!\u201d She walked away.</p><p>He followed her. \u201cIf not with me, then with who? With Vova, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter with him than with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s charming.\u201d Alexander was still trying to be rational, but if she kept saying things like that, all reason was going to leave him.</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t write to you because I thought Dimitri would tell you. He said he definitely would. So I thought for sure you knew.\u201d Something unspoken remained in her after that, but Alexander\u2019s temper didn\u2019t let him get to it.</p><p>\u201cYou thought Dimitri would tell me?\u201d Alexander repeated in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she said challengingly.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just write me yourself?\u201d he yelled, coming close and looming over her. \u201cFour thousand rubles, Tatiana, you\u2019d think I\u2019d deserve a f*cking letter from you, no? You\u2019d think my four thousand rubles would buy you a pen to write me and not just vodka and cigarettes for your village lover!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your weapons down!\u201d she yelled back. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare come near me with those things in your hands!\u201d</p><p>Hurling away his gun and his trench tool, he came for her, making her back away, and came for her again, without touching her, making her back away once more. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Tania?\u201d he said. \u201cAm I crowding you? Getting too close?\u201d He paused, leaning into her face. \u201cScaring you?\u201d he added bitingly.</p><p>\u201cYes and yes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yes.\u201d</p><p>Alexander picked up a handful of pebbles and threw them hard into the water.</p><p>For a minute, maybe two, maybe three, neither of them spoke, getting their breath. He waited for her to say something, and when she didn\u2019t, Alexander tried again to lure her back into what they felt when it was just the two of them, at Kirov, at Luga, at St. Isaac\u2019s. \u201cTania, when you first saw me here . . .\u201d He trailed off. \u201cYou were so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave my happiness away?\u201d she asked. \u201cWas it my sobbing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought you were crying from happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen much of that, Alexander?\u201d Tatiana asked, and for a second, just for a moment, he wondered if there was a double meaning behind her words, but he was too confounded to think carefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have to play these guessing games?\u201d he said in exasperation. \u201cCan\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d When she didn\u2019t say anything, Alexander sighed. \u201cAll I asked was where Dasha was.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana almost curled into herself.</p><p>\u201cTania, if you\u2019re unhappy because I\u2019m making you remember things you want to forget then we will deal with that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d he said loudly, raising his hand. \u201cI said if that\u2019s what it is. But if it\u2019s something else\u2014\u201d He stopped. Her face looked so upset. Lowering his voice back to calm, opening his hands to her, looking at her with everything he felt for her, Alexander said, \u201cListen. How about this? I will forgive you for not writing me, if you will forgive me for one thing that\u2019s bothering you.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIs there only one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, there are so many things that are bothering me, I don\u2019t even know where to begin.\u201d</p><p>He saw that she really didn\u2019t. And through it all, the hurt remained in her eyes.</p><p>It was Tatiana\u2019s eyes that Alexander reacted to now: they were the same eyes he had seen on the Fifth Soviet pavement when she yelled to him that she could forgive him for his indifferent face but not for his indifferent heart. Weren\u2019t they past that? He wore his heart for her as a medal on his chest; weren\u2019t they beyond all the lies?</p><p>How much was there beyond that Fifth Soviet pavement?</p><p>Alexander realized, only death was beyond that. They had never fixed that fight. And all the things that preceded it. And all the things that surpassed it.</p><p>And through all those things ran Dasha, whom Tatiana had tried to save and could not. Whom Alexander had tried to save and could not.</p><p>\u201cTania, is all this because Dasha and I were planning to get married?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>Aha.</p><p>\u201cIs all this because of the letter that I wrote to Dasha?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>Aha.</p><p>\u201cIs there more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d Tatiana said, shaking her head, \u201chow petty you manage to make it all sound. How trivial. All my feelings have now been reduced to your contemptuous \u2018all this.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not contemptuous,\u201d he said, with surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s not trivial. It\u2019s not petty, but it\u2019s all in the past\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s all right here, right now, all around me and inside, too! I live here now. And here,\u201d she said raising her voice even more, \u201cthey have been waiting for you to come to marry my sister! And I don\u2019t mean just the old women. I mean everybody in the village. Since I came to live here, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve heard, and not just every day but every dinner, every lunch, every sewing circle. Dasha and Alexander. Dasha and Alexander. Poor Dasha, poor Alexander.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cDoes that seem like the past to you?\u201d</p><p>Alexander tried to reason with her. \u201cHow is that my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did they perhaps ask Dasha to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I didn\u2019t ask her to marry me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play this game with me, Alexander, don\u2019t toy with me! You told her you would be married this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I did this why?\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>\u201cOh, just stop it! At St. Isaac\u2019s we agreed to keep away from each other. Except you couldn\u2019t keep away from me, so you made plans to marry my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left you alone after that, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Alexander declared grimly.</p><p>\u201cHe would have left me alone if you\u2019d never come to the apartment again, too!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cWhich would you have preferred?\u201d</p><p>She stopped moving for a moment. \u201cAre you really asking me,\u201d she said, panting, \u201cwhat I would have preferred?\u201d Her eyes were wide. \u201cAre you in all honesty asking me if I would have preferred your marrying my sister to not seeing you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! At St. Isaac\u2019s you were ready to beg me not to stay away from you. So don\u2019t give me this shit. It\u2019s only easy to say now, in retrospect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is that what this is \u2014 easy?\u201d Tatiana was walking around the clearing in such furious circles she was almost spinning. With his long strides Alexander kept up with her, but she was making him dizzy.</p><p>\u201cStop moving!\u201d he shouted. She stopped. \u201cI see, so you set the rules and then you don\u2019t like that I play by them. Well, live with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am living with it,\u201d Tatiana retorted. \u201cEvery single damned day since the day I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is the fight you want?\u201d Alexander yelled. \u201cThis fight? You won\u2019t win this one, because this one goes right back to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Breathing hard, Tatiana said, \u201cYou told Dasha you would get married, she told my grandmother, my grandmother told the village. You wrote her a letter saying you were coming to marry her. Words have meaning, you know.\u201d Tatiana fell briefly quiet. \u201cEven words you don\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>Why did he think she wasn\u2019t talking about Dasha now?</p><p>\u201cIf you felt so strongly about this,\u201d he said, \u201cthen why didn\u2019t you write me a letter back, saying, \u2018You know what, Alexander, Dasha didn\u2019t make it, but I\u2019m right here.\u2019 \u201d I would have come sooner. And I wouldn\u2019t have lived the six months I lived not knowing if you had survived!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the letter you wrote her,\u201d Tatiana said incredulously, \u201cyou think I\u2019d be writing you and asking you to come here? You think after that letter I\u2019d be asking you for anything? I\u2019d be an idiot to do that, wouldn\u2019t I? An idiot, or\u2014\u201d She stopped.</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cOr a child,\u201d she said, not looking at him.</p><p>Alexander took a deep breath. \u201cOh, Tania\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese games you grown-ups play,\u201d she said, backing away from him. \u201cThese lies \u2014 you\u2019re just too good at them.\u201d She lowered her head. \u201cToo good for me.\u201d</p><p>All Alexander wanted that instant was to touch her. Her lips, her anger, her face \u2014 he wanted to touch it all. \u201cTania . . .\u201d he whispered, holding out his hands to her. \u201cWhat are you talking about? What games, what lies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here, why?\u201d she said coldly.</p><p>He felt himself about to choke on his words. \u201cHow can you even ask me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? Because the last thing you wrote was that you were coming to marry Dasha. How much you loved her. How she was the woman for you. The only woman for you. I read that letter. That\u2019s what you wrote. Because one of the last things I heard you say on Lake Ladoga was that you never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d Alexander screamed, the pin falling to the ground. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? Did you forget you made me promise to lie till the last? You made me promise. As late as November I was still saying, let\u2019s tell the truth. But you! Lie, lie, lie, Shura, marry her, but promise me you won\u2019t break my sister\u2019s heart. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you did commendably well,\u201d Tatiana said acidly. \u201cBut did you have to be so convincing?\u201d</p><p>Running his hand through his hair, Alexander shook his head. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d she said loudly, stepping up close and looking up at him, angry and unafraid. \u201cThe marrying Dasha part? The loving her part? Which part of all those lies do I know you didn\u2019t mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhat answer did you want me to give her as she lay dying in your arms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only answer you could give her,\u201d she replied. \u201cThe only answer you meant to give, living your life of lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both live that life of lies, Tatiana \u2014 because of you!\u201d he yelled, wanting to tear her hair out. \u201cBut you know I didn\u2019t mean what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI hoped you didn\u2019t mean it. But can you understand that it was the only thing I heard all the way on the train to Molotov and all the way across the Volga ice and for two months in the hospital as I struggled for my breath, can you understand that?\u201d</p><p>She struggled for her breath now as Alexander stood and watched her, feeling unbearable remorse.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have cared,\u201d Tatiana continued. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t need much, I don\u2019t need much comfort.\u201d She clenched her fists again. And the hurt was in her eyes. \u201cBut I do need a little bit,\u201d she said, her voice unsteady. \u201cI need a little bit for me, and then you could have said what you needed to say to Dasha, as you absolutely had to!\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI wanted your eyes on me for a second to let me know that I wasn\u2019t nothing, so I could have a little faith. But no,\u201d she said. \u201cYou treated me like you always do \u2014 as if I weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t treat you as if you aren\u2019t there,\u201d Alexander said, paling with confusion. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I hide you from everyone. That\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s a fine difference for a girl like me,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cBut if you can hide your heart so well even from my eyes, then maybe you can hide your heart for Dasha, too \u2014 the same way. And maybe for Marina and for Zoe, and for every girl you\u2019ve ever been with. Maybe that\u2019s what you grown men do \u2014 in private look at us one way and then blatantly deny us in public, as if we mean absolutely nothing.\u201d She stared at the ground.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d asked Alexander. \u201cAre you forgetting that the only one who did not see the truth was your blinded sister? Private, public, Marina saw it in five minutes.\u201d He paused. \u201cOn second thought, the only two people who seem not to have seen the truth are your sister and you, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat truth?\u201d She stood a stride away from him, and her fists were shaking. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d she said. \u201cLied so well. But you are a man. You did. You denied me in your last words, and you denied me in your last glance. And for a while it almost seemed right. How could you feel for me? I thought. Who could feel for anything after that Leningrad . . .\u201d Tatiana paused, panting hard. \u201cBut still I wanted to believe in you so much! So when we got your letter to Dasha, I ripped it open, hoping I was wrong, praying that maybe there was a word in it for me\u2014\u201d Tatiana raised her voice. \u201cA single word, a single syllable that I could keep for my own, needing it so desperately, to show me that my entire life had not been a complete lie!\u201d She broke off. \u201cA single word!\u201d she yelled, hitting Alexander with both fists in the chest. \u201cJust one word, Alexander!\u201d</p><p>He tried to remember what he had written. He could not. But it was her hurting eyes he wanted to heal most of all. He took her into his arms, fighting with him, clutching him, and then crying. \u201cTania, please. You knew I was in agony\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she was so upset and volatile that she wrested herself out of his arms and cried, \u201cI knew this? How did I know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are supposed to just know,\u201d Alexander said, coming toward her. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s the point of you?\u201d she yelled, backing away.</p><p>\u201cThe point of me,\u201d he yelled back, \u201cis that I stood with my arms around you and my whole heart in my eyes in the back of that f*cking Ladoga truck and pleaded with you to save yourself for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you don\u2019t ask every girl you send across the Road of Life to save herself for you with those eyes of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>In a broken voice she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything other than you. Not how to act, or how to play games, or how to lie, or anything.\u201d She lowered her head. \u201cYou show me one thing in private, and then suddenly you plan to marry my sister. On Ladoga you tell her you never felt for me, you tell her you love only her, you don\u2019t look at me as you leave me to face death, and then you don\u2019t send a word my way. How in the world do you expect someone like me to know what the truth is without a little help from you? All I\u2019ve ever known in my life is your damn lies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d he cried. \u201cHave you forgotten St. Isaac\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many other girls went to visit you there, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten Luga?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just a damsel in distress,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cDimitri himself told me how much you liked to help us girls out.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was about to lose control completely. \u201cWhat did you think I was doing coming to Fifth Soviet every chance I got, bringing you all my food?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWho did you think I was doing that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you didn\u2019t feel pity for me, Alexander!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cFor f*ck\u2019s sake, pity?\u201d</p><p>Folding her arms across her chest, Tatiana said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d he said, nearly right up against her. \u201cPity is too good for you. That\u2019s the price you pay for living your life as a lie. Don\u2019t like it much, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I hate it,\u201d Tatiana said, looking up and not backing away one centimeter. \u201cAnd knowing that I hate it, why in the hell did you come here? Just to torture me further?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came because I didn\u2019t know Dasha had died!\u201d he yelled. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be bothered to f*cking write me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did come to marry Dasha,\u201d Tatiana said in a calm voice. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just say so?\u201d</p><p>Growling helplessly, Alexander clenched his fists and stepped quickly away from her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t keep all the lies straight in your head, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana, you are completely out of line,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you from the first day we met, let\u2019s come clean, let\u2019s not live this life. Let\u2019s choose a different one. I told you that from the start. Let\u2019s tell them the truth and live with the consequences. You were the one who said no. I didn\u2019t like it. But I said fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You did not say fine, Alexander! Had you said fine, you would not have been coming to Kirov every single day against my wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgainst your wishes?\u201d he said, staggering back.</p><p>Tatiana shook her head at him. \u201cYou are unbelievable. What, whose head do you think you won\u2019t sway, Alexander Barrington, with your rifle and your height and your life? You think that just because I, a seventeen-year-old child, opened my mouth and my eyes and gaped at you as if I\u2019d never seen anything quite like it, you had the right to ask my sister to marry you? You think because I\u2019m so young that wouldn\u2019t break me? You think I need nothing from you, while you just take and take and take from me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you need nothing from me, and I have not taken and taken and taken from you,\u201d Alexander said through his own clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve taken everything but that!\u201d she screamed. \u201cAnd that you don\u2019t deserve!\u201d</p><p>He came up close to her and hissed, \u201cI could have taken that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said, furiously shoving him away. \u201cBecause you haven\u2019t broken me enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop shoving me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop menacing me! Stay away from me!\u201d</p><p>He stood back. \u201cNone of this would be happening if you had listened to me from the beginning. None of it! Let\u2019s tell them, I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you,\u201d Tatiana said vehemently, \u201cthat my sister was more important to me than some need of yours I couldn\u2019t comprehend. She was more important to me than some need of my own I couldn\u2019t understand either. All I wanted was for you to respect my wishes. But you! Oh, you kept coming at me and coming at me and coming at me, and little by little you tore me apart, and when it wasn\u2019t enough, you came for me in the hospital and tore me apart some more, and when that wasn\u2019t enough, you got me up on the roof of St. Isaac\u2019s with you to finish me off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not finished you off,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTo finish off my heart for good,\u201d continued Tatiana with clenched everything. \u201cAnd you knew it. And when you had it all, and had me, and knew it, that\u2019s when you showed me how much I really meant to you by planning to marry my sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d Alexander shouted. \u201cWhat do you think happens when you can\u2019t be f*cking bothered to fight from the start for what you want? What do you think happens when you give the people you want away? That\u2019s what happens! They go on with their lives, they get married, they have children. You wanted to live that lie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I wanted to live that lie! I was living the only truth I knew. I had a family I did not want to sacrifice for you! That\u2019s what I fought for.\u201d</p><p>Unsteady on his feet, Alexander could not believe the words that were coming out of her. \u201cThat was your only truth, Tatiana?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and lowered her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou came for me, and I did not push you away far enough. How could I? I was\u2014\u201d She broke off. \u201cI was in this with my eyes open, and my eyes were only for you. I hoped you were smarter, but I saw you were not smarter by much, and so I continued with you, knowing that I would stand by you and believe in you. I would give you anything and everything you needed, wanting so little back for myself.\u201d She couldn\u2019t look at him bravely anymore. \u201cGive me a glance at the end of your proclamation of love to someone else,\u201d Tatiana said, \u201cand that would have been enough for me. Give me one word in your letter of love for someone else, and that would have been enough for me. But you didn\u2019t feel enough for me to know I might need even so little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d he screamed into her face. \u201cI will stand here and be accused of anything, but don\u2019t you dare tell me I didn\u2019t feel enough for you! Don\u2019t even pretend to yourself you can speak that lie and have it come out of your mouth as the truth. Everything I have f*cking done with my life since the day I met you was because of how I felt about you, so if you continue to give me your bullshit now, I swear to God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said faintly, but it was too late then.</p><p>Alexander grabbed her and shook her. Tatiana felt so vulnerable, so soft in his arms. Utterly defeated by his anger and his remorse and his desire, he pushed her hard away, cursed, picked up his things off the ground, and ran up the hill and through the path. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>6</p><p>Tatiana ran after him, yelling, \u201cShura, please stop! Please!\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t catch up. He disappeared through the woods. She ran all the way home. His things were still there, but he was not.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Tanechka?\u201d Naira asked, carrying a basket of tomatoes.</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Tatiana replied, panting. She took the basket from Naira.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill at the old house,\u201d she said. \u201cTaking the boards off the windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he nails them back,\u201d Dusia said, looking up from the Bible, \u201cwhen he is done. What\u2019s he doing that for anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Tatiana said, turning away so they wouldn\u2019t see her face. \u201cDo you need your medicine, Raisa?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana gave Raisa her medicine for the shakes, medicine that didn\u2019t help at all, and then she folded the sheets she had washed yesterday, and then \u2014 so afraid he was going to come, take his things, and leave \u2014 she hid his tent and rifle in the shed behind the house, and then she went down to the river and washed all his uniforms by hand on the washboard.</p><p>Alexander still had not come back.</p><p>Tatiana took his helmet into the woods and picked a whole helmetful of blueberries. Returning home, she made a blueberry pie and blueberry comp?te, a thick fruit drink.</p><p>Alexander still hadn\u2019t come back.</p><p>Tatiana went and caught some fish and made ukha, fish soup, for dinner. He once said he really liked ukha.</p> <p>Alexander still hadn\u2019t come back.</p><p>Tatiana peeled some potatoes, grated them, and made potato pancakes.</p><p>Vova came and asked if she wanted to go swimming. She said no and got out some ribbed cotton material and made Alexander a new, larger sleeveless top.</p><p>And still he hadn\u2019t come back.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he just have stayed and finished their fight? She wasn\u2019t going anywhere; she was staying until the end, why couldn\u2019t he? The pit of her stomach was so empty and scared. Well, she wasn\u2019t going to let him go until they finished it. She didn\u2019t care how he lost his temper.</p><p>Now it was six o\u2019clock and time to go to the banya. She left him a note. Dearest Shura, If you\u2019re hungry, please eat the soup and the pancakes. We\u2019re at the bathhouse. Or you could wait for us and we will eat together. On your bed is a new top for you. I hope it fits better. Tania.</p><p>In the bathhouse she scrubbed herself for him until she was glistening pink.</p><p>Zoe asked her if Alexander was going to join them by the fire this evening.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him.\u201d</p><p>Zoe said, flinging her great big breasts, \u201cHe is quite delicious. Do you think he is feeling awful over Dasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Zoe smiled. \u201cMaybe he needs a little comfort.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana looked Zoe straight in the face. As if Zoe had any idea about what comfort Alexander needed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d she said coolly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t. Never mind.\u201d Zoe laughed and went to get changed.</p><p>Tatiana dried off and dressed, brushing her wet hair and leaving it down past her shoulders. She put on a blue print cotton dress she had made; it was thin and sleeveless with a half-open back and a short hemline. When they all came out of the bathhouse, Alexander was waiting for them outside. Tatiana locked her relieved eyes on him for a moment and then, unable to take his expression, looked away.</p><p>\u201cThere he is!\u201d Naira said. \u201cWhere have you been all day?\u201d</p><p>Dusia asked, \u201cHow are the windows in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWindows? What house?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cVasili Metanov\u2019s house. Tania said you were taking the boards off the windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, never taking his darkened eyes off Tatiana. She stood next to Raisa, hoping to hide behind Raisa\u2019s shaking.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry? Have you eaten?\u201d Tatiana asked him in her smallest voice. She couldn\u2019t find a bigger one.</p><p>Mutely he shook his head.</p><p>They all started walking home. Axinya took Alexander\u2019s arm. Zoe came up close on the other side of him, took his other arm and asked if Alexander wanted to go to the fire.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied, pulling away from Zoe and toward Tatiana, bending down to her and whispering, \u201cWhat did you do with my things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHid them,\u201d she whispered back, her heart throbbing. She wanted to put her hand on him, but she was afraid he\u2019d lose his control, and they would have to have it out in front of everyone.</p><p>\u201cTania makes very good fish soup, Alexander,\u201d Naira said. \u201cYou like fish soup?\u201d</p><p>Dusia piped up, \u201cAnd her blueberry pie is out of this world. I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Alexander whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d Dusia asked.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Alexander said, moving away from them all.</p><p>When they got home, Tatiana busied herself with setting the table. She looked up on her bed to see if he had read the note and taken the shirt. The note was gone. The shirt remained where she had left it.</p><p>Alexander came inside. The four ladies were out on the porch. \u201cWhere are my things?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShura\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d he snapped. \u201cGive me my things so I can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, can you come here?\u201d Naira stuck her head in. \u201cWe need your help opening this bottle of vodka. The cap seems to be stuck.\u201d</p><p>He went out on the porch. Tatiana\u2019s hands were trembling as badly as Raisa\u2019s. She dropped one of the dishes. The metal plate made quite a clang when it hit the wooden floor.</p><p>Vova arrived. The porch was filled with laughing voices.</p><p>Alexander came inside and opened his mouth to speak. Tatiana motioned to the back of him. Vova stood in the doorway. \u201cTanyusha, do you need help? Can I carry something to the table for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Tanyusha,\u201d said Alexander bitingly, \u201ccan Vova carry something for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. Can you give me a minute, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d said Vova to Alexander, who hadn\u2019t moved. \u201cYou heard her. She wants a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Alexander, without turning around. \u201cA minute with me.\u201d</p><p>Vova reluctantly left the room.</p><p>\u201cWhere are my things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, why are you leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? There is no place for me here. You\u2019ve made that abundantly clear. I can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t packed for me, the way you feel. I don\u2019t need to be told twice, Tania.\u201d</p><p>Her lips were trembling. \u201cStay and have dinner with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Shura,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cI made you potato pancakes.\u201d She took a step to him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, blinking.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave. We haven\u2019t finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ve finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say to make it better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said it all very clearly. Now good-bye would be good.\u201d</p><p>The food table was between them. Tatiana came around on his side. \u201cShura,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cplease let me touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He backed farther away.</p><p>Naira stuck her head through the open door. \u201cIs dinner ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost, Naira Mikhailovna,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to leave until you fixed me?\u201d she said faintly. \u201cFix me, Shura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me yourself there isn\u2019t enough of me to fix what\u2019s wrong inside you. Well, you\u2019ve made a believer out of me. Now, where are my things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura\u2014\u201d</p><p>Coming closer to her, Alexander said through gritted teeth, \u201cWhat do you want, Tania? You want a scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, trying very hard not to cry.</p><p>His face was near her. \u201cA loud, ugly scene like the kind you\u2019re used to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cJust give me my things, and I\u2019ll go quietly, and you won\u2019t have to explain a single word to your friends and your lover.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t move, Alexander said, much louder, \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed and upset, Tatiana led him outside to the shed behind the house, out of everyone\u2019s view.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, Tanechka? Are we going to eat soo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back!\u201d Tatiana yelled, her shoulders shaking. When they were behind the house, Tatiana tried to take hold of Alexander\u2019s hand, but he roughly ripped his arm away from her. She staggered but did not back off. Coming in front of him quickly, she wrapped her arms around his waist. He tried to push her away. \u201cPlease don\u2019t go,\u201d she said, looking up at him with pleading eyes. \u201cPlease. I beg you. I don\u2019t want you to go. I waited for you every minute of every day since I left the hospital. Please.\u201d She put her forehead on his chest.</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t say anything. Tatiana didn\u2019t look up. His hands remained on her bare arms.</p><p>Holding him tightly, Tatiana said, \u201cGod, Alexander! How can you be so thick? Can\u2019t you see why I didn\u2019t write you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Why?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled his smell, her face still in his chest. \u201cI was so afraid that if I told you about Dasha, you wouldn\u2019t come to Lazarevo at all.\u201d She wished she were braver and could look at him, but she didn\u2019t want to see him be angry with her anymore. Taking his hand, she placed it on her cheek, and when his warmth gave her strength, she looked up at him. \u201cLeningrad nearly finished us all off. I thought that maybe if you didn\u2019t know about her and came anyway, and I got healthy again, like last summer, maybe your feeling for me would come back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back?\u201d Alexander said hoarsely. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d His hand remained on her cheek. His other hand, though, wrapped itself on her bare back, his fingers fanning her, grasping her, and moving on her flesh, pressing him to her. \u201cCan\u2019t you see . . .\u201d he said and broke off. He couldn\u2019t say any more. She felt it. And he didn\u2019t need to. She felt that, too.</p><p>At last Alexander spoke. \u201cTatia, I will earn your forgiveness. I will fix everything. I will do right by you, but you have to let me. You can\u2019t shut me out like this \u2014 you just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cPlease understand.\u201d She hugged him tighter. \u201cJust too many lies for me, too much doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her eyes to him.</p><p>His arms around her, Alexander said, \u201cTania, what doubt? I am here only for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen please stay,\u201d she said. \u201cStay for me.\u201d</p><p>Breathing hard, Alexander bent his head to her, and she gave him her wet hair to kiss. His lips stayed on her for a few moments, and then he said, \u201cWhat is this, Lake Ladoga?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d Tatiana said, \u201cthere is a houseful of people.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips were pressing into her bare shoulder blades so emphatically they were making her feeble.</p><p>\u201cLift your face to me this instant.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her face to him that instant.</p><p>\u201cTania, could we eat, please?\u201d Naira\u2019s loud voice from the porch was hungry and irritated. \u201cEverything is burning!\u201d</p><p>Alexander kissed her so fiercely that for a moment Tatiana became supported only by his arms around her. Her numb legs could not hold her up.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she doing out there? We\u2019re all starving. Tatiana!\u201d</p><p>They heaved themselves away from each other, Tatiana didn\u2019t know how, retrieved his things from the shed, and went inside.</p><p>Tatiana poured soup for Alexander first, placing the bowl right in front of him and handing him the spoon. Then she served everyone else while Alexander waited for her to sit down before he took his first bite.</p><p>\u201cSo, Alexander,\u201d said Vova, \u201cwhat does a captain in the Red Army do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what a captain in the Red Army does. I know what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, do you need some more fish?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d asked Vova.</p><p>\u201cYes, tell us, Alexander,\u201d said Axinya. \u201cThe village is dying to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in heavy weapons, in a destroyer brigade. Do you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>Everybody but Tatiana shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cI command an armored company of men. We provide extra support for the rifle guards.\u201d Alexander swallowed his soup. \u201cAt least, we\u2019re supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s extra support?\u201d asked Vova. \u201cTanks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanks, yes. Armored cars. Tania, are there more pancakes? We also operate antiaircraft machine guns called Zeniths, and mortars, and other field artillery. Cannons, howitzers, heavy machine guns. I myself stand behind a Katyusha, a rocket launcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d said Vova. \u201cSo it\u2019s the best job. Less dangerous than the rifle frontovik?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore dangerous than anything. Who do you think the Germans are trying to knock out of position first \u2014 a guy with a slow, bolt-action Nagant or me with a mortar that pummels them with fifteen bombs a minute?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cAlexander, you want some more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tatiasha\u2014\u201d He stopped. She stopped. \u201cI\u2019m full, Tania, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d said Zoe, \u201cwe hear Stalingrad is going to fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Stalingrad falls, we lose the war,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cAny more vodka?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana poured him a shot.</p><p>Dusia said, \u201cAlexander, how many men are we prepared to lose in Stalingrad to stop Hitler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs many as it takes.\u201d</p><p>She crossed herself.</p><p>Red-faced, Vova said excitedly, \u201cMoscow was quite a bloodbath.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana heard Alexander suck in his breath. Oh, no, she thought. No scene, please.</p><p>\u201cVova,\u201d said Alexander, leaning in front of Tatiana \u2014 who pressed into his side \u2014 to glare at Vova. \u201cDo you know what a bloodbath is? Moscow had 800,000 troops before the battle for the capital started in October. Do you know how many were left when they stopped Hitler? Ninety thousand. Do you know how many men were killed just in the first six months of the war? How many young men were killed before Tania left Leningrad? Four million,\u201d he said loudly. \u201cOne of those young men could be you, Vova. So don\u2019t go around calling it a bloodbath, as if it were a game.\u201d</p><p>Everyone at the table was quiet. Tatiana, nested into Alexander, said, \u201cYou want more to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll just go and clear\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alexander lowered his arm under the table and placed his hand on Tatiana\u2019s leg, shaking his head ever so slightly and keeping her in place.</p><p>Tatiana remained in place. Alexander did not take away his hand. At first her cotton dress was between his hand and her thigh, but Alexander obviously did not like that, because he moved the dress up, just enough to grasp her bare thigh with his bare hand. The aching in her stomach intensified.</p><p>Naira said, \u201cTanechka, aren\u2019t you going to clear up, dear? We can\u2019t wait for your pie. And some tea.\u201d</p><p>Alexander\u2019s hand squeezed her a little harder and moved up.</p><p>Tatiana clenched her teeth. In exactly one second she was going to moan right at the dinner table, in front of four old women.</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cTatiana cooked wonderfully for us. She\u2019s outdone herself. She\u2019s tired. Why don\u2019t we give her a break. Zoe, Vova \u2014 maybe you could clear up?\u201d</p><p>Naira said, \u201cBut, Alexander, you don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand extremely well.\u201d Alexander\u2019s hold on Tatiana\u2019s leg did not abate.</p><p>Tatiana grabbed the edge of the table with her fingers. \u201cShura, please,\u201d she said hoarsely.</p><p>His hand gripped her thigh harder. Her hands gripped the table harder.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tania,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cNo. It\u2019s the very least they can do.\u201d He stared across to Naira. \u201cDon\u2019t you think, Naira Mikhailovna?\u201d</p><p>Naira said, \u201cI thought Tanechka enjoyed doing the small things she does.\u201d</p><p>Dusia agreed. \u201cYes. We thought it brought her pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Alexander nodded. \u201cDusia, it does bring her pleasure. Next she\u2019ll be bending down and washing your feet. But don\u2019t you think the disciples need to pour drink for Jesus every once in a while?\u201d</p><p>Dusia stammered, \u201cWhat does Jesus have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>Alexander\u2019s steel grip tightened.</p><p>Tatiana opened her mouth and\u2014</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d snapped Zoe, \u201cwe\u2019ll clear up.\u201d</p><p>With a gentle pat, Alexander let go of Tatiana\u2019s thigh.</p><p>Tatiana breathed out. After a few moments her fingers managed to let go of the table. She not only could not look at Alexander but couldn\u2019t meet anyone else\u2019s eyes either.</p><p>\u201cZoe, Vova, thank you,\u201d said Alexander, grinning at Tatiana, who remained motionless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going for a smoke,\u201d he said. Tatiana could not even acknowledge him.</p><p>After he left, the old ladies leaned in to Tatiana and lowered their voices. \u201cTania, he is very aggressive,\u201d said Naira.</p><p>Dusia said, \u201cThere is no God in the Red Army, that\u2019s the trouble. The war has made him hard, I tell you, hard.\u201d</p><p>Axinya said, \u201cYes, but look how protective he is of our Tanechka. It\u2019s adorable.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana looked at them with incomprehension. What were they saying? What were they talking about? What just happened?</p><p>\u201cTania, did you hear us?\u201d</p><p>She stood up. Her sole defender in the world, her rifle guard, her battle brigade would have her unqualified support. \u201cAlexander is not hard, Dusia. He is completely right. I should not be doing everything around here.\u201d</p><p>They had tea and blueberry pie, which was so good that soon there wasn\u2019t any pie left. After the old women went out for a smoke, Zoe, squeezing Alexander\u2019s arm and smiling coyly, asked once again if he wanted to go to the fire. Alexander took his arm away and said no once again.</p><p>Tatiana wanted Zoe to go away.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d said Zoe. \u201cEven Tania goes. With Vova,\u201d she added with emphasis.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d whispered Alexander, looking at Tatiana, who was putting sugar in his tea.</p><p>\u201cTania, tell Alexander that awful joke you told last week. No, it was so awful, we nearly died,\u201d said Vova.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d heard all of Tania\u2019s awful jokes,\u201d said Alexander. There was something so achingly familiar and comforting about sitting pressed against his large arm that Tatiana felt a need to put her head on him. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cTell him the joke, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Vova tickled Tatiana. \u201cCome on! He is going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVova, stop,\u201d said Tatiana, glancing at Alexander, who intently sipped his tea and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling him,\u201d Tatiana said, suddenly embarrassed. She knew that Alexander would not be pleased with the joke. She did not want to displease him \u2014 not even for a single stupid moment.</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Alexander turned to her and put down his cup. \u201cI love your jokes.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI want to hear.\u201d</p><p>Sighing and looking at the table, Tatiana said, \u201cChapayev and Petka are fighting in Spain. Chapayev says to Petka, \u2018Why are the people screaming? Who are they welcoming?\u2019 \u2018Oh, some Dolores Ebanulli,\u2019 replies Petka. \u2018Well, what\u2019s she yelling?\u2019 asks Chapayev. Petka replies, \u2018She yells, \u201cIt\u2019s better to do it on your feet than on your knees.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</p><p>Vova and Zoe roared with laughter.</p><p>Alexander sat stonily, tapping on his teacup. \u201cThese are the kinds of jokes you now tell at the fire on Saturday nights?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t reply and didn\u2019t look at him. She knew he wouldn\u2019t like that joke.</p><p>Vova shoved her lightly. \u201cTania, we\u2019re going tonight, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Vova, not tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? We always go.\u201d</p><p>Before Tatiana had a chance to say anything, Alexander, with his hands still around his teacup, looked at Vova and said, \u201cShe said not tonight. How many more times will she have to say it before you hear it? Zoe, how many more times will I have to say it before you hear it?\u201d</p><p>Vova and Zoe stared at Alexander and at Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Vova said in a confused voice.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBoth of you. Go to your fire. But quick.\u201d</p><p>Vova opened his mouth to speak, but Alexander stood up from the table, leveled a look at Vova, and said calmly and slowly, \u201cI said go on,\u201d in a voice that invited no argument. He got none. Vova and Zoe left.</p><p>Tatiana shook her head in amazement, staring at the table. Alexander bent to her, saying huskily, \u201cLike that?\u201d And kissed her on the head and went out to smoke.</p><p>After laying out her bedding on the porch, Tatiana helped the old ladies into bed. When she was done, Alexander was still sitting on the bench outside the house. The crickets were noisy tonight. Tatiana could hear the distant howl of a coyote, the murmuring hoot of an owl. She went to wash the dessert dishes.</p><p>\u201cTania, will you stop fussing and come here.\u201d</p><p>Her hands still wet, she nervously stepped up to him. The relentless throbbing in the pit of her stomach would not subside, not for dinner or the dishes, not for the old women or the laundry, not for anything.</p><p>\u201cCloser,\u201d Alexander said, watching her for a few seconds. He dropped his cigarette on the ground and put his hands on her hips, bringing her between his open legs.</p><p>Tatiana was barely standing.</p><p>Holding on to her, Alexander looked up for a moment and then pressed his head into her rib cage just below her breasts.</p><p>Tatiana, not knowing what to do with her hands, placed them carefully on Alexander\u2019s head. His hair was short and thick, straight and dry. Tatiana liked how it felt. She closed her eyes, trying to breathe normally. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI am, yes,\u201d Alexander replied. \u201cTatia, instead of thinking about yourself, couldn\u2019t you have once thought about me? Couldn\u2019t you have just imagined me for five seconds, and what I was going through for six months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHad you done that, thought of me for five seconds, and written to me, you would have gotten letters back that would have eased every single one of your fears. And you would have eased mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly thought that there could be only two explanations for your silence. One, you were dead. Two, you had\u201d \u2014 he paused \u2014 \u201cfound someone else. I never imagined that any of the lies I spoke would get under your skin. I thought you had the ability to see clear to the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had that ability?\u201d Tatiana said softly, caressing his head. \u201cWhere is your ability?\u201d Found someone else? she thought. \u201cHonestly.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his forehead from side to side against her. \u201cWhat did Axinya call you? A warm bun?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cYes,\u201d she muttered. \u201cA warm bun.\u201d</p><p>Alexander\u2019s hands on her hips tightened. \u201cA small warm bun,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Very, very gently, Tatiana stroked his hair with her shaking fingers. Her breath was so shallow it was not getting air into her lungs.</p><p>\u201cThis is too close, even by Fifth Soviet standards,\u201d Alexander said at last.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered, trying not to disturb the night. \u201cUs? Or this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d he said with surprise, looking up at her. \u201cNo. This house.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shivered.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, hoping he wouldn\u2019t touch her burning skin.</p><p>\u201cWant to go in?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Tatiana nodded again. All she wanted was for his hands to remain on her, tight around her hips, tight around her waist, around her back, around her legs, anywhere, everywhere, but tight and on her and permanent.</p><p>Alexander lifted his head to her. Parting her mouth, she was about to bend\u2014</p><p>Suddenly Tatiana heard the shuffling of Naira Mikhailovna on the porch. Alexander lowered his hands and his head. Against her will she stepped away from him, just as Naira descended the steps, mumbling, \u201cForgot to go one last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d said Alexander, not even bothering to smile.</p><p>Naira stared at Tatiana for a moment. \u201cTanechka, what are you doing? Go get ready for bed, dear. It\u2019s so late already, and you know how early we wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Naira Mikhailovna.\u201d</p><p>When Naira went around the corner, Tatiana let her glance stop at Alexander, who was looking at her unhappily. She shrugged, also unhappily. They went inside. Getting a big white shirt out of her trunk, Tatiana thought, where to change? Alexander had no such reservations. He took off his shirt right in front of her, leaving on his linen trousers as he hopped up onto the bed. Tatiana had never seen Alexander without his uniform, his shirt, his long johns; she had never seen Alexander bare. He was very muscled. Was she ever going to get her breath back? She did not think so.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take off her dress and put on her nightshirt. She decided to leave the dress on.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said, dimming the kerosene lamp. Alexander did not reply.</p><p>Naira walked through the house to her bedroom saying, \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said good night. Alexander didn\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>Still in her dress, Tatiana was under the blanket on the porch sofa when she heard Alexander\u2019s deep voice from inside call for her. \u201cTatia.\u201d</p><p>She got up and stood shyly in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Alexander said, his muted voice cracking.</p><p>All she wanted was to go to him. But she was so afraid. She walked around the table.</p><p>\u201cStand on the hearth,\u201d Alexander told her.</p><p>Tatiana stood, her face next to his, and before he had a chance to whisper or open his mouth, she kissed him, her hands clutching his head.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he breathed out. She felt him trying to pull her up.</p><p>\u201cOh, Shura, I can\u2019t . . . There will be the biggest fuss . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop kissing him either.</p><p>\u201cTania, I don\u2019t give a shit if it\u2019s in tomorrow\u2019s papers. Right now come here to me.\u201d He pulled her up by her arms, and once she was up, he entwined her with all his limbs, his whole enormous body swallowing her as they kissed ravenously.</p><p>\u201cGod, Tatia,\u201d Alexander whispered. \u201cOh, God, I\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she replied, her lips open, her hands stroking his back. \u201cSo much.\u201d For a moment he stopped kissing her and moving against her, as he embraced her in a nest inside him. Tatiana could not believe how remarkable it felt to touch Alexander\u2019s naked back and hard shoulders and hard arms.</p><p>He was crushing her to him, his lips more demanding, his insistent hands all over her. He had only two hands? Then why were they everywhere at once? She was enveloped in him, unable to keep her eyes open, yet all she wanted was to see him, to not miss a second of him. Pulling up her dress to her waist, Alexander touched her bare leg. Involuntarily her legs spread apart slightly, and Tatiana moaned into his lips.</p><p>Smiling, Alexander whispered, \u201cOh, Tania. Moan, but not too loud. Wait, not so loud.\u201d</p><p>Her legs opened a little more. His hand caressed the inside of her thigh.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she groaned. Stop, please.</p><p>He licked her lips. \u201cTania, your thighs . . .\u201d Alexander whispered. His hand climbed on her.</p><p>Tatiana tried to pull away from him, but there was nowhere for her to go. \u201cShura,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease. Stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they sound sleepers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey wake up at the sound of a cricket in the house. They come outside five times to go to the outhouse. Please. I can\u2019t keep quiet. You\u2019d have to suffocate me to keep me quiet.\u201d</p><p>They kept whispering into each other\u2019s wet mouths.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she whispered. \u201cStop.\u201d They could not stop.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s hand reluctantly came away from her leg, resting on her bare stomach under her dress. \u201cI like the dress,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not touching the dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Feels nice. Soft. Take it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, pushing him away slightly.</p><p>They lay relatively quiet for a few minutes as they got their breath back.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s fingers went back to rubbing her leg. \u201cStop rubbing my leg,\u201d Tatiana whispered. She throbbed from her thighs to her navel. \u201cStop touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve waited too long for you.\u201d Bending over her, he pressed his lips to her throat. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me, Tania?\u201d he whispered. \u201cTell me you don\u2019t want me.\u201d His hands were tugging the dress down from her shoulders. \u201cTake it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she panted. \u201cShura, come on, I can\u2019t keep quiet. You have to stop.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t stop. The dress came off one arm, then off the other.</p><p>Alexander took her hand and put it on his chest. \u201cTania, feel my heart! Don\u2019t you want to lie against my chest?\u201d he said imploringly. \u201cYour bare breasts on my chest, your heart next to my heart. Come on, just for a second. Then you can put the dress back on.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana silently stared at him in the dark, at his blazing bronze eyes, at his moist mouth. How could she say no to Alexander? She lifted her arms. Alexander slipped the dress over her head. She went to cover her breasts, and his hands stopped her. \u201cKeep your hands down.\u201d</p><p>He lay on his back and said, \u201cCome, lie on top of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to lie on top of me?\u201d Tatiana asked softly.</p><p>He pulled her to him. \u201cNot if you want me to stop.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, Tatiana lay down carefully against his chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania,\u201d Alexander said intensely, his arms around her. \u201cDo you feel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she whispered, her own heart ready to burst.</p><p>His hands ran over her back down to her hips, caressing her through her panties, pulling them down a little, caressing her bare bottom. Pushing her up from him, Alexander fondled her breasts. \u201cI have been dreaming of your beautiful breasts for a year,\u201d he said, smiling, breathing through his parted mouth. Tatiana wanted to tell him that she had been dreaming of his beautiful, unstoppable hands on her for a year but couldn\u2019t speak. She wanted to tell him that she had been dreaming of his beautiful, unstoppable mouth on her nipples for a year but couldn\u2019t speak. What she wanted to do was lean over him and put her nipple into his mouth. She was too shy to do that. All she could do was watch his face and pant.</p><p>Alexander closed his eyes. \u201cTatia, please, keep quiet. I can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d He pulled at her nipples. She moaned so loudly that he stopped, but not for long. Pushing her off him, Alexander lay her down onto her back. \u201cLook at you,\u201d he whispered. He sucked her nipples for a moment. Tatiana\u2019s hands were grasping at the sheet. One of Alexander\u2019s hands went around her mouth, the other went on her thigh. \u201cTania,\u201d he said, \u201cyou think I\u2019m hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d she panted into his palm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Alexander whispered. \u201cI\u2019m famished. Watch out for me. Now, don\u2019t make a single sound,\u201d he said, getting on top of her. \u201cTania, God . . . I\u2019ll cover your mouth, just like this, and you hold on to my arms, just like this, and I\u2019m going to \u2014 just like this\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tatiana cried out so loudly that Alexander stopped, fell back on the bed, put his arm over his face, and groaned.</p><p>They lay next to each other, only their legs touching, hers bare, his still in his trousers. His arm remained around his face.</p><p>Reluctantly Tatiana put her dress back on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d he whispered to her. \u201cDie, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re going to die? she thought, beginning to crawl to the edge to get down.</p><p>Alexander stopped her. \u201cWhere are you going? Sleep with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Shura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He smiled, still panting. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a second.\u201d She smiled back.</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019ll come out, they\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what? What are they going to do?\u201d He wasn\u2019t letting go of her arms. \u201cTatia, right here,\u201d he whispered, tapping on his chest. \u201cJust like you did in Luga. Remember? You called me over, you said, come near me. Well, now I\u2019m telling you to come.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana crawled to him and put her head into the crook of his arm. Alexander pulled the blankets over them and hugged her. She placed her hand on his smooth bare chest, feeling his rapid heart. \u201cShura, darling . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he said, sounding as if he wouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cJust like in Luga.\u201d She rubbed his chest gently.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little lower? Just kidding, just kidding,\u201d he quickly said when Tatiana stopped. \u201cLove your hair against me,\u201d Alexander whispered, stroking her head, kissing her temple. \u201cLove everything of yours against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Shura, please,\u201d Tatiana muttered, kissing his chest and closing her eyes. She felt infinite comfort lying in his arms. His fingers caressing her head were forcing her eyes shut. \u201cThat feels nice,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Minutes passed. Minutes or\u2014</p><p>Maybe seconds.</p><p>Moments.</p><p>Blink.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Alexander said, \u201care you asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and then they looked at each other and smiled. She parted her mouth to kiss him, and he shook his head and said, \u201cNo. Keep your lips away, if you want me away.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana kissed his shoulder and stroked him while he stroked her. \u201cShura,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so happy you came for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Me, too.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her lips against his skin.</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d whispered Alexander, \u201cwant to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cTell me. Start at the beginning. Don\u2019t stop until you finish.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana started at the beginning but couldn\u2019t get past the sled near the ice hole in the lake.</p><p>Neither could Alexander.</p><p>Then she was asleep and woke up when the rooster crowed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>7</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she said, trying to extricate herself from him. \u201cLet go. I have to go, quick.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was profoundly asleep and not moving. She noticed that about him. He was a good sleeper. She managed to move out from under his arm and jump down from the side of the stove.</p><p>Tatiana put on a clean dress and ran to get the water from the well, and ran to milk the goat, and ran to exchange goat\u2019s milk for some cow\u2019s milk. When she came back to the house, Alexander was already up and shaving. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said to her, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said, too embarrassed to look at him. \u201cHere, let me help.\u201d She sat in the chair in front of him, holding a small broken mirror to her chest as he shaved. He kept cutting himself every few seconds, as if the knife he was using weren\u2019t sharp. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill yourself with that thing,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cWhat do they issue you in the army? Maybe you should grow your beard back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the knife,\u201d he said. \u201cThe knife is very sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d</p><p>She saw him staring at her breasts.</p> <p>\u201cAlexander . . .\u201d she said, putting the mirror down.</p><p>\u201cOh, now that it\u2019s daylight, I\u2019m suddenly Alexander again?\u201d he said.</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t look at him but couldn\u2019t help smiling either. She felt so exhilarated this morning, she had practically skipped home carrying the two pails of milk.</p><p>Alexander made coffee. He poured her a cup, and they sat silently outside in the breathy morning and drank the hot liquid, their bodies lightly touching. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice morning,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a glorious morning,\u201d he said, turning to her and beaming.</p><p>Naira called her, and Tatiana went to attend to her chores while Alexander collected his things. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked with a twitch of anxiety when he came outside.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting out of here,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d A smile lit up her face.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I have to do laundry. I have to make breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, that\u2019s my point exactly. I have to come before laundry. I have to come before breakfast.\u201d Alexander stared at her.</p><p>She backed away. \u201cLook,\u201d she said, \u201chelp me. I\u2019ll be done so much faster if you help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you\u2019ll come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, almost inaudibly. But Alexander smiled at her. She knew he had heard.</p> <p>She made eggs and potatoes for everyone. Alexander gulped down his food and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go do the laundry.\u201d</p><p>Quickly he carried the basket of clothes to the river. Tatiana carried the washboard and soap. She could hardly keep up.</p><p>\u201cSo since when do you make rude jokes in the presence of a whole group of young people?\u201d Alexander asked.</p><p>Tatiana shook her head. \u201cShura, it was just a stupid joke. I didn\u2019t realize it was going to upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you did. That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want to tell it in front of me.\u201d</p><p>She ran alongside him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to be upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be upset? Have I ever been upset by your other jokes?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana kept quiet before she answered him because she wanted to figure out what it was that was obviously still niggling him. That the joke was inappropriate? That it was rude? That she told the joke to Vova? To strangers Alexander didn\u2019t know? That it was out of her character? That it didn\u2019t fit in with what he knew about her? Yes, Tatiana decided. It was the last. He brought it up now because he was worried about something. She said nothing until they got to the river. \u201cI barely know what the joke means,\u201d she said.</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cBut you know just enough what it means?\u201d</p><p>Aha, thought Tatiana. He is worried about me. She didn\u2019t reply, stepping into the water and wetting the washboard and the soap.</p><p>Alexander watched her while he smoked. \u201cSo how do you keep your white dress from getting wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bottom gets a little wet. What?\u201d She blushed. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole dress doesn\u2019t get wet?\u201d He was grinning.</p><p>\u201cWell, no. I don\u2019t stand and wash clothes in water up to my neck.\u201d</p><p>Stubbing out his cigarette and taking off his shirt and boots, Alexander said, \u201cHere, let me. Just hand me the clothes, will you?\u201d</p><p>There was something so endearing and incomprehensible about him, a captain in the Red Army standing knee deep in the Kama, shirtless, his big soapy arms immersed in women\u2019s work, while Tatiana stood dry as gin and handed him dirty clothes. She found it so amusing, in fact, that when she saw him drop a pillowcase in the river and bend to pick it up, she tiptoed up to him and gave him a great shove. Alexander toppled over into the water.</p><p>When he came back up, Tatiana was laughing so hard it took her a few seconds to run up the riverbank away from him. Alexander caught her in three strides.</p><p>\u201cNot very good balance, big man,\u201d Tatiana said, laughing. \u201cWhat if I were a Nazi?\u201d</p><p>Saying nothing, he carried her to the river.</p><p>\u201cNo, instantly put me down,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m wearing a nice dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he said, flinging her into the water.</p><p>She came up soaked. \u201cNow look what you\u2019ve done,\u201d she said, splashing him. \u201cI have nothing to go back in.\u201d</p><p>Alexander caught her in his arms and kissed her, lifting her into the air. Tatiana felt them both slipping back, back, back, and they fell in, and when they came up for air, all decorum gone, Tatiana jumped on him to dunk him, but she just didn\u2019t weigh enough to push him down. He threw her off him and held her head for a few seconds underwater while she grabbed for his leg. \u201cDo you give up?\u201d he asked, pulling her head out.</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d she yelped, and he pushed her back down.</p><p>\u201cDo you give up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>Alexander pushed her back down.</p><p>After the fourth time, all out of breath, she said, \u201cWait, the clothes, the clothes!\u201d</p><p>The laundry \u2014 undergarments, pillowcases \u2014 was all floating cheerfully by.</p><p>Alexander went after them. Dripping and laughing, Tatiana went back on shore.</p><p>He walked out of the water, dropped the clothes on the ground, and came for her. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said, dizzied by his expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he said hotly. \u201cLook at your nipples, look at your body in that dress.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her. \u201cWrap your legs around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she said, wrapping her arms around his neck and kissing him.</p><p>\u201cI mean, open your legs and wrap them around me.\u201d Holding her with one hand under her bottom, he moved her leg around his waist with the other hand. \u201cLike this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, I . . . put me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Their wet lips would not stop.</p><p>When they opened their eyes, Alexander had to put Tatiana down, because six women from the village were standing at the clearing, holding their clothes baskets, staring at them with a look of perplexed and frankly disapproving confusion.</p><p>\u201cWe were just leaving,\u201d Tatiana muttered as Alexander draped something wet over her shoulders to cover her see-through dress. She never wore a bra, didn\u2019t own one, and for the first time in her life she was aware of her nipples poking out and being seen through a sheer item of clothing. It was as if suddenly she saw herself with Alexander\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, that will be all over Lazarevo tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cCould it be any more humiliating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say yes,\u201d said Alexander, leaning into her. \u201cThey could have come three minutes later.\u201d</p><p>Turning bright red, Tatiana didn\u2019t respond. Laughing, he put his arm around her.</p><p>When they got to the house, Tatiana in a wet dress and Alexander in wet trousers and nothing else, the old ladies looked mortified. \u201cThe clothes floated away,\u201d Tatiana explained \u2014 unsatisfactorily, she felt. \u201cWe had to dive in and rescue them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing happening,\u201d mumbled Dusia, crossing herself. \u201cIn all my years of living.\u201d</p><p>Alexander disappeared into the house, emerging five minutes later dressed in his khaki army trousers, black army boots, and the white ribbed sleeveless top Tatiana had sewn for him. She peered at him through the sheets she was haphazardly hanging. He was crouching as he rummaged through his rucksack. She watched Alexander in profile, his bare muscled arms, his soldier\u2019s body, his spiky wet black hair, a cigarette in the corner of his lips \u2014 Tatiana\u2019s breath was taken away from her, he looked so beautiful. He turned his head to her and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI have a dry dress for you,\u201d he said, and out of his rucksack he produced her white dress with red roses.</p><p>He told her how he had retrieved it from Fifth Soviet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll fit me anymore,\u201d she said, very moved. \u201cBut maybe I\u2019ll try it on another day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Alexander said, stuffing it back into his rucksack. \u201cYou can wear it for me another day.\u201d He picked up his rifle and all his belongings. \u201cYou don\u2019t need anything. You\u2019re done here. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAway from here,\u201d he said, lowering his voice. \u201cWhere we can be uninterrupted and alone.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cBring money,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said we didn\u2019t need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd bring your passport. We might go to Molotov.\u201d</p><p>The immense excitement Tatiana felt vanquished all guilt as she told the four ladies she was leaving. Naira said, \u201cAre you going to be back for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Slinging his rifle on his back and taking Tatiana by the hand, Alexander said, \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Tania, our sewing circle is today at three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . .\u201d Alexander drew out. \u201cTania won\u2019t be joining you today. But you ladies have a great session.\u201d</p><p>They ran down to the river. Tatiana never even looked back.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandparents\u2019 house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy there? It\u2019s such a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we had such a fight there yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gazed at her. \u201cYou know what we had there yesterday?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana knew. She made no reply but held his hand tighter.</p><p>When they got to the clearing, Tatiana walked inside the izba, which was empty but spotless. It was a one-room cabin with four long windows and a great big furnace stove in the center that took up half the room. There was not an item of furniture, but the wooden floor had been mopped, the windows were clean, and even the sheer white curtains had been washed and dried and no longer smelled moldy. Tatiana peeked out. Alexander was on his knees driving a tent stake into the ground. His back was to her. She put her hand on her heart. Come on, calm down, she told herself.</p><p>Walking outside, she collected some twigs into a bundle in case he wanted to make a fire.</p><p>Tatiana was paralyzed by fear and love, walking around the sandy pine-needle banks of the river Kama during a sunlit noon in June.</p><p>She took off her sandals and put her feet into the cool water. She could not go near Alexander now, but maybe later they could go swimming. \u201cWatch out!\u201d she heard from behind her. Alexander sprinted into the water and dove in, wearing just his army skivvies.</p><p>\u201cTania, want to go swimming?\u201d he called to her.</p><p>Her heart pounding, she shook her head. \u201cI see you know how to swim very well,\u201d she said, watching him do the backstroke.</p><p>He lifted his face to her from the water. \u201cI know how to swim,\u201d he said. \u201cCome in, I\u2019ll race you.\u201d He grinned. \u201cUnderwater. All the way to the other side.\u201d</p><p>If she weren\u2019t so nervous, she would have grinned back and then taken him up on it.</p><p>Alexander came out, pulling back his wet hair. His naked chest, his naked arms, his naked legs glistened. He was laughing; to Tatiana he appeared to be glowing from the inside out. She couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away from his taut, magnificent body. His wet skivvies clung to him\u2014</p><p>No, she was not going to make it.</p><p>\u201cFeels good,\u201d Alexander said, coming up to her. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s swim.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shook her head, backing away on unsteady legs to the edge of the clearing, where she picked some blueberries off the low bushes. Please, calm down, she kept repeating to herself. Please.</p><p>\u201cTatia,\u201d he called quietly from right behind her, and she turned around. He was drying himself off. She handed him some blueberries; he took them but didn\u2019t let go of her hand, gently pulling her down to the grass. \u201cYou sweet girl, sit down for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana sat on the grass, and Alexander knelt in front of her. Leaning forward, he very softly kissed her lips. Tatiana stroked his arms. She could barely breathe.</p><p>\u201cTatia . . . Tatiasha,\u201d he said huskily, taking her hands and kissing them, kissing her wrists and the insides of her forearms.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said, just as huskily.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re alone together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she replied, suppressing a moan.</p><p>\u201cWe have privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivacy, Tania!\u201d Alexander said intensely. \u201cFor the first time in our life you and I have real privacy. We had it yesterday. And we have it today.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take the emotion in his cr\u00e8me br?l\u00e9e eyes. She lowered her gaze.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Alexander cupped her small face in his massive hands. \u201cAre you . . . scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Please, don\u2019t be scared of me.\u201d He kissed her deeply on the lips, so deeply, so fully, so lovingly, that Tatiana felt the aching pit inside her open up and flare upward. She tottered, physically unable to continue sitting upright. \u201cTatiasha,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy are you so beautiful? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a rag,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at you.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her. \u201cGod, what a blessing.\u201d Pulling away, Alexander took her hands. \u201cTania, you are my miracle, you know that, don\u2019t you? You are the one God sent me to give me faith.\u201d He paused. \u201cHe sent you to redeem me, to comfort me, and to heal me \u2014 and that\u2019s just so far,\u201d he added with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m barely able to hold myself together right now, I want to make love to you so much . . .\u201d Here he stopped. \u201cI know you\u2019re afraid. I will never hurt you. Will you come into my tent with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tatiana said, softly but audibly.</p><p>Alexander carried her in his arms to his tent, setting her down on his blanket and closing the tent flaps behind them. It was subdued and dusky inside, with only the barest sunlight filtering in through the open ties. \u201cI would have brought you inside the nice, clean house,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cbut we have no quilts, no pillows, and it\u2019s all wood and a hard furnace top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Tatiana muttered. \u201cTent is good.\u201d She could have been on a marble floor of the Peterhof Palace for all she cared.</p><p>Alexander was hugging her to him, but all she wanted was to be lying down in front of him. How did he do that? \u201cShura,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered back, kissing her neck.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t . . . he wasn\u2019t doing anything else, as if he were waiting, or thinking, or . . .</p><p>Alexander pulled away from her, and she saw by the reserve in his eyes that something was troubling him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t look at her. \u201cYou said so many upset things to me yesterday . . . not that I don\u2019t deserve all of them . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve all of them.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAsk me.\u201d She knew what he wanted from her.</p><p>His eyes remained lowered.</p><p>Shaking her head, Tatiana said, \u201cLift your head. Look at me.\u201d He did. Kneeling in front of him, Tatiana held his face between her hands, kissed his lips, and said, \u201cAlexander, the answer is yes . . . yes . . . of course I\u2019ve saved myself for you. I belong to you. What are you even thinking?\u201d</p><p>His happy, relieved, excited eyes flowed into her. \u201cOh, Tania.\u201d For a moment he didn\u2019t speak. \u201cYou have no idea . . . what that means to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she whispered. She knew.</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cYou were right,\u201d he said emotionally. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve what you have to give me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not you, who?\u201d said Tatiana, hugging him. \u201cWhere are your hands? I want them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hands?\u201d He kissed her ardently. \u201cLift your arms.\u201d He took off her sundress and laid her down on the blanket, kneeling over her, roaming over her face and throat with his hungry lips, roaming over her body with his hungry fingers.</p><p>\u201cNow I need you completely naked before me, all right?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He took off her white cotton panties, and Tatiana in her weakness watched him in his weakness, staring at her and then uttering, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t take it . . .\u201d</p><p>He put his cheek against her breast. \u201cYour heart is pounding like gunfire . . .\u201d He licked her nipples. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tatiana whispered, her hands in his damp hair.</p><p>Bending over her, Alexander whispered, \u201cYou tell me what you want me to do, and I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll go as slow as you need me to. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t reply. She wanted to ask him to bring her instant relief from the fire but could not. She had to trust in Alexander.</p><p>His palm pressing into her stomach, Alexander whispered, \u201cLook at you, your wet, erect nipples standing up, pleading with me to suck them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck them,\u201d Tatiana whispered, moaning.</p><p>He did. \u201cYes. Moan, moan as loud as you want. No one can hear you but me, and I came sixteen hundred kilometers to hear you, so moan, Tania.\u201d His mouth, his tongue, his teeth devoured her breasts as her back and chest and hips arched into him.</p><p>Lying down on his side next to her, Alexander eased his hand between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d she said, trying to keep her legs together.</p><p>\u201cNo, open,\u201d Alexander said, his hand pushing her legs apart. With his fingers he traced her thigh upward. \u201cShh,\u201d he whispered, wrapping his free arm around her neck. \u201cTania, you\u2019re trembling.\u201d His fingers touched her. Her body stiffened. Alexander\u2019s breath stopped. Tatiana\u2019s breath stopped. \u201cDo you feel how gently I rub you,\u201d he whispered, his lips on her cheek. \u201cYou . . . so blonde all over.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were clenched on her stomach under his forearm. Her eyes were closed.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel that, Tatia?\u201d</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>Alexander stroked her up and down and then in small circles. \u201cYou feel unbelievable . . .\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her hands clenched tighter.</p><p>He rubbed her a little firmer. \u201cWant me to stop?\u201d He groaned slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, do you feel me against your hip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I thought that was your rifle.\u201d</p><p>His hot breath was in her neck. \u201cWhatever you want to call it is fine with me.\u201d He bent over her and sucked her nipples as he rubbed her and rubbed against her\u2014</p><p>In circles, in circles\u2014</p><p>As she moaned and moaned\u2014</p><p>And\u2014</p><p>He pulled his fingers away and his mouth away and himself away.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no. Don\u2019t stop,\u201d Tatiana murmured in a panic, opening her eyes. In the palpitating tension of her flesh she had begun to feel combustion, and when he stopped, she started to quiver so uncontrollably that Alexander lay on top of her briefly to calm her, pressing his forehead to her forehead. \u201cShh. It\u2019s all right.\u201d He paused for a second and got off her. \u201cTell me what you want me to do.\u201d</p><p>Unsteadily, Tatiana said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. What else have you got?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAll right, then.\u201d He pulled off his shorts and knelt in front of her.</p><p>When Tatiana saw him, she sat straight up. \u201cOh, my God, Alexander,\u201d she muttered incredulously, backing away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, smiling from ear to ear. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d His hands held on to her legs.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head, staring at him in astonishment. \u201cNo, no. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow, and in His infinite wisdom,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cGod has ensured that it all works the way it\u2019s supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, it can\u2019t be possible. It\u2019ll never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Alexander said, staring at her with lust. \u201cIt will.\u201d</p><p>He lay her down flat, and said, \u201cI cannot wait a second longer. Not another second. I need to be inside you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. No, Shura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Tania, yes. Say that to me. Yes, Shura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Yes, Shura.\u201d</p><p>Alexander climbed on top of her, supporting himself on his arms. \u201cTania,\u201d he whispered passionately, \u201cyou are naked and underneath me!\u201d As if he could not believe it himself.</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d she said, still trembling, \u201cyou are naked and above me.\u201d She felt him rubbing against her.</p><p>They kissed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said, his breath shallow. \u201cI didn\u2019t think this day would ever come.\u201d He paused and then whispered, \u201cYet I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without it. You alive, under me. Tania, touch me. Put your hands on me.\u201d</p><p>Instantly she reached down and took hold of him.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel how hard I am,\u201d he whispered, \u201c. . . for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d she said in crazed disbelief. Seeing him was a profound shock to her. Feeling him was entirely too much. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d she muttered, stroking him gently. \u201cYou will kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cLet me. Open your legs.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>\u201cNo, wider.\u201d Alexander kissed her and whispered, \u201cOpen yourself for me, Tania. Go ahead . . . open for me.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana did. She continued to stroke him.</p><p>\u201cNow, are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, you are ready. Let go of me.\u201d He smiled. \u201cHold on to my neck. Hold on tight.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Alexander pushed himself inside her, little by little, little by little. Tatiana grasped at his arms, at the blanket, at his back, at the grass above her head. \u201cWait, wait, please . . .\u201d He waited as best he could. Tatiana felt as she had imagined she would \u2014 that she was being torn open. But something else, too.</p><p>An intemperate hunger for Alexander.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI\u2019m inside you.\u201d He kissed her and breathed deeply out. \u201cI\u2019m inside you, Tatiasha.\u201d</p><p>Softly she moaned, her hands around his neck. \u201cAre you really inside me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He pulled up slightly. \u201cFeel.\u201d</p><p>She felt. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you . . . fit.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Alexander whispered, \u201cOnly just, but yes.\u201d He kissed her lips. Took a breath. Left his lips on her. \u201cAs if God Himself joined our flesh . . .\u201d He took another breath. \u201c. . . Me and you together, and said, they shall be one.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana lay very still. Alexander was very still, his lips pressed against her forehead. Was there more? Tatiana\u2019s body was aching. There was no relief. Her hands went around to hold him a little closer. She looked up into his flushed face. \u201cIs that it? Is that all there is to it?\u201d</p><p>Alexander paused a moment. \u201cNot quite.\u201d He inhaled her breath. \u201cI\u2019m just \u2014 Tania, we\u2019ve been so desperately longing for this . . .\u201d he whispered into her mouth, \u201cand the moment will never come again.\u201d He gazed into her face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered back. She was throbbing. She tilted her hips up to him.</p><p>Another moment.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d He pulled slowly and slightly out and pushed himself back in. Tatiana gritted her teeth, but through the gritted teeth a moan escaped.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d she said.</p><p>Slowly he pulled halfway out and pushed himself back in.</p><p>\u201cWait . . .\u201d</p><p>Alexander pulled all the way out and pushed himself all the way in, and Tatiana, astounded, nearly screamed, but she was too afraid he would stop if he thought she was in pain. She heard him groan, and less slowly he pulled all the way out and pushed himself all the way in. Moaning, she gripped his arms.</p><p>\u201cOh, Shura.\u201d She was unable to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI know. Just hold on to me.\u201d</p><p>Less slowly. Less gently.</p><p>Tatiana was feverish from the pain, from the flame.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana paused, dizzy and lost. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going as slow as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Shura.\u201d Breath, breath, where is my breath . . .</p><p>Short panting pause. \u201cTania . . . God, I\u2019m done for, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Alexander whispered hotly. \u201cDone for, forever.\u201d</p><p>Less, less gently.</p><p>Speechlessly Tatiana clung to him, her mouth open in a mute scream.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Alexander stopped. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, shaking his head against her cheek. \u201cHang on tight,\u201d he whispered. He was still for another moment.</p><p>Through his parted lips he breathed, \u201cOh, Tania . . .\u201d and suddenly he thrust in and out of her so hard and so fast that Tatiana thought she was going to pass out, crying in tumult and pain and gripping his head buried in her neck.</p><p>A breathless moment.</p><p>And another.</p><p>And another.</p><p>The heart was wild, and the throat was parched, and the lips were wet, and breath was slowly coming back, and sound, and sensation, and smell.</p><p>And her eyes were open.</p><p>Blink.</p><p>Alexander pulsed to a gradual stop, took a deep relieved breath, and lay on top of her for a few panting minutes.</p><p>Her hands continued to grip him.</p><p>A bittersweet tingle remained where he had just been. Tatiana felt regret; she wanted him inside her again; it had felt so excessive and absolute.</p><p>Lifting himself off her, Alexander blew on her wet forehead and chest. \u201cAre you all right? I hurt you?\u201d he whispered, tenderly kissing her freckles. \u201cTania, honey, tell me you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t answer him. His lips on her face were too warm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Tatiana finally replied, smiling shyly, holding him to her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Alexander lay down by her side. \u201cI\u2019m fantastic,\u201d he said, his fingers running down the length of her body from her face to her shins and slowly back up again. \u201cI have never been better.\u201d His shining smile was so full of happiness that Tatiana wanted to cry. She pressed her face against his face. They didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>His hand stopped moving and rested on Tatiana\u2019s hip. \u201cYou were surprisingly more quiet than I had anticipated,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I was trying not to faint,\u201d Tatiana said, making him laugh.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might be.\u201d</p><p>She turned on her side to him. \u201cShura, was it . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Alexander kissed her eyes. \u201cTania,\u201d he whispered, \u201cto be inside you, to come inside you . . . it was magic. You know it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think it was going to be like?\u201d she asked, nudging him.</p><p>\u201cThis was better than anything my pathetic imagination could conjure up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been imagining this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d He held her to him. \u201cForget me. Tell me \u2014 what did you expect?\u201d He grinned, kissed her, and laughed with delight. \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to burst,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d Huskily he added, \u201cHave you been imagining this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, nudging him again. Certainly not this. Her fingers floated down from Alexander\u2019s throat to his stomach. All she wanted was permission to touch him again. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you expecting?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana thought about it. \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, you must have been expecting something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Not this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was quite embarrassed and wished Alexander wouldn\u2019t look at her with such mouthwatering adoration. \u201cI had a brother, Shura,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew what you all looked like. Sort of quiet . . . and down . . . and very . . . hmm . . .\u201d Tatiana searched for a proper word. \u201cUnalarming.\u201d</p><p>Alexander burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen one . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was alarming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Why was he laughing like that?</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana paused. \u201cI guess I thought this unalarming thing would . . . I don\u2019t know . . . quietly sort of . . .\u201d She coughed once. \u201cLet\u2019s just say the movement was also quite a surprise to me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander grabbed her, kissing her happily. \u201cYou\u2019re the funniest girl. What am I going to do with you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana lay quietly facing him, the aching inside her thoroughly unsubsided. She was fascinated with his body. Her fingers lightly stroked his stomach. \u201cSo what now?\u201d She paused. \u201cAre we . . . done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said at once.</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d Alexander said, his voice filled with emotion, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that,\u201d he said, lifting her face to him. \u201cI have never heard you say it to me.\u201d</p><p>That couldn\u2019t be true, thought Tatiana. I\u2019ve felt it every minute of every day since we met. Spilling over \u2014 \u201cI love you, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered, gazing at her. \u201cTell me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She hugged him. \u201cI love you breathlessly, my amazing man.\u201d With affection she smiled into his face. \u201cBut you know, I have never heard you say it to me either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did, Tatiana,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cYou heard me say it to you.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak, or breathe, or blink.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I know?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she mouthed inaudibly.</p><p>\u201cBecause you got up off that sled . . .\u201d</p><p>Another mute moment passed.</p><p>The second time they made love, it hurt less.</p><p>The third time Tatiana experienced a floating, incandescent moment of such pain-infused exquisite pleasure that it caught even her by surprise. She cried out.</p><p>Crying out, she moaned, \u201cGod, don\u2019t stop. Please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Alexander said, and stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she said, opening her eyes, parting her lips, looking up at him. \u201cI said don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear you moan again,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI want to hear you moan for me not to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d she whispered, milling her hips against him, her hands around his neck.</p><p>\u201cNo, Shura, no? Or yes, Shura, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Shura, yes.\u201d Tatiana closed her eyes, \u201cI beg you . . . don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Alexander moved in and out of her deeper and slower. She cried out.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cOr . . .\u201d</p><p>Faster and faster. She cried out.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cTania . . . is it so good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny which way.\u201d Her tense hands clenched around him.</p><p>\u201cMoan for me, Tania,\u201d Alexander whispered, changing his rhythm and his speed. \u201cGo ahead . . . moan for me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t have to ask twice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop, Shura . . .\u201d she said helplessly.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop, Tania.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop, and there it was \u2014 finally Tatiana felt her entire body stiffen and explode in a convulsive burn, then a lava melt. It was some time before she was able to stop moaning and quivering against Alexander. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d she uttered at last, still panting.</p><p>\u201cThat was my Tania discovering what is so fantastic about making love. That was . . . relief,\u201d he whispered, pressing his cheek to her cheek.</p><p>Tatiana clasped him to her, turning her face away and murmuring through her happy tears, \u201cOh, my God, Alexander . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have we been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your \u2018precise\u2019 watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t bring it. Wanted time to stop moving forward,\u201d said Alexander, blinking and closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTania? You\u2019re not sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My eyes are closed. I\u2019m very relaxed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, will you tell me the truth if I ask for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She smiled. Her eyes were still closed.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever touched a man before? Touched a man.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana opened her eyes and laughed quietly. \u201cShura, what are you talking about? Besides my brother when we were younger, I\u2019ve never even seen a man before.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was nestled in his arms, her fingers touching his chin, his neck, his Adam\u2019s apple. She pressed her index finger to the vividly pulsing artery near his throat. She moved up a little and kissed the artery and then left her mouth on it, feeling it beat against her lips. Why is he so endearing? she thought. And why does he smell so good?</p><p>\u201cWhat about those hordes of young beasts you told me about, chasing you in Luga? None of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you touch any of them?\u201d asked Alexander.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cShura, why are you so funny? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe through clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She didn\u2019t take her mouth away from his neck. \u201cOf course not.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat are you trying to get out of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of things you got up to before me.\u201d</p><p>Teasingly, Tatiana said, \u201cWas there life before Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, what else do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho has seen your naked body? Other than your family. Other than when you were seven, doing your naked cartwheels.\u201d</p><p>Is this what he wanted? The complete truth? She had been so afraid to tell him. Would he want to hear it? \u201cShura, the first time any man saw me even partly naked was you in Luga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d He moved away a little to see her eyes.</p><p>She nodded, returning to rubbing her mouth against his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone touched you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouched me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelt your breasts, felt\u2014\u201d His fingers searched for her.</p><p>\u201cShura, please. Of course not.\u201d</p><p>Through his artery she felt his heart quicken its beat into her mouth. Tatiana smiled. She would tell it all to him right now, if that\u2019s what he wanted from her. \u201cDo you remember the woods in Luga?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I forget?\u201d he said huskily. \u201cIt was the sweetest kiss of my life.\u201d</p><p>Her lips in his neck, Tatiana whispered, \u201cAlexander . . . it was the first kiss of mine.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and then turned on his side, peering into her face in skeptical emotional disbelief, as if what she had been giving him were less than the total truth. Tatiana turned on her side to him. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing me. What now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I won\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d</p><p>His stupefied eyes unblinking, Alexander said shallowly, \u201cWhen I kissed you in Luga . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura . . .\u201d She pressed her body flush against his. \u201cWhat do you want? You want the truth from me or something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tatiana said, lying on her back and putting her hands under her head.</p><p>Alexander bent over her. \u201cI think you\u2019re just telling me that because you think it\u2019s what I want to hear,\u201d he said, running his fingers over her breasts and stomach. His hands on her were unremitting. They never stopped moving.</p><p>\u201cIs it what you want to hear?\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t reply at first. \u201cI don\u2019t know. No. Yes, God help me,\u201d he said with difficulty. \u201cBut I want the truth more.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana patted him cheerfully on the back. \u201cYou have the truth.\u201d And smiled. \u201cIn my whole life I have never been touched by anyone but you.\u201d</p><p>But Alexander wasn\u2019t smiling. His bronze eyes melting right in front of her, he asked haltingly, \u201cHow can that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how it can be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, walk straight from your mother\u2019s womb into my arms?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana laughed. \u201cVery nearly.\u201d She gazed into his face. \u201cAlexander, I love you,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you understand? I never wanted to kiss anyone before you. I wanted you to kiss me so much in Luga I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t know how to tell you. I stayed up half the night trying to figure out a way to get you to kiss me. Finally in the woods, I wasn\u2019t going to give up. If I can\u2019t get my Alexander to kiss me in the woods, I thought, I have no hope of ever being kissed by anyone.\u201d Her hands were on him.</p><p>His face was over hers. \u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d he whispered intensely. \u201cYou need to stop right now. What are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d Her fingertips pressed into his back.</p><p>When Alexander made love to her, his lips did not leave hers, and in his impassioned climax, which she barely heard through her shattering own, Tatiana was almost sure he groaned as if he were stopping himself from crying. He whispered into her mouth, \u201cI just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to survive you, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d Alexander murmured, his body over her, as she lay underneath him. \u201cOpen your eyes. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t speak. She was listening to the loving cadence of his voice.</p><p>\u201cTania . . .\u201d he whispered, his shimmering fingers circling her face, her throat, the top of her chest. \u201cYou have newborn skin,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cDo you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou have newborn skin and the sweetest breath, and your hair is silk upon your head.\u201d Kneeling over her, Alexander tenderly sucked her nipple. \u201cYou are divine through and through.\u201d</p><p>Listening, comforted, she held his head in her hands. He stopped talking and lifted his face to her. There were tears in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cPlease forgive me, Tatiana,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cfor hurting your perfect heart with my cold and indifferent face. My own heart was always overflowing with you, and it was never indifferent. You didn\u2019t deserve any of what you\u2019ve been given, of what you\u2019ve had to bear. None of it. Not from your sister, not from Leningrad, and certainly not from me. You don\u2019t even know what it took me not to look at you one last time before I closed the tarpaulin on that truck. I knew that if I did, it would all be over. I would not have been able to hide my face from you or from Dasha. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep my promise to you for your sister. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t look at you. I couldn\u2019t look at you. I gave you so much when we were alone. I hoped it would be enough to carry you forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, Shura,\u201d said Tatiana, with tears in her own eyes. \u201cI\u2019m here. And it will be enough in the future.\u201d She pressed his head to her chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ever doubted you. But now my heart is light.\u201d</p><p>Alexander kissed her between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou have fixed me.\u201d And Tatiana smiled.</p><p>Murmuring and whispering, Tatiana lay happily under Alexander, having been once again loved and relieved, and relieved . . . \u201cOh, and I thought I loved you before.\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed into her temple. \u201cThis does add a whole new dimension, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d His hands did not leave her body. Nothing of him left her body. He was holding her from underneath, still moving inside her.</p><p>Turning her face up to him, a smile coming to her lips, a smile of youth and ecstasy, Tatiana said, \u201cAlexander, you are my first love. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her bottom, pressed himself into her, licked the salt off her face, and nodded. \u201cThat I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatia, I knew it even before you yourself knew it.\u201d He grinned. \u201cBefore you finally found the word to describe to yourself what you were feeling, I knew it from the start. How else could you have been so shy and guileless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuileless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Alexander smiled. \u201cYour inability to look at me in public, yet your total devotion to my face when we were together \u2014 like now,\u201d he said, kissing her. \u201cYour embarrassment at the smallest things \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even keep my hand on you in the tram without you blushing . . . your fingers on me when I was telling you about America . . . your smile, your smile, Tania, when you ran to me from Kirov.\u201d Alexander shook his head at the memory. \u201cWhat a prison you have set up for me with your first love.\u201d</p><p>She put her arms tighter around him and said teasingly, \u201cOh, so the first love part you believe, but the first kiss part you have a problem with? What kind of girl do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nicest girl,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania . . .\u201d Alexander shook his head in smiling disbelief. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, her hands caressing his stomach. \u201cShura . . . am I wanting too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But you are going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana craved something, but she just couldn\u2019t find a way out of her timidity to ask him. Quietly, thoughtfully, she stroked his stomach and then cleared her throat. \u201cHoney? Can I lie on top of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Alexander smiled, opening his arms. \u201cCome and lie on top of me.\u201d</p><p>She lay down on him and softly, wetly kissed his lips. \u201cShura . . .\u201d she whispered, \u201cdo you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>Her lips were on his face, on his throat, on the top of his chest. She whispered, \u201cYou know what your skin feels like to me? The ice cream that I love. Creamy, smooth. Your whole body is the color of caramel, like my cr\u00e8me br?l\u00e9e, but you\u2019re not cold like ice cream, you\u2019re warm.\u201d She rubbed her lips back and forth against his chest.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 better than ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled, moving up to his lips. \u201cI love you better than ice cream.\u201d After kissing him deeply, she gently, gently sucked his tongue. \u201cDo you like that?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He groaned his assent.</p><p>\u201cShura, darling . . .\u201d she asked very shyly, \u201cis there . . . anywhere else you might like me to do that?\u201d</p><p>Pulling away, he gaped at her. Silent and tantalized, Tatiana watched his incredulous face.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Alexander said slowly, \u201cthere is a place where I might like you to do that, yes.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back, trying to hide her excitement. \u201cYou\u2019ll just \u2014 you\u2019ll just have to tell me what to do, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana kissed Alexander\u2019s chest, listened to his heart, moved lower, lay her head on his rippled stomach. Moving lower still, she brushed her blonde hair against him and then rubbed her breasts against him, feeling him already swollen underneath her. She kissed the arrow line of his black hair leading down from his navel and then grazed her lips against him.</p><p>Kneeling between Alexander\u2019s legs, Tatiana took hold of him with both hands. He was extraordinary. \u201cAnd now . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow put me in your mouth,\u201d he said, watching her.</p><p>Her breath leaving her body, she whispered, \u201cWhole?\u201d and took what she could of him into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMove up and down on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>There was a thickening pause. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s good, too.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana felt him hard against her fervent lips and rubbing fingers. When Alexander gripped her hair, she, stopping for a moment, looked into his face. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d she whispered, hungrily putting him deeper inside her mouth and moaning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing so well, Tatia,\u201d he whispered. \u201cKeep going, and don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>She stopped. He opened his eyes. Smiling, Tatiana said, \u201cI want to hear you groan for me not to stop.\u201d</p><p>Alexander sat up and kissed her wet mouth. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop.\u201d Then he gently pushed her face down on him, falling back on the blanket.</p><p>Right before the end he pulled her head away and said, \u201cTania, I\u2019m going to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo come,\u201d Tatiana whispered. \u201cCome in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Afterward, as she lay cradled in his chest, Alexander said, gazing at her in stark amazement, \u201cI\u2019ve decided that I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>For a long time she lay next to him, feeling his tender fingers feather her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did we spend two days fighting when we could have been doing this?\u201d</p><p>Alexander ruffled her hair. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t fighting, Tatiasha. That was foreplay.\u201d</p><p>They kissed each other. \u201cI\u2019m sorry again,\u201d Tatiana whispered.</p><p>\u201cMe, too, again,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>Then Tatiana fell quiet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>How does he know me so well? she thought. All I have to do is blink, and he knows I\u2019m thinking, or fretting, or anxious. She took a breath. \u201cShura . . . have you loved many girls before?\u201d she asked in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, my angel face,\u201d Alexander said passionately, caressing her. \u201cI have not loved many girls before.\u201d</p><p>Tears forming at the base of her throat, she asked, \u201cDid you love Dasha?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment. \u201cTania, don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>She was silent herself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what answer you want me to give you,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI\u2019ll give you whatever answer you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me only the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I did not love Dasha,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI cared for her. We had some good times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust all right,\u201d he repeated. He tweaked her nipple. \u201cHaven\u2019t you figured out yet,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cthat Dasha was not my type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you say about me to your next girl?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll say that you had perfect breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you had young, perky, incredible breasts with the biggest, most sensitive cherry nipples . . .\u201d he said, climbing on top of her and holding up her legs high against his arms. \u201cAnd lips for the gods, and eyes for kings. I will say,\u201d Alexander whispered hotly, pushing himself inside her and groaning, \u201cthat you felt like nothing else on this earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied sleepily. \u201cToward evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going back?\u201d said Alexander. \u201cWe\u2019re not moving from here.\u201d He paused. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to leave.\u201d</p><p>Before night set, they crept out of the tent, and Tatiana sat on a blanket with Alexander\u2019s uniform tunic around her shoulders while he built a fire with the twigs and dry branches she had found earlier. The fire was a raging blaze in five minutes.</p><p>\u201cYou build a good fire, Shura,\u201d Tatiana said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He pulled out two cans of tushonka, some dry bread and water.</p><p>\u201cLook what else I\u2019ve got.\u201d In a piece of aluminum foil he had a few squares of chocolate.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Tatiana mouthed, staring at him in wonder, not even looking at the chocolate.</p><p>They ate.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to sleep in the tent?\u201d Tatiana asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you want, I can build a fire in the house.\u201d He smiled. \u201cDo you see how I cleaned it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and when did you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday, after our fight. What do you think I did all afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter our fight?\u201d More surprised. \u201cBut before you came back and told me to give you your things so you could leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shoved him in the ribs. \u201cYou just wanted to hear me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d Alexander whispered. \u201cOr right here, right now, I\u2019ll have to make love to you again, and you won\u2019t live through it.\u201d</p><p>And she almost didn\u2019t.</p><p>In front of the fire, in his arms, Tatiana was crying against Alexander\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cTania, why are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Shura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I miss my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we treat her right, you think? Did we do right by her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did as well as we could. You did the best you could. What do you think, we asked for this? To break each other\u2019s hearts, to hurt other people, to fall in love like this? I struggled against my feelings. I wanted to love your sister, God bless her. I couldn\u2019t help that it was impossible.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from him, toward the fire and the Kama behind it and the full moon above it, Tatiana said, \u201cI tried not to love you for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Then tentatively, \u201cShura . . . are you . . . in love with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn to me,\u201d Alexander said. She turned. \u201cTatia, I worship you. I\u2019m crazy in love with you. I want you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Tatiana, will you marry me? Will you be my wife?\u201d Pause. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d Pause. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Alexander. I will marry you . . . I will be your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow why are you crying?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>8</p><p>The next morning at dawn Tatiana stumbled out to the water, barely able to walk.

I wash your arms and your legs and your love-giving heart and your life-giving belly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the soap,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI\u2019ll wash you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, how does it go?

Certainly not in Russian. Something about ten thousand falling at your right hand. I\u2019ve got to brush up on my Bible and tell it to you. I think you\u2019d like it. But you get my meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get your meaning,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI won\u2019t be afraid.\u201d She gazed at him. \u201cHow can I be afraid now?\u201d she whispered. \u201cLook what I\u2019ve been given. Give me the soap,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand up,\u201d Alexander muttered. \u201cI\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>Her hands with the soap moved lower. \u201cNot quite finished.\u201d</p><p>He fell backward in the water.</p><p>\u201cDone for, certainly,\u201d Tatiana said, falling on top of him. \u201cBut not finished.\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana was clinging to Alexander in the cold Kama, her feet not touching bottom, her arms wrapped around his neck. \u201cLook at the sunrise over the mountains. It\u2019s pretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she murmured. He was standing in the water.</p><p>She saw he was oblivious to the sunrise, holding her to him with one hand and stroking her face with the other. \u201cI found my true love on the banks of the river Kama,\u201d whispered Alexander, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cI found my true love on Ulitsa Saltykov-Schedrin, while I sat on a bench eating ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t find me. You weren\u2019t even looking for me.

How can we have such a connection? Right from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a closeness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We don\u2019t have a connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We have communion.\u201d</p><p>Alexander built a fire in the foggy cool morning on the shore of the quietly flowing river. They had some bread from his rucksack and some water. He smoked.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t really come prepared,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cWish we had a cup. A spoon. Some plates. Coffee.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cbut I brought everything I needed.\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t do it,\u201d he said, his hands on her. \u201cWe\u2019ll never leave here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we leaving here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get dressed.

She was not. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Alexander smiled. \u201cWant me to carry you for a bit?\u201d he asked huskily.</p><p>Her face melted. \u201cYes,\u201d Tatiana replied. \u201cBut this time in your arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday,\u201d Alexander said, lifting her, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to explain to me why you took bus Number 136 clear across Leningrad to the bus terminal.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana pinched him. \u201cSomeday,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to explain to me why you followed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d Tatiana asked in disbelief, getting down and walking beside him.</p><p>\u201cA church. We have to find one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>Alexander looked at her askance. \u201cWhere do you intend to get married?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana thought about it. \u201cLike everybody in the Soviet Union \u2014 at the registry office.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? Why don\u2019t we go back and continue as we were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an idea,\u201d Tatiana muttered. The mention of a church unsettled her.</p><p>Alexander took her hand and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy church, Shura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d said Alexander, looking at the road ahead, \u201cwho do you want this covenant of marriage to be made with? The Soviet Union? Or God?\u201d</p> <p>She had no answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you believe in, Tatiana?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cWell, I believe in God and you. We\u2019re getting married in a church.\u201d</p><p>They found a small Russian Orthodox church close to the center of town, St. Seraphim\u2019s. The priest inside studied them after Alexander told him what they wanted, and said, \u201cAnother war wedding. Hmm.\u201d He glanced at Tatiana. \u201cAre you even old enough to be a bride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eighteen tomorrow,\u201d she said, sounding about ten.</p><p>\u201cDo you have witnesses? Do you have rings? Did you register your marriage at the registry office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of the above,\u201d said Tatiana, pulling Alexander by the arm, but he freed himself from her hold and asked the priest where they could buy some rings.</p><p>\u201cBuy?\u201d the priest asked with surprise. His name was Father Mikhail. He was tall and bald, with penetrating blue eyes and a long gray beard. \u201cBuy rings? Well \u2014 nowhere, of course. We have a jeweler in town, but he has no gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the jeweler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, let me ask you, why do you want to get married in a church? Just go to the registry office. Like everybody. They\u2019ll give you a certificate in thirty seconds. I think you can use the court clerk as your witness.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stood still next to Alexander, who after taking a deep breath, said, \u201cWhere I come from, marriage is a public and sacred ceremony. We\u2019re only going to do this once, so we would like it done right.\u201d</p><p>We? thought Tatiana. She couldn\u2019t understand her misgivings.</p><p>Father Mikhail smiled. \u201cAll right, son,\u201d he said sincerely, \u201cI\u2019ll be glad to marry two young people starting out in life. Come back tomorrow with rings and witnesses. Come back at three. I\u2019ll marry you then.\u201d</p><p>As they descended the church steps, Tatiana said dismissively, \u201cOh, well. We don\u2019t have the rings.\u201d And breathed a small sigh of\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d said Alexander, producing four gold teeth out of his rucksack. \u201cThat should be enough for two rings.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stared dumbfounded at the teeth.</p><p>\u201cDasha gave them to me. Don\u2019t look so horrified.\u201d</p><p>But she was, she was horrified. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make ourselves rings out of the teeth Dasha stole from her dental patients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have another idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for what?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana had no answer to that. Wait for what indeed? With a heavy heart she followed Alexander down the street.</p><p>The jeweler lived in a small house in town and worked out of his home. He looked at the teeth, looked at Alexander and Tatiana, and told them he could make gold rings out of the teeth \u2014 for the price of two more gold teeth.</p><p>Alexander said he didn\u2019t have two more gold teeth, but he had a bottle of vodka. The jeweler, creaking refusal, returned the four teeth to Alexander, who sighed loudly and produced two more teeth out of his ruck.</p><p>Alexander asked if there was anywhere in Molotov they could buy some housewares.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll probably want gold teeth for a blanket, Shura,\u201d whispered Tatiana. The jeweler introduced them to his overlarge wife Sofia, who sold them two down quilts, pillows, and sheets all for 200 rubles.</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred rubles!\u201d exclaimed Tatiana. \u201cI made ten tanks and five thousand flamethrowers and I did not get as much as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cblew up ten tanks and used up five thousand flamethrowers and got two thousand rubles for that. Never think about the money. Just spend it on what you have to.\u201d</p><p>They also bought a pot, a pan, a kettle, some plates, utensils and cups, and a soccer ball. Alexander also managed to talk two metal buckets out of Sofia.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d Tatiana asked, looking at the two metal buckets \u2014 one that fit inside the other.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d He smiled. \u201cA surprise for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to carry all this back home?\u201d</p><p>Kissing her nose, Alexander said fondly, \u201cWhen you\u2019re with me, don\u2019t worry \u2014 I will take care of everything.\u201d</p><p>Sofia sold them two kilos of tobacco but couldn\u2019t help them with produce. She sent them to a stand where they picked up apples, tomatoes, and cucumbers, bread and butter, and with one of the tushonka cans they had a feast for lunch on a blanket in a secluded spot on the outskirts of town down by the Kama.</p><p>\u201cWhat amazes me,\u201d Tatiana said, breaking the bread, \u201cis that you gave me the Pushkin book for my birthday last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get the rubles in there?\u201d She poured Alexander a cupful of kvas, a beverage made from bread products.</p><p>\u201cI gave you the book with the money already there.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Alexander thoughtfully. \u201cReally?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you barely knew me. Why would you give me a book full of money?\u201d She wanted him to tell her about all the money she had found in that book. But he said nothing. Tatiana knew this about Alexander: unless he wanted to, he didn\u2019t speak about anything. Tatiana stared at him. She wanted him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d she said, glancing away.</p><p>Crawling over to her on the blanket, Alexander took the drink and the bread out of her hands and said, smiling, \u201cI\u2019ll teach you this, too: whenever you want something from me and are too shy to ask, blink three times quick.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>10</p><p>They had spent the night in his tent by the river. After swimming, they fell into unconscious sleep hours before the sun set at eleven and slept for fifteen hours straight.</p><p>In the late morning they left all their new purchases in the woods before going back into town to be married.</p><p>Tatiana put on her white dress with red roses. \u201cI told you I was too big for this dress now.\u201d She smiled at Alexander lying on the blanket watching her. She knelt, turning her back to him. \u201cCan you tie my straps, please? Just not tight. Not like before, on the bus.\u201d He wasn\u2019t budging behind her. She glanced at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, that dress on you,\u201d Alexander said, his fingers through the crisscross laces pressing on her bare back. He tied the straps for her, kissing her shoulder blades, telling her she looked so good the priest was going to want to marry her himself. She unbraided her hair and left it down, brushed behind her ears. Alexander put on his dress uniform and his cap. Saluting her, he asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Shyly she saluted him back. \u201cI think you\u2019re the most handsome man I ever saw.\u201d</p><p>Kissing her, his voice condensed with love, he said, \u201cAnd in two hours I\u2019m going to be the most handsome husband you ever saw. Happy birthday, my eighteen-year-old child bride.\u201d The joy was plain on his face.</p><p>Tatiana hugged him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re getting married on my birthday.\u201d</p><p>Alexander hugged her back. \u201cThis way you\u2019ll never forget me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, because that\u2019s likely,\u201d Tatiana said, groping for him gently. \u201cWho could ever forget you, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>The judge behind the small desk in one of the rooms at the registry office indifferently asked them if they were both of sound mind and were entering into this contract willingly, then shrugged and stamped their passports.</p><p>\u201cAnd you wanted to get married in front of him,\u201d Alexander whispered as they walked out.</p><p>Tatiana was quiet. She wasn\u2019t sure about the \u201csound mind\u201d part.</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now our domestic passports are stamped, \u2018Married, June 23, 1942.\u2019 Mine states your name. Yours states my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlexander, what about Dimi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said, putting two fingers against her lips. \u201cIs that what we\u2019re going to do? Let that bastard stop us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about him. Don\u2019t mention his name, understand?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana understood.</p><p>\u201cBut we have no witnesses,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go back and ask Naira Mikhailovna and the rest to stand as witnesses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs your intention to ruin this day completely, or is your intention to marry me?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>Putting his arm around her, Alexander said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll get us perfectly good witnesses.\u201d</p><p>Alexander offered the jeweler and his wife Sofia a bottle of vodka to come with them to the church for half an hour. The couple readily agreed, and Sofia even brought a camera as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cYou two are something,\u201d said Sofia as they walked down the street headed for St. Seraphim\u2019s. \u201cYou must really want to be married to go through all this trouble.\u201d She frowned at Tatiana, eyeing her suspiciously. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the family way, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d said Alexander unabashedly, pulling Tatiana away. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d He patted her stomach. \u201cThis will actually be our third child.\u201d He smiled broadly. \u201cBut the first one who\u2019s not a bastard.\u201d</p><p>They walked more quickly down the street, and Tatiana, red in the face, pulled out one of Alexander\u2019s forearm hairs. \u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cEmbarrass you every step of the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cTatia, because I don\u2019t want them to know anything about us. I don\u2019t want to give away a drop of you and me to anyone. Not to strangers, not to the old women you lived with. To nobody. This has nothing to do with them. Just you, me. And God,\u201d he added.</p><p>Tatiana stood by Alexander\u2019s side. The priest was not at the church yet. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming,\u201d she whispered, looking around. The jeweler and Sofia were standing at the back of the small church, close to the door, holding their bottle of vodka.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t one of us have to be baptized?\u201d Tatiana wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he replied. \u201cA Catholic, thanks to my thoughtful, once-Italian mother. And didn\u2019t I baptize you yesterday in the Kama?\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my good girl,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHang on. We\u2019re almost there.\u201d Alexander faced the altar, his gaze unwavering, his head strong, his mouth closed. He stood and waited.</p><p>Tatiana thought it was all a dream.</p><p>A nightmare from which she could not wake up. But not her nightmare. Dasha\u2019s.</p><p>How could Tatiana be marrying Dasha\u2019s Alexander? Just last week she could not have imagined a moment in her life when that would have been possible. She couldn\u2019t help it, she felt as if she were living a life that was not meant for her.</p><p>\u201cShura, some integrity I have,\u201d Tatiana said quietly. \u201cPined after my sister\u2019s lover long enough for her to die and for me to claim him as my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, what are you thinking? Where are you?\u201d he asked, puzzled, turning to her slightly. \u201cI was never Dasha\u2019s. I was always yours.\u201d He took her hand.</p><p>\u201cEven through the blockade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially then. What little I had was all for you. It was you who was everybody else\u2019s. But I was only yours.\u201d</p><p>Alexander and Tatiana had had an impossible love. Suddenly marriage. A proclamation to the world, a banner. They met, they fell in love, now they were getting married. As if it were always meant to be. As if betrayal, deceit, war, hunger, death \u2014 and not just death but the death of everyone else she had ever loved \u2014 had been their courtship.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s fragile resolve was weakening by the second.</p><p>There had been other lives and other people\u2019s hearts, deep and abiding hearts. There was her Pasha, losing his life before it even began, and Mama, trying so hard to keep going after the death of her favorite child. There was Papa, under a cloud of alcohol-fueled guilt no war could fix, and there was Marina, missing her own mother, missing her home, unable to find a small place for herself in their cramped rooms.</p><p>There was Babushka Maya, painting away her life, half hoping her first love would return. There was her Deda, dying away from his family, and Babushka, dying because there was no point in living through war without him.</p><p>And then there was Dasha.</p><p>If things were as they were supposed to be, why did Dasha\u2019s death feel so unnatural, why did it seem to break the order of things in the universe?</p><p>Was Alexander right and Tatiana wrong? Was she to blame, with her misplaced integrity, her inexplicable commitment to her sister? Should Tatiana have let Alexander say to Dasha, I like Tania best.</p><p>Should Tatiana have said to Dasha from day one, I want him for myself.</p><p>Would that have been the right thing, maybe?</p><p>To come out with the truth, instead of hiding behind her fear?</p><p>No, Tatiana thought, as they waited for the priest. No. He was too much for me then. I was jaw-droppingly smitten, like I was twelve. It was only right that Dasha should have him. On the surface she seemed right for him, not me.</p><p>I was right for kindergarten, for Comrade Perlodskaya, who used to kiss me every day and hold me in her lap. I was right for Deda, because when he said, Tania, you have to be this way, I said, yes, I will be this way.</p><p>\u201cSelfish!\u201d she exclaimed in the church. Alexander looked at her. Nodding, she repeated, \u201cSelfish, to the end. Dasha is dead, and I\u2019m stepping in. Gingerly, I step in, careful not to disturb Vova\u2019s crush on me, or Naira\u2019s illusions about me, or Dusia\u2019s and my churchgoing. I step in but say, wait, just make sure my love for you doesn\u2019t interfere with my sewing circle at three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana, I guarantee,\u201d Alexander said, the light in his eyes flickering off for a moment, \u201cyour love for me will interfere with everything.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him standing tall next to her. Tatiana was still jaw-droppingly smitten. Alexander was still too much for her. Now more than ever. \u201cShura,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, Tatia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this? Are you sure? You don\u2019t have to do this for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I do.\u201d He smiled, bending to her. \u201cAs a husband, I will have certain . . . inalienable rights that no one can assail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure of anything.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana knew: had Alexander told Dasha the truth from the beginning, he would have had to go his own way. He never then could have been part of Tatiana\u2019s life in the drab apartment with all those grand betrayals and hurts.</p><p>Tatiana would have lost him, and Dasha, too. She could not have continued to live with her sister, knowing that Dasha \u2014 with her breasts, her hair, her lips, and the fullness of her heart \u2014 was not enough for the man she loved. The chasm that cheap knowledge would have wreaked in Tatiana\u2019s family no bridge could have spanned, not even the bridge of sisterly affection.</p><p>No, Tatiana could not have claimed him for herself. She knew that.</p><p>But this was the thing: she didn\u2019t lay claim to Alexander. She was not reclaiming him now. She was not going to a warehouse of love and saying, I think he is mine, I\u2019ll take him. He\u2019ll do. Tatiana did not drive in her stake for the possession of his heart.</p><p>It was Alexander who came to her, while she was nothing but absorbed in her own small, lonely life, and showed her that larger than life was possible. Alexander was the one who crossed the street and said, I\u2019m yours.</p><p>Alexander was the one.</p><p>Glancing at him, Tatiana saw that he was waiting patiently, confident and whole and perfect. The sun filtered in through the church\u2019s stained glass windows. She breathed in the faint smell of long-gone incense. Dusia had introduced her to the church in Lazarevo, and every evening after dinner Tatiana went willingly, ready to pray as Dusia had taught her, ready to part with her crushing sadness and her crushing doubt.</p><p>When Tatiana had been a child in Luga, her beloved Deda, seeing her depressed one summer and unable to find her way, said to her, \u201cAsk yourself these three questions, Tatiana Metanova, and you will know who you are. Ask: what do you believe in? What do you hope for? But most important \u2014 ask: what do you love?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Alexander. \u201cWhat did you call it, Shura?\u201d she said quietly. \u201cOur first night, you said you and I had something, you called us . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe life force,\u201d he replied.</p><p>I know who I am, she thought, taking his hand and turning to the altar. I am Tatiana. And I believe in, and hope for, and love Alexander for life.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, children?\u201d Father Mikhail walked through the church. \u201cDid I keep you waiting?\u201d</p><p>He took his place in front of them at the altar. The jeweler and Sofia stood nearby. Tatiana thought they might have already finished that bottle of vodka.</p><p>Father Mikhail smiled. \u201cYour birthday today,\u201d he said to Tatiana. \u201cNice birthday present for you, no?\u201d</p><p>She pressed into Alexander.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I feel that my powers are limited by the absence of God in the lives of men during these trying times,\u201d Father Mikhail began. \u201cBut God is still present in my church, and I can see He is present in you. I am very glad you came to me, children. Your union is meant by God for your mutual joy, for the help and comfort you give one another in prosperity and adversity and, when it is God\u2019s will, for the procreation of children. I want to send you righteously on your way through life. Are you ready to commit yourselves to each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d they said.</p><p>\u201cThe bond and the covenant of marriage was established by God in creation. Christ himself adorned this manner of life by his first miracle at a wedding in Cana of Galilee. A marriage is a symbol of the mystery of the union between Christ and His Church. Do you understand that those whom God has joined together, no man can put asunder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d they said.</p><p>\u201cDo you have the rings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>Father Mikhail continued. \u201cMost gracious God,\u201d he said, holding the cross above their heads, \u201clook with favor upon this man and this woman living in a world for which Your Son gave His life. Make their life together a sign of Christ\u2019s love to this sinful and broken world. Defend this man and this woman from every enemy. Lead them into peace. Let their love for each other be a seal upon their hearts, a mantle upon their shoulders, and a crown upon their foreheads. Bless them in their work and in their friendship, in their sleeping and in their waking, in their joys and their sorrows, in their life and in their death.\u201d</p><p>Tears trickled down Tatiana\u2019s face. She hoped Alexander wouldn\u2019t notice. Father Mikhail certainly had.</p><p>Turning to Tatiana and taking her hands, Alexander smiled, beaming at her unrestrained happiness.</p><p>Outside, on the steps of the church, he lifted her off the ground and swung her around as they kissed ecstatically. The jeweler and Sofia clapped apathetically, already down the steps and on the street. \u201cDon\u2019t hug her so tight. You\u2019ll squeeze that child right out of her,\u201d said Sofia to Alexander as she turned around and lifted her clunky camera. \u201cOh, wait. Hold on. Let me take a picture of the newlyweds.\u201d</p><p>She clicked once.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>\u201cCome to me next week. Maybe I\u2019ll have some paper by then to develop them.\u201d She waved.</p><p>\u201cSo you still think the registry office judge should have married us?\u201d Alexander grinned. \u201cHe with his \u2018of sound mind\u2019 philosophy on marriage?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shook her head. \u201cYou were so right. This was perfect. How did you know this all along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you and I were brought together by God,\u201d Alexander replied. \u201cThis was our way of thanking Him.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana chuckled. \u201cDo you know it took us less time to get married than to make love the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch less,\u201d Alexander said, swinging her around in the air. \u201cBesides, getting married is the easy part. Just like making love. It was the getting you to make love to me that was hard. It was the getting you to marry me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was so nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. He still hadn\u2019t put her down. \u201cI thought the chances were twenty-eighty you were actually going to go through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty against?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot to have a little more faith, my husband,\u201d said Tatiana, kissing his lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>11</p><p>They walked back home down the forest road, carrying their purchases on their backs. Alexander carried nearly everything. Tatiana carried the two pillows.</p><p>\u201cWe should go to Naira Mikhailovna\u2019s,\u201d she remarked. \u201cThey must be out of their minds with worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go, thinking about other people,\u201d he said in a slightly irritated tone. \u201cPeople other than me. You want to go back to that house on our wedding day? On our wedding night?\u201d</p> <p>Alexander was right. Why did she always do that? What was she thinking? She didn\u2019t like making people feel bad, that was all. She told him that.</p><p>\u201cI know. But it\u2019s all right. You can\u2019t make everyone feel good. I tell you what. Start with me. Feed me. Nurture me. Love me. Then we\u2019ll move on to Naira Mikhailovna.\u201d She walked slowly alongside him. \u201cTatiasha, we\u2019ll go and see them tomorrow if you want. All right?\u201d said Alexander, sighing.</p><p>They arrived at their cabin in the clearing by six in the evening. There was a note on the door from Naira Mikhailovna that said, Tania, where are you? We\u2019re worried sick. N. M.</p><p>Alexander tore the note off the door.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we going in?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but . . .\u201d He smiled. \u201cJust a minute. I have to do something, and then we\u2019ll go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, and you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Alexander took the housewares, the pillows, and the heavy quilts and disappeared inside. While Tatiana waited for him, she made them sandwiches out of bread, butter, tushonka and cheese. He was still inside.</p><p>Tatiana began to glide around the clearing in small circles, dancing to a tune in her head. \u201cSomeday we\u2019ll meet in Lvov, my love and I.\u201d She saw her dress twirl up, and, smiling, she spun faster and faster with extravagant delight, watching the roses float into the air under her hands. When she looked up, Alexander was standing by the door of the cabin, his enraptured eyes all over her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cLook,\u201d she said, pointing. \u201cI made you a sandwich. Are you hungry?\u201d</p> <p>Alexander shook his head, walking to her. She ran to him and, throwing her arms around his neck, whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re married, Shura.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her into his arms, he carried her to the door. \u201cTania, in America we have a custom. The new husband carries his new wife over the threshold of their new home.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his cheek. He was more beautiful than the morning sun.</p><p>Alexander carried her into the house and kicked the door closed behind them. Inside was shadowy like a dream. They needed a kerosene lamp. Forgot to buy one. Tomorrow they\u2019d have to get one in Lazarevo.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she said, rubbing her cheek against his. \u201cI see you\u2019ve made the bed. Very thoughtful.\u201d His stubble was already growing in from this morning.</p><p>\u201cI do what I can.\u201d He carried her to the bed he had made for them above the stove, stepped onto the hearth, and set her down, opening her legs and standing between them, nuzzling his head in her chest. He lifted her dress.</p><p>All Tatiana wanted to do was watch him, but desire kept gluing her eyes shut. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to come up here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. \u201cLie back. Like this.\u201d Pulling off her panties, Alexander brought her hips to his face.</p> <p>For a moment all Tatiana heard was his rapid breathing. Reaching down, she touched his head. \u201cShura?\u201d His eyes on her, his hands on her, his breath on her were weakening her.</p><p>His fingers stroked her. \u201cAll this underneath your white dress with red roses . . .\u201d Alexander whispered. \u201cLook at you . . .\u201d He kissed her softly. \u201cTania, you are such a lovely girl.\u201d She felt his warm, wet lips on her. His hair and stubble rubbed against the insides of her thighs. It was too much. The burn and the melt were near-instant.</p><p>She was still quaking with aftershocks when Alexander climbed onto the bed, placing his soothing hand on her trembling lower stomach.</p><p>\u201cDear God, Alexander,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d Tatiana murmured, nudging him downward. \u201cPlease? . . . Again?\u201d She glanced at him and closed her eyes when she saw his grin. \u201cWhat?\u201d She smiled herself. \u201cUnlike you, I don\u2019t need a rest period.\u201d</p><p>Her hands clasped his head.</p><p>\u201cTatia . . . you\u2019re very blonde . . . have I mentioned how much I love that?\u201d</p><p>She moaned in a whisper; his mouth, his tongue felt so tenderly, exceedingly arousing. \u201cOh, Shura . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t ask for a moment, unable to stop her soft exultation. \u201cWhat did you think the first time you saw me in this dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I think?\u201d</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>\u201cI thought \u2014 Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Shura . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there is a God, I thought . . . Please someday let me make love to this girl while she wears that dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiasha . . . isn\u2019t it nice to know there is a God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, Shura, yes . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d she panted, lying on her side, her eyes half closed, her mouth dry, unable to get a decent breath out of her lungs, \u201cI need you this minute to tell me that you have shown me everything there is. Because I\u2019m just about done for.\u201d</p><p>Alexander smiled. \u201cCan I surprise you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Tell me there\u2019s nothing more.\u201d She saw the look in his eyes.</p><p>Flipping her onto her back, Alexander descended on top of her. \u201cNothing more?\u201d Hungrily kissing her, he parted her legs. \u201cI haven\u2019t even begun, do you understand?\u201d he whispered. \u201cI have been going easy on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been going easy on me?\u201d she repeated in disbelief, crying out as he entered her, clutching at him, moaning under his weight, her molten insides starting to burn again.</p><p>\u201cIs it too much? You\u2019re clutching me as if . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s too much . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania . . .\u201d Alexander\u2019s mouth was on her shoulders, on her neck, on her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s our wedding night. Watch out for me . . . there will be nothing left of you. Only the dress will remain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise, Shura?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Kneading her hand, touching her ring, Alexander said, \u201cIn America, when two people get married, they say their vows. Do you know what those are?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was hardly listening. She had been thinking of America. She wanted to ask Alexander if there were villages in America, villages with cabins on the banks of rivers. In America where there was no war, and no hunger, and no Dimitri.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening? The priest says, \u2018Do you, Alexander, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cLawfully bedded?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat too. No, lawfully wedded. And then we say our vows. Do you want me to tell you what they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat what are?\u201d Tatiana brought his fingers to her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou have to repeat after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepeat after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, Tatiana Metanova, take this man to be my husband\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, Tatiana Metanova, take this great man to be my husband.\u201d Kissing his thumb and forefinger and middle finger. He had wonderful fingers.</p><p>\u201cTo live together in the covenant of marriage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo live together in the covenant of marriage.\u201d Kissing his ring finger.</p><p>\u201cI will love him, comfort him, honor and keep him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will love him, comfort him, honor and keep him.\u201d Kissing the ring on his ring finger. Kissing his little finger.</p><p>\u201cAnd obey him.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana smiled, rolling her eyes. \u201cAnd obey him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, forsaking all others, be faithful to him until death do us part\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kissing the palm of his hand. Wiping tears from her face with the palm of his hand. \u201cAnd, forsaking all others, be faithful to him until death do us part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, Alexander Barrington, take this woman to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Shura.\u201d Sitting on top of him, rubbing her breasts into his chest.</p><p>\u201cTo live together in the covenant of marriage\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kissing the middle of his chest.</p><p>\u201cI will love her\u201d \u2014 his voice cracked\u2014\u201d love her, comfort her, honor, and keep her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Pressing her cheek to his chest and listening for the iambic rhyme of his heart.</p><p>\u201cAnd, forsaking all others, be faithful to her until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Shura.\u201d His chest wet from her tears. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>His hands above his head. \u201cThere are things worse than death.\u201d</p><p>Her heart full, overwhelmed. Remembering her mother\u2019s body tilted over her sewing. Remembering Marina\u2019s last words, to the end saying, I don\u2019t want to die . . . and not feel just once what you feel. Remembering a laughing Dasha braiding her young hair already a lifetime ago. \u201cOh, yes? Like what?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>She understood anyway. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a bad life in the Soviet Union than a good death. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was a life with you, then yes.\u201d</p><p>Nodding into his chest, Tatiana said, \u201cBesides, I haven\u2019t seen a good death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it. What did Dasha say to you before she died?\u201d</p><p>Pressing herself into him. Wanting to be inside him, wanting to touch his magnanimous heart. \u201cShe said I was a good sister.\u201d</p><p>Alexander\u2019s hands holding her head gently to him. \u201cYou were a very good sister. She left you well.\u201d Pausing. \u201cShe died a good death.\u201d</p><p>Kissing the skin over his heart. \u201cWhat will you say to me, Alexander Barrington, when you leave me alone in the world?\u201d Tatiana whispered. \u201cWhat will you say so I know, so I can hear it?\u201d</p><p>Alexander lay her down on the bed, leaning over her. \u201cTania,\u201d he whispered, \u201cthere is no death here in Lazarevo. No death, no war, no Communism. There is only you and only me, and only life.\u201d He smiled. \u201cMarried life. Let\u2019s go and live it.\u201d He jumped off the bed. \u201cCome outside with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPut on your dress.\u201d He threw on his army trousers. \u201cJust your dress.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and hopped down. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Every wedding day has to have dancing.\u201d</p><p>He took her out into the chilly clearing. Tatiana heard the rushing river, the crackling of pine, smelled pinecones. \u201cLook at that moon, Tatia . . .\u201d said Alexander, pointing into the distant valley between the Ural Mountains.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking,\u201d she said, her eyes on him. \u201cBut we have no music.\u201d She stood smiling in front of him, her hands in his hands.</p><p>Alexander pulled her to him. \u201cUnder a wedding moonrise, a dance with my wife in her wedding dress . . .\u201d</p><p>They waltzed in the clearing under a haloed rising round crimson moon.</p><p>He sang:</p><p>Oh, how we danced</p><p>On the night we were wed . . .</p><p>We found our true love</p><p>Though a word wasn\u2019t said . . .</p><p>He sang in English. Tatiana understood most of it. \u201cShura, darling,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have such a good voice. I know that song. In Russian we call it \u2018The Danube Waltz.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it better in English,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she said, pressed against his naked chest, looking up at him. \u201cYou have to teach me how to sing it, so I can sing it to you.\u201d</p><p>Taking her hand, he whispered, \u201cCome, Tatiasha.\u201d</p><p>They did not sleep that night. Their sandwiches lay untouched on the ground by the trees where she had sat and made them.</p><p>Alexander.</p><p>Alexander.</p><p>Alexander.</p><p>Her dacha years, her boat, her Lake Ilmen, on which she once was queen, fell forever away into the cleft of vanished childhood as Tatiana in tremulous awe surrendered herself to Alexander, who, by turns voracious and tender, lavished her starving flesh with miracles she had not dreamed of . . . as if pervaded with his deathless leaven . . . All earthly stuff \u2014 emotions, anguish, passion \u2014 had been transmuted to the stuff of heaven. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>12</p><p>In the groggy early morning Tatiana sat on the blanket in front of a blue crystal river, cradling Alexander\u2019s head in her hands. \u201cHoney,\u201d she whispered, \u201cwant to go swimming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d replied Alexander, his head in her lap, \u201cif only I could move my body.\u201d</p><p>After they slept for a few hours and swam for a few hours, they got dressed and went to Naira\u2019s house. The women were inside on the porch, drinking tea and clucking.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re talking about us,\u201d Tatiana said to him, taking one step away as they walked.</p><p>\u201cWait till we give them something to really gossip about,\u201d Alexander said, nudging her forward and grabbing her bottom.</p><p>The women were upset with Tatiana. Dusia cried and prayed. Raisa shook even more than usual. Naira stared at Alexander reprovingly. Axinya twitched with excitement, as if unable to wait until she could tell her friends later in the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been? We didn\u2019t know what happened to you. We thought you had been killed,\u201d said Naira.</p><p>\u201cTania, tell them. Have you been killed?\u201d Alexander said, trying not to smile.</p> <p>The women \u2014 including Tatiana \u2014 all glared at Alexander, who saluted them and went outside to shave. Tatiana thought he must have looked like a pirate with his black stubble. What to do? To pretend? To own up? The explanations, though. Was it something she could stand? Could she explain to these well-meaning women the workings of her life? They believed their world with her to be one thing, and now she was about to tell them it was something else. Just a few days ago they were aflutter over Alexander\u2019s traveling 1,600 kilometers to marry his fianc\u00e9e, supposedly heartbroken, and suddenly this. It didn\u2019t look very good for her, nor for him.</p><p>\u201cTatiana, will you tell us please where you were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere, Naira Mikhailovna. We went to Molotov. We bought a few things, some food, some . . . We . . .\u201d</p><p>What was she going to say?</p><p>\u201cWhere did you sleep? You\u2019ve been gone for three days! We honestly didn\u2019t know what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander walked up the stairs, onto the porch, and said without ceremony, \u201cDid you tell them we got married?\u201d</p> <p>Most of the oxygen on the porch was sucked into the lungs of the four old women who collectively went, \u201cAahhhhhh!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana rubbed her eyes, shaking her head. Leave it to him. She sat down on a chair by the sofa and sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starved,\u201d he said, walking into the parlor room. \u201cTatia, is there anything to eat?\u201d He came out chewing a hunk of bread. He sat down next to Dusia on the sofa, put his arm around her, and said, \u201cLadies, you love newlyweds in small villages, don\u2019t you? Maybe we could have a little party.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>Losing her composure, Naira said tersely, \u201cAlexander, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but we are upset. Saddened and upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried!\u201d exclaimed Axinya.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, married?\u201d cried Dusia, crossing herself. \u201cNot my Tanechka. My Tanechka is pure\u2014\u201d</p><p>Coughing loudly, Alexander got up. \u201cTania? Please, let\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, wait.\u201d</p> <p>He sat back down.</p><p>Dusia said, \u201cTatiana Georgievna, tell me it isn\u2019t true. Tell me he is just kidding. Just playing jokes on us, trying to get four old women older before their time.\u201d</p><p>Naira Mikhailovna said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he is kidding, Dusia.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana, shaking her head at Alexander, said, \u201cDusia, please don\u2019t be upset\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Alexander interrupted, turning to Dusia sitting next to him. \u201cWhy should you be upset? We\u2019re married, Dusia. It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d she cried. \u201cTania, what about God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your sister?\u201d asked Naira sternly.</p><p>\u201cWhat about decorum, propriety?\u201d asked Axinya in a thrilled voice, as if decorum and propriety were the two last things she wanted here in Lazarevo.</p><p>Raisa shook. \u201cTania, your sister\u2019s memory is not yet cold.\u201d</p><p>Naira said sharply, \u201cAlexander, we thought you had come to marry Dasha, God rest her soul.\u201d</p><p>One glance at Alexander told Tatiana that he was losing his patience. Hurriedly she said, \u201cLook, look, let me explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>But it was too late. Alexander got up and said, \u201cNo. Let me explain. I came to Lazarevo for Tatiana. I came to marry her. We\u2019re done here. Tania, let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll take your trunk. We\u2019ll come back for the sewing machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake her trunk? No, she is not leaving here!\u201d cried Naira.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d Alexander said, his arm around Tatiana\u2019s neck, \u201cwe\u2019re newlyweds.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cDo you really want us in your house?\u201d</p><p>Naira gasped. Dusia crossed herself. Raisa shook, and Axinya clapped her hands once in glee.</p><p>Tatiana squeezed Alexander\u2019s arm. \u201cShh,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease. Go outside. Let me talk to them for a second. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will. Go outside.\u201d</p><p>Naira said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you have to go. You can have my bedroom. I will sleep on the stove.\u201d</p><p>Before Tatiana could stop him, Alexander leaned forward and said, \u201cNaira Mikhailovna, trust me, you don\u2019t want us in your house \u2014 Ouch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander! Go outside. Please,\u201d Tatiana said, rubbing his arm where she had pinched him.</p><p>Turning back to Naira, Tatiana sat down. \u201cLook, it will be better for us in the cabin.\u201d She wanted to say \u201cmore private\u201d but she knew they wouldn\u2019t understand. \u201cIf you need anything, let us know. Alexander wants to come over and fix your fence. If you want us to come for dinner, let us know, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanechka, we are so worried about you,\u201d said Naira. \u201cYou, of all people, with a soldier!\u201d</p><p>Dusia muttered Christ\u2019s name.</p><p>Naira continued. \u201cI just don\u2019t know about him. We would have thought you\u2019d want someone a little more like yourself. More your match.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Axinya said, \u201cI\u2019m beginning to suspect that\u2019s exactly what she got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI\u2019m safe with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we want you to come for dinner,\u201d said Naira. \u201cWe love you.\u201d</p><p>Dusia said, \u201cGod spare you from the horrors of the marriage bed.\u201d</p><p>Keeping her face straight and glancing outside at Alexander, Tatiana said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Outside, Alexander was doubled over.</p><p>He was carrying her big heavy trunk, so he was fairly helpless, which was the way she liked it, because she was yelling at him. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you let me handle things my own way, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your own way would entail milking a cow for hours and washing their clothes and then sewing them all new ones and God knows what else!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cI would\u2019ve thought after we got married you would calm down a bit, be less protective, less . . . you know. You. That American way that makes you stand out like a black peg among white nails.\u201d</p><p>Alexander laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand anything,\u201d he said, panting a bit. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo shatter your illusions, I\u2019ll warn you right now that everything you\u2019ve seen will increase a hundredfold now that you\u2019re my wife. Everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Protectiveness. Possessiveness. Jealousy. All of it. A hundredfold. That\u2019s the nature of the beast. Didn\u2019t want to tell you beforehand, thought it might scare you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are. You can\u2019t get the marriage annulled.\u201d Alexander glanced at her, his eyes burning. \u201cNot after it\u2019s been so . . . thoroughly consummated.\u201d</p><p>They couldn\u2019t even wait to get home. He carried the trunk into the pines and sat down on it. Tatiana climbed on top of him. \u201cDon\u2019t be too loud in the woods,\u201d he told her, lifting her onto himself and kissing her.</p><p>Afterward Alexander said, \u201cThat\u2019s like asking you to shed your freckles for a day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The four women came to see them at the house later in the afternoon. Alexander and Tatiana were playing soccer. Actually Tatiana had just gotten the ball away from him and, squealing, was trying to hold on to it, while he was behind her, trying to kick it from under her. He had lifted her off the ground and was pressing himself hard into her while she was shrieking. All he was wearing was his skivvies, and all she was wearing was his ribbed top and her underwear.</p><p>Flummoxed, Tatiana stood in front of Alexander, trying to shield his near-naked body from four pairs of wide eyes. He stood behind her, his arms on her shoulders, and Tatiana heard him say, \u201cTell them \u2014 No, forget it, I will,\u201d and before she could utter a sound, he came forward, walked up to them, twice their size, bare and unrelentingly himself, and said, \u201cLadies, in the future you might want to wait for us to come and see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d Tatiana muttered, \u201cgo and get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoccer is probably the least of what you\u2019ll see,\u201d Alexander said into the women\u2019s stunned faces before going inside the house. When he came back out, suitably covered, he told Tatiana he was going to the village to get a couple of things they needed, like ice and an ax.</p><p>\u201cWhat an odd combination,\u201d she remarked. \u201cWhere are you going to get ice from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fish plant. They have to refrigerate their fish, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAx?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom that nice man Igor,\u201d Alexander yelled, walking up the clearing, blowing her a kiss.</p><p>She gazed after him. \u201cHurry back,\u201d she called.</p><p>Naira Mikhailovna apologized hastily. Dusia was mouthing a prayer. Raisa shook. Axinya beamed at Tatiana, who invited them all for a bit of kvas. \u201cCome inside. See how nicely Alexander cleaned the house. And look, he repaired the door. Remember, the top hinge was broken?\u201d</p><p>The four women looked around for a place to sit.</p><p>\u201cTanechka,\u201d said Naira nervously, \u201cthere is no furniture in here.\u201d</p><p>Axinya whooped.</p><p>Dusia crossed herself.</p><p>\u201cI know, Naira Mikhailovna. We don\u2019t need much.\u201d She looked down on the floor. \u201cWe have some things, we have my trunk. Alexander said he will make us a bench. I\u2019ll bring my desk with the sewing machine . . . we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Naira,\u201d said Axinya, \u201cleave the girl alone, will you?\u201d</p><p>Dusia glared at the rumpled bedsheets on top of the stove. A flustered Tatiana smiled. Alexander was right. It was better to go and visit them. She asked when would be a good time to come for dinner.</p><p>Naira said, \u201cCome tonight, of course. We\u2019ll celebrate. But you come every night. Look, you won\u2019t be able to eat here at all. There\u2019s nowhere even to sit or cook. You\u2019ll starve. Come every night. That\u2019s not too much to ask, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s too much to ask,\u201d Alexander said when he returned with no ice (\u201cTomorrow\u201d) but with an ax, a hammer and nails, a saw, a wood plane, and a kerosene-burning Primus stove. \u201cI didn\u2019t marry you so we could go over there every night.\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou invited them inside? That\u2019s very brave of you, my wife. Did you at least make the bed before they came in?\u201d He laughed harder.</p><p>Tatiana was sitting down on the cool iron hearth, shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019re just impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impossible? I\u2019m not going there for dinner, forget it. Why don\u2019t you just invite them here afterward then, for the post-dinner vaudeville\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaudeville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d He dropped all of his goods on the floor in the corner of the cabin. \u201cInvite them here for the entertainment hour. Go ahead. As I make love to you, they can walk around the hearth, clucking to their hearts\u2019 content. Naira will say, \u2018Tsk, tsk, tsk. I told her to go with my Vova. I know he could do it better.\u2019 Raisa will want to say, \u2018Oh, my, oh, my,\u2019 but she\u2019ll be shaking too much. Dusia will say, \u2018Oh, dear Jesus, I prayed to You to spare her from the horrors of the marriage bed!\u2019 And Axinya will say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Wait till I tell the whole village about his horrors,\u2019 \u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>Alexander laughed and then went to the water to swim.</p><p>Tatiana nested inside the cabin, arranging their things, neatening up, and making the bed. She got herself ready to go to Naira\u2019s and was sitting by the iron hearth waiting for the water to boil on the little Primus stove so she could make some tea when Alexander came back inside. He took off his wet shorts and came close to her. She glanced up, her heart giving out at the sight of him. He nudged her with his leg. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, quickly turning her gaze back to the kettle. But he nudged her again, and she wanted to look at him so much.</p><p>Wanted to taste him so much.</p><p>Overcoming her shyness, Tatiana knelt on the wide-plank wood floor in front of Alexander, taking him into her tender hands. \u201cAre all men this beautiful,\u201d she whispered fondly, \u201cor just you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just me,\u201d replied a grinning Alexander. \u201cAll other men are repellent.\u201d He lifted her off the floor. \u201cToo hard on your knees on the wood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn America do they have carpets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWall to wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me a pillow, Shura,\u201d whispered Tatiana.</p><p>They went over to Naira\u2019s for dinner. Tatiana cooked while Alexander fixed the broken fence. Vova and Zoe came, too, ostensibly confounded by the twisted hand of fate that had allowed their little, unassuming, innocent Tania to be married to a soldier in the Red Army.</p><p>Tatiana saw that everyone was watching her and Alexander\u2019s every move and interaction. So when she served Alexander and stood close against him as he looked up at her, she could not look down at him, her body throbbing with remembrance. She was afraid that every person at the table would know instantly what she was remembering.</p><p>After dinner Alexander didn\u2019t ask anyone to help her. He helped her himself, and when they were outside, bent over the dishpan, he turned her chin to him and said, \u201cTatia, don\u2019t turn your face away from me again. Because now you\u2019re mine, and every time I look at you, I need to see you\u2019re mine in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana gazed at him, adoring him.</p><p>\u201cThere I am,\u201d he whispered, kissing her, their hands entwined in the warm, soapy water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>13</p><p>The following tranquil afternoon a barebacked and barefooted Alexander was crouching and fiddling with two metal bowls while Tatiana danced in little steps behind him, jumping up and down and asking him what he was doing. It occurred to her that she didn\u2019t like surprises. She liked to know things up front. Finally he had to get up, take her by the shoulders, and lead her away, asking her to go and cook something, read, practice her English \u2014 something, anything other than bother him for the next twenty minutes.</p><p>Tatiana could not. She stopped jumping but tiptoed near him, bending over his back to see.</p><p>Alexander put milk, heavy cream, sugar and eggs into the smaller metal bowl and mixed the ingredients briskly.</p> <p>She lifted her shirt and rubbed her breasts against his bare back.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I need right now, though, is a cup of blueberries.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana got those for him, glad to help. After filling the large bowl with ice and rock salt, Alexander put the small metal bowl inside the large metal bowl and with a long wooden spoon started stirring the milk and sugar mixture.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? When will you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery soon you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow soon? Just tell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible. You\u2019ll know in thirty minutes. Can you wait thirty minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes? What are we going to do for thirty minutes?\u201d She was bouncing up and down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too much.\u201d He laughed. \u201cLook, I have to mix this. Come back in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana walked around the clearing in circles, watching him.</p><p>She was deliriously happy. She was speechlessly, wordlessly, infinitely happy.</p> <p>\u201cShura, are you watching? Look!\u201d She cartwheeled and then balanced herself upside down on one hand.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweet girl,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m watching.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later Alexander called her over.</p><p>Tatiana skipped up and looked at the thick, blue-colored mixture in the bowl. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He handed her a spoon. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>She tasted it. \u201cIce cream?\u201d she said incredulously.</p><p>He nodded with a grin. \u201cIce cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me ice cream?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Happy birthday.\u201d Pause. \u201cNow, why are you crying? Eat. It\u2019ll melt.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana sat on the ground with the bowl between her legs and ate her ice cream and cried. Alexander opened his hands with perplexed incomprehension and went to wash.</p><p>\u201cI saved you some ice cream. Have some,\u201d Tatiana said tearfully when he returned.</p><p>\u201cNo, have it all,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much for me. I had half of it. Have the rest. Otherwise what are we going to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d Alexander said, kneeling by her, \u201cthat I\u2019d like to undress you, spread the ice cream all over your body, and lick it off you.\u201d</p><p>Dropping the spoon, Tatiana said hoarsely, \u201cSounds like a waste of perfectly good ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Though she didn\u2019t think so when he was done with her.</p><p>Afterward they swam, and then he sat and smoked. \u201cTatia, show me your naked cartwheels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, here? No, this isn\u2019t a good place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not here, where? Go on, right into the river.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stood up, smiling and sparkling naked, lifted her arms, and said, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d And then catapulted herself upside down in jubilant rainbow somersaults one two three four five six seven times into the Kama.</p><p>\u201cHow was that?\u201d she called to him from the water.</p><p>\u201cSpectacular,\u201d he replied, sitting on the ground, smoking and watching her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>14</p><p>Even without his watch, Alexander, still on military time, woke first in the early blue morning and went to wash and smoke, while Tatiana sleepily waited for him, curled into a ball like a warm bun, as if she had just come out of the oven. When he jumped into bed, he immediately pressed his ice-cold body into her. She yelped and futilely tried to get away. \u201cPlease, no! That\u2019s just merciless. I hope they fine you for that in the army. I bet you never did that to Marazov twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re right,\u201d he replied, \u201cBut I don\u2019t have inalienable rights to Marazov. You\u2019re my wife.

Until you\u2019ve warmed me from the inside out and the outside in.\u201d</p><p>After they made love, Tatiana made Alexander breakfast. Twelve potato pancakes, and then she sat on the blanket next to him in the crisp sunrise, every glittering day warmer than before. Alexander ate ravenously. She watched him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re always so hungry. How did you survive last winter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I survive last winter?\u201d</p> <p>She gave him the rest of her own pancakes. He protested, but not for long when she scooted closer to him, a breath away, and fed him herself, unable to look away from his face. She felt melted before him.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Tatia?\u201d Alexander asked softly, taking the last bite from the fork in her hands. He smiled. \u201cDid I do something you liked?\u201d</p><p>Blushing and shaking her head once, she emitted a small excited sound and kissed him on his unshaven cheek. \u201cCome on, husband,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s go and shave you.\u201d</p><p>While she was shaving him, she said, \u201cDid I tell you that Axinya offered to fire up the banya tomorrow morning if we want to have a hot bath, and to stand guard by the door to make sure no one comes in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. You told me,\u201d Alexander replied. \u201cI like that Axinya, but you know she\u2019ll be standing at the door to hear us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be quieter, then, won\u2019t you?\u201d Tatiana said, wiping the soap off his smooth cheek.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to be quieter?\u201d</p><p>She blushed, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do today?\u201d Tatiana asked as she finished the other cheek and dried his face. \u201cWe should go pick some blueberries later, so I can make blueberry pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should. But first I\u2019m going to drag that log into the water so we can have a place to sit and brush our teeth, and then I\u2019m going to build us a table to clean our fish,\u201d Alexander replied. \u201cYou will go to your damn sewing circle. To your women. I won\u2019t be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a couple of hours,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour job is to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have only one job here in Lazarevo,\u201d Alexander said, catching her around the waist. \u201cTo make love to my nubile wife.\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana almost moaned out loud. \u201cI see a lot of talking and not a lot of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is my English?\u201d Tatiana asked Alexander in English.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Alexander replied in English. It was late morning. They were walking through the dense deciduous riverbank woods a few kilometers from home, with two buckets for blueberries, and they were supposed to be talking only in English, but Tatiana backtracked and said in Russian, \u201cI\u2019m reading much better than I\u2019m talking, I think. John Stuart Mill is simply unreadable now instead of unintelligible.\u201d</p><p>Alexander smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s a fine distinction.\u201d He yanked up a couple of mushrooms. \u201cTania, can we eat these?\u201d</p><p>Taking them out of his hands and throwing them back on the ground, Tatiana said, \u201cYes. But we will only be able to eat them once.\u201d</p><p>Alexander laughed. She said, \u201cI have to teach you how to pick mushrooms, Shura. You can\u2019t just rip them out of the ground like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to teach you how to speak English, Tania,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>In English, Tatiana continued, \u201cThis is my new husband, Alexander Barrington.\u201d</p><p>And in English, Alexander replied with a smile of pleasure on his face, \u201cAnd this is my young wife, Tatiana Metanova.\u201d He kissed the top of her braided head and in Russian said, \u201cTatiana, now say the other words I taught you.\u201d</p><p>She turned the color of a tomato. \u201cNo,\u201d she stated firmly, in English. \u201cI am not saying them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Look for blueberries.\u201d Still in English.</p><p>She saw that Alexander couldn\u2019t have been less interested in blueberries. \u201cWhat about later? Will you say them later?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot now, not later,\u201d Tatiana replied bravely. But she was not looking at him.</p><p>Alexander drew her to him. \u201cLater,\u201d he continued in English, \u201cI will insist that you please me by using your English-speaking tongue in bed with me.\u201d</p><p>Struggling slightly against him, Tatiana said in English, \u201cIt is good I am not understand what you say to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will show you what I mean,\u201d said Alexander, putting down his bucket.</p><p>\u201cLater, later,\u201d she acquiesced. \u201cNow, pick up your backet. Collect blueberries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said in English, not letting go of her. \u201cAnd it\u2019s bucket. Come on, Tania. Say the other words.\u201d He held her. \u201cYour shyness is an aphrodisiac to me. Say them.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana, breathless inside and out, said, \u201cAll right,\u201d in English. \u201cPick up your bucket. Let us go house. I will practice love with you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander laughed. \u201cMake love to you, Tania. Make love to you.\u201d</p><p>It was a dazzling and peaceful summer afternoon. Alexander was sawing a tree into short logs. Tatiana was by his side.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She was nudging him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re like my tiny shadow. Let me finish. I have to make a bench so we can sit and eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to play something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve got to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can play Alexander Says.\u201d She smiled invitingly.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about war-hide-and-seek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Afraid of losing again, Captain?\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cOh, you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to . . . cavort?\u201d</p><p>Alexander glanced at her. She blushed and said, \u201cI meant really cavort. Frolic in the water. I want to stand in the palm of your hand and have you lift me above your head\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I can fling you after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard it called that before, but all right, you got yourself a game.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, not letting go of the saw, Alexander said, \u201cWe will do all that and twice, but first I have to finish sawing this damn wood.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was silent a second. \u201cDo you want to show me how you do your military push-ups?\u201d She paused. \u201cFifty in a row?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you give me an incentive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too much. Later.\u201d</p><p>She was silent another second. \u201cDo you want to arm wrestle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArm wrestle?\u201d Alexander said with a disbelieving grin. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, big man, what are you, afraid?\u201d She tickled him.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana tickled him again, croaking like a chicken. \u201cCroak, croak, croak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He put down his saw, but she was already halfway across the clearing, running away and shrieking. He ran after her, yelling, \u201cYou better not let me catch you!\u201d</p><p>She let him catch her with joy in the woods. Whirling her to him and panting, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to tickle me when I have a saw in my hand!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was laughing. \u201cBut, Shura, you always have something in your hand. If it\u2019s not a saw, it\u2019s a cigarette, or an ax, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her bottom.</p><p>\u201cYes, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her breasts.</p><p>\u201cDo you see what I mean?\u201d she said, panting herself. \u201cSo wrestle me to the ground.\u201d She paused. \u201cLike you want.\u201d She couldn\u2019t get her breath back as he hugged her. Either he didn\u2019t know his own strength or he was afraid of not being able to hold her close enough. Tatiana hoped it was the first one. \u201cI\u2019m here, Shura, I\u2019m here,\u201d she panted, gently patting him. \u201cCome on now.\u201d</p><p>He let her go, and she stood in front of him for a moment.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Alexander grinned. \u201cYou got me away from my work, now what? Push-ups now, cavort now, what now?\u201d</p><p>They stood without moving. Tatiana\u2019s eyes twinkled. Alexander\u2019s eyes twinkled. She moved left, right\u2014</p><p>But he was quicker this time. \u201cGot to be quicker than that,\u201d he said, grabbing her and then setting her back down. \u201cTry again?\u201d</p><p>She moved right, right, left\u2014</p><p>Still not quick enough. \u201cTry again?\u201d</p><p>Motionlessly she stood, stood, lunged left, and was around him on the right before he even straightened up.</p><p>Squealing, Tatiana jumped into his arms as he ran for her, and then hugging him and kissing his face, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s do this. Let me blindfold you. I\u2019ll spin you around, and then you have to stumble around the clearing and find me.\u201d She giggled. \u201cStop tickling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of you blindfolding me,\u201d Alexander replied, continuing to tickle her. \u201cHow about instead if I blindfold you and feed you and you tell me what I\u2019m putting in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was laughing even before he finished. Alexander looked at her innocently. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cHow about if even before you blindfold me, I tell you what you\u2019re going to put in my mouth?\u201d</p><p>Alexander laughed himself, carrying her to the house. \u201cYou have yourself a game,\u201d he said, \u201cBut only if you call what I\u2019m putting in your mouth by name \u2014 in English.\u201d He put his hands under her dress, caressing her.</p><p>\u201cShura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of me. I have to go and hide. You have to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I have to find you? You\u2019re already right here.\u201d He fondled her bottom.</p><p>\u201cShura, you\u2019re holding me too tight. I can\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t want you to go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of game is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same game we play all day long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up, make love. Wash, make love. Cook, eat, make love. Swim, make love. Play soccer, play dominoes, play blindfold, make love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but here we\u2019re going straight to making love.

Do you just refuse to learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man. I\u2019m physically unable to learn how to cook for myself,\u201d he said.

Can I look at you again?\u201d</p><p>With a twitch of the wooden spoon, Tatiana flicked a bit of batter into his face. \u201cHey!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWatch, I said.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head in disbelief, Alexander stuck his hand into the batter and threw a handful into Tatiana\u2019s face. \u201cWho do you think you\u2019re dealing with around here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she slowly replied, wiping the batter from her eyes and proceeding to stir. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you know who you\u2019re dealing with around here.\u201d Before he could move, Tatiana took the whole pot and poured it on him, then jumped up and ran outside.</p><p>When he caught her in the clearing, Alexander was dripping with batter. Hoisting her up, he rubbed his messy self all over her, into her, holding her mouth closed to stop her from laughing, but she wouldn\u2019t stop, feeling desperate delight and desire. Tatiana\u2019s whole body was shaking from laughter, and she could tell that it reminded her husband too much of her whole body shaking from pleasure, because he was already on to the next thing, but she was still laughing. Trembling, quickening, and sticky, their chests pressed together, they were poured like thick cream and warm sugar over one another, licking each other, stuck together and slippery, and afterward a panting and sated Alexander joyously asked, \u201cIf we don\u2019t cook the pancakes but eat the batter raw, does that still count as breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost sure of it,\u201d panted back Tatiana.</p><p>The sun was at full noon. Alexander was cleaning the trout at the small table he had built. He was using his army knife to scale the fish and cut off their heads. Tatiana stood by his side with a bag to catch the remnants and a pot of water to put the cleaned fish into. She was about to make fish soup with potatoes. They had only one sharp knife, and Alexander was very proficient with it. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t have to cook the food you catch, you\u2019ll never starve, will you, Shura?\u201d Tatiana said, watching him with admiration.</p><p>\u201cTania, if I had to, I would cook this fish on the fire that I build.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, you fish, you build fires, you make furniture, you fight, you log. Is there anything you can\u2019t do?\u201d Tatiana blushed even as she was saying it.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d Alexander leaned over and kissed her deeply, not stopping until she moaned into his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t be so delicious,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Clearing her throat, she murmured, \u201cI\u2019ve got to stop turning red.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t. And yes, there is one thing I can\u2019t do. Can\u2019t make pancakes.\u201d He smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cWhen are we going to go to Molotov to get our wedding pictures from the jeweler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to want our gold rings for those pictures, I know it.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana gazed at him, kissing his arm, pressing her face against him. \u201cDo we have enough kerosene for the Primus stove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I put the ukha on, can we leave it for a little while?\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cShura? . . . Dusia asked me to come and help her at the church.\u201d She looked at Alexander. \u201cPlease? I feel bad because I haven\u2019t been over there much\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re over there way too much.\u201d He stopped smiling.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was your shadow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept when you\u2019re over there way too much.\u201d Alexander sighed. \u201cWhat does she need this time?\u201d</p><p>Relieved, Tatiana said, \u201cOne of the windows fell out. She was wondering if you could fix it. It\u2019s her only stained glass window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so she needs me this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you. She says she\u2019ll give you some vodka for your trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her to leave you alone, and she\u2019s got herself a deal.\u201d</p><p>Leaving for a moment, Tatiana returned with a cigarette and a lighter. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you talk,\u201d Alexander said, opening his mouth. She watched him take a few puffs. Then, not knowing what to do with the cigarette, she smelled it, brought it to her mouth, took a drag, and immediately broke into a cough. Alexander motioned for the cigarette back, took three or four deep drags, and said, \u201cI\u2019m done. And don\u2019t put it in your mouth again. I hear you breathing in the night \u2014 your lungs are struggling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the TB,\u201d she said, stubbing out the cigarette. \u201cThat\u2019s you holding me.\u201d She looked away.</p><p>Glancing at her, Alexander said nothing.</p><p>At the church Tatiana helped Alexander hold the small stained glass window. She stood on a stepladder while he caulked the edge of the window with a gooey mixture of water, pulverized limestone, and clay. \u201cShura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a hypothetical question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would we have done if Dasha were still alive? Do you ever think about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana paused. \u201cWell, I do. Sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike when do you think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike now.\u201d</p><p>When he made no reply, Tatiana persisted. \u201cCan you think about it? What would we have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo.\u201d</p><p>Alexander sighed. \u201cWhy do you enjoy torturing yourself? Do you feel life has been too good to you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stared at him. \u201cLife has,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cbeen too good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold the window steady,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Dusia\u2019s only stained glass window. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll forgive even you for breaking it. Is it too heavy for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Here, let me come closer to the frame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute longer. I\u2019m almost done.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana moved on the ladder, lost her footing, and came toppling down, letting go of the glass, which fell out of the frame and was caught by Alexander, who grabbed it, laid it down, and went to help Tatiana off the ground. She was shaken but not hurt. She had a scrape on the back of her ankle. She was, however, frowning at her husband.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Alexander said. \u201cLike my reflexes? Dusia will now be praying for my life every day.\u201d He tried to dust Tatiana off but just made her messier. \u201cLook at my hands. I\u2019m going to cement myself to you if I\u2019m not careful.\u201d He smiled, kissing her collarbone.</p><p>Still Tatiana frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove your reflexes,\u201d she said. \u201cLightning quick. Good job. I just want to point out,\u201d she added, \u201cthat given the choice between the glass and your wife, you chose the glass, admirably quick though you were.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Alexander helped Tatiana back onto the ladder, standing behind her on the ground. He didn\u2019t touch her with his messy hands, but he softly bit her bottom through her dress. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose the glass,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were already on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see your legendary reflexes reach for me while I was being propelled downward like a rocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And what would have happened to you if that glass fell on top of you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have been very happy with me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very happy with you now,\u201d she said, but she was smiling, and he bit her bottom again and went to the window to finish caulking. Finally the glass was solidly back in. Dusia, who was inside the church, thanked Alexander up and down and even kissed him, telling him he was not a bad man.</p><p>Alexander bowed his head slightly, nodding at Tatiana. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana pulled him by his shirt. \u201cCome on, not-a-bad-man,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll wash you.\u201d They walked back home through the sap-smelling woods. At the house Tatiana went inside to get soap and towels.</p><p>\u201cTania, can you feed me first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, you can\u2019t eat covered in muck like you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know how the washing-me thing goes. I won\u2019t be eating for two hours, and I\u2019m starving now. Just put the soup in a bowl, take a spoon, and feed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you wouldn\u2019t take two hours . . .\u201d Tatiana muttered under her breath, the flame pit in her stomach opening up.</p><p>\u201cJust feed me, Tatia. Rail at me later.\u201d Alexander raised his brows, his eyes warming her like the fire. Her glad heart swelling, Tatiana obliged, and as she was feeding him, she resumed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my hypothetical question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlissfully, I forgot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Dasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d He chewed and swallowed a mouthful of potato and fish, and said in a serious tone, \u201cI think you know the answer to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You know if she were still alive, I would have had to marry her, as I had promised, and you would have had to go and have a bang with good old Vova.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shoved his leg. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about this if you\u2019re not going to be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good. Can I have some more soup?\u201d</p><p>After lunch, when they were in the water and he was scrubbing his hands while Tatiana was soaping his back, Alexander said, \u201cI could never have married Dasha if you were still alive. You know that. My truth would have had to come out here in Lazarevo. What about yours?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>They were sitting in the river near the shore. Alexander took the bottle of shampoo and turned Tatiana\u2019s back to him to lather her hair. Running his fingers through her soapy strands, he said, \u201cYou miss her.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI wonder what being here in Lazarevo would have been like had she lived.\u201d Leaning back into him, she said, \u201cI miss my family.\u201d She paused as her voice broke. \u201cLike you must have missed your mother and father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have time to miss them,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI was too busy saving my f*cking life.\u201d He tilted her head back to rinse her hair.</p><p>But Tatiana knew the truth. \u201cYou know, sometimes I get a funny feeling about Pasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat funny feeling?\u201d</p><p>She stood up and took the soap from him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. A train blew up, no bodies were retrieved. As if the not knowing for certain what had happened to him makes his death somehow less real.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, too, and led her deeper into the water. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you only believe it if you see the people you love die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI didn\u2019t see my mother die. I didn\u2019t see my father die. They\u2019re dead all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She soaped him comfortingly. \u201cBut Pasha is my twin. He is like half of me. If he is dead, what about me?\u201d She lathered her breasts and rubbed her hard, soapy nipples against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI can answer that. You\u2019re very much alive,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI tell you what: you want to play this hypothetical game? I\u2019ll play. I have a question for you,\u201d he said, taking the soap out of her hands and pitching it onto the shore. \u201cSay Dasha were still alive, and you and I had not yet married, but\u201d \u2014 Alexander stopped talking while he lifted Tatiana onto himself \u2014 \u201cbut I had made love to you standing\u201d \u2014 he paused between breaths \u2014 \u201clike this\u2014\u201d They both groaned. \u201cHere, in our Kama River . . . tell me, oh, my very alive wife, what would you have done? Would you have let me go then, knowing\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cried out.</p><p>\u201c \u2014 this?\u201d whispered Alexander.</p><p>As if Tatiana could answer. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play this game anymore,\u201d she moaned, wrapping her legs loosely around his waist and her arms tightly around his neck.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Afterward Tatiana sat collapsed in the shallow water against a boulder jutting out of the river, and Alexander lay before her, the back of his head against her chest. They were murmuring and looking out onto the Kama and the mountains when Tatiana noticed that Alexander had become quieter. He had fallen asleep, his legs stretched out in the gentle lap of the river, his bare upper body pressed against her. Smiling and holding him to her, Tatiana softly kissed his sleeping head, leaving her lips in his wet hair.</p><p>Blinking, blinking, she sat for a long time not moving, until at last she soaked in a breath, an afternoon breath of sap and fresh water and cherry blossoms nearby. Wet grass, old leaves, sand, earth, Alexander, and she whispered, \u201cOnce upon a time there lived a man, a shining prince among peasants, who was worshipped by a frail maiden. The maiden escaped into the land of lilacs and milk and waited impatiently for her prince, who came and handed her the sun. They had nothing to run to and everything to run from; they had no refuge and no salvation; they had nothing but their tiny kingdom, in which lived but two people \u2014 the master, the mistress, and two slaves.\u201d Pausing for breath, Tatiana squeezed Alexander. \u201cEach glorious day was a miracle from God. And they knew it. Then the prince had to leave, but that was all right because the maiden\u2014\u201d Tatiana stopped. She thought she heard him hold his breath. \u201cShura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m very interested in what happens next. Why was it all right? What was the maiden going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was I doing so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad. My favorite part was something about a master . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI reserve final judgment till the end.\u201d Alexander rubbed the back of his head against her chest. \u201cTell me why it was all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all right,\u201d Tatiana continued, trying to think quickly, \u201cbecause the maiden patiently waited for him to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is a fairy tale. And?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an and after that? And . . . they lived happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>After the longest mute minute Alexander asked, \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stared at the Ural Mountains and made no reply.</p><p>Grunting, Alexander got up and turned to her. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a bad story, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t bad? Why don\u2019t you try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much for making up stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you prefer to blow things up. Go ahead, try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Sitting with his legs crossed, he splashed water on his face, splashed water at her, and began. \u201cLet\u2019s see . . . Once upon a time there lived a fair maiden\u2014\u201d He looked at her. \u201cA maiden like no other. And one renegade mercenary knight had the fortune to be loved by her.\u201d He smiled. \u201cOver and over.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana nudged him with her foot, but her own pleased smile was, if anything, broader than his.</p><p>\u201cThe knight left to protect the kingdom against marauders,\u201d Alexander paused. \u201cAnd did not come back.\u201d He stopped looking at her, staring at the riverbank instead. \u201cThe maiden waited for her knight for a suitable period\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Forty years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe reasonable.\u201d Tatiana pinched his leg.</p><p>\u201cOuch. But finally she couldn\u2019t wait anymore and gave herself to the liege of the local manor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter forty years who\u2019d want her?\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned his gaze back to Tatiana. \u201cBut lo and behold, surprise! Her knight came back, only to find his maiden running the manor and romping with someone else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like in Pushkin\u2019s Evgeny Onegin,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cOh, except unlike Onegin, this knight, feeling like an idiot, challenged the liege to a duel, fought for the maiden\u2019s honor, such as it was, and lost. He was then drawn and quartered right in front of her very eyes, which she dabbed with her silken handkerchief, vaguely remembering the land of lilacs they had once lived in, and then shrugged nonchalantly and went in for tea.\u201d Alexander laughed. \u201cNow, that\u2019s a story!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tatiana said, rising to her feet and walking to the cabin. \u201cA stupid story.\u201d</p><p>As she was getting ready to leave, Alexander sat and smoked. \u201cWhy do you always have to go to your stupid sewing circle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always. It\u2019s just for an hour.\u201d Tatiana smiled, wrapping her arms around him. \u201cYou can wait an hour, can\u2019t you, Captain?\u201d she whispered huskily.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he said, holding her with one arm. His cigarette was in the other hand. \u201cCan\u2019t they manage without you, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>She kissed his damp forehead. \u201cShura, have you noticed the days have been getting hotter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed. Can\u2019t you just sew here? I brought your sewing machine, your desk. I\u2019ve made you a stool. I see you sewing; just the other day you were sewing all those dark clothes. What was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, just something silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, continue sewing something silly here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m teaching them how to fish, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive a man a fish and he\u2019ll eat for a day,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cTeach him how to fish and he\u2019ll eat for a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head and sighing, Alexander said, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it. Church is one thing, but no soldier husband of mine is going to a sewing circle. It\u2019ll unman you. Besides, you already know how to fish. Stay home. Play with your rifle or something. I\u2019ll be back in an hour. Do you want something delicious to eat before I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I know exactly what I want,\u201d he said, laying her down on the blanket in the grass. The sun burned over their heads.</p><p>\u201cShura, I\u2019m going to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them your husband was starving and you had to feed him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>16</p><p>\u201cSo what do you have in your bags, big man?\u201d Tatiana said one parched summer afternoon as she sat on the blanket in the clearing with his rucksack and the map case between her legs and painstakingly took out all of his things one by one. Tatiana was thirsty. It had been very hot in Lazarevo. Hot in the morning, sweltering in the afternoons, quite warm at night under the new moon. They slept naked under thin sheets with the windows open. They swam constantly. Still, they were always hot.</p><p>Alexander was sawing two long logs down to size. \u201cNothing at all of interest,\u201d he replied, his back to her.</p><p>Tatiana took out his semiautomatic, his pen and paper, a pack of cards, rolling papers, two books, two boxes of ammunition, his military knife, all his maps, and two hand grenades.</p> <p>She became immediately interested in the maps, but before she had a chance to open them up, Alexander walked across the clearing to her, saw in his hand, cigarette in his mouth, and took the grenades from her. \u201cTell you what,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we not play with explosive devices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, jumping to her feet. \u201cYou taught me how to shoot from the P-38, can you teach me how to fire from your rifle?\u201d She stared at the maps on the blanket. \u201cHow many rounds can it fire one after another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-five,\u201d replied Alexander, smoking down his cigarette.</p><p>\u201cYou could teach me how to shoot from your mortar, but you don\u2019t have a mortar in your ruck.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t carry my mortar around with me in my ruck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou carry all your maps, though.\u201d Tatiana glanced at them again.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, I wish you wouldn\u2019t stay on heavy weapons,\u201d Tatiana said, hugging him. \u201cCan\u2019t Colonel Stepanov make you a runner or something? Can\u2019t you tell him you\u2019ve married a nice girl who can\u2019t live without her soldier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll do that,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tatiana led him by the hand inside their house, taking his saw and throwing it on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t finished,\u201d he said, pointing to his logs.</p> <p>\u201cSo? You\u2019re my husband, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes? So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I have some inalienable rights, too?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was sitting naked on top of Alexander, pressing the palms of her hands into his chest.</p><p>\u201cHow does a what work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mortar. Didn\u2019t you tell Vova you operated a mortar? How does it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mortar is one of the things I operate. What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it have a short barrel like a cannon or a long barrel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s got a long barrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. So you have a long barrel, and what do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou point it up at a forty-five-degree angle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you pop a bomb into the barrel. It drops to the bottom, hits the firing pin, the propellant charge explodes, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what happens next. The bomb flies out at seven hundred meters a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let me see if I\u2019ve got it straight. Long barrel. Point up. Drop. Fire. Pop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain. Long. Up. Drop. Fire. Pop. I\u2019m a quick learner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does the mortar barrel have to be so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo improve muzzle velocity. Do you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some idea.\u201d</p><p>Back outside, Tatiana had a quick drink and went straight to Alexander\u2019s relief maps. He went back to his logs. She was even hotter now; she needed to dunk her body in the Kama. Fascinated, Tatiana studied the maps. \u201cShura, why are all your maps only of Scandinavia? Look, there is one of Finland and one of Sweden and one of the North Sea between Norway and England. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just campaign maps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why of Scandinavia?\u201d She looked over at him. \u201cWe\u2019re not fighting Scandinavia, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fighting Finland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and here\u2019s a map of the Karelian Isthmus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you fight in the Karelian Isthmus, near Vyborg, in the Winter War of 1940?\u201d</p><p>Alexander came over and lay on his stomach next to her, kissing her shoulder. \u201cI did, yes.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was quiet for a moment. \u201cAt the start of the war last year, didn\u2019t you send Dimitri on several reconnaissance missions to the Karelian Isthmus, to Lisiy Nos?\u201d</p><p>Taking the maps away from her, he said, \u201cDo you ever forget anything I say to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cI wish you would have told me that sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy all those maps?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Finland, Tania,\u201d Alexander replied, getting up and pulling her up. \u201cAre you hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Sweden, Shura. I am hot, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little of Sweden.\u201d He blew on her forehead and her neck.</p><p>\u201cAnd Norway and England, Shura.\u201d She closed her eyes, leaning against him. \u201cYour breath is hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweden is neutral in the current war, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Alexander led her inside their house. \u201cYes. Sweden is trying to stay neutral in the current war. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Tatiana smiled, her throat dry. \u201cWhat else have you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it all, you\u2019ve had it all \u2014 in spades,\u201d Alexander said softly, lifting her to their bed. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He smiled. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she purred, her hands caressing him, feeling the droplets of heat all over her body. \u201cCan you do that thing where you make us come together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Tatiasha,\u201d Alexander said, bending over her. \u201cI\u2019ll do that thing where I make us come together.\u201d</p><p>Scorched and soaked, they fell away from each other. Breathless, they lay on their backs, and then they panted, and then they turned their faces to one another and smiled happily.</p><p>Alexander went to get them a drink, and when some time had passed and Tatiana was able to breathe normally again, she gently pleaded with him to tell her how he received his first medal of valor.</p><p>For a few minutes Alexander was mute. Tatiana waited. There was a breeze coming in through the curtains, but the breeze was hot. Alexander\u2019s body was wet. Tatiana\u2019s body was wet. They needed that Kama River to cool off in. But Tatiana wasn\u2019t getting off the bed until she heard about Karelia.</p><p>Finally he shrugged. \u201cIt was not much.\u201d His voice was even. \u201cWe had fought all through the swamps near the gulf, from Lisiy Nos practically to Vyborg. We pushed the Finns back to the city but then got bogged down in the swamps in the woods. The Finns were very well entrenched and had munitions and supplies, and we were in the mud and had nothing. In the terrible battle near Vyborg we lost more than two-thirds of our men. We were forced to stop and retreat.\u201d</p><p>Alexander paused. \u201cIt was really stupid. This was in March, just days before the armistice on March 13, and here we were, losing hundreds of men for no reason. I was in the rifle corps then. We had nothing but single-bolt rifles on us.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd one or two mortars.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana smiled back. Her hand was on his chest.</p><p>\u201cMy platoon had thirty men when we started out. I had four left by the end of two days. Four plus me. When we returned out of the marshes to post at Lisiy Nos, we learned that one of the men left in the swamps near the defense line at Vyborg was Colonel Stepanov\u2019s young son, Yuri. He was eighteen and had just joined the army.\u201d</p><p>Alexander paused.</p><p>Paused or stopped?</p><p>Her hand on his chest, Tatiana waited. She felt his heart speed up.</p><p>And then Alexander moved her hand away from his heart.</p><p>Tatiana did not put it back.</p><p>He said, \u201cSo . . . I went back, spent a few hours looking for him, and found him still alive but hit. We brought him back to camp.\u201d Alexander tightened his mouth. \u201cHe didn\u2019t make it.\u201d He wasn\u2019t looking at Tatiana.</p><p>But she was looking at him. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Yuri Stepanov I got my medal of valor.\u201d</p><p>The bones in Alexander\u2019s face were set, and his eyes were expressionless. Tatiana knew: he was making them expressionless.</p><p>She replaced her gentle hand on his chest and watched Alexander slowly blink away his life.</p><p>\u201cThe colonel was grateful to you for bringing his son back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Alexander, his voice flat. \u201cColonel Stepanov has been very good to me. He transferred me out of the infantry division and into the motorized. And when he became commander of the Leningrad garrison, he took me with him.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was very, very quiet. She was barely breathing. She didn\u2019t want to know. She didn\u2019t want to ask. But she couldn\u2019t not ask.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go into the swamps by yourself,\u201d she said at last, and sighed deeply. \u201cWho did you take with you?\u201d</p><p>Carefully Alexander replied, \u201cDimitri.\u201d</p><p>It was a long time before Tatiana spoke.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was in your platoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t. I asked him if he wanted to come on the mission with me, and he said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he say yes?\u201d asked Tatiana. \u201cI find it difficult to believe that Dimitri would go on a dangerous mission near enemy lines to find a wounded soldier.\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t reply for a few moments. \u201cWell, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let me understand. You and Dimitri went into the swamps alone to retrieve Yuri Stepanov?\u201d Tatiana tried to keep her voice even. She couldn\u2019t do it as well as Alexander. Her voice shook.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you expect to find him?\u201d She sounded pained.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cAre you looking for a specific answer, Tatia? Something I\u2019m not telling you?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana paused, trying not to swallow. \u201cIs there something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>He was looking not at her but at the ceiling. \u201cI told you. We went in, we looked for a couple of hours. We found him. We brought him back. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that when Dimitri was promoted to private first class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Quietly with her fingers Tatiana drew large circles, small circles, medium circles on Alexander, her head on his chest. \u201cShura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the armistice of 1940, Vyborg was where the Soviet border with Finland was, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far is Vyborg from Helsinki?\u201d</p><p>Alexander was silent. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana bit her lip. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look far on the map.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a map. Nothing looks far on it,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cMaybe 300 kilometers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. How far\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? How far from Helsinki to Stockholm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake! Stockholm?\u201d But Alexander was still not looking at Tatiana. \u201cMaybe another 500 kilometers. But across water. There is the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia in between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is the gulf, there is the sea,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI have one more question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He did not sound amused.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the border now?\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cThe Finns came down from Vyborg to Lisiy Nos, right? Where you sent Dimitri last year for reconnaissance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana, is there a point to your questions?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cThat\u2019s enough already.\u201d</p><p>She sat up abruptly and moved away, starting to climb down.</p><p>Alexander caught her by the arm. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were done, right? I\u2019m going to cool off, and then I\u2019ve got to start on dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana closed her eyes. Alexander had that voice. He had that voice, those eyes, those hands, that mouth. He had that everything.</p><p>She came.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked, laying her next to him, caressing her. \u201cWhat are you asking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me about my medal, I told you. You asked me about the borders, I told you. You asked me about Lisiy Nos, I told you. Now, stop all that thinking,\u201d he said, gently kneading her nipple between his thumb and forefinger.</p><p>Alexander kissed her. They were still damp from before, still parched from before, and thirsty, and hot. \u201cDo you have any more questions? Or are you finished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, longer, warmer, deeper, kissed her tenderly, endlessly.</p><p>\u201cI might be finished,\u201d she whispered. That\u2019s what he did to her: kissed her until the liquid flame dissolved her flesh. And he knew it. Everything he did to her he did unceasingly until he dissolved her. She was helpless before him. And he knew it. His mouth still on hers, Alexander prodded her thighs apart and slid two fingers inside her . . . pulled them out . . . slid them back in . . . \u201cI think I\u2019m finished now,\u201d whispered Tatiana. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>17</p><p>A few blistering summer days later, Tatiana was jumping up and down again. \u201cWhat are you making now?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou already made a bench. Stop all this building. Let\u2019s go swimming. Swimming! Come on, even the Kama is warm nowadays. Let\u2019s dive in, and I\u2019ll try to stay under longer than you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was inside the house, having just brought in the two logs he had been working on, each about a meter tall. They came up to just below his hips.</p><p>\u201cLater. I\u2019ve got to make this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you making?\u201d Tatiana repeated.</p><p>\u201cWait and you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA countertop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for? What we need here is a table.\u201d She jumped up and down again. \u201cWe keep eating dinner on our laps. Why don\u2019t you make a table? Better yet, come swimming with me.\u201d She pulled on him.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe later. Is there anything to drink? God, this heat.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana left and came back instantly with water and a cut cucumber. \u201cDo you want a cigarette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She brought him a cigarette. \u201cBut, Shura, we don\u2019t need a countertop. We need a table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a high table. Or we\u2019ll use this as a high bench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just make it lower?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait and you\u2019ll see. Tatia, did anyone ever tell you that patience is a virtue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re making.\u201d</p><p>Alexander led her out of the house. \u201cCan you go and get me some bread? I\u2019m hungry. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to go to Naira\u2019s. We haven\u2019t got any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Go to Naira\u2019s. Just be back soon.\u201d</p><p>Soon she came back with the bread, some butter, eggs, and cabbage. \u201cShura! I\u2019m going to make cabbage pie tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait. I\u2019m starving now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always starving. I can\u2019t keep you fed.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAre you hot? You took off your shirt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo hot.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana beamed. \u201cAre you done yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost. I\u2019m just planing it.\u201d</p><p>Coming up to the bench, Tatiana looked at it, looked at him, and said, \u201cPlaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking it smooth. We don\u2019t want to get splinters.\u201d</p><p>She was puzzled. \u201cWe don\u2019t? Shura, do you know what Dusia told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweet girl. What did Dusia tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat this is the hottest summer they\u2019ve had in Lazarevo in seventy-five years, since 1867! Since she was four years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d said Alexander. Tatiana held out a flask of water for him. He drank it down whole and asked for more. He left the refilled flask on the countertop next to him as he continued to plane the flat top.</p><p>Tatiana watched him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cIt comes up to my ribs. Why did you build it so high?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Alexander put down his wood plane and went to wash his hands and face in the bucket of water. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll help you up.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her to the countertop and stood in front of her. \u201cWell? How do you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel high,\u201d Tatiana said, looking at him. His eyes were peaceful, his lips were happy. \u201cBut I\u2019m not afraid of heights.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd my face almost comes up to your face. I like that. Come closer, soldier.\u201d</p><p>Alexander opened her legs and stood between them. For a moment, their eyes nearly level, they gazed at each other, and then they kissed. He ran his hands under her dress up her thighs to her hips. She wasn\u2019t wearing any underwear.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He played with her and then untied his drawstring shorts. \u201cTell me, Tatiasha,\u201d Alexander murmured, guiding himself inside her and tugging her forward. \u201cIs this close enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she said hoarsely, gripping the countertop.</p><p>Holding her hips up to him, he moved in and out of her and then yanked her sundress down to her waist, bent, and sucked her nipples. \u201cI want your wet nipples against my chest,\u201d he said. \u201cGrab my neck.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGrab my neck, Tania,\u201d he said, increasing his pace. \u201cDo you still think the countertop is too high?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Alexander murmured, pressing her to him, enfolding her bare body in his avid hands. \u201cSuddenly \u2014 it seems just the right height . . . doesn\u2019t it, my impatient wife, doesn\u2019t it\u2014\u201d</p><p>And afterward, as Alexander stood in front of her, panting and drenched, Tatiana, also panting and drenched, kissed his wet throat and asked, \u201cTell me, did you build it just for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d Alexander said, taking a long drink from the flask and then pouring the rest of the water over her face and breasts. \u201cWe can put potatoes on it.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Tatiana said, \u201cBut we don\u2019t have any potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, you were right, this countertop is the perfect height! I finally have a place to knead the dough for my pies.\u201d Tatiana smiled at him while flouring her hands. The yeast dough had risen at last, and she was about to make them cabbage pie.</p><p>Alexander was sitting on top of the counter, swinging his legs back and forth. \u201cTatiana, don\u2019t try to change the subject! Are you honestly telling me,\u201d he said, \u201cthat Peter the Great should not have built Leningrad and modernized Russia in the process?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that,\u201d Tatiana replied. \u201cWatch it \u2014 your leg is in my flour. Pushkin is saying that. Our Pushkin was of two minds about it when he wrote \u2018The Bronze Horseman.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is this pie going to take?\u201d Alexander asked, not moving a centimeter away. He flicked a bit of flour in Tatiana\u2019s face. \u201cAnd Pushkin was not of two minds about it. The point of \u2018The Bronze Horseman\u2019 was that Russia needed to be brought into the New World \u2014 even if it was to be kicking and screaming.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cPushkin did not think Leningrad was built at a fair price. And don\u2019t start the flicking game,\u201d she said, throwing a handful of flour at Alexander. \u201cYou know you\u2019ll lose.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThe pie will take forty-five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, after you put it in the oven.\u201d Alexander brushed the flour off his face and swung his legs harder, not taking his eyes off Tatiana. \u201cLook at what Pushkin wrote. Was it not thus, a towering idol, hard by the chasm, with iron bridle, you reared up Russia to her fate? Fate, Tania. Destiny. Can\u2019t fight against destiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, move a bit, can you?\u201d said Tatiana, taking a rolling pin to roll out the dough. \u201cPushkin also wrote, The emperor\u2019s generals went speeding,\u201d she continued, \u201cto save the people, who unheeding, with fear were drowning where they dwelled. Fear, Alexander, drowning! That\u2019s what I mean about ambivalence. The people did not want to be saved or modernized, Pushkin wrote.\u201d</p><p>Alexander did not move away, his thigh deliberately bumping the rolling pin. \u201cTania, but there is a city where there was none before. There is a civilization where before there were marshes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop bumping! Tell that to Pushkin\u2019s Eugene. He went mad. Tell that to Pushkin\u2019s Parasha. She drowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEugene was weak. Parasha was weak. I don\u2019t see a statue built to them.\u201d He did not stop bumping.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cBut, Shura, there is no denying that Pushkin himself was ambivalent. Was the human cost too high a price to pay for building Leningrad? he was asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is yes denying,\u201d said Alexander adamantly. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was ambivalent at all. Is this pie going to have a filling, or are you just going to bake the crust in the oven?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stopped rolling out the dough and stood still, staring at him. \u201cShura, how can you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I say that? There is no filling.\u201d</p><p>She tapped his leg lightly with the rolling pin. \u201cGo and get me my frying pan off the hearth. How can you say he was not ambivalent?\u201d Tatiana repeated, watching Alexander. \u201cLook what Pushkin writes. Why, it\u2019s the point of his whole poem!\u201d She took a breath:</p><p>\u201cAnd in the moonlight\u2019s pallid glamour,</p><p>Rides high upon the charging brute,</p><p>Hand outstretched \u2018mid echoing clamor,</p><p>The Bronze Horseman in pursuit.\u201d</p><p>And another breath. \u201cPushkin doesn\u2019t end his poem as he began it, with the gorgeous granite parapets and golden spires of Leningrad and white nights and the Summer Garden.\u201d Her heart swelling at the mention of the Summer Garden, Tatiana smiled at Alexander, who smiled back. She continued. \u201cPushkin ends the poem by telling us that yes, Leningrad was built, but the statue of Peter the Great came to life as if in a nightmare and is chasing Eugene \u2014 our frantic wretch \u2014 for eternity through those beauteous Leningrad streets:</p><p>And all through that long night, no matter,</p><p>What road the frantic wretch might take,</p><p>There would pound with ponderous clatter,</p><p>The Bronze Horseman in his wake.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shivered slightly. Why did she shiver? It was so hot.</p><p>Alexander held the cast-iron pan in front of her. \u201cTania, can you argue with me and put the filling in the dough at the same time? Or am I going to have to agree with you so you can make dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, that\u2019s the price of Leningrad! Parasha dead and drowned. Eugene pursued by the Bronze Horseman for eternity,\u201d Tatiana said as she spooned the filling inside the dough shell and started to seal up the edges. \u201cI think Parasha would have liked to have her life. And Eugene didn\u2019t want to pay with his sanity, certainly. He would have preferred living in a swamp.\u201d</p><p>Alexander hopped back up onto the counter, his legs parted wide.\u201dHere lay asprawl my luckless knave, and here in charity they buried, the chill corpse in a pauper\u2019s grave.\u201d He shrugged casually. \u201cWhatever. I say Eugene is a fair price to pay for the free world.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana paused, thought, looked up at him. \u201cIs Eugene a fair price to pay to create \u2018socialism in one country,\u2019 too?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on now!\u201d Alexander exclaimed. \u201cSurely you\u2019re not equating Peter the Great with Stalin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander jumped off the counter. \u201cKicking and screaming, Tatiana, but into the free world! Not kicking and screaming into slavery. It\u2019s a vital, essential, crucial difference. It\u2019s the difference between dying for Hitler and dying to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill dying, though, right, Shura?\u201d said Tatiana, coming close to him. \u201cStill dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be dying myself soon if I don\u2019t get fed,\u201d Alexander muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going in the oven now.\u201d She put the pie in and crouched to wash her hands and face in the bucket. The cabin was too hot with the stove on. The open doors, the open windows, nothing helped. Straightening up, Tatiana glanced at Alexander and said, \u201cWe have forty-five minutes. What do you want to do? No, wait. Forget I said that. God, all right, but can we clean the counter first? Look, I\u2019m getting covered in flour. You like that, don\u2019t you? Oh, Shura, you\u2019re insatiable. We can\u2019t do this all the time . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, Shura, we can\u2019t . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, Shura . . .</p><p>\u201cOh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know that you\u2019re just being contrary,\u201d Tatiana said to Alexander as they sat outside in the last light under the waxing crescent moon and ate their cabbage and onion pie with a tomato salad and black bread with butter. \u201cI know you think that dying for Hitler and dying for Stalin amounts to the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Alexander swallowed his bite of pie. \u201cI do, yes, but dying to stop Hitler does not. I am America\u2019s ally. I am fighting on the side of America.\u201d Resolutely he nodded once. \u201cI\u2019ll take that fight.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana looked into her cabbage pie. \u201cI think it wasn\u2019t cooked long enough,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nine o\u2019clock at night. I\u2019d have eaten it raw four hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to let their discussion go \u2014 because she thought she was right \u2014 Tatiana resumed. \u201cBack to Pushkin, though. Russia, as represented by Eugene, didn\u2019t want to be modernized. Peter the Great should have left well enough alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough?\u201d exclaimed Alexander. \u201cThere was no Russia! While the rest of Europe was forging into the age of enlightenment, Russia was still in the dark ages. After Peter built Leningrad, suddenly there was French language and culture and education and travel, there was a market economy, an emerging middle class, a sophisticated aristocracy. There was music, and books. Books, Tania, that you love. Happy families that Tolstoy wrote about. Tolstoy could never have written his books had it not been for what Peter the Great built a hundred years before him. Eugene and Parasha\u2019s sacrifice meant that a better world order prevailed.\u201d He paused. \u201cThat light triumphed over darkness.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cYes, well, easy for you to talk about their sacrifice. You\u2019re not being chased by a block of bronze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at it another way,\u201d Alexander said, eating his bread. \u201cWhat are we having for dinner tonight, dinner that\u2019s turned into a late-night supper? Cabbage pie. Bread. Why? Do you know why?\u201d</p><p>She tutted. \u201cI don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe patient, and you\u2019ll see in a minute. We\u2019re eating rabbit food because you did not want to get up at five this morning. I said, we have to go now if we\u2019re going to have some trout. Otherwise the fish will leave. Did you listen?\u201d</p><p>She grunted. \u201cSometimes I listen . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded. \u201cAnd on the days you listen, we have fish. Was I right? Of course. Certainly it\u2019s terrible to get up so early. But afterward we have real food.\u201d Alexander ate the pie happily. \u201cAnd that\u2019s my point: all great things worth having require great sacrifice worth giving. That\u2019s how I feel about Leningrad. It was worth it.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana paused. \u201cStalin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No, no, and no!\u201d He put his plate on the blanket. \u201cI said great things worth having. Sacrifice for Stalin\u2019s world order is not only execrable, it\u2019s meaningless. What if I made you get up, made you, told you, you had no choice, you had to get up, bleary-eyed and exhausted, and go out into the cold, not for fish but for mushrooms? And not just for mushrooms but the kind of mushrooms I pick, the poisonous mushrooms I keep yanking from the ground, the ones that singe your liver upon contact, with death following in three to five minutes?\u201d Alexander laughed. \u201cTell me \u2014 would you want to get up then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get up now,\u201d Tatiana grumbled, pointing to his plate. \u201cEat your food. It\u2019s not fish\u2014\u201d</p><p>He picked up his plate. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely Tania pie,\u201d said Alexander, his mouth full, cheerfully blinking at Tatiana. \u201cThere are some battles, no matter how much you don\u2019t want to fight them, that you just have to fight. That are worth giving your life for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess . . .\u201d she said, looking away.</p><p>Alexander swallowed his food and set down his plate. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana crawled to him on the blanket. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this anymore,\u201d she said, hugging him tightly.</p><p>\u201cPlease let\u2019s not,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cLet\u2019s go and dive into the evening Kama.\u201d</p><p>The next morning Tatiana was screaming from inside the cabin. Her shrieks carried to Alexander through the pines, over the sound of his ax falling down on the cracking wood. He dropped the axe and ran to the house to find her crouching on top of the high counter. Her legs were drawn up to her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he exclaimed, panting.</p><p>\u201cShura, a mouse ran by my feet as I was cooking.\u201d</p><p>Alexander stared at the eggs on the hearth, at the small pot of bubbling coffee on the Primus stove, at the tomatoes already on their plates, and then at Tatiana, ascended a meter from the floor. His mouth reluctantly, infectiously drew into a wide grin. \u201cWhat are you\u201d \u2014 he was trying to keep from laughing \u2014 \u201cwhat are you doing up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you!\u201d she yelled. \u201cA mouse ran by and brushed his\u201d \u2014 she shivered \u2014 \u201chis tail against my leg. Can you take care of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what are you doing up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting away from the mouse, of course.\u201d She frowned, looking at him unhappily. \u201cAre you just going to stand there, or are you going to catch it?\u201d</p><p>Alexander walked to the counter and picked her up. Tatiana grabbed his neck but did not put her feet down. He hugged her, kissed her, kissed her again with enormous affection, and said, \u201cTatiasha, you goose, mice can climb, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo they can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen mice climb the pole of the commander\u2019s tent in Finland, trying to get to the piece of food at the very top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was food doing at the top of the tent pole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe put it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see if mice could climb.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana almost laughed. \u201cWell, you\u2019re not getting breakfast, or coffee, or me in this house until that mouse is gone.\u201d</p><p>After carrying her outside, Alexander went back for the breakfast plates. They ate on the bench, side by side. Alexander turned and stared at her incredulously. \u201cTania, are you . . . afraid of mice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Have you killed it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would you like me to do that? You never told me you were afraid of mice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never asked. How would I like you to kill it? You are a captain in the Red Army, for goodness\u2019 sake. What do they teach you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow to kill human beings. Not mice.\u201d</p><p>She barely touched her food. \u201cWell, throw a grenade at it. Use your rifle. I don\u2019t know. But do something.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cYou went out into the streets of Leningrad while the Germans were throwing five-hundred-kilo bombs that blew arms and legs off the women standing ahead of you in line, you stood fearless in front of cannibals, you jumped off a moving train to go and find your brother, but you are afraid of mice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you got it,\u201d Tatiana said defiantly.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cIf a person is fearless in the big things\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Again. Are you done with your questions? Anything else you want to ask? Or add?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one thing.\u201d Alexander kept his face serious. \u201cIt looks like,\u201d he said slowly, his voice calm, \u201cwe\u2019ve found three uses for that too-high potato countertop I built yesterday.\u201d And he burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, laugh,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019m here for your amusement.\u201d Her eyes twinkled.</p><p>Putting his own plate on the bench, Alexander took the plate out of her hands and brought her to him to stand between his legs. Reluctantly she came. \u201cTania, do you have any idea how funny you are?\u201d He kissed her chest, looking up at her. \u201cI adore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really adored me,\u201d she said, trying to twist herself out of his arms, unsuccessfully, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t be sitting here idly flirting when you could be militarizing that cabin.\u201d</p><p>Alexander stood up. \u201cJust to point out,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s not called flirting once you\u2019ve made love to the girl.\u201d</p><p>After Alexander went inside, a smiling Tatiana sat on the bench and finished her food. In a few minutes he emerged from the cabin holding his rifle in one hand, his pistol in the other, and a bayonet attachment between his teeth. The dead mouse was swinging at the end of the bayonet.</p><p>He spoke out of the corner of his mouth. \u201cHow did I do?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana failed to keep a straight face. \u201cAll right, all right,\u201d she said, chortling. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to bring out the spoils of war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I know you wouldn\u2019t believe in a dead mouse unless you saw it with your own eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop quoting me back to me? Shura, you tell me, I will believe it,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cNow, go on, get out of here with that thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne last question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Tatiana, covering her face, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cDo you think this dead mouse is worth the price of a . . . killed mouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you just go?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana heard his boisterous laughter all the way to the woods and back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>18</p><p>They were sitting on their rock fishing. Rather they were attempting to fish. Tatiana was holding her fishing line in the water, but Alexander had put his down and was lying on the rock, rubbing her bare back. Ever since she had sewn herself a new blue cotton sundress, which was open from the nape of her neck to the small of her back, Alexander seemed unable to concentrate on small tasks at hand, such as hunting and gathering. He didn\u2019t want her to wear anything else, but he couldn\u2019t do anything else either.</p><p>\u201cShura, please. We haven\u2019t caught a thing. I don\u2019t want Naira Mikhailovna to go hungry because you won\u2019t catch her a fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Because that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of right now \u2014 Naira Mikhailovna. And I told you we should have gotten up at five.\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana sighed, smiling, looking out onto the shimmering river. \u201cYou said you were going to read to me. You brought the Pushkin book out here. Read to me from \u2018The Bronze Horseman.\u2019 \u201d She began, \u201cThere was a time, our memories keep its horrors fresh and near us . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead. I\u2019ll hunt and gather.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was kissing her back. \u201cPut the fishing line down. I can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly six in the evening, and we have no dinner!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, taking the fishing line out of her hands. \u201cWhen do you ever deny me?\u201d Alexander lay down on his back. \u201cPull up your dress and sit on me.\u201d Groaning slightly, he paused and said, \u201cNo, not like that. Turn around. Sit facing the river, away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAway from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander said, closing his eyes. \u201cI want to see your back when you\u2019re on top of me.\u201d</p><p>Afterward, as she was still facing away from him, a released and confined and perplexed Tatiana said inaudibly, \u201cPerhaps I could have continued to fish. After all, I\u2019m facing the right way.\u201d</p><p>Softly stroking the small of her back, Alexander said nothing.</p><p>Tatiana got off him. \u201cDo you want to kiss me?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He lay with his eyes closed. \u201cYes.\u201d But he did not move. \u201cHow many days left, Tatiana?\u201d he asked in a gutted voice.</p><p>Turning quickly away from him and to the Kama, she picked up her fishing line. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered, staring at the water. \u201cI\u2019m not keeping time.\u201d</p><p>Then Tatiana heard Alexander\u2019s voice from behind. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I read to you now? Oh, here. Here\u2019s a passage you\u2019ll like:</p><p>\u201cGet married? I? And yet why not?</p><p>Of course it won\u2019t be easy sailing.</p><p>But what of that? I\u2019m young and strong,</p><p>Content to labor hard and long,</p><p>I\u2019ll build us soon, if not tomorrow,</p> <p>A simple nest for sweet repose</p><p>And keep\u2014\u201d</p><p>He paused. Tatiana knew that the name of the woman in Pushkin\u2019s poem was Parasha. She waited, her eyes glazing over from the ache in her heart. Alexander resumed reading, his cracked voice lower.</p><p>\u201cAnd keep Tatiana free of sorrow,</p><p>And in a year or two, who knows,</p><p>I may obtain a snug position,</p><p>And it shall be Tatiana\u2019s mission</p><p>To tend and rear our children . . . yes,</p><p>So we will live, and so forever</p><p>Will be as one, till death us sever</p><p>And grandsons lay us both to rest . . .\u201d</p><p>He stopped. Tatiana heard him slam the book shut. \u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead on, soldier,\u201d she said, her trembling hands gripping the fishing line. \u201cRead bravely on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alexander said from behind her. Tatiana did not turn to look at him. Instead, staring out onto the languid river, she continued from memory:</p><p>\u201cThus ran his reverie. Yet sadly</p><p>He wished that night the wind would still</p><p>Its mournful wail, the rain less madly</p><p>Be rattling at the windowsill . . .\u201d</p><p>Alexander and Tatiana did not speak again until they returned to the cabin.</p><p>After coming back from Naira\u2019s in the late evening, Alexander built a fire, Tatiana made some tea, and they sat, Tatiana in a lotus position, Alexander next to her. He was very quiet, she thought, quieter than usual.</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d she said softly, \u201ccome here. Put your head on me. Like always.\u201d</p><p>He lay down, his head in her lap. Gently, tenderly, full of aching affection, Tatiana stroked his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, soldier?\u201d she whispered, bending to smell him. Tea and cigarettes. She cradled his head between her thighs and her breasts, kissing his eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he replied. And said nothing else.</p><p>Tatiana sighed. \u201cWant to hear a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s one you haven\u2019t told Vova.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cThe paratroopers go to the parachute packer. \u2018Hey,\u2019 they ask, \u2018are your parachutes any good?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he replies, \u2018I\u2019ve had no complaints.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Alexander almost laughed. \u201cFunny, Tania.\u201d He jumped up away from her and took her cup. \u201cI\u2019m going to smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmoke here. Leave the cups. I\u2019ll take care of them later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to take care of them later,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do you always do that?\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lip.</p><p>Before he walked away, Alexander said, \u201cAnd why do you always have to serve Vova? What? Are his hands broken? He can\u2019t serve himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, I serve everybody.\u201d She paused and said quietly, \u201cYou first.\u201d She looked up at Alexander. \u201cHow would it look if I served everybody but him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit how it would look, Tania. I just need you not to do it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Was he displeased with her?</p><p>Tatiana continued to sit in front of the flickering flame with her legs crossed. It was dark except for the circle around the fire and the waxing half-moon in the sky. The air smelled of fresh water and burning wood and night. She knew that Alexander was sitting on the bench by the house, slightly behind her, and that he was watching her. He was doing that more and more often. Watching her as he smoked. And smoked. And smoked.</p><p>She turned to him. Alexander was watching her, and smoking.</p><p>Rising, Tatiana walked to him and stopped at his legs. Stepping on his feet, she asked shyly, \u201cShura . . . want to go inside?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou go ahead. I\u2019ll sit here for a while and wait for the fire to burn out.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana looked him over, studied him, searched his eyes, his lips, his slightly unsteady hands.</p><p>Chewing her lip again, she didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Alexander repeated.</p><p>Coming closer to him, she pulled his legs apart and knelt on the ground in front of him. His shallow breathing became more rapid. Looking up into his face and rubbing his legs, Tatiana said, \u201cWhat do I love?\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>Tatiana prodded him again. \u201cWhat do you love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour soft mouth on me,\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said, undoing the ties on his trousers. \u201cIs it too dark? Or can you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see,\u201d he said, taking hold of her head as she took hold of him.</p><p>\u201cShura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>19</p><p>Alexander was in the darkening woods collecting kindling. Tatiana called for him, but he did not answer. She wanted to see him before she ran quickly to Naira\u2019s. On the bench she set out for him a plate of warm fried potatoes, two tomatoes, and a cucumber. When he came back from the woods, he was always hungry. Near his plate she left a cup of sweet black tea, and next to it a cigarette and a lighter.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s funny husband had lost interest in funny things. He had interest in smoking and in chopping wood. That\u2019s all he did now. Smoked for himself, chopped wood for her. They continued to occasionally wake before dawn and go fishing when the Kama was still as glass, the air dewy and blue, go silently and sleepily to their rock in the secluded river pool, just to the side of their clearing. Alexander was right, of course. It was the best time to go fishing. They would catch half a dozen trout in four or five minutes. He would leave them alive in the net basket lowered from a poplar branch into the river. Then he would smoke, and Tatiana would brush her teeth and go back to bed.</p><p>After he smoked and swam, Alexander would come back to bed, and Tatiana, as always, would receive him, having waited for him, listened for him, prayed for him. She was immoderately excited by him. He owned her. However Alexander wished to offer her his remarkable crown, Tatiana would take, even if it was with ice at dawn.</p> <p>But whereas before, Alexander had been delighted in his perceived mistreatment of freezing her with his limbs, recently he had begun to touch her as if she were scalding hot, as if he were burning himself on her. He was drawn to the fire, he could not help but touch her, yet he touched her now as if he knew that the burns he was inflicting on himself would scar him for life, if they didn\u2019t kill him first.</p><p>What happened to the Shura who used to chase her and grab her and knock her down to the ground and lick her and tickle her? What happened to the Shura who needed to make love to her in broad daylight so he could look at her? Where was he, the laughing man, the joking man, the brash man, the careless man? Gradually he seemed to have been drowned and resurrected as the Alexander who did little but smoke and chop wood and watch her.</p><p>Sometimes when Tatiana was abundantly asleep, all tucked in to him, comforted and at peace, she would suddenly be woken up in the darkest night by Alexander. She wouldn\u2019t move or acknowledge him. She felt him lying awake, unable to breathe, suffocating her, embracing the breath out of her body. She would hear his broken gasps, feel his lips rubbing against her hair, and wish she could stop breathing permanently.</p><p>Tatiana was slicing his tomatoes as the tears were silently flowing down her cheeks.</p><p>Behind her she heard him say, \u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d</p> <p>Alexander was too stealthy a soldier. Quickly she wiped her eyes, cleared her throat, and said, \u201cHang on, I\u2019m almost done.\u201d The light was waning; maybe he wouldn\u2019t see her wet face.</p><p>Turning her head to him and smiling, she saw he was perspiring and covered with wood chips. \u201cCollecting more kindling?\u201d Tatiana asked, her heart beginning to pound. \u201cHow much wood am I going to need?\u201d She stood and stepped up to Alexander. \u201cMmm . . . you\u2019re so delicious-smelling,\u201d she murmured, short of breath at the scent of him, at the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cWhy is your face all red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was cutting onions for the potatoes. You know onions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see only one plate. Are you going somewhere, I asked?\u201d He was not smiling.</p><p>\u201cOf course, not,\u201d said Tatiana, clearing her throat.</p> <p>\u201cLet me go and wash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d she said, coming up barefoot to Alexander, feeling vulnerable and aroused. \u201cI always feel so tiny when you\u2019re in your boots,\u201d she whispered, gazing up at him.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s whole body clamped her motionless. His left hand held her head, his right hand gripped her bottom, his body was on her and in her, around her and over her. She could not twitch without him letting her. Submitting to him completely, Tatiana could feel Alexander with every thrust struggling through his love for her, struggling through his need for her. By now she understood: Alexander knew his own strength very well.</p><p>Underneath him Tatiana pressed her lips to his collarbone. \u201cOh, Shura . . . I need you so much.\u201d Trying hard not to cry.</p><p>His voice cracked. \u201cI\u2019m here. Feel me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling, soldier,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m feeling.\u201d</p><p>Too soon Tatiana felt the burning wave start to flood her, and she bit her mouth shut, suppressing her crying moans. But she knew that Alexander felt it, too, holding her as taut as he did, for he stopped moving and pulled himself away. There it starts, Tatiana thought, opening her hands and pleading for him. There it starts and lasts all night until he finally, gentle and bruising, rhythmic and broken, releases his hunger and longing onto me, until he exhausts himself and me, until we both can\u2019t crawl away from his aching regret.</p><p>It was evening. Tatiana was looking unblinking at Alexander lying on his stomach, his face to her, his eyes closed. She was quietly by him, listening to his breath, trying to determine if he was asleep. She didn\u2019t think so. Every fourth breath or so, Alexander would shudder, as if he were thinking. Tatiana didn\u2019t want him to be thinking. Slowly she drew small circles on his back with her fingers. Alexander murmured and turned his face away from her.</p> <p>What does he need? she thought. What can I give him?</p><p>\u201cWant a massage?\u201d she asked, kissing his upper arm, running her palm over his hard shoulders. She squeezed him. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, opening one eye. \u201cYou know how to give a massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled. He was wearing only his skivvies. She hopped on top of him.</p><p>\u201cTatia, what do you know about massages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she said teasingly, pinching his behind. \u201cI\u2019ve given lots of massages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>She knew that would get his attention. \u201cYes. Ready? Rail tracks, rail tracks,\u201d Tatiana began, with her fingertips tracing two long parallel lines down his spine, moving from his neck to the top of the elastic on his shorts.</p><p>\u201cRail ties, rail ties.\u201d She drew short perpendicular lines across.</p><p>\u201cHere comes the late train . . .\u201d A zigzagging line down.</p><p>\u201cAnd it spills all the grain.\u201d Her hands tickled his back.</p><p>Alexander laughed, his head on his hands.</p><p>Tatiana had an urge to kiss him. But that wasn\u2019t part of the game.</p><p>\u201cThe chickens come, and they peck at it.\u201d She poked him with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cThe geese come, and they pinch it.\u201d She pinched him all over.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a massage is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children come, and they step on it!\u201d She pounded his back with the palms of her hands.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are you pounding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe robbers come, and they salt it, and they pepper it, and they eat it,\u201d she squealed, tickling him. He wriggled. I love that he is ticklish, Tatiana thought with pleasure. She couldn\u2019t resist, she bit his back. He was just too gorgeous lying under her, twitching from being tickled. As she bit him, he purred.</p><p>\u201cHere comes Dedushka, he collects some grain,\u201d Tatiana said, pecking at Alexander with her fingers. \u201cHere comes the zookeeper . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, not the zookeeper,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cHe sits down, and he begins to write.\u201d Tatiana drew a table and a chair. She made squiggly writing lines on Alexander\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cPlease admit my daughter to the zoo, and please collect all the grain. He puts down a period . . . he places a stamp . . .\u201d She slapped Alexander lightly.</p><p>\u201cTrrrrr.\u201d She poked him in the ribs. He jumped. She laughed.</p><p>\u201cTime to mail it!\u201d Tatiana popped the elastic on his shorts. It snapped against his lower back. She pulled down his shorts a little and caressed his behind.</p><p>Alexander lay there not moving. \u201cIs it over?\u201d he asked in a muffled voice.</p><p>Laughing, Tatiana lay down flat on top of him. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, kissing him between his shoulders. \u201cHow did you like it?\u201d She loved how his bare back felt under her body, like a firm bed. He carried me on his back, she thought. Carried me nine kilometers, me and his rifle. Tatiana rubbed her cheek against his very tanned shoulder blade. All month out in the hot sun. She blinked.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Interesting. Was that some kind of a Russian massage?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana told him she and the kids at Luga used to do that to each other twenty times a day, each time harder and more ticklish than the last. She didn\u2019t mention that she and Dasha, too, used to do it endlessly to each other.</p><p>Alexander moved out from under Tatiana. \u201cMy turn,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she squealed. \u201cYou better be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn over.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana turned over, still in her sundress.</p><p>\u201cWait. Up, up. Take the dress off.\u201d He helped her.</p><p>Tatiana lay down on her stomach in front of Alexander, her hair tied with white ribbons by the sides of her head, her neck exposed, her back exposed, smooth, cream-colored, satin. She had freckles on her shoulders from the sun, but the rest of her was ivory. Bending to her, Alexander traced a line from her shoulder blade to her neck with his tongue. He pulled the ribbons from her hair. His breath shallow, he said, \u201cWait, let\u2019s remove these, too,\u201d tugging at her blue silk panties.</p><p>Tatiana lifted her hips. \u201cShura,\u201d she said, \u201chow are you going to do the elastic pop at the end if you remove my underwear?\u201d</p><p>Lost as always at the sight of her hips moving up, Alexander took the skin near her shoulder into his mouth. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have a train with grain or bears stomping on your back, maybe we can imagine the elastic on your underwear, too?\u201d He saw she was smiling, her eyes already closed. He removed his own shorts with one hand.</p><p>As he continued to kiss her between her shoulder blades, she moaned softly and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not playing by the rules of the game.\u201d</p><p>Supporting himself on his knees, he sat astride her and began. \u201cAll right, how does it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRail tracks, rail tracks,\u201d Tatiana said helpfully.</p><p>Alexander drew two lines from her neck all the way to her bottom.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to go so far down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he said, his fingers, his hands remaining on her bottom.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she repeated, but her voice quickened.</p><p>\u201cThe chickens,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cWhat did they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey pecked,\u201d she said. Alexander lightly pecked her with his fingers. He pressed his palms into her back, fanning her from her spine to her ribs. His hands slipped around to her breasts. \u201cWhat about the geese?\u201d he asked, fondling her.</p><p>\u201cThey pinched.\u201d Gently he squeezed her nipples. \u201cShura, you\u2019re going to have to do better than that,\u201d Tatiana said, lifting her chest slightly off the bed. He squeezed her nipples less gently. \u201cMmm,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe robbers came . . .\u201d Alexander said, moving off her, spreading her legs and kneeling between them. \u201cThey salted,\u201d he said, lifting her hips up to him, \u201cthey peppered,\u201d he continued, sliding himself fully inside her. Tatiana cried out, grasping the sheet with both hands. \u201cAnd they ate it . . . once . . . and again . . . and again . . .\u201d</p><p>Not stopping, Alexander bent over her, pressing his palm into her back, edging up to touch her glowing golden hair. He closed his eyes and straightened up, his hands like a vise clamping her hips.</p><p>Afterward, Tatiana muttered, \u201cWas that some sort of an American massage? Because that was definitely not in the rules.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but his eyes were still closed.</p><p>\u201cYou know, don\u2019t you, that I\u2019m never going to feel the same way about that game now?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cLike you don\u2019t feel the same way about war-hide-and-seek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019ve ruined that also,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Alexander leaned forward and hugged her from behind, still inside her, feeling himself unable to hold her close enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>20</p><p>Late at night Tania and Shura were playing strip poker. Tania, Tania, Tania. Death-defying, life-affirming, star-making, indomitable, ridiculously beautiful Tania hated to lose at anything. And she was splendidly losing at poker. Alexander needed to focus on the cards and not her.</p><p>Having just lost her shirt, his moaning wife was sitting halfway up, leaning back on her arms while Alexander was kneeling forward, lingeringly sucking her nipples. They were outside in the clearing in front of the fire below the waxing gibbous moon. \u201cTake me inside,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot until you lose one more hand.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t back away from her. \u201cLook at me, Tania. I\u2019m in a gaseous state when I\u2019m with you . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot all of you is in a gaseous state,\u201d she said, grabbing hold of him and falling back onto the blanket. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not losing one more hand for anything.\u201d</p><p>Things weren\u2019t going well for Tatiana in their poker game but very well for Alexander. She had only her underwear left. \u201cMy underwear and my wedding ring,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cI think I can win in two tries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take that wedding ring off, and you can keep it off for good,\u201d Alexander told her as he dealt the cards.</p><p>He watched her as she examined her hand; Alexander could barely pay attention to his own. By the fire, Tatiana\u2019s poetic face was focused on the cards she kept in front of her chest to cover herself from his prying eyes. Alexander wanted her to put down the cards. He took a breath. He would get to her soon enough.</p><p>In English, she said, \u201cHow do you say . . . hit me.\u201d She smiled. \u201cTwice.\u201d</p> <p>She concentrated diligently. Suddenly her face cleared. Eyes flickering, she turned her gaze to him and said, back to Russian, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll raise you two kopecks.\u201d</p><p>Trying to be serious, Alexander said, \u201cI\u2019ll see your two. Come on, Tatia.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShow me what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d She threw down a full house, beaming at him.</p><p>\u201cAha nothing,\u201d Alexander said, putting down his cards. He had four kings.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She frowned.</p><p>\u201cI win. Four kings.\u201d He pointed to her underwear. \u201cGo on \u2014 off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour of a kind beats full house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re such a liar,\u201d she fumed, throwing her cards at him and covering her breasts with her hands.</p><p>He pulled her hands away. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Luga, I\u2019ve seen them.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>She covered herself again. \u201cI finally understand how you win all the time. You cheat.\u201d</p><p>Alexander could not stop laughing. He couldn\u2019t shuffle anymore. \u201cHow many times do I have to explain it, Comrade I-remember-everything-you-ever-tell-me? Huh?\u201d He reached over and pulled at her panties. \u201cRules are rules. Off.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana scooted away from him on the blanket. \u201cYes, cheating rules,\u201d she declared defiantly. \u201cLet\u2019s play again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll play again, but you\u2019ll be playing buck naked. Because you lost this game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShura! Just the other day you told Naira Mikhailovna that your full house beat her four of a kind. You are just the biggest cheater. I\u2019m not going to play with you if you cheat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, the other day Naira Mikhailovna had three of a kind, not four of a kind, and I had a straight, and a straight does beat three of a kind.\u201d Alexander stared at her, grinning broadly. \u201cI don\u2019t need to cheat to beat you in poker. Dominoes, yes. But not poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t need to cheat, then why do you?\u201d Tatiana demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Alexander said, putting down the cards. \u201cYour panties are coming off, Tania, one way or another. I won fair and square.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheated fair and square,\u201d she said.</p><p>Alexander was wearing his army trousers. He was naked to the waist. Tatiana\u2019s hands were still up at her breasts, but her lips were moist and slightly parted, and her eyes were roaming over his exposed body. \u201cTania,\u201d he said, staring at her intently, \u201cdo you want me to enforce the rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, jumping up. \u201cI want to see you try.\u201d</p><p>Alexander liked her fighting spirit. He was only seconds behind her when he jumped up off the blanket, but Tania was going to stop at nothing to get away. By the time he was up and running, she was already in the Kama.</p><p>Alexander stopped at the waterline. \u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind!\u201d he yelled to her.</p><p>\u201cYes, and you cheat at poker just to get me to take my clothes off!\u201d she yelled back from the river.</p><p>Crossing his arms on his chest, Alexander said, \u201cDo I really need to cheat at poker to get you to take your clothes off? I can\u2019t keep them on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you . . .\u201d he heard from the river.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cCome out.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t see her. She was a dark space in the river. \u201cCome on, come out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in and get me if you\u2019re so clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m clever but not crazy. I\u2019m not going into the river at night. Come.\u201d</p><p>He heard her cluck like a chicken.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Alexander said and turning around walked away from the shoreline. He went back to the fire, collected their cards, his cigarettes, their teacups. He brought everything, including the blanket, into the house and then came back out. The clearing was quiet. The river was quiet, too. It was cooler at night now.</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d Alexander called.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d he called, louder.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Alexander walked quickly to the river. He could see nothing, not even a dark space. The moon was pale; the stars did not reflect in the water.</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d he shouted loudly.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Suddenly Alexander remembered the swift midriver current of the Kama, the rocks they sometimes stumbled on, the drifts of wood that floated by. Panic like adrenaline shot through him.</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d he yelled. \u201cThis is not funny at all!\u201d He listened for a splash, a breath, a stirring.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He ran into the water in his trousers. \u201cYou won\u2019t want to get near me if this is another one of your jokes!\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Alexander swam against the current, yelling for her. \u201cTania!\u201d</p><p>He turned his gaze back to the shore.</p><p>And there she was\u2014</p><p>Standing, already dry, wearing a long shirt, wiping her hair, watching him. He couldn\u2019t see her expression because the fire was behind her, but when she spoke, he could tell she was wearing a big smug smile on her face. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to go into the Kama with your trousers on, you big cheater?\u201d</p><p>He was speechless. Relieved but speechless.</p><p>Running out of the water, Alexander came at her so quickly that she backed away and stumbled to the ground, looking up at him, the smile on her face evaporating.</p><p>He stood over her for a few moments, breathing hard and shaking his head. \u201cTatiana, you are impossible.\u201d He gave her his hand to pull her up but didn\u2019t look at her again as he let go and, dripping wet, walked to the cabin.</p><p>He heard her say behind him, \u201cIt was just a joke . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot f*cking funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone doesn\u2019t know how to take a little joke,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think would be so funny to me about you drowning?\u201d he shouted, whirling around to face her. \u201cWhat part of that do you think I would find particularly funny?\u201d Alexander grabbed her, let go, and went inside. He heard her behind him, and then she was in front of him. Longingly looking up at him, she whispered, \u201cShura . . .\u201d She took his hand and placed it under her shirt. She had taken off her underwear. Alexander held his breath. She was impossible. His hand remained between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to come into the water and rescue me,\u201d Tatiana said contritely, feeling for him, unbuttoning his trousers. \u201cYou forgot the part where the knight rescues the frail maiden.\u201d</p><p>His fingers caressed her. \u201cFrail?\u201d Alexander said, bringing her closer. \u201cYou must be thinking of someone else. And you forget that your sole job as a maiden is to make love to, not terrorize the knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to terrorize the knight,\u201d she murmured as Alexander picked her up and laid her atop their bed. She opened her arms to him.</p><p>In the flickering light of the kerosene lamp, Alexander gazed at his Tatiana lying naked, flat on her back, quivering for him, open for him, moaning for him. They had been making love for a long while, and he knew she nearly had no more, having burned and burned through the wave. Tania, was all he could think. Tania. He placed his hand on her toes and ran it up her legs, between her open thighs, gently, so she wouldn\u2019t jump out of her skin, up her stomach to her chest, spanning her from one side to the other, pressing his palm into her breasts, and then slowly moving his hand up to encircle her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Alexander? What, darling?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Alexander made no reply. His hand remained on her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, soldier,\u201d said Tatiana, placing her own hand on top of his. \u201cFeel me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling, Tania,\u201d Alexander whispered, bending over her. \u201cI\u2019m feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease come to me,\u201d she moaned. \u201cPlease . . . come, take me like you want . . . take me like I love . . . go ahead . . . but like I love, Shura . . .\u201d</p><p>He took her like she loved, and afterward, when they were warm under the covers, spent, murmuring, clasped and saturated in each other, ready to go to sleep, Alexander opened his mouth to speak, and Tatiana said, \u201cShura, I know it all. I understand it all. I feel it all. Say nothing.\u201d</p><p>They were enveloped in a fierce embrace, their naked bodies not just pressed hard against each other but in a trance, attempting a Bessemer smelt, in which they would be alloyed and conjoined by heat and perhaps in their cooling, grieving bliss eventually be tempered.</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t feel tempered. He felt as if he were being daily blown out of sand into a still-warm glass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>21</p><p>So they lived. From morning until night, from the first swell of the river to the last song of the lark, from the smell of the nettles to the scent of the pinecones, from the peaceful morning sun to the pale blue moon in the clearing, Alexander and Tatiana so spent their lilac days.</p><p>Alexander cut wood for her and made it into small bundles tied together with twigs. She made him blueberry pie and blueberry comp?te and blueberry pancakes. The blueberries were plentiful that summer.</p><p>He built things for her, and she made bread for him.</p> <p>They played dominoes. They sat on Naira\u2019s porch and played dominoes on the days it rained, and Tatiana beat Alexander every time, and no matter how hard he tried, he could not win. Alone they played strip poker. Tatiana always lost.</p><p>They played war-hide-and-seek, Alexander\u2019s favorite.</p><p>Tatiana sewed him five more tops and two new pairs of army skivvies. \u201cSo you feel me under your uniform,\u201d she told him.</p><p>They went mushroom picking together.</p><p>He taught her English. He taught her poems in English that he still remembered, some by Robert Frost: The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, but I have promises to keep . . .</p> <p>And some by Emma Lazarus: Here at our sea-washed sunset gates shall stand a mighty woman . . .</p><p>After building a fire in the cabin, Alexander would read Pushkin to her while she cooked dinner on their hearth, though eventually he stopped reading \u201cThe Bronze Horseman.\u201d It was too much for them both.</p><p>In the book he had found a picture of himself that he had given to Dasha the year before. The photo was of him getting his medal of valor for Yuri Stepanov. \u201cIs my wife proud of her husband?\u201d he asked, showing Tatiana the picture.</p><p>\u201cHopelessly,\u201d she replied with a grin. \u201cThink about this, Shura,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was still a kid rowing on Lake Ilmen, you had already lost your father and mother, joined the army, and become a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a kid rowing on Lake Ilmen,\u201d he said, grabbing her. \u201cA queen rowing on Lake Ilmen. Waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we still haven\u2019t gotten those wedding photos,\u201d Tatiana said.</p> <p>\u201cWho has time to go to Molotov?\u201d remarked Alexander.</p><p>They did not speak about his leaving, but just the same the days sped on. By the end they didn\u2019t just speed on, they seemed to race ahead of them in triple time, as if the spring had broken on the hands of the pitiless clock.</p><p>Alexander and Tatiana did not speak about the future.</p><p>No, not did not.</p><p>Could not.</p><p>Not after the war, not during the war, not after July 20. Alexander found himself barely able to speak to Tatiana about the next day. They had no past. They had no future. They just were. Young in Lazarevo.</p><p>As they ate and played, and talked and told jokes, as they fished and wrestled, as they walked in the woods practicing Tatiana\u2019s English and swam naked across the river and back, as he helped her with their laundry and the laundry of four old women, as he carried the water from the well for her and her milk pails, as he brushed her hair each morning and made love to her many times a day, never tiring, never ceasing to be aroused by her, Alexander knew that he was living the happiest days of his life.</p><p>He held no illusions. Lazarevo was not going to come again, neither for him nor for her.</p> <p>Tatiana held those illusions.</p><p>And he thought \u2014 it was better to have them.</p><p>Look at him.</p><p>And look at her.</p><p>Tatiana so ceaselessly and happily did for him, so constantly smiled and touched him and laughed \u2014 even as their twenty-nine moon-cycle days spun faster around the loop of grief \u2014 that Alexander had to wonder if she ever even thought about the future. He knew she sometimes thought about the past. He knew she thought about Leningrad. She had a stony sadness around her edges that she had not had before. But for the future, Tatiana seemed to harbor a rosy hope, or at the very least a sense of humming unconcern.</p><p>What are you doing? she would ask him when he was sitting on the bench and smoking. Nothing, Alexander would reply. Nothing but growing my pain.</p><p>He smoked and wished for her.</p><p>It was like wishing for America when he was a few years younger.</p><p>Wishing for a life with her, a life that was full of nothing else but her, a simple, long, married life of being able to smell her and taste her, to hear the lyre of her voice and see the honey of her hair. To feel her staggering comfort. All of it, every day.</p><p>Could he find a way to turn his back on Tatiana and have her faithful face free him? Would she forgive him? For leaving her, for dying, for killing her?</p><p>He felt punched in the gut when he watched her skip stark naked out of the cabin in the morning, and throw herself squealing into the river, and then get out and head across the clearing to him, sitting on his stump of a heart. Watching her nipples hard from the cold, her flawless body trembling to be held by him, Alexander gritted his teeth and smiled and thanked God that when he pressed her to him, she could not see his contorted face.</p><p>Alexander smoked and watched her from his tree stump bench.</p><p>What are you doing? she would ask him.</p><p>Nothing, he would reply. Nothing but growing my pain into madness.</p><p>His temper flared up constantly.</p><p>It irritated him to no end seeing her fetch and carry for other people. Tatiana, seeing his displeasure, would only sublimate herself further to him, fetching and carrying for him until he couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cWhat can I get you? What else can I get you? What do you need?\u201d came out of her mouth with heartbeat regularity.</p><p>He would say, no, I don\u2019t need anything. And she would come, carrying his cigarette, put it in his mouth, light it, and kiss the corner of his lip, her loving eyes centimeters away from his tortured ones. Alexander wanted to say, stop, back away. What will happen to you after I\u2019m gone and you\u2019re left without me? What will be left of you after I\u2019m gone when you have given me everything?</p><p>Alexander knew that Tatiana didn\u2019t know how to give to him any other way. She had one way \u2014 and that\u2019s what he got. Her devotion to him was indelible; her inability to hide her true self was the reason he fell in love with her in the first place. Soon she would have to learn, Alexander thought, as he swung his ax and crashed it down hundreds of times a day. Learn how to hide him even from her true self.</p><p>Alexander grew upset with her over the pettiest things. Her constant cheeriness vexed him constantly. She was always singing and bouncing around with a little spring in her step. He didn\u2019t understand how she could be so carefree when she knew he was leaving in fifteen days, ten days, five days, three days.</p><p>He grew bitterly jealous of her; even he was surprised at himself. He could not stand to see anyone looking at her. He could not stand to see her smiling at anyone. He could not stand to see her talking to Vova, much less serving him. He lost his temper with heartbeat regularity, but he couldn\u2019t stay upset with her for five minutes. The arsenal Tatiana carried to ease Alexander out of his bottomless hole had too many weapons.</p><p>Alexander could never get close enough to her. Not when they walked, not when they ate, not when they slept, not when they made love. His feelings teetering between intense tenderness and unrestrained lust, he needed her many times a day. His body would begin to physically ache when he remained without her while she went to her sewing circle or to help the old women. Tatiana\u2019s shy eagerness, her engulfing sweetness, her unconcealed vulnerability tore at Alexander\u2019s heart. All he hungered for was to feel her velvet flesh surround him as she cried out, whispering, Oh, Shura.</p><p>He grew unable to bear coming on top of her and watching her face and seeing her watch his. To finish, he would repeatedly have to turn her over, because when he was behind her, she could not see him.</p><p>It was all about making him feel better about leaving her.</p><p>To leave her was unthinkable.</p><p>The question Alexander had asked himself many times, he had started to forget the answer to.</p><p>At what price Tatiana?</p><p>In the beginning the answer was clear.</p><p>Tatiana was the answer.</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t the beginning anymore. This was the end.</p><p>She had gone to the fish plant, having heard there might be herring, while Alexander remained at the clearing, walking around numbly waiting for her to come back. He went to the house and was looking in her trunk for something to hold when he found something at the very bottom, almost as if that something had been hidden. The trunk had belonged to Tatiana\u2019s grandfather, so Alexander didn\u2019t give it much thought at first, but when he removed the top layer of sheets and clothes and some papers and three books, he pulled out a black canvas backpack. Immediately curious, he opened it. Inside he found his old P-38 pistol, bottles of vodka, winter boots, cans of tushonka, dried crackers, a flask, and rubles. There were warm clothes, too, all dark-colored.</p><p>Alexander smoked ten unhappy cigarettes waiting for her to return.</p><p>He heard Tatiana before he saw her. She was humming the waltz tune he had sung for her. \u201cShura!\u201d she called out to him joyfully. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe it. Herring! Real herring. We\u2019re going to have a feast tonight.\u201d</p><p>She skipped to him and lifted her arms up to his neck. Breaking in two, Alexander kissed her, thinking that her face felt a bit wet, and then showed her the backpack. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>She stared at it. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis? What\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going through my things? Come and help me with the herring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not touching the herring until you tell me what this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether or not I tell you, we still have to eat. It\u2019ll take me thirty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d</p><p>She sighed loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s a pack for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? Are you planning to go camping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d She put the herring down and sat on the bench.</p><p>Alexander pulled out the drab, all-brown clothing and a brown hat. \u201cWhy so attractive?\u201d He saw how she tensed.</p><p>\u201cJust to make myself more inconspicuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore inconspicuous? You\u2019d better hide those take-me lips of yours then. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Alexander raised his voice. \u201cWhere are you going, Tania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to be ready for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, lowering her gaze. \u201cTo go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo with me where?\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cAnywhere.\u201d She turned her eyes up. \u201cAnywhere you go,\u201d Tatiana said, \u201cI will go with you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander tried to speak but couldn\u2019t; he found himself without words. \u201cBut, Tania . . . I\u2019m going back to the front.\u201d</p><p>She was looking down at the ground. \u201cAre you, Alexander?\u201d she asked quietly without looking up.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Where else would I be going?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes stared at him with profound emotion. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>Blinking and stepping away from her, as if being too close to her left him unprotected, Alexander said, still holding her backpack, \u201cTania, I\u2019m going back to the front. Colonel Stepanov gave me extra time to come here. I gave him my word I would return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s one thing about you Americans,\u201d she said, \u201cyou always keep your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s one thing about us,\u201d Alexander said bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s no use talking about it. You know I have to go back.\u201d</p><p>Shivering, Tatiana raised her seaweed eyes to him and in a small voice said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go back with you. I\u2019ll go back to Leningrad.\u201d She must have taken his speechlessness to mean he was relieved, and continued, \u201cI thought if you were back at the barracks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d he shouted, aghast. \u201cAre you joking? Are you f*cking joking?\u201d</p><p>Alexander was so upset that he had to walk away into the woods for a few minutes until reason got hold of him again. When he came back, she was cleaning the herring. Typical. He was mortified, she was cleaning herring. He walked up to her and knocked the fish hard out of her hands.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d she yelled. \u201cStop! What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>Alexander went back into the woods to calm down and watched her pick up the herring, wash the sand and dirt off it, and proceed to clean it again.</p><p>Returning, he took the damned herring, put it down on the paper on the ground, stood Tatiana up in front of him, and took her by the shoulders. \u201cLook at me, Tania. I\u2019m trying to stay calm, all right? Do you see what an effort it is?\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat the hell are you thinking? You are not coming back with me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but the soft words that came out of her were \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Alexander said. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely not. Not while there is breath in my body. You\u2019ll have to kill me to come with me. Forget it. I will come and see you on my next furlough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will never come back. You will die out there without me. I can feel it. I\u2019m not staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, who will let you go back? I won\u2019t. Did you forget that Leningrad is under full blockade? You can\u2019t get back into Leningrad. We\u2019re still getting people out! Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what Leningrad was? I can\u2019t imagine you have, because it was only six months ago, and you still wake up in the middle of the night. Leningrad is a city under siege. Leningrad is still bombed every single f*cking day. There is no life in Leningrad. It\u2019s very dangerous, and you are not going back there.\u201d He was panting.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you have another idea, let me know. I have to clean this herring.\u201d</p><p>Alexander picked up the herring and was going to throw the whole damn thing into the Kama, but Tatiana grabbed his arm, and said, \u201cNo! It\u2019s our dinner, and the old women are looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not coming with me. And I\u2019m done talking about it.\u201d Turning her backpack upside down, he threw all of her supplies onto the ground.</p><p>Tatiana watched him calmly and then said, \u201cAnd who\u2019s going to pick all that up?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Alexander picked up the clothes and shredded them into pieces with his army knife.</p><p>Her eyes set yet frightened, Tatiana watched him from the bench. \u201cOh, this is calm?\u201d she said. \u201cShura, I can make myself new clothes.\u201d</p><p>Cursing, Alexander clenched his fist and bent down to her. \u201cGod, are you deliberately trying to provoke me?\u201d</p><p>Picking up the backpack, he was about to rip it to shreds when Tatiana grabbed his arm and the knife, her hand right on the blade, and said, \u201cNo. No. Please.\u201d She hung on to him, wrestling for the knife, pulling on the backpack. She was no match for him, and Alexander was about to shove her away, but what stopped him was that she still continued to struggle knowing she was outmatched. To stop her, Alexander would have had to hurt her. He let her have the knife and the backpack.</p><p>Out of breath, she went to clean the herring. With his knife.</p><p>Over at Naira\u2019s for dinner, Alexander didn\u2019t talk much; he was too upset. When Tatiana asked him if he wanted some more blueberry pie, he snapped at her, \u201cI said no!\u201d and saw the reproach in her eyes. He wanted to apologize but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak as they walked through the woods, but at home, as they undressed and got into bed, Tatiana said, \u201cYou\u2019re not still angry, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Alexander said. He left his shorts on as he got under the covers and turned away from her.</p><p>\u201cShura?\u201d She stroked his back and kissed his head. \u201cShura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to stop touching him, and she, of course, didn\u2019t.</p><p>What was wrong with her?</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Tatiana whispered. \u201cCome on, big man. Feel, I\u2019m naked. Do you feel?\u201d</p><p>He felt. Turning onto his back without meeting her eyes, Alexander said, \u201cTatiana, I want you to promise me you will stay right here where it\u2019s safe for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t stay here,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI can\u2019t be without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can, and you will. Just like before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. You don\u2019t understand anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she pleaded, her small, warm hand on his arms, on his stomach, moving lower.</p><p>Pushing it away, he said, \u201cWe have only three days left. I\u2019m not ruining them this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you\u2019re willing to ruin them with your sulkiness and bad behavior.\u201d Her forgiving hand returned to caressing him.</p><p>Pushing her hand away again, Alexander said, suddenly understanding, \u201cOh, so that\u2019s why you\u2019ve been so damn chipper, as if you couldn\u2019t care less I was leaving? Because you thought you were coming with me?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her body softly against his side, kissing his arm. \u201cShura,\u201d Tatiana whispered, \u201chow do you think I\u2019ve been able to live out these days with you? I couldn\u2019t continue if I thought you were leaving me. Husband,\u201d she said, her voice like a black pit, \u201ceverything I have I gave to you. If you leave, you\u2019re going to take it all.\u201d</p><p>Alexander had to get off the bed before he lost his mind. He jumped down to stand on the floor. \u201cWell, you\u2019d better get more from somewhere, Tania!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cBecause I am leaving, and I\u2019m leaving without you.\u201d</p><p>Silently she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shake your head at me!\u201d Alexander yelled. \u201cThere is a war on, for f*ck\u2019s sake! A war! Millions of people are already dead. What do you want, to be just another dead body without an ID tag in a mass grave?\u201d</p><p>She started to convulse. \u201cI have to come with you,\u201d she said in her smallest whisper. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m a soldier. This country is at war. I have to go back. But you are safe here. I came to get away from the fighting, and you and I had a good time\u2014\u201d Was it possible to actually choke on words? \u201cBut now it\u2019s over, do you understand? Over,\u201d he said loudly. \u201cI have to go back, and you can\u2019t come.\u201d He paused, panting. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to come. I\u2019m not even going to be at the garrison. I\u2019ve been moved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoved where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. But Leningrad cannot have another winter like we had last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking the blockade? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me everything.\u201d She paused. \u201cDon\u2019t you, Alexander?\u201d Tatiana asked pointedly. \u201cDon\u2019t you tell me everything?\u201d</p><p>What was that in her voice? God. He wasn\u2019t about to ask. \u201cNot this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tatiana said, sitting on the bed, looking down at him. \u201cOn the third day after we met, you told me you were from America, just like that. You poured out your entire life to me on our third day. But now you can\u2019t tell me where you\u2019re posted?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana jumped down. Alexander backed away. He couldn\u2019t be far enough from her eyes and her body and her open palms.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Shura,\u201d she said pleadingly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t marry me to keep secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, I\u2019m not having this with you! Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she yelled. \u201cWhy in the world did you marry me then, if all you wanted was to continue to lie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI married you,\u201d Alexander yelled in a breaking voice, \u201cso I could f*ck you anytime I felt like it! Don\u2019t you get it by now? Anytime, Tania! What else do you think a soldier on furlough could possibly want? And if I hadn\u2019t married you, all of Lazarevo would now be calling you my whore!\u201d</p><p>Alexander could see by Tatiana\u2019s sunken face she could not believe the words that had just come out of his mouth. She staggered back against the wall, not knowing what to cover on herself, her face or her body. \u201cYou married me so you could what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatia . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Tatia me!\u201d she screamed. \u201cFirst your insults, then Tatia? Your whore, Alexander?\u201d She groaned helplessly and put her face into her hands.</p><p>\u201cTania, please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing? That I don\u2019t know you\u2019re trying to make me hate you? Well, you know what,\u201d she said through gritted teeth. \u201cAfter trying for days, I think you\u2019ve finally succeeded!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor days you\u2019ve been trying to push me away so you could leave me easier!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming back,\u201d Alexander said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019ll have you!\u201d she cried. \u201cAnd are you really? Are you sure you haven\u2019t come here for this?\u201d She ran to her trunk, rummaged through it, found the Bronze Horseman book, and tore from it a handful of hundred- and thousand-dollar bills.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she yelled, throwing the money at him. \u201cDid you come for this, for your American money? For your ten thousand American dollars I found in your book? Did you come for this, so you could run to America without me? Or were you going to leave me some, as a kind of a thank you for opening your legs, Tatiana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania . . .\u201d</p><p>Grabbing his rifle by the barrel, she went up to Alexander and furiously shoved the butt of the gun into his stomach, pointing the muzzle at herself. \u201cI want back what you took from me.\u201d She nearly couldn\u2019t continue. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ever saved myself for you, but now shoot me, you liar and thief \u2014 that\u2019s what you want anyway. Take your damn hand away from my throat and pull the trigger.\u201d She jabbed him again, high in the solar plexus, putting the barrel between her breasts. \u201cGo ahead, Alexander,\u201d she said. \u201cThirty-five rounds, right here in my heart.\u201d</p><p>He took the weapon from her without saying a word.</p><p>Tatiana raised her hand and slapped him hard on the face. \u201cI want you to leave right now,\u201d she said, a tear rolling down her cheek. \u201cWe had some good times. We\u2019re certainly not going to have them again. You f*cked me,\u201d she said, \u201canytime you felt like it. I get it by now. It\u2019s the only thing you wanted from day one. Well, you got what you wanted, you\u2019re done, so go.\u201d Tatiana ripped the wedding ring off her finger and flung it at him. \u201cThere \u2014 you can give it to your next whore!\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders hunched and quaking, she climbed onto the bed, wrapping herself in a white sheet, like a body dead from the hunger.</p><p>Alexander went outside and went swimming in the cold Kama waters, wishing for his pain, his remorse, his love, for his whole life to be washed away into the tundra. The blue moon was three nights from full. If I stay in the water, maybe I can float in the river, down to the Volga, into the Caspian Sea, and no one will find me. I will float on my pain and my heart; I will float and feel no more. That\u2019s all I want. To feel no more.</p><p>Eventually he came back inside.</p><p>Climbing onto the bed, Alexander lay silently next to his Tania, listening for her breath. Every few minutes her breathing would break into the shudder of someone who had been crying for a long time. She lay in a fetal position, turned away from him to the wall.</p><p>Finally he unraveled her from the sheet and rubbed against her. Slightly parting her legs, he entered her, pressing his mouth to the nape of her neck and then to the top of her head. His left hand slipped under her to hold her to him, his right hand embraced her hip. He cradled her in himself, like always, as she cradled him in herself, like always.</p><p>Tatiana barely stirred. She did not pull away from him, but neither did she make a single sound. She is punishing me, Alexander thought, closing his eyes. I deserve much worse. Still, it was unbearable to hear her silence. Alexander kissed her head, her hair, her shoulders. He could not be deep enough in her enslaving warmth to find peace. At last she couldn\u2019t help herself, she groaned and shuddered and clutched his hand, and he did not stop himself from release this time. Afterward he remained inside her and then heard her crying.</p><p>\u201cTatiasha, I am so sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said those heartless things. I didn\u2019t mean them.\u201d He held her stomach into him.</p><p>\u201cYou meant them,\u201d Tatiana said emptily. \u201cYou\u2019re a soldier. You meant them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tania,\u201d Alexander said, hating himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I\u2019m your husband first.\u201d He held her close. \u201cFeel me, Tania, feel my body, feel my hands, my lips on you, feel my heart. I didn\u2019t mean them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, I wish you would stop saying things you don\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>He breathed in her smells, rubbing his face in her hair. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, but her hand remained on his. \u201cTurn to me?\u201d he asked, pulling himself away.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Turn to me, and tell me you forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana turned, lifting her swollen eyes to Alexander.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey . . .\u201d He paused, closing his eyes. He could not endure her expression. \u201cBreathe on me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want to smell your blueberry breath on my face.\u201d</p><p>She did. Alexander inhaled the warm spirit out of her lungs into his mouth and into his lungs. He hugged her. \u201cPlease tell me you forgive me, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgive you.\u201d Her voice was flat.</p><p>\u201cKiss me. I want to feel your lips forgive me.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him. He watched her close her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou have not forgiven me. Again.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana kissed him again softly. She kissed him, and then her mouth parted, and she made a small forgiving moaning sound. Her hands drifted down to take hold of him. Quietly she caressed him and caressed him. And caressed him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Alexander said, gazing at her. \u201cSay to me, Shura, I know you didn\u2019t mean it. You were just angry.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, she said, \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay to me, I know you love me to insanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tania,\u201d he said, raw emotion in his voice. \u201cI love you to insanity.\u201d He ran his lips back and forth against her silken eyebrows, unable to breathe, afraid he would exhale her breath out of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I hit you,\u201d Tatiana whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d she said, \u201cis that why you came here?\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep her voice from breaking. \u201cFor your . . . money?\u201d</p><p>Crushing her with his arms, he said, looking at the wall, \u201cTania, stop it. No, I did not come for my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get the American dollars from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother. I told you my family had money in America. My father decided he was going to come to the Soviet Union with nothing, and my mother agreed, but she brought this money with her just in case and hid it from him. This was the last thing my mother left me, a few weeks before she was arrested. We carved out the inside covers of the Pushkin book. We hid the money together. Ten thousand dollars on one side, four thousand rubles on the other. She thought that maybe it could help me get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you put it when you were arrested in 1936?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hid it in the Leningrad Public Library. And there it remained until I gave the book to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my prescient Alexander,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cyou gave it to me just in time, didn\u2019t you? The library shipped out most of its priceless items, including the entire Pushkin collection, way back last July and moved the rest of its books down to the cellar. Your money would have been long lost.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you give it to me? You wanted it to be in a safe place?\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned his gaze back to her. \u201cBecause I wanted to trust you with my one life,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tatiana was quiet.</p><p>\u201cThe book wasn\u2019t in the library the whole time, though, was it?\u201d</p><p>He made no reply.</p><p>\u201cIn 1940, when you went to fight Finland, you took the money with you, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He made no reply.</p><p>\u201cOh, Alexander.\u201d Tatiana buried her face in his chest.</p><p>Alexander wanted to speak. He just could not.</p><p>It was Tatiana who spoke. \u201cOne more thing for Dimitri not to forgive you for, as if there weren\u2019t enough already. When you went back for Stepanov\u2019s son, you took Dimitri with you because you two were going to escape through Finland, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Nothing moved on Alexander.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to run, through the swamps, right to Vyborg, and then to Helsinki, and then to America! You had brought your money, you were ready. It was the moment you had dreamed about for years.\u201d She kissed his chest. \u201cWasn\u2019t it, my husband, my heart, my Alexander, my entire life right here in this cabin, wasn\u2019t it, tell me?\u201d She was crying.</p><p>Alexander had lost his powers of speech. He was very nearly losing his powers over everything. He never wanted to have this out with Tatiana.</p><p>Her voice trembled. \u201cIt was a great plan. You would have disappeared, and no one would have ever gone to look for you \u2014 they would just have assumed you had died. You didn\u2019t count on Yuri Stepanov being alive. You thought he\u2019d be dead. It was just an excuse to return to the woods. Suddenly he was alive!\u201d Tatiana emitted a low laugh. \u201cOh, Dimitri must have been extremely surprised when you said you were going back with Yuri. What are you thinking, he must have said. Are you crazy? You\u2019ve wanted to go back to America for years. Here\u2019s your chance, here\u2019s my chance.\u201d She paused. \u201cHow close am I?\u201d</p><p>Nuzzling into her blonde head, Alexander finally said in a stunned whisper, \u201cAs if you were there. How do you know this?\u201d</p><p>She cupped his face in her hands. \u201cBecause I \u2014 better than anybody \u2014 know who you are.\u201d Tatiana paused, leaving her hands on his face. \u201cSo you returned to the Soviet Union with Stepanov\u2019s son, thinking you would have another chance to run. What did you have to do, Shura?\u201d she asked. \u201cPromise Dimitri that if you didn\u2019t die, one way or another you would get him to America?\u201d</p><p>He pushed away her hands and turned on his back, shutting his eyes. \u201cTania, stop. I can\u2019t continue this anymore. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She stopped only to get control of her faltering speech.</p><p>\u201cSo now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow nothing,\u201d Alexander said darkly, looking up at the beamed ceiling. \u201cNow you stay here and I go back to the front. Now Dimitri is crippled. Now I fight for Leningrad. Now I die for Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod! Don\u2019t say that!\u201d Tatiana grabbed his arms, turning him to her and, crying, clutched at his chest. He held her as close as he could, but it wasn\u2019t close enough, not for her, not for him. \u201cDon\u2019t say that, Shura!\u201d She was sobbing uncontrollably. \u201cShura, please,\u201d she barely whispered. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me by myself in the Soviet Union.\u201d</p><p>Alexander had never seen Tatiana so upset. He didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, his voice breaking, his heart breaking. Come on, Tatiana, love me less, let me go, free me.</p><p>Hours went by. In the deepest night, Alexander made love to her again. \u201cGo on, Tatiasha,\u201d he whispered, \u201cspread your legs for me like I love.\u201d</p><p>She tasted as if she were crying tears of nectar into his throat.</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d he said, kissing her blonde downy hair, licking the soft inside of her thighs, \u201cpromise me you will not leave Lazarevo.\u201d</p><p>There was no answer from her, just stifled moans.</p><p>\u201cAre you my good girl?\u201d he whispered, his fingers more tender, more persistent. \u201cAre you my lovely girl?\u201d he whispered, his mouth more gentle, more persistent, his hot breath imploring into her. \u201cSwear to me you will stay here and wait for me. Promise me you\u2019ll be a good wife and wait for your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise, Shura. I will wait for you.\u201d</p><p>Then, later, \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting a long time,\u201d Tatiana said brokenly, lying relieved and unrelieved in his arms, \u201chere alone in Lazarevo.\u201d</p><p>Hugging her to him so hard she could barely breathe, an utterly unrelieved Alexander whispered, \u201cAlone, but safe.\u201d</p><p>How they spent the next three days Alexander did not know. Awash in a flood of hostility and despair, they battled and railed and shattered their bodies on one another, unable to find one strand, one sobering swallow of solace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>22</p><p>The morning Alexander was leaving, they could not touch.</p><p>Tatiana sat on the bench outside while he packed. Alexander put on his dress uniform that she had washed and ironed for him with an iron warmed on the hearth, brushed his hair, and put on his sidecap. He made sure he had his helmet tied to him and his tent on his back. He had his pistol, his ammunition, his passport, his grenades, and his rifle.</p><p>He left her all of his money save for the few rubles it was going to cost him to get back.</p> <p>When he came out of the house, Tatiana, who had been sitting, got up and disappeared into the house, appearing a few minutes later with a cup of coffee, full of milk and sugar, and a plate of food. Some black bread, three eggs, a sliced tomato.</p><p>Alexander took the plate from her. He was choking. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Holding her stomach, she sat down heavily. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cEat. You have a long journey ahead of you.\u201d</p><p>Listlessly he ate as they sat almost side by side, if only she weren\u2019t turned one way and he another.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come to the train station with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>Finishing his food, Alexander put the plate on the ground. \u201cI\u2019ve left you plenty of wood, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he said, turning to her and pointing to the woodshed at the side of the cabin.</p><p>\u201cPlenty,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should last me a good long while.\u201d</p><p>Gently Alexander pulled the white satin ribbons from her braids. Taking his comb, he brushed out her smooth blonde hair, rubbing the silken strands between his fingers. \u201cHow do I arrange for my money to come to you here?\u201d Alexander asked. \u201cI get two thousand rubles a month. That\u2019s a lot of money for you. I can send you fifteen hundred. I\u2019ll keep five hundred for cigarettes.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t do it. You\u2019ll only get yourself into further trouble. Leningrad isn\u2019t Lazarevo, Shura. Protect yourself. Don\u2019t tell anyone we\u2019re married. Take the ring off your finger. You don\u2019t want Dimitri to find out somehow. We don\u2019t need more trouble for you. You already have plenty. I don\u2019t need your money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen send it to me when you write to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. The censors will steal it immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCensors? So I should avoid writing to you in my English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want me to live, yes.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t turn around when she said, \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will send the money to the local Soviet in Molotov,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cGo there once a month and check, all right? I\u2019ll say I\u2019m sending it to Dasha\u2019s family.\u201d Closing his eyes, Alexander pressed his lips to her gleaming hair. \u201cI\u2019d better go. There is only one train a day.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said in a stricken voice, \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the road. Have you got everything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>All this without looking at each other.</p><p>They left together and walked up the path through the woods. Before the clearing disappeared from view, Alexander turned around one last time to look at the blue river and the deep green pines, at their wood cabin and their bench, at their log in the water, at the place where his tent had stood just yesterday. At their fire.</p><p>\u201cWrite to me,\u201d Alexander said to Tatiana, \u201cand let me know how you\u2019re doing.\u201d He paused. \u201cSo I don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Her arms were twisted around her stomach. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>They got to the road. The pine needles smelled strong, the woods were quiet, the sun was warm overhead. They stood in front of each other, Tatiana in her yellow dress, looking at her bare feet, Alexander in his army uniform, rifle on his shoulder, looking down the road.</p><p>Her hand came up and patted him gently on the chest, pressing into his heart. \u201cYou keep yourself alive for me, soldier, you hear?\u201d Tears were running down her face.</p><p>Alexander took her hand and brought it to his lips. She was wearing his ring. He couldn\u2019t speak, couldn\u2019t say her name aloud.</p><p>Tatiana placed her trembling palm on Alexander\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, my love,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>She let go of his face. He let go of her hand. \u201cTurn around and go home,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t watch me. I can\u2019t walk away with you standing here.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana turned away. \u201cGo ahead. I won\u2019t watch you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander couldn\u2019t come near her. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t leave you like this. Please go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t want to go, but please let me. Knowing you\u2019re safe is the only chance I have of staying alive. I will make my way back to you, but you have to be safe.\u201d He stopped. \u201cNow I must go. Come on, lift your head to me. Lift your head to me, and smile.\u201d</p><p>Turning around, Tatiana lifted her crying face to him and smiled.</p><p>They stared at each other for a long moment. Tatiana blinked. Alexander blinked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that in your eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m watching all my wooden crates descend the ramp from the Winter Palace,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGot to have a little more faith, my wife.\u201d Alexander raised his shaking right hand to his temple, to his lips, to his heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>DESOLATE WAVES</p><p>TATIANA went back to their house, lay down on their bed, and did not get up.</p><p>During her semiconscious sleep Tatiana kept hearing the four old women in the room. They were talking quietly while fixing her blankets, adjusting the pillows under her head, stroking her hair.</p><p>Dusia said, \u201cShe needs to trust in the Lord. He will get her out of this.\u201d</p> <p>Naira said, \u201cI told her it wasn\u2019t a good idea to fall in love with a soldier. All they do is break your heart.\u201d</p><p>Raisa tremulously said, \u201cI think the problem isn\u2019t that he\u2019s a soldier. The problem is she loves him too much.\u201d</p><p>Axinya whispered, patting Tatiana\u2019s back, \u201cLucky girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s lucky?\u201d Naira said indignantly. \u201cIf only she had listened to us and stayed at our house, none of this would have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only she came to church with me more often,\u201d said Dusia. \u201cThe Lord\u2019s rod and His staff, they would comfort her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think, Tanechka?\u201d Axinya said, standing close to Tatiana. \u201cYou think the Lord\u2019s rod and staff would comfort you right now?\u201d</p><p>Naira said, \u201cThis is no good. We are not helping her.\u201d</p><p>Dusia: \u201cI never liked him.\u201d</p><p>Naira: \u201cMe neither. Never understood what Tania saw in him.\u201d</p><p>Raisa: \u201cShe is too good for him.\u201d</p><p>Naira: \u201cShe is too good for anybody.\u201d</p> <p>Dusia: \u201cShe can be even better, closer to the Lord.\u201d</p><p>Naira: \u201cMy Vova is such a kind, gentle boy. He cared for her.\u201d</p><p>Raisa: \u201cI bet you Alexander\u2019s not going to come back for her. He\u2019s left her here for good.\u201d</p><p>Naira: \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. He married her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dusia: \u201cSoiled her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Raisa: \u201cAnd discarded her.\u201d</p><p>Dusia: \u201cI always suspected he was godless.\u201d</p><p>Axinya whispered to Tatiana, \u201cThe only thing that will keep him away is death.\u201d</p> <p>Thank you, Axinya, thought Tatiana, opening her heavy eyes and lifting her body out of bed. But that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m afraid of.</p><p>The old girls convinced Tatiana without much effort to come back and live with them. Vova helped her to carry the trunk and sewing machine back to Naira\u2019s house.</p><p>At first Tatiana could not get through her day without physically holding herself together. There was no comfort inside her, and she knew it. There was nowhere she could turn to inside herself to leave the darkness. No memory she could fondly think of, no gentle joke, no musical refrain. There was no part of her body she could touch without shuddering. Nowhere she could look without seeing Alexander.</p><p>This time she didn\u2019t have the hunger to dull her sorrow. She didn\u2019t have infected lungs. There was nothing for her healthy body to do but grit its teeth and lift the buckets that went on her shoulders every morning, and milk the goat and pour the warm milk for Raisa, who could not pour it herself, and hang the clothes on the line and have the women say at night how wonderful the clothes smelled, having been hung by Tania in the sunshine.</p><p>Tatiana sewed for them and for herself, she read to them and to herself, she bathed them and herself, she tended their garden and looked after their chickens and took the apples off the trees, and little by little, bucket by bucket, book by book, shirt by shirt, their need enveloped her again, and Tatiana was comforted.</p><p>Just like before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>After two weeks came the first letter from Alexander.</p><p>Tatiasha,</p><p>Can there be anything harder than this? Missing you is a physical aching that grips me early in the morning and does not leave me, not even as I draw my last waking breath.</p> <p>My solace in these waning empty summer days is the knowledge that you\u2019re safe, and alive, and healthy, and that the worst that you have to go through is serfdom for four well-meaning old women.</p><p>The wood piles I\u2019ve left are the lightest in the front. The heaviest ones are for the winter. Use them last, and if you need help carrying them, God help me, ask Vova. Don\u2019t hurt yourself. And don\u2019t fill the water pails all the way to the top. They\u2019re too heavy.</p><p>Getting back was rough, and as soon as I came back, I was sent right out to the Neva, where for six days we planned our attack and then made a move in boats across the river and were completely crushed in two hours. We didn\u2019t stand a chance. The Germans bombed the boats with the Vanyushas, their version of my rocket launcher, the boats all sank. We were left with a thousand fewer men and were no closer to crossing the river. We\u2019re now looking at other places we can cross. I\u2019m fine, except for the fact that it\u2019s rained here for ten days straight and I\u2019ve been hip deep in mud for all that time. There is nowhere to sleep, except in the mud. We put our trench coats down and hope it stops raining soon. All black and wet, I almost felt sorry for myself until I thought of you during the blockade.</p><p>I\u2019ve decided to do that from now on. Every time I think I have it so tough, I\u2019m going to think of you burying your sister in Lake Ladoga.</p><p>I wish you had been given a lighter cross than Leningrad to carry through your life.</p> <p>Things are going to be relatively quiet here for the next few weeks, until we regroup. Yesterday a bomb fell in the commandant\u2019s bunker. The commandant wasn\u2019t there at the time. Yet the anxiety doesn\u2019t go away. When is it going to come again?</p><p>I play cards and soccer. And I smoke. And I think of you.</p><p>I sent you money. Go to Molotov at the end of August.</p><p>Don\u2019t forget to eat well, my warm bun, my midnight sun, and kiss your hand for me, right in the palm and then press it against your heart.</p><p>Alexander</p><p>Tatiana read Alexander\u2019s letter a hundred times, memorizing every word. She slept with her face on the letter, which renewed her strength.</p> <p>My love, my dear, dear Shura,</p><p>Don\u2019t talk about my cross \u2014 first heave your own off your shoulders.</p><p>How did I live last winter? I don\u2019t know, but I think almost longingly of it now. Because I moved. There was movement inside me. I had energy to lie, to pretend to Dasha, to keep her alive. I walked, I was with Mama, I was too busy to die myself. Too busy hiding my love for you.</p><p>But now I wake up and think, how am I going to go through the rest of my day until sleep?</p><p>To ease myself back into life, I\u2019ve surrounded myself with the villagers. You think it was bad before. I\u2019m from morning till night helping Irina Persikova, who had to have her leg cut off in Molotov, infection or something. I think I like her because she carries my mother\u2019s name.</p><p>I think of Dasha. I grieve for my sister.</p><p>But her face is not the last face I see before I sleep. Yours is.</p><p>You are my hand grenade, my artillery fire. You have replaced my heart with yourself.</p> <p>Are you thinking of me with your rifle in your hands?</p><p>What do we do? How do we keep you from dying? These thoughts consume my waking minutes. What can I do from here to keep you alive?</p><p>Dead or wounded, those Soviets will leave you in the field.</p><p>Who is going to heal you if you fall?</p><p>Who is going to bury you if you die? Bury you like you deserve \u2014 with kings and heroes.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Tatiana</p><p>Tatia,</p><p>You ask how I keep myself from dying. Poorly, I say. Though still better than Ivan Petrenko.</p><p>My commander tells me \u2014 choose the best men you have, and I salute him, and do. And then they die. What does that make me?</p><p>We came under the worst unprotected fire today. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m alive to write you these words. We were supplying the men across the river at the Nevsky Patch. We row the boats with food and arms and munitions and new men to the other side. But the Germans are relentless from Sinyavino Heights, we can\u2019t get past them or to them; they sit on their hills like vultures and hurl their metal at us. Usually I don\u2019t go \u2014 there\u2019s not enough of me to go on these suicide missions, and the commander knows it, but today we just didn\u2019t have enough soldiers to man the boats.</p><p>Petrenko died. We were in the boat coming back to our side, and a piece of artillery shell hit him. Took his arm off. I threw him on my back, and, you know, in my insanity I bent down to pick up his arm. I picked it up and he fell off my back, and as I looked at him lying in the boat I thought, what am I doing? Who is going to sew that arm back on?</p><p>I didn\u2019t want him and his arm reunited, I realized. I just wanted them to be buried together. There is no dignity in the man being ripped apart. The body has to be together so the soul can find it. I buried him and his arm by the woods, near a small birch. He had once said he liked birches. Had to take his rifle \u2014 we barely have enough weapons as it is \u2014 but I left him his helmet.</p><p>I liked him. Where is the justice that a good man like Petrenko dies and yet Dimitri, infirm and hobbled, still lives?</p><p>You want to know what I thought of in that boat?</p><p>I thought, I have to stay alive. Tatiasha will never forgive me.</p><p>But this war is unjust, as you\u2019ve seen. A good man has as much chance of dying as a bad one. Maybe more so.</p><p>I want you to know that should something happen to me, don\u2019t worry about my body. My soul isn\u2019t going to return to it, nor to God. It\u2019s flying straight to you, where it knows it can find you, in Lazarevo. I want to be neither with kings nor heroes, but with the queen of Lake Ilmen.</p><p>Alexander </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>3</p><p>There were no more letters from Alexander.</p><p>August passed quietly into September, and still no letters. Tatiana did the best she could, drowning herself with the old women, with her village, with her books, with her English, with John Stuart Mill, whom she read out loud to herself in the woods, almost understanding everything.</p><p>Still nothing from him, and her soul wasn\u2019t quiet anymore, and it wasn\u2019t comforted.</p> <p>One Friday at the knitting circle, Tatiana, her head buried in the sweater she was making for Alexander, heard Irina Persikova ask if she had received any letters from him.</p><p>\u201cNot for a month now,\u201d said Naira quietly. \u201cShh. We don\u2019t talk about it. The Molotov Soviet has no news. She goes every week to check. Shh.\u201d</p><p>Dusia said, \u201cEither way, God is with him.\u201d</p><p>Axinya jovially said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tanechka. The post is terrible. You know that. Letters take a long time to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Axinya,\u201d said Tatiana, looking at her knitting needles. \u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a story that\u2019ll make you feel better. A woman named Olga lived in the village here a few months before you came, and her husband was at the front, too. She waited and waited for letters from him. Nothing. Like you she fretted and waited, and then she got ten letters all at once!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana smiled. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be great?\u201d she said. \u201cTo get ten letters from Alexander all at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, darling.\u201d Axinya smiled. \u201cSo don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Dusia said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. Olga put the letters in chronological order and started reading them. She read nine of them, and the tenth letter was from the commandant, saying her husband had been killed at the front.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana paled. \u201cOh\u201d was all she could get out.</p><p>\u201cDusia!\u201d Axinya exclaimed. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, have you no sense? Next you\u2019re going to tell her how Olga drowned herself in the Kama.\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana put down her knitting needles. \u201cYou ladies finish up here without me, all right? I\u2019m going to go and start on our dinner. I\u2019m making cabbage pie.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled home and immediately got the Pushkin book out of the trunk. Alexander had told her he put the money back. Looking at the cover, looking and looking, Tatiana took a deep breath and carefully cut off the paper with a razor blade. The money was there. Breathing out a small sigh, she took it into her hands.</p><p>Then she counted it.</p><p>Five thousand dollars.</p><p>Without alarm she counted the crisp new bills again, taking care to separate each one. Ten one-hundred-dollar bills. Four one-thousand-dollar bills.</p><p>Five thousand dollars.</p><p>She counted it again.</p><p>Five thousand dollars.</p> <p>Tatiana started doubting herself; for a moment she thought maybe it had always been five thousand dollars, that she had just mistaken the amount.</p><p>If only Alexander\u2019s voice in the kerosene-lamp-filled night didn\u2019t carry from her brain to her heart: This was the last thing my mother left me, a few weeks before she was arrested. . . . We hid the money together. Ten thousand American dollars . . . four thousand rubles.</p><p>Tatiana climbed on top of her bed and lay on her back, facing the beamed ceiling.</p><p>He had told her he was leaving her all the money.</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t say that. He said, I\u2019m leaving you the money. She had watched him glue the cover back together.</p><p>Why would he take only five thousand dollars?</p><p>To mollify her? To have her not worry, not make another scandalous scene? Not return to Leningrad with him?</p><p>She held the money to her chest and tried to fathom Alexander\u2019s heart.</p><p>He was the man who, a few meters away from freedom, from America, had chosen to turn his back on his lifelong dream. Feel one way. Behave one way, too. Alexander may have hoped for America, but he believed more in himself. And he loved Tatiana most of all. Alexander knew who he was.</p><p>He was a man who kept his word.</p><p>And he had given it to Dimitri. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Part Four</p><p>IN LIVE DEFIANCE</p><p>WORN OUT WITH TERROR AND MISGIVING</p><p>TATIANA wasn\u2019t staying another second in Lazarevo by herself.</p> <p>She wrote Alexander ten letters, relaxed, upbeat, comfortable letters. She made her news chronological and seasonal. She enlisted Naira Mikhailovna\u2019s help in sending them to Alexander one by one, at an interval of one every week.</p><p>She knew that if she just left without a word, the old ladies would write to Alexander or, worse, find a way to telegraph Alexander a frantic missive telling him of her disappearance, and if he were still alive to hear it, his uncontrolled reaction might cost him his life. So Tatiana told the women that to avoid having to get a job at the Lazarevo fish plant, where most of the villagers worked, she was going to Molotov to work in the hospital. Tatiana invited no argument, and after the first few muttered questions from Dusia, got none.</p><p>Naira Mikhailovna wanted to know why Tatiana couldn\u2019t send the letters straight from Molotov. Tatiana replied that Alexander didn\u2019t want her to leave Lazarevo, and he would be upset if he found out she was working in town. She didn\u2019t want to upset him while he was fighting. \u201cYou know how protective he can be, Naira Mikhailovna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtective and unreasonable,\u201d Naira said, vigorously nodding. She was more than willing to enlist as a co-conspirator in what she saw as a plot to circumvent Alexander\u2019s impossible character. She agreed to send him the letters.</p><p>Having sewn herself all new clothes, and having packed as many bottles of vodka and tushonka as she could carry, Tatiana set out early one morning after saying good-bye to the four old women. Dusia said a prayer over her head. Naira cried. Raisa cried and shook. Axinya leaned in and whispered, \u201cYou are crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Crazy for him, thought Tatiana. She left wearing dark brown trousers, brown stockings, brown boots, and a brown winter coat. Her light hair was tied in a plaid brown kerchief. She wanted to draw as little attention to herself as possible. She had sewn the dollars into an inseam flap on her trousers. Before she left, she took off her wedding ring and threaded it through a braided rope she had made. As she kissed it before tucking it inside her shirt, she whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re just closer to my heart this way, Shura.\u201d</p><p>As she was walking through the woods out of Lazarevo, Tatiana passed the path that led to their clearing. Stopping briefly, she thought about going down to the river and glancing . . . one last time. The thought alone \u2014 the imagining \u2014 was too much for her. Shaking her head, she continued onward.</p><p>There were some things she could not do.</p><p>She had watched Alexander steal one look; she could not. Since Vova had carried her trunk up the path over two months ago, Tatiana had not returned to the place where she had lived with Alexander. Vova boarded up the windows, put the padlock back on, and carried all of Alexander\u2019s cut wood to Naira\u2019s house.</p><p>In Molotov, Tatiana first went to the local Soviet to see if there was any money from Alexander for September.</p><p>Surprisingly, there was!</p> <p>She asked if there was any telegram or letter with the money. There wasn\u2019t.</p><p>If he was still getting soldier\u2019s pay, it meant that he had neither died nor deserted. Taking the 1,500 rubles, Tatiana wondered what would make Alexander send her ring money but not write? Then she remembered the months it had taken for her grandmother\u2019s letters to reach them in Leningrad. Well, she didn\u2019t care if she got thirty letters from Alexander all at once, one for each day of September.</p><p>At the train station in Molotov, Tatiana told the Party domestic passport inspector that Leningrad was experiencing a dire shortage of nurses, what with the war and the hunger, and she was returning to help. She showed him the employment stamp from Grechesky Hospital in her passport. He didn\u2019t have to know she had washed floors and toilets and dishes and sewed body bags. For his help Tatiana offered him a bottle of vodka.</p><p>He asked for the letter from the hospital inviting her to return to Leningrad. Tatiana replied that the letter got burned, but here were her credentials from the Kirov factory, from the Grechesky Hospital, and here was a citation for valor in the Fourth People\u2019s Volunteer Army, and here was another bottle of vodka for his trouble.</p><p>He stamped her passport, and she bought her ticket.</p><p>Before she boarded her train, she went to see Sofia, who was so excruciatingly slow, Tatiana felt herself aging as she waited. Tatiana thought she would miss her train for sure, but Sofia finally managed to procure the two photographs she had taken of Alexander and Tatiana on the steps of St. Seraphim\u2019s church on their wedding day. Tatiana stuffed them in her backpack and ran to catch her train.</p><p>The train she was departing on was much better than the one on which she had arrived. It was a semblance of a passenger train, and it was going southwest to Kazan. Southwest was the wrong direction for Tatiana, who needed to be heading north. But Kazan was a big city, and she would be able to catch another train. Her plan was to somehow make her way back to Kobona and to catch a barge across Lake Ladoga to Kokkorevo.</p><p>As the train was pulling out, Tatiana looked across the road at the Kama in the far distance, obscured by pines and birches, and thought, will I ever see Lazarevo again?</p> <p>She did not think so.</p><p>In Kazan, Tatiana got on a train headed to Nizhny Novgorod \u2014 not the Novgorod of her childhood and of Pasha, another Novgorod. She was now less than 300 kilometers east of Moscow. She caught another train, this one a freight train heading northwest to Yaroslavl, and from there a bus north to Vologda.</p><p>In Vologda, Tatiana found that she could take the train to Tikhvin, but that Tikhvin was under constant and oppressive German fire. And from Tikhvin getting to Kobona was apparently impossible. The trains were being knocked out of operation three to four times a day, with heavy loss of life and supplies. Thank God for the train inspector, who sold her the ticket to Tikhvin and who was more than willing to chat with her.</p><p>She asked the inspector how the food was getting into the blockaded Leningrad if the Kobona route was blocked by German fire.</p><p>After she found out, Tatiana decided to follow the food. From Vologda she took a train headed for Petrozavodsk, far north on the western shores of Lake Onega, and simply got off early, in Podporozhye, and walked fifty kilometers to Lodeinoye Pole, which was ten kilometers from the shores of Lake Ladoga.</p><p>In Lodeinoye Pole, Tatiana felt the earth rumbling underneath her feet and knew she was close.</p><p>While stopping at a canteen to have some soup and bread, Tatiana overheard four transport drivers talking at the next table. Apparently the Germans had practically stopped bombing Leningrad, diverting all their air power and artillery to the Volkhov front \u2014 where Tatiana was headed. The Soviet general Meretskov\u2019s 2nd Army was only four kilometers away from the Neva, and the German field marshal Manstein was determined not to let Meretskov push him from his positions along the river. Tatiana heard one of the men say, \u201cDid you hear about our 861st division? Could not move the Germans at all, spent all day under their fire, and lost 65 percent of its men and 100 percent of its commanding officers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing!\u201d another exclaimed. \u201cDid you hear how many men Meretskov lost in August-September in Volkhov? How many dead, wounded, missing in action? One hundred and thirty thousand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a lot?\u201d said another. \u201cIn Moscow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of one hundred and fifty thousand men!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana had had quite enough of listening to other people\u2019s discussions. But she needed just a little bit more information. After striking up a conversation with the truck drivers, she found out that food barges departed on Lake Ladoga just south of a small town called Syastroy, about ten kilometers north of the Volkhov front. Syastroy was about a hundred kilometers south from where Tatiana was at the moment.</p><p>Tatiana was going to ask the men for a ride but didn\u2019t like the sound of them. They were staying in Lodeinoye Pole overnight, and the way one of them looked at her, even with her brown plaid kerchief . . .</p><p>She wiped her mouth, thanked them, and left. She felt better knowing she was carrying Alexander\u2019s loaded P-38.</p><p>It took Tatiana three days to walk the hundred kilometers to Syastroy. It was early October and cold, but the first snow had not fallen yet, and the road was paved. Many other people walked along with her \u2014 villagers, evacuees, itinerant farmers, occasionally soldiers returning to the front. She walked for half a day next to one who was returning from furlough. He looked as forlorn as Alexander must have felt. Then he caught a ride from an army truck, and Tatiana kept walking.</p><p>The bursting roar of heavy bombs exploding in the near distance never stopped shaking the earth underneath her feet as she walked, her pack on her back, her eyes to the ground. No matter how bad this seemed, it was better than running through the potato field in Luga. It was better than sitting in the train station in Luga, realizing that the Germans weren\u2019t leaving until Tatiana was dead. It was better than that, but not much. She kept walking, her eyes to the ground.</p><p>She walked even at night \u2014 it was calmer at night, and after eleven there were no bombings. She would walk for another few hours and then find a barn to sleep in. One night she stayed with a family who offered her dinner and their oldest son. She ate the dinner, passed on the son, offering money instead. They took it.</p><p>Ten kilometers west of Syastroy, right on the Volkhov River, Tatiana found a small barge about to take off across the lake around the horn of Novaya Ladoga. The longshoreman was untying the rope. She waited as the plank was just about to go up and then ran up to the man and told him she had food for the war effort, for the blockade, taking out five cans of ham and a bottle of vodka. The longshoreman stared longingly at the vodka. Tatiana asked him to keep the vodka for himself and let her go to see her dying mother in Leningrad. Tatiana knew this was a dire time for local people. Most of their relatives who had lived in Leningrad were either dead or dying. The dockhand gratefully kept the vodka and waved her on. \u201cWarning you, though \u2014 it\u2019s a bad passage. Too long in the water, and the Germans bomb the barges all day long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d She crossed without incident.</p><p>The barge came to Osinovets, north of Kokkorevo, where Tatiana offered the rest of her tushonka \u2014 four cans \u2014 and another bottle of vodka to the truck driver who was taking food to Leningrad. He let her sit in the front with him and even shared some bread with her as they drove.</p><p>Tatiana stared out the window. Was she really going to be able to go back to her Fifth Soviet apartment? As if she had much choice.</p><p>But to go back to Leningrad?</p><p>She shivered. She didn\u2019t want to think about it. The driver dropped her off at Finland Station in the north of the city. She took a tram back to Nevsky Prospekt and walked home from Insurrection Square.</p><p>Leningrad was sad and empty. It was nighttime, and the streets were poorly lit, but at least there was electricity. Tatiana must have come at a good time, because it was quiet; there was no shelling. But as she walked, she saw three smoldering fires and many broken shambling gaps where windows and doors had once been.</p><p>She hoped her building on Fifth Soviet was still standing.</p><p>It was. Still green, still drab, still filthy.</p><p>Tatiana stood for a few minutes at the double front doors. She was searching for the thing Alexander called courage.</p><p>The courage to go back up the stairs that led to the two empty rooms where six other hearts had once lived. Rooms filled with jokes and vodka and dinners and small dreams and small desires and life.</p><p>She looked up and down the street. Across Grechesky the church still stood, untouched and unbombed. Turning her head to Suvorovsky, she saw a few people going into their buildings, coming home from work. Just a few people, maybe three. The pavement was clear and dry. The cold air was hurting her nose.</p><p>It was for him.</p><p>His heart was still beating, and it called to her.</p><p>He was going to be her courage.</p><p>She nodded to herself and turned the handle. The dark green hallway smelled of urine. Holding on to the railing, Tatiana slowly walked up three flights of stairs to her communal apartment.</p><p>Her key worked in the glossy brown door.</p><p>The apartment was quiet. There was no one in the front kitchen, and the doors to the other rooms were closed. All closed, except for Slavin\u2019s, whose door was slightly ajar. Tatiana knocked, looked in.</p><p>Slavin was on his floor, listening to the radio.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he said in a shrill voice.</p><p>\u201cTania Metanova, remember? How are you?\u201d She smiled. Some things never changed.</p><p>\u201cWere you here during the War of 1905? Oh, did we give those Japs hell.\u201d He pointed his finger to the radio. \u201cListen, listen carefully.\u201d</p><p>Just the sound of the metronome, beat beat beat.</p><p>Quietly she backed away. The Russians lost that war. Slavin looked up from the floor at her and said, \u201cYou should have come last month, Tanechka \u2014 only seven bombs fell on Leningrad last month. You would have been safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you need anything, I\u2019m right down the hall.\u201d</p><p>There was no one in her kitchen either. To her surprise, the door to her hallway and her two rooms was unlocked. In the hallway on her sofa she found two strangers, a man and a woman drinking tea.</p><p>Tatiana stood for a moment staring at them. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked at last.</p><p>They said they were Inga and Stanislav Krakov. They were both in their forties; he was paunchy and spottily balding, she was small and wizened.</p><p>\u201cBut who are you?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d demanded Stanislav, not even looking at her.</p><p>Tatiana put down her backpack. \u201cThese are my rooms,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting on my sofa.\u201d</p><p>Inga quickly explained that they had lived on Seventh Soviet and Suvorovsky. \u201cWe had a nice apartment, our own apartment,\u201d she said. \u201cOur own bathroom, and kitchen, and a bedroom.\u201d Apparently their building was bombed to the ground in August. With the shortage of housing in Leningrad because of so many demolished buildings, the Soviet council placed Inga and Stanislav in the Metanov rooms, which were unoccupied. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Inga. \u201cThey\u2019ll find us our own apartment soon; they said, maybe even a two-bedroom. Right, Stan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m back now,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cThe rooms are no longer unoccupied.\u201d She looked around the hallway. Alexander had cleaned the place so well, she thought with sadness.</p><p>\u201cYes? And where are we supposed to go?\u201d asked Stan. \u201cWe are registered with the council to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other rooms in the communal apartment?\u201d she asked. The other rooms \u2014 where other people had died.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all taken,\u201d said Stan. \u201cListen, why are we still talking about this? There\u2019s enough space here. You can have a whole room to yourself. What\u2019s to complain about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth rooms are mine, though,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cActually, no,\u201d said Stan, continuing to drink his tea. \u201cBoth rooms belong to the state. And the state is at war.\u201d He laughed joylessly. \u201cYou are not being a good proletarian, comrade.\u201d</p><p>Inga said, \u201cStan and I are Party members in the Leningrad corps of engineers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d said Tatiana, suddenly feeling very tired. \u201cWhich room can I take?\u201d</p><p>Inga and Stan had taken her old room, where she had slept with Dasha, with Mama, with Papa, with Pasha. It was also the only room with heat. Deda and Babushka\u2019s old room had a broken stove in it.</p><p>Even if the stove weren\u2019t broken, Tatiana had no wood to heat it.</p><p>\u201cCould I at least have my bourzhuika back?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd what will we use?\u201d said Stan.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name anyway?\u201d asked Inga.</p><p>\u201cTania.\u201d</p><p>Sheepishly Inga said, \u201cTania, why don\u2019t you move the little cot to the wall near where the stove is on our side? The wall is warm. Do you want Stan to help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInga, stop, you know my back is bad,\u201d snapped Stan. \u201cShe can move it herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana. She moved Deda\u2019s sofa just far enough to sandwich Pasha\u2019s little cot in between the back of the sofa and the wall.</p><p>The wall was warm.</p><p>Tatiana slept for seventeen hours covered by her coat and three blankets.</p><p>After waking, she went to the Soviet council housing committee to register herself once again as a resident of Leningrad. \u201cWhat did you come back for?\u201d the woman behind the desk asked her rudely, filling out documents for a new ration card. \u201cWe\u2019re still under blockade, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cBut there\u2019s a shortage of nurses. The war is still on.\u201d She paused. \u201cSomeone has to take care of the soldiers, right?\u201d</p><p>The older woman shrugged, not lifting her eyes. Is anyone in this city going to lift their eyes and look at me? thought Tatiana. Just one person. \u201cSummer was better,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMore food. Now you won\u2019t be able to get potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Tatiana said, twinging with pain, remembering the potato counter Alexander had built in Lazarevo.</p><p>With her ration card in hand, she went to the Elisey food store on Nevsky. She couldn\u2019t bear to go back to the store on Fontanka and Nekrasova where she used to get the family rations a year ago. In Elisey it was too late for bread, but she did get some real milk, some beans, an onion, and four tablespoons of oil. For a hundred rubles she bought a can of tushonka. Since she wasn\u2019t working yet, her bread ration was only 350 grams, but for workers it rose to 700. Tatiana planned to get a job.</p><p>Tatiana looked for a bourzhuika but had no luck. She even went to Gostiny Dvor shopping center, across from Elisey on Nevsky, but couldn\u2019t find anything there. She had 3,000 rubles left of Alexander\u2019s money, and she would have gladly spent half of it on a bourzhuika to keep her warm, but there was none to be found. With her bag of food Tatiana walked across Nevsky, past the European Hotel, down Mikhailovskaya Ulitsa, crossed the street into the Italian Gardens, and sat on the bench where Alexander had told her about America.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move, not even when the bombing started, not even when she saw shelling down Mikhailovskaya and across Nevsky. She watched a bomb fall on the pavement and explode in a black flame. Alexander will be so angry when he finds out I\u2019m here, Tatiana thought, finally getting up and heading home. But she wanted him alive; she didn\u2019t care if he killed her. She had seen Alexander\u2019s temper \u2014 he had lost his mind during their last days in Lazarevo. How Alexander got sane \u2014 if Alexander got sane \u2014 after he left her, Tatiana did not know.</p><p>She went back to work at Grechesky Hospital. She had been right. The hospital was in dire need of help. The administration officer saw her former Grechesky employment stamp, asked if she had been a nurse, and Tatiana replied that she had been a nurse\u2019s aide and that it would take her no time at all to brush up on her skills. She asked to be placed in the critical care unit. She was given a white uniform and followed a nurse named Elizaveta for one nine-hour shift and then a nurse named Maria for another nine-hour shift. The nurses did not lift their eyes to Tatiana.</p><p>But the patients did.</p><p>After two weeks of working eighteen-hour days, Tatiana was finally given her own rounds and a Sunday afternoon off. She got up her courage to go to Pavlov barracks.</p><p>2</p><p>Tatiana needed just a word that Alexander was all right and where he was stationed.</p><p>The sentry at the gate was no one she knew; his name was Viktor Burenich. The young soldier was friendly and eager to help. She liked that. He checked the roster of all the soldiers currently at the barracks and told her that Alexander Belov was not there. She asked if he knew where the captain was. The guard replied with a smile that he did not. \u201cBut he\u2019s all right as far as you know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The guard shrugged. \u201cI think so, but they don\u2019t tell me these things.\u201d</p><p>Holding her breath, Tatiana asked if Dimitri Chernenko was still alive.</p><p>He was. Tatiana exhaled. Burenich said Chernenko wasn\u2019t at the garrison at present, but that he constantly came and went with supplies.</p><p>Tatiana tried to think of who else she knew. \u201cIs Anatoly Marazov here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He was, what luck.</p><p>In a few minutes Tatiana saw Marazov through the gate.</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d He seemed glad to see her. \u201cWhat a surprise to see you here. Alexander had told me you evacuated with your sister.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lieutenant,\u201d she said, her eyes welling up involuntarily. She was extremely relieved. If Marazov mentioned Alexander so offhandedly, it meant that everything was all right.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you, Tania,\u201d Marazov said.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you haven\u2019t upset me.\u201d They stood in the passageway.</p><p>\u201cYou want to walk around the block?\u201d Marazov asked her. \u201cI have a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>They strolled with their coats buttoned to Palace Square.</p><p>\u201cAre you here to see Dimitri? He\u2019s not in my unit anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know,\u201d she said, and stammered. Could she keep all the lies in her head? How would she have known about Dimitri? \u201cI know he was injured. I saw him at Kobona a few months back.\u201d And if she wasn\u2019t here to see Dimitri, who was she here to see?</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s now on this side. Running. Unhappy about that, too. I just don\u2019t know what he wants the war to give him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still in . . . Alexander\u2019s destroyer company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Alexander doesn\u2019t have a company anymore. He was wounded\u2014\u201d Marazov broke off as Tatiana stumbled. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Yes, of course. I tripped,\u201d she said, crossing her arms around her stomach. She thought that any minute she was going to faint. She had to keep herself together at all costs. She had to. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis hands were burned in an attack in September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis hands?\u201d His hands.</p><p>\u201cYes. Second-degree burns. Couldn\u2019t hold a cup of water for weeks. He\u2019s better now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack at the front.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t continue anymore. \u201cLieutenant, maybe we should go back. I really must get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Marazov said, puzzled, as they turned around. \u201cWhy did you come back to Leningrad anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of nurses. I came back to be a nurse.\u201d She quickened her step. \u201cAre you posted to Shlisselburg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually, yes. We have a new base of operations for the Leningrad front, up in Morozovo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorozovo? Listen \u2014 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re all right. What\u2019s next for you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost so many men trying to break the blockade, we\u2019re constantly regrouping. But next time out I think I\u2019m with Alexander again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d she said, her legs weakening. \u201cWell, I hope so. Listen, it was good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, are you all right?\u201d Marazov stared at her, that look of sad familiarity creeping into his eyes again. Tatiana remembered his face when he met her for the first time, last September. He had looked at her as if he already knew her.</p><p>She managed a small smile. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Stiffly she came up to him and laid her hand on his sleeve. \u201cThank you, Lieutenant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I tell Dimitri you stopped by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Tatiana was nearly down the street when he yelled, \u201cShould I tell Alexander?\u201d</p><p>She turned around. \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d she called back faintly.</p><p>The following night when Tatiana came home from the hospital, she found Dimitri waiting for her in the hallway with Stan and Inga.</p><p>\u201cDimitri?\u201d said a shocked Tatiana. \u201cWhat \u2014 how \u2014 what are you doing here?\u201d She glared at Stan and Inga.</p><p>\u201cWe let him in, Tanechka,\u201d said Inga. \u201cHe said you used to see each other last year?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri came up to Tatiana and put his arms around her. She stood with her own arms at her side. \u201cI heard you came asking for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so touched. You want to go inside your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you I stopped by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurenich, the sentry guard. He said a young girl stopped by asking for me. You didn\u2019t leave your name, but he described you. I\u2019m very touched, Tania. These have been very hard months for me.\u201d</p><p>He was lopsided and hollow-eyed.</p><p>\u201cDimitri, this is not a good time for me,\u201d she said, casting an angry glance toward Inga and Stan. She turned her face away from him. \u201cI\u2019m very tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be hungry. You want to have dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ate at the hospital,\u201d Tatiana lied. \u201cAnd I have almost nothing here.\u201d How to get him to go, just go? \u201cI have to wake up tomorrow at five. I have two nine-hour shifts back to back. I\u2019m on my feet all day. Another time, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tania. I don\u2019t know if there will be another time,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cCome on. Maybe you can make me some tea. A little something to eat? For old times?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana could not even imagine Alexander\u2019s reaction when he found out that Dimitri was in the room with her. This was not in her plans \u2014 to deal with him. She didn\u2019t know what to do about him. But then she thought, Alexander still has to deal with him. So I have to deal with him. He is not just Alexander\u2019s. He is ours.</p><p>Tatiana fried Dimitri some soybeans on a Primus stove that she had borrowed from Slavin in return for occasionally cooking for him. She threw in a few small carrots with the beans and a piece of old onion. She gave him some black bread with a spoonful of butter. When Dimitri asked for vodka, Tatiana told him she was all out, not wanting him to get drunk while she was alone with him. The room was poorly illuminated by a kerosene lamp; there was electricity, but Tatiana couldn\u2019t find any lightbulbs in the stores.</p><p>He ate with the plate on his lap. She sat on the far end of the couch and realized she had not taken off her coat yet. She took off her coat, and while he ate, she went and made herself a cup of tea.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so cold in this room?\u201d Dimitri asked.</p><p>\u201cNo heat,\u201d replied Tatiana. She was still wearing her nurse\u2019s uniform, and her hair was tied back in a nurse\u2019s white head kerchief.</p><p>\u201cSo, Tania, tell me \u2014 how have you been? You look good,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like a girl anymore.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou look like a young woman. You look older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough things happen to you,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cand you almost can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look very good. This war agrees with you.\u201d Dimitri smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve gained weight since I saw you last\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tatiana leveled a look at him that stopped him. \u201cDimitri,\u201d she said quietly, \u201clast time you saw me, I was in Kobona, asking for your help to bury my sister. Maybe you\u2019ve forgotten. But I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, oh, I know,\u201d he said, with a casual drift of his hand. \u201cWe just completely lost touch. But I never stopped thinking about you. I\u2019m glad you made it out of Kobona. Many people didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister, for one.\u201d Tatiana wanted to ask how in the world could he have looked Alexander in the face and lied about Dasha, but Tatiana could not bear to say her husband\u2019s name in front of Dimitri.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your sister,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cMy parents died, too. So I know how you feel.\u201d Dimitri paused. Tatiana waited. Waited for him to finish eating and leave.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get back to Leningrad?\u201d Dimitri asked her.</p><p>Tatiana told him.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to talk about herself. She didn\u2019t want to talk about anything. Where was Dasha, where was Alexander, where were Mama and Papa, surrounding Tatiana so she wouldn\u2019t have to sit in the room alone with Dimitri?</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Tatiana asked him what he was doing with himself, now that he looked to be permanently injured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a runner. Do you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana knew what a runner was. But she shook her head. If he was talking about himself, he was not asking her questions.</p><p>\u201cI get supplies for the front lines and for the rear units from trucks, from planes, from ships, and I distribute them around\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you distribute them? Here in Leningrad?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHere, yes. Also to various delivery points on this side of the Neva. And to the Karelian side near Finland.\u201d Glancing at her sideways, Dimitri said, \u201cDo you see why I\u2019m so unhappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cThe war is dangerous. You don\u2019t want to be in this war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be in this country,\u201d Dimitri mumbled, barely heard.</p><p>But heard.</p><p>\u201cDid you say you deliver to the Finnish line?\u201d she asked, her voice fading with her strength.</p><p>\u201cYes, to the border troops on the Karelian Isthmus. I also deliver to our new headquarters for the Neva operations in Morozovo. The command post was built there, while we plan our next move\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere on the Karelian Isthmus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of a place called Lisiy Nos . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d Tatiana said, holding on to the arm of the couch.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Dimitri smiled. \u201cI also bring supplies on foot from quarters to quarters. Do you know, Tania, I even bring in supplies for the generals!\u201d he said, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d she said, barely listening. \u201cAnyone interesting?\u201d</p><p>Lowering his voice, Dimitri said, \u201cI\u2019m getting to be quite friendly with General Mekhlis.\u201d He laughed with satisfaction. \u201cI bring him paper, pens, plus if I get anything extra \u2014 if you get my meaning \u2014 I bring it to him. Never ask him to pay me. Cigarettes, vodka, all goes to him. He quite looks forward to my visits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Tatiana said. She had no idea who Mekhlis was. \u201cMekhlis . . . what army does he command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, are you joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would I joke?\u201d Tatiana was exhausted.</p><p>In a gleeful whisper Dimitri said, \u201cMekhlis commands the NKVD army!\u201d Lowering his voice, he said, \u201cHe is Beria\u2019s right-hand man!\u201d Lavrenti Beria was Stalin\u2019s People\u2019s Commissar of the NKVD.</p><p>Tatiana had been afraid of bombs once, and of hunger, and of death. She was afraid once of being lost in the woods. And once she was afraid of a human being wanting to do her harm for no reason other than to do her harm.</p><p>The harm was the means and the end.</p><p>Tonight Tatiana wasn\u2019t afraid for herself.</p><p>But studying Dimitri\u2019s depraved, ominously insinuating face, she was afraid for Alexander.</p><p>Before tonight she had felt twinges of remorse about leaving Lazarevo and reneging on what had been a heartfelt promise to her husband. But now she became convinced that Alexander didn\u2019t just need her closer to him, he needed her more than even she herself had thought possible.</p><p>Someone had to protect Alexander \u2014 not just from random death, no, but from deliberate destruction.</p><p>Without moving, without blinking, without flinching, Tatiana studied Dimitri.</p><p>She watched him put down his cup and move closer on the couch to her. Then she blinked and came out of her thoughts. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell, Tania,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cYou are not a child anymore.\u201d</p><p>She did not move a muscle as he moved closer still.</p><p>\u201cInga and Stan out there told me you are working so much that they are convinced you are seeing a doctor at the hospital. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Inga and Stan told you, then it must be,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cThe Communists never lie, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Dimitri moved closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tatiana got up off the couch. \u201cListen, it\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, come on. You\u2019re lonely. I\u2019m lonely. I hate my life, hate every minute of every day of it. Do you feel like that sometimes?\u201d</p><p>Only tonight, Tatiana thought. \u201cNo, Dima. I\u2019m fine. I have a good life, all things considered. I\u2019m working, the hospital needs me, my patients need me. I\u2019m alive. I have food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, but you must be so lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I be lonely?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m constantly surrounded by people. And I thought I was seeing a doctor? Listen, let\u2019s stop this. It\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>He got up and made a move toward her. Tatiana put out her hands. \u201cDimitri, that\u2019s all over. I\u2019m not the one for you.\u201d She stared at him pointedly. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve always known that, yet you\u2019ve always been quite persistent. Why?\u201d</p><p>With an easy laugh, Dimitri said, \u201cMaybe I had been hoping, dear Tania, that the love of a good young woman like yourself would redeem a rogue like me.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana leveled her cold gaze on him. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear,\u201d she said at last, \u201cthat you don\u2019t think you\u2019re beyond redemption.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cOh, but I am, Tania,\u201d he said. \u201cI am. Because I didn\u2019t have the love of a good young woman like you.\u201d He stopped laughing and raised his eyes to her. \u201cBut who did?\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t reply, standing in the place where the dining room table used to be, before Alexander sawed it to pieces for her and Dasha to use as firewood. So many ghosts in one small, dark room. It was almost as if the room were still crowded with feeling, with want, with hunger.</p><p>Dimitri\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said loudly. \u201cWhy did you come to the barracks asking for me? I thought this was what you wanted. Are you just trying to lead me on? To tease me?\u201d He raised his voice, far beyond the levels these walls could contain. He came closer. \u201cBecause in the army we have a word for girls who tease us.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWe call them mothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDima, is that what you think? That I\u2019m a tease? You think that\u2019s me, the girl who wants one thing and pretends she wants another? Is that me?\u201d</p><p>He grumbled without replying.</p><p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear with you right from the start. I came to the barracks asking for you, for Marazov. I just wanted to see a familiar face.\u201d Tatiana wasn\u2019t going to back down, though inside she was cold and far away from him.</p><p>\u201cDid you ask for Alexander, too, perhaps?\u201d Dimitri asked. \u201cBecause if you did, you know, you wouldn\u2019t find him at the garrison. Alexander would be either up in Morozovo, if he was on duty, or in every knocking joint in Leningrad, if he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Feeling herself pale inside and out, and hoping Dimitri didn\u2019t see and didn\u2019t hear the paling of her voice, Tatiana said, \u201cI asked for everybody I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody except Petrenko,\u201d Dimitri said, as if he knew. \u201cEven though you were quite friendly with him, coming around as often as you used to last year. Why didn\u2019t you ask for your friend, Ivan Petrenko? Before he got himself killed, he told me that he sometimes used to walk you to the ration store. On orders of Captain Belov, of course. He was quite helpful to you and your family. Why wouldn\u2019t you ask about him?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was stunned. She felt herself to be so ridiculously in need of Alexander, so ridiculously in need of protection against this specter of a man in her room that she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>Tatiana hadn\u2019t asked about Petrenko because she knew that Petrenko was dead. But she only knew he was dead from Alexander\u2019s letters, and Alexander could not be writing to her.</p><p>What to do, what to do, to end this revolting lie enveloping her life.</p><p>Tatiana was so fed up, so frustrated, so tired, so desperate, that she nearly opened her mouth and told Dimitri about Alexander. Truth was better than this. Tell the truth and live with the consequences.</p><p>It was the consequences that stopped her.</p><p>Straightening her back and staring coldly at Dimitri, Tatiana said firmly, \u201cDimitri, what the hell are you trying to get out of me? Stop trying to manipulate me with your questions. Either ask me outright or keep quiet. I\u2019m too tired for your games. What do you want to know? Why I didn\u2019t ask for Petrenko? Because I asked for Marazov first, and once I knew he was at the garrison, I stopped asking. Now, enough!\u201d</p><p>Dimitri stared at her with uneasy surprise.</p><p>There was a knock on the door. It was Inga. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she said sleepily, standing in her tattered gray bathrobe. \u201cI heard so much noise. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you, Inga,\u201d Tatiana said, slamming the door. Tatiana would deal with Inga later.</p><p>Dimitri came up to her and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tania. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you. I just misunderstood your intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Dimitri. It\u2019s late. Let\u2019s say good night.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri tried to come near her, and Tatiana backed away.</p><p>Stepping away himself, he shrugged. \u201cI always wished it had worked out for us, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you, Dimitri?\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDimitri! How\u2014\u201d Tatiana exclaimed and broke off.</p><p>Dimitri stood in a room in which he had once spent many evenings being fed and watered. He had sat with Tatiana\u2019s family, who had invited him into their home and made him a part of their life. He had been in this room now for an hour. He had talked freely about himself, accused Tatiana of she didn\u2019t know what. He\u2019d told her things that sounded like lies. She didn\u2019t know. What he did not do was ask her what had happened to the six people who had once been in this room with him. He did not ask about her mother, or her father, or her grandparents, or Marina, or her mother\u2019s mother. He did not ask her in Kobona in January, he did not ask her now. If he knew about their fate, he did not utter a single commiserating word, he did not make a single comforting wave of his hand. How did Dimitri think it could have worked out for him and anyone, but especially for him and Tatiana, when he could not look for a second beyond himself into anyone else\u2019s life or heart? Tatiana didn\u2019t care that he didn\u2019t ask after her family. What she wanted was for him not to pretend to her, as if she didn\u2019t know the truth.</p><p>Tatiana wanted to say this to Dimitri. But it wasn\u2019t worth it.</p><p>Though she suspected that the truth was plain in her eyes, because bowing his head and appearing even more hunched, Dimitri stammered, \u201cI just can\u2019t seem to say the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll say good night,\u201d Tatiana said coldly. That will be the right thing.</p><p>He went to the door, and she followed him. \u201cTania, I think this is good-bye. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see each other again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re meant to, we will.\u201d Tatiana swallowed hard, numb inside, her legs weak.</p><p>Dimitri lowered his voice, and whispered, \u201cWhere I\u2019m going, Tatiana, you will never see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d she mouthed, her strength gone.</p><p>He left at last, leaving black turmoil behind for Tatiana, who lay on her cot between the wall and the back of the couch, lay in all her clothes clutching her wedding ring to her chest, not moving or sleeping until morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>3</p><p>In Morozovo, Alexander was sitting behind a table in his officer\u2019s tent when Dimitri stepped inside with some cigarettes and vodka. Alexander was wearing his coat, and his injured hands were numb from the cold. He was thinking of going to the mess tent to get some warmth and some food, but he couldn\u2019t leave his tent. It was Friday, and he had a meeting with General Govorov in an hour to talk about their preparations for an assault on the Germans across the river.</p><p>It was November, and after four failed attempts to cross the Neva, the 67th Army was now impatiently waiting for the river to freeze. Finally the Leningrad command concluded that it would be easier to attack with the foot soldiers in line formations on ice instead of being clustered in easy-to-destroy pontoon boats.</p><p>Dimitri placed the bottles of vodka and the tobacco with the rolling papers on the table. Alexander paid him. He wanted Dimitri to leave. He had just been reading a letter from Tatiana that was puzzling him. He hadn\u2019t written to her for the few weeks that he\u2019d been hurt, even though he could have had a nurse write the letter for him. Alexander knew that if Tatiana saw a letter in someone else\u2019s handwriting, she would go insane reading between the lines into how badly he was really injured. Not wanting her to worry, he had sent her his September money and waited until he could hold a pen, writing to her himself toward the end of the month.</p> <p>He wrote that his burn wounds were just God\u2019s way of protecting him. Unable to function at his weapons, Alexander had missed two disastrous assaults on the Neva in September, which had decimated the first and second line armies so utterly that all reserves had to be brought in from the Leningrad garrison. The Volkhov front would have been glad to supply the Leningrad front with men \u2014 if only they had some. But after Hitler\u2019s directive to Manstein to hold the Neva and the blockade around Leningrad at all costs, there were hardly any men left in Meretskov\u2019s 2nd Army in Volkhov.</p><p>Elsewhere, Stalingrad was being razed to the ground. The Ukraine was Hitler\u2019s. Leningrad was barely holding. The Red Army was thoroughly debilitated. Govorov was planning another attack on the Germans across the Neva. And Alexander was sitting at his desk, trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with his wife.</p><p>Here it was November, and none of her letters that came with steady and conversational regularity, though without some of her usual candid fervor, mentioned a word about his injuries. He was driving himself to distraction trying to read between the lines of her letters when Dimitri had come in with the supplies. And now Dimitri wasn\u2019t leaving.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, can you pour me a drink? For old times\u2019 sake?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Alexander poured Dimitri a drink. He poured himself a smaller one. He sat behind his desk, Dimitri in a chair opposite him. They talked about the impending invasion and about the frightful battles with the Germans across the Neva on the Volkhov side.</p> <p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d Dimitri said quietly, \u201chow can you sit there so calmly knowing what\u2019s ahead of you? Four attempts to cross the Neva, most of our men dead, and I hear that the fifth attack once the ice freezes is going to be our last one, that not a single man will be allowed to return until the blockade is broken; did you hear that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard something about it, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be here anymore. I can\u2019t. Just yesterday I was delivering supplies to the Neva for the Nevsky Patch troops, and a rocket bomb flew all the way from Sinyavino across the river and blew up yet another f*cking squadron getting ready to ferry. I was maybe a hundred meters away from the explosion. But look\u201d \u2014 he showed Alexander the cuts on his face \u2014 \u201cit doesn\u2019t end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dimitri, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his voice a notch, Dimitri said, \u201cAlexander, you will not believe how unprotected the Lisiy Nos area is right now! I deliver to our border troops there and see the Finns in the woods. There are maybe a dozen men in all. It\u2019s providential. You can come with me in my delivery truck, and before we get to the border, we can dump the truck, and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDima!\u201d whispered Alexander. \u201cDump the truck? Look at you. You can barely walk on straight ground. We talked about this in June\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot just in June. We talked this to death. I\u2019m tired of talking. Tired of waiting. I can\u2019t wait anymore. Let\u2019s just go, we\u2019ll go, and we\u2019ll make it, and if we won\u2019t make it, they\u2019ll shoot us. What\u2019s the difference? At least this way we stand a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me\u2014\u201d Alexander said, getting up from his desk.</p><p>\u201cNo, you listen to me. This war has changed me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cIt has shown me that I have to fight for my own life to survive. By whatever means necessary. Everything I\u2019ve done so far just hasn\u2019t worked. Not the moving from platoon to platoon, not the foot wound, not the months in the hospital, not the Kobona interlude \u2014 nothing! I\u2019ve been trying to save my life until we make our move again. But the Germans are determined to kill me. And I\u2019m determined not to let them.\u201d Dimitri paused and lowered his voice. \u201cMakes your little stunt with the now deceased and forgotten Yuri Stepanov even more infuriating in retrospect.\u201d His voice barely audible, Dimitri said, \u201cHe\u2019s dead, and we\u2019re still here. All because you had to bring him back. We\u2019d be in America right now, if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><p>Fighting with himself for control, Alexander came around on Dimitri\u2019s side of the desk, bent down to him, and said through his teeth, \u201cAnd I told you then the same thing I am telling you now. Over and over then. Over and over now. Go! Leave. Go ahead. I will give you half of my money. You know how to get to Helsinki and Stockholm like the back of your hand. Why don\u2019t you just go?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri pulled away on his chair from Alexander. \u201cYou know very well I can\u2019t go on my own. I don\u2019t speak a word of English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to speak English! Just get to Stockholm and claim refugee status. They\u2019ll take you, Dimitri, even without English,\u201d Alexander said coldly, backing slightly away.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now with my leg\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget your leg. Drag it behind you if you have to. I\u2019ll give you half of the money\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me half of the money? What the f*ck are you talking about? We are supposed to be going together, remember? That was our plan, right. Together?\u201d Dimitri paused. \u201cI\u2019m not going alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going alone,\u201d Alexander hissed, \u201cthen you will wait until I say the time is right.\u201d He unclenched his fists. \u201cThe time is not right. In the spring it will be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not waiting till the f*cking spring!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat choice do you have? Do you want to succeed, or do you want to fail in a hurry? You know the NKVD border troops shoot deserters on the spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be dead by the spring,\u201d said Dimitri, getting up from the chair and attempting to square off against Alexander. \u201cYou\u2019ll be dead by the spring. What\u2019s the matter with you? What the f*ck has gotten into you? Do you not want to run anymore? What would you rather do \u2014 die?\u201d</p><p>Keeping the torment out of his eyes, Alexander did not reply.</p><p>Dimitri glared at him. \u201cFive years ago, when you were nobody, had nobody, when you needed me, I did you a favor, Captain of the Red Army.\u201d</p><p>Alexander took one stride and stood so close to Dimitri that Dimitri not only backed off but fell into his chair, glancing up at Alexander with anxiety.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cAnd I have never forgotten it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cDon\u2019t get all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I made myself clear? We will wait for the right time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the border at Lisiy Nos is unprotected now!\u201d Dimitri exclaimed. \u201cWhat the f*ck are we waiting for? Now is an ideal time to go. Later the Soviets will bring more troops in, the Finns will bring more troops in, the war will continue there. Now it\u2019s a stalemate. I say let\u2019s go now \u2014 before the battle for Leningrad kills you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s stopping you?\u201d said Alexander. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d said Dimitri, \u201cfor the last time, I\u2019m not going without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDimitri,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cfor the last time, I\u2019m not going now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell you when. First we will break the blockade. Yes, it will take all we have, but we will do it, and then in the spring\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dimitri chuckled. \u201cMaybe we should just send Tania to do it.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Alexander thought he had misheard.</p><p>Did Dimitri just mention Tatiana?</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d he asked quietly and slowly.</p><p>\u201cI said, maybe we should just send Tania. She is quite the little blockade runner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl,\u201d Dimitri said with admiration, \u201cI am convinced, could get to Australia by herself if she wanted to!\u201d Howling, he threw his head back. \u201cBefore we know it, she\u2019ll be making regular food runs between Molotov and Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Alexander,\u201d Dimitri continued, \u201cinstead of wasting two hundred thousand of our men, including you and me, we should have Tatiana Metanova break the blockade.\u201d</p><p>Stubbing out his cigarette, Alexander said, \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Hoping Dimitri wouldn\u2019t notice, he clenched his hands around the chair posts.</p><p>\u201cI said to her, I said, \u2018Tania, you ought to enlist. You\u2019ll be a general in no time.\u2019 And she said she actually was thinking of joining\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014\u201d Alexander interrupted, finding it hard to continue. \u201cWhat do you mean, you said to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week ago. She made me dinner on Fifth Soviet. They finally had their pipes fixed. The apartment, well, some complete strangers are living there, but . . .\u201d Dimitri smiled. \u201cShe is getting to be quite the little cook.\u201d</p><p>It took most of what Alexander had to remain impassive.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Dimitri said with an amused look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. But what are you talking about, Dima? Is this another one of your little white lies? Tatiana is not in Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, believe me, I\u2019d know Tania anywhere.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShe looks good. She told me she was seeing a doctor.\u201d He laughed. \u201cCan you believe it? Our little Tanechka. Who would have thought that she would be the only one left standing?\u201d</p><p>Alexander would have liked to say stop it, but he did not trust his voice. He said nothing, his hands remaining on the posts of the chair.</p><p>He had just gotten a letter from her yesterday. A letter!</p><p>\u201cTania came looking for me at the barracks. Made me dinner. She said she\u2019d been in Leningrad since the middle of October. No, and how she got there, too!\u201d Dimitri laughed. \u201cLiterally walking through the Volkhov front, as if Manstein and his thousand-kilo bombs did not exist.\u201d Dimitri shook his head. \u201cWhen I get into the good fight, I want her with me.\u201d</p><p>Keeping himself under barest control, Alexander said, \u201cAnd when is it, Dimitri, that you think you\u2019ll be going into the good fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery clever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDimitri, I don\u2019t give a shit. This doesn\u2019t matter. But I just realized I\u2019m late. I have a meeting with General Govorov in a few minutes. You will have to excuse me.\u201d</p><p>After Dimitri left, Alexander became so upset in his tent that in his stricken fury he broke apart the wooden chair he had been sitting on.</p><p>Now he knew what was wrong with her letters. Alexander was weak from anger, and he didn\u2019t have enough time to calm down before his meeting with Govorov, or after. Anger continued to cloud his judgment. After his meeting he went to Colonel Stepanov.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Stepanov, coming from around his desk. \u201cI see that look in your eyes, Captain Belov.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>With his hat in his hands, Alexander nodded and said, \u201cSir, you have been very kind to me. I haven\u2019t had a day off since I came back in July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Belov, you had over five weeks off in July!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is a few days, sir. If you like, I can drive a supply truck into Leningrad. That way it will be partly for army business, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Alexander?\u201d Stepanov said, coming closer and lowering his voice.</p><p>Alexander gave a small shake of his head. \u201cEverything is fine.\u201d</p><p>Stepanov studied him. \u201cDoes it have anything to do with the money you\u2019re sending out of here to Molotov every month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, sir, maybe we should stop the money transfers to Molotov.\u201d</p><p>Stepanov lowered his voice another notch. \u201cDoes it have anything to do with the stamp from a registry office in Molotov that I saw in your passport when I was signing you in?\u201d</p><p>Alexander kept silent. \u201cSir, I am urgently needed in Leningrad.\u201d He paused, trying to collect himself. \u201cIt\u2019s just for a few days.\u201d</p><p>Stepanov sighed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come back by ten o\u2019clock roll call on Sunday . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I will be here. It\u2019s more than enough time. Thank you. I\u2019ve never let you down. I won\u2019t forget this.\u201d</p><p>As Alexander was leaving, Stepanov said, \u201cTake care of your personal business, son. Forget the supplies. You won\u2019t have another chance for personal business until we break the blockade.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>4</p><p>Tatiana was dragging her feet. She was hanging around her last patients even though it was long past her sign-out time. She was a little hungry, but cooking for herself was such a displeasure, she wished she could nourish her body intravenously, like some of the wounded. Working with critically injured men and women was preferable to being in her room by herself.</p><p>Finally she left and, not lifting her head, slowly walked home down Grechesky in the dark.</p><p>She walked through the communal apartment. Inga was sitting on the couch in the hallway and casually drinking tea. Why was she in Tatiana\u2019s home? It was so incongruous that she and Stan should remain. \u201cHello, Inga,\u201d said Tatiana tiredly as she took off her coat.</p> <p>\u201cHmm. Someone was here for you.\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders. \u201cDid you do as I asked and not let anyone in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did as you asked,\u201d Inga replied shortly. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t too pleased, though. Another soldier\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat soldier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Coming up to Inga and lowering her voice, Tatiana whispered, \u201cWho was it? It wasn\u2019t the same soldier, was it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Different. Tall.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s heart jumped. Tall!</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2014\u201d she stammered. \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I told him he couldn\u2019t come in. He didn\u2019t want to hear anything after that. You have quite a contingent of soldiers following you around, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Without even grabbing her coat, Tatiana swirled around the small hallway, swung open the door, and there in front of her stood Alexander.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she gasped, her knees buckling. \u201cOh, God.\u201d Seeing the expression in his darkened eyes, she knew what he was feeling. She didn\u2019t care. Her eyes filling with tears, she leaned her head into his coat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even put his arms around her. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said coldly, taking her by the arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside.\u201d</p><p>Inga said, \u201cTania told me not to let anyone in, Captain \u2014 Tania, aren\u2019t you going to introduce us?\u201d She had put down her cup.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Alexander, pushing Tatiana into the room and kicking the door shut behind him. She came to him instantly, her shaking arms open, her face overflowing. She could barely get his name out of her emotional mouth. \u201cShura . . .\u201d</p><p>He put his palms out. \u201cDon\u2019t come near me.\u201d</p><p>Not listening, Tatiana came to him, and said, \u201cShura, I am so happy to see you. How are your hands?\u201d</p><p>He pushed her hard away, saying loudly, \u201cNo, Tatiana! Stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>He walked through the room to the window. It was cold by the window. Tatiana followed him. Her need to lay her hands on him and to have him touch her was so desperate that she forgot the pain left by Dimitri\u2019s visit, by the missing five thousand dollars, by her own twisted feelings. \u201cShura,\u201d Tatiana said, her voice breaking. \u201cWhy are you pushing me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Alexander\u2019s eyes were bitter and angry. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why I\u2019m here,\u201d Tatiana said to him. \u201cYou needed me. I came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you here!\u201d he yelled. Tatiana flinched but did not move away. \u201cI don\u2019t need you here,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI need you safe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease let me touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, I told you, I cannot be away from you. I didn\u2019t think you could feel me all the way in Lazarevo. You need me close to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose to me? Not close to me, Tatiana,\u201d he said nastily, standing against the windowsill. It was dark in the room, the only light coming from the street. Alexander\u2019s face was dark, his eyes were dark.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Her voice was trembling in supplication. \u201cOf course, close to you. Close to who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck were you thinking,\u201d he yelled, \u201cgoing to the barracks and asking for Dimitri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for Dimitri!\u201d she exclaimed faintly. \u201cI went to find you. I didn\u2019t know what happened to you. You stopped writing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t write to me for six months!\u201d he said loudly. \u201cYou could have waited two weeks, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was over a month, and I couldn\u2019t have, no,\u201d she said. \u201cShura, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d Tatiana came a step closer. \u201cFor you. You told me never to look away from you. Here I am. Look into my eyes and tell me what I feel.\u201d Pleadingly she opened her hands to him. \u201cWhat do I feel, Shura?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Alexander blinked, his teeth grinding. \u201cLook into my eyes and tell me what I feel, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>She clasped her hands together.</p><p>\u201cYou promised me!\u201d Alexander said. \u201cYou promised me. You gave me your word!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana remembered. She looked into his face. She was so weak and wanted him so much. And she could see that he needed her, if anything, even more. He just couldn\u2019t see past his anger. Like always. \u201cAlexander, husband, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s your Tania.\u201d She almost cried as she opened her palms to him. \u201cShura, please . . .\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t reply, Tatiana took off her shoes and came to stand in front of him at the window. She felt more vulnerable than ever, standing in her white uniform in front of him, with his black hair, black boots, and black trench coat looming over her, so emotional, so upset. \u201cPlease, let\u2019s not fight. I am so happy to see you. I just want . . .\u201d She would not lower her eyes from him, would not. \u201cShura,\u201d she said, her body trembling, \u201cdon\u2019t . . . push me away.\u201d</p><p>He turned his face from her. Tatiana unbuttoned the front of her uniform and took hold of Alexander\u2019s hand. \u201cKiss the palm of your hand and press it against your heart, you wrote to me,\u201d she whispered, kissing the palm of his hand and then putting it on her bare breast, his large, warm, dark hand, the hand that had carried her and caressed her, and she closed her eyes and moaned.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Tatiana . . .\u201d Alexander said, pulling her to him, his hands attacking her body. He pushed her down on the couch, his incensed lips not leaving her mouth, his hands in her hair. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d He yanked off her uniform, vest, and underwear, leaving her naked except for her garters. Gripping her bare thighs above the stockings, he whispered, \u201cTania, God, what do you want from me . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana couldn\u2019t even answer. His body on hers was making her speechless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m furious with you.\u201d He was kissing her as if he were dying. \u201cYou don\u2019t care I\u2019m furious with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care . . . take your anger out on me,\u201d Tatiana groaned. \u201cGo ahead, take it out on me, Shura . . . now.\u201d</p><p>He was inside her in seconds.</p><p>Her hands clutching his head, Tatiana whispered, \u201cCover my mouth,\u201d ready to scream.</p><p>Alexander hadn\u2019t taken off his coat, nor his boots.</p><p>There was a knock on the door. \u201cTania, are you all right?\u201d Inga\u2019s voice sounded.</p><p>His hand over Tatiana\u2019s mouth, Alexander yelled, \u201cGet the hell away from the door!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCover my mouth, Shura,\u201d Tatiana whispered, crying from happiness. \u201cOh, God, cover it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t get off me, don\u2019t get off me, please,\u201d she murmured, holding on to his coat, to his head, grasping on to any part of him. \u201cHow are your hands?\u201d In the dark, she couldn\u2019t see them. They felt scabbed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana was kissing his lips, his chin, his stubble, his eyes \u2014 she couldn\u2019t take her lips away from his eyes \u2014 holding his head close to her. \u201cShura, darling, don\u2019t get off me, please, I\u2019ve missed you so much, stay right here. Stay where you are . . .\u201d For a few dark moments Tatiana pressed herself against Alexander. \u201cDon\u2019t pull away from me, feel how warm I am? Don\u2019t pull out into the cold . . .\u201d She lay underneath him and tried not to cry. And failed. \u201cIs that why you hadn\u2019t written to me? Because of your hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think the absence of your letters would make me crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, getting off her, \u201cI had hoped you would just wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, lovely husband, are you hungry?\u201d Tatiana murmured to him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m touching you again. I can\u2019t be this lucky. What can I make for you? I have some pork, some potatoes. Do you want food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alexander said, helping her sit up. \u201cWhy is it so cold in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStove\u2019s broken. Bourzhuika is in the other room, remember? Slavin lets me use his Primus stove in the kitchen.\u201d She smiled, her hands running up and down his coat. \u201cHoney, Shura, do you want me to make you some tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, you\u2019ll freeze. Do you have anything else to wear? Something warm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m burning,\u201d she said, her hands on his coat. \u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d She hung on to him.</p><p>\u201cWhy is the sofa in the middle of the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bed is behind the couch.\u201d</p><p>Alexander looked over the back of the couch to see Tatiana\u2019s cot. Pulling a blanket off it, he covered her. \u201cWhy are you sleeping between the sofa and the wall?\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, Alexander reached over and touched the wall with his hand. They stared at each other in the dark. \u201cWhy did you give them the warm room, Tania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give it to them. They took it. There are two of them, only one of me. They\u2019re sad. He\u2019s got a bad back. Shura, how about a hot bath? I\u2019ll run you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Get dressed. Right now.\u201d Alexander buckled his belt and walked out of the bedroom, still in his coat. Disheveled and barely buttoned, Tatiana followed him. He walked past Inga in the hallway into the bedroom, where Stan was sitting reading the newspaper, and asked Stan to switch rooms with Tatiana. Stan said he wasn\u2019t switching. Alexander replied that indeed Stan was, and he and Tatiana started moving all of Inga and Stan\u2019s things into the cold room and all of Tatiana\u2019s things into the warm room.</p><p>For fifteen minutes Tatiana heard Stan grumbling, standing with Inga in the hallway, and at one point as she passed him, she whispered, \u201cStanislav Stepanich, shh. Please. Don\u2019t provoke him.\u201d</p><p>Stan did not heed her warning. As Alexander was walking past carrying Stan\u2019s trunk, Stan seethed, \u201cWho do you think you are? You don\u2019t know who you\u2019re dealing with. You\u2019ve got no right to treat me this way.\u201d</p><p>Dropping the trunk, Alexander grabbed his rifle and jammed Stan against the wall with the barrel under his throat. \u201cWho the f*ck do you think you are, Stan?\u201d Alexander said loudly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who you\u2019re dealing with! What, you think I\u2019m going to be scared of you, too, you bastard? You\u2019ve come to the wrong man. Now, get into the other room, and don\u2019t f*ck with me, because I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d He gritted his teeth. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ever upset her again, you hear me?\u201d Giving Stan a last jolt under the chin, Alexander stepped away from him and kicked his heavy trunk, rolling it over. \u201cHere, carry your own f*cking trunk.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana, who watched Alexander, did not come to Stan\u2019s rescue, even though she thought Alexander looked angry enough to really hurt Stan. Inga mumbled, \u201cWhat kind of sick people come and see you here, Tania? Come on, Stan, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing his throat, Stan started to stay something, and Inga yelled, \u201cCome on, Stan. Shut your mouth and let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>In the warm room Tatiana quickly stripped off Inga and Stan\u2019s bedding, throwing it out into the hall, and put clean sheets on her old bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Alexander said, sitting on the sofa and motioning Tatiana to him.</p><p>Tatiana shook her head. \u201cOh, you, Alexander. Do you want some food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater. Come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you take off your coat this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here and I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>She fell into his arms. \u201cLeave your coat on. Leave everything on.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana ran a hot bath for Alexander, took him by the hand into the small bathroom, undressed him, and soaped him and scrubbed him and rinsed him, and cried over him, and kissed him. \u201cYour poor hands,\u201d she kept saying. His red fingers looked pretty bad to her, but Alexander assured her they would heal almost without scarring. His wedding ring was not on his finger but on a rope around his neck \u2014 just like hers.</p><p>\u201cIs the water warm enough for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can boil another pot.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll come in here and pour the boiling water over you. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d he said, and did not smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, Shura . . .\u201d she whispered, kissing his wet forehead, turning his face to her as she knelt beside the bath. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, brightening. \u201cWe can play a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo games right now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll like this one,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend we\u2019re in Lazarevo, and I\u2019m you, stroking my fingers in the dishpan. Remember?\u201d She immersed her arms up to her elbows in the soapy hot water.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d said Alexander, closing his eyes and reluctantly smiling.</p><p>While he was drying and dressing, Tatiana went outside into the kitchen and made him dinner, cooking him almost all the food she had \u2014 potatoes, carrots, and a bit of pork meat \u2014 and then took him into the bedroom and breathlessly sat by him on the couch, watching him eat. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d she said. \u201cI ate at the hospital. Eat, darling, eat.\u201d</p><p>During their senseless, sleepless night, Tatiana told Alexander about everything Dimitri had told her \u2014 the NKVD general, Lisiy Nos, and the other allusions. Alexander stared at the ceiling. \u201cAre you waiting for me to answer you before you ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you anything.\u201d She was lying in his arms, playing with his wedding ring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking to you about Dimitri here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the walls have ears.\u201d Alexander banged loudly on the wall with his fist.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, they\u2019ve already heard everything.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cEverything else he told you \u2014 about me \u2014 it\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She laughed lightly. \u201cBut, Shura, tell me, how many knocking joints are there in Leningrad, and why would you have to go to all of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, darling \u2014 I know.\u201d She kissed his chest and covered them both up with two wool blankets. \u201cThere is only one thing true nowadays, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one,\u201d he whispered, staring at her intensely in the dark. \u201cOh, Tatia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a picture of yourself here? A picture I can take with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow I\u2019ll find you one. I\u2019m afraid to ask. When are you leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunday.\u201d</p><p>Her heart squeezed shut. \u201cSo soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy commander puts his head on the butcher block every time he lets me have special leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a nice man. Thank him for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana, someday I will have to explain to you the concept of keeping a promise. You see, when you give your word, you have to keep your word.\u201d He was stroking her hair.</p><p>\u201cI know what keeping a promise means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you only know what making a promise means,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cYou are very good at making the promise. It\u2019s keeping the promise you have a problem with. You promised me you would stay in Lazarevo.\u201d</p><p>Thoughtfully Tatiana said, \u201cI promised because that\u2019s what you wanted me to do.\u201d She squeezed tighter into the crook of his arm. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me much choice.\u201d She couldn\u2019t lie close enough to him. \u201cAt the point you were asking for my promise, I would have promised you anything.\u201d Under his arm was no good. She climbed on top of him. \u201cAnd did.\u201d She kissed him softly. \u201cYou wanted me to promise. I promised. I always do what you want me to do.\u201d</p><p>His hands tenderly moving down her back, Alexander said, \u201cNo, you always do as you please. You certainly make the right noises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said, rubbing herself into him.</p><p>\u201cYes, that you do,\u201d Alexander said, his hands more insistent. \u201cYou certainly say the right things. Yes, Shura; of course, Shura; I promise, Shura; maybe even, I love you, Shura, but then you just do as you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Shura,\u201d Tatiana said, her tears falling into his face.</p><p>All the agonizing words Tatiana had meant to say to Alexander, she kept inside, slightly surprised that he kept his own agonizing words to her under control, and she could tell he had plenty. But she knew \u2014 the endless November Leningrad night was too short for misery, too short for what they were feeling, too short for them. Alexander wanted to hear her moan, she moaned for him, indifferent to Inga and Stan just centimeters of thin plaster away. Under the flickering light of the open bourzhuika Tatiana made love to her Alexander, yielding to him, clutching him, clinging to him, unable to keep herself from crying each time she came, each time he came, each time they came together. She made love to him with the abandon of the skylark\u2019s last flight south when the bird knows he is going to either make it to the warmth or die.</p><p>\u201cYour poor hands,\u201d she was whispering as she kissed the scars on his fingers and wrists. \u201cYour hands, Shura. They\u2019ll heal, right? They won\u2019t scar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hands healed,\u201d he said. \u201cYours didn\u2019t scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, remembering putting out the fire on the roof last year. \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how,\u201d Alexander whispered. \u201cYou healed them. Now heal mine, Tania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, soldier.\u201d Tatiana was on top of him, desperately pressing his head to her naked breasts.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>She was embracing him the way he used to embrace her in Lazarevo. And for the same reason. \u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d she whispered, leaning into his face. \u201cI\u2019ll breathe for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>5</p><p>The next morning, before they came out into the corridor, Tatiana hugged Alexander and said, \u201cBe nice,\u201d as she opened their bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always nice,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Stan and Inga were sitting in the hallway. Stan stood up, extended his hand to Alexander, introduced himself, apologized for yesterday, and asked Alexander to sit and have a smoke. Alexander did not sit, but he took a cigarette from Stan.</p> <p>\u201cThis kind of living is hard on everyone, I know. But it\u2019s not forever. You know what the Party says, Captain\u2014\u201d said Stan, smiling ingratiatingly.</p><p>\u201cNo, what does the Party say, comrade?\u201d Alexander asked, glancing down at Tatiana, who stood beside him holding his hand.</p><p>\u201cBeing determines consciousness, doesn\u2019t it? We live like this long enough, and we\u2019ll all get used to it. Soon we\u2019ll all become changed human beings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Stan,\u201d Inga said plaintively, \u201cI don\u2019t want to live like this! We had a nice apartment. I want that back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get it back, Inga. The council promised us a two-bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander said, \u201cHow long do you think, Stan, we\u2019ll have to live like this before we\u2019re changed? And changed into what?\u201d He stared bleakly at Tatiana, who said, peering up into his face, \u201cShura, I have some kasha. Darling, I\u2019ll make you some?\u201d Smoking as if it were his breakfast, Alexander nodded. She didn\u2019t like the look in his eyes.</p><p>When she came back inside with two bowls of kasha and a cup of coffee for him, Tatiana overheard Stan telling Alexander that he and Inga, married for twenty years, were both engineers and long-standing members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.</p><p>Alexander barely excused himself before he went to eat his kasha inside the room, not even asking Tatiana to follow him.</p><p>Tatiana ate her kasha with Inga and Stan, refusing to answer Inga\u2019s curious questions about Alexander. Then she washed the dishes from the night before, cleaned the kitchen, and finally and reluctantly joined him inside the room. Tatiana knew she was procrastinating. She did not want to face Alexander alone.</p><p>He was collecting her things into her black backpack. Glaring at her, he said, \u201cYou wanted to come back for this? You missed this? Strangers, Communist Party strangers, listening to your every word, your every moan? You missed all this, Tania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no place for me here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is hardly a place for you.\u201d</p><p>After watching him for a moment she asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPacking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPacking?\u201d she repeated quietly, closing the door behind her. Here it starts, Tatiana thought. I didn\u2019t want it. I wished we didn\u2019t have to have it. But here it is. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcross the lake. I can get you across easily to Syastroy, and then I\u2019ll take you in an army truck to Vologda. From there you\u2019ll catch a train. We have to go now. It\u2019ll take me a while to get back, and I must return to Morozovo tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>Vigorously Tatiana shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Alexander snapped. \u201cWhat are you shaking your head for?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cTatiana, I\u2019m warning you. Don\u2019t provoke me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you are.\u201d</p><p>In a small voice she said, \u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Alexander raised his voice. \u201cYou are!\u201d</p><p>In the same small voice Tatiana said, \u201cDon\u2019t raise your voice to me.\u201d</p><p>Dropping her backpack with a thud to the wooden floor, Alexander came up to her and, leaning down, said into her face, \u201cTatiana, in a second I\u2019m going to raise more than my voice to you.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana felt so sad inside. But she squared her shoulders and did not look away. Quietly she said, \u201cGo ahead, Alexander. I\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he said, gritting his teeth. \u201cWell, I\u2019m terrified of you.\u201d He stepped away and picked up the backpack. Tatiana remembered the first day of the war, she remembered Pasha telling her father, no, I don\u2019t want to go, and being sent away anyway, and dying.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, stop it, I said. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you are, Tania,\u201d he said, whirling to her, his face distorted by anger. \u201cYou are. I will take you to Vologda, if have to carry you there myself, kicking and screaming.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana backed away from him, just a little bit, half a step, and said, \u201cFine. But I will not be kicking, I will not be screaming. As soon as you leave, I will come back.\u201d</p><p>Alexander threw the backpack against the wall, close to Tatiana\u2019s head. He came at her with clenched fists and smashed the wall near her so hard that the plaster crumbled and his hand went through the hole.</p><p>Her legs trembling, her eyes closed, Tatiana backed away another half a step and stopped moving.</p><p>\u201cFor f*ck\u2019s sake!\u201d Alexander screamed in a rage, punching the wall next to her face. \u201cWhat will it take for you to listen to me, just once, just f*cking once, what will it take for you to do as I say?\u201d He grabbed her by the arms and pinned her roughly against the wall.</p><p>\u201cShura, this is not the army,\u201d Tatiana whispered tremulously, afraid to look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou are not staying here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>There was a knock. Alexander went to the door, ripped it open, and shouted, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Inga, her face red, muttered, \u201cI just wanted to see if Tania was all right. Tania? I heard yelling \u2014 banging\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Inga,\u201d Tatiana said, stepping away from the wall on unsteady legs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hear a lot more before we\u2019re done,\u201d Alexander said to Inga. \u201cJust put the f*cking glass to the wall,\u201d and slammed the door shut. Whirling around, he came for Tatiana, who backed away from him, her hands up, whispering, \u201cShura, please . . .\u201d but, unstoppable and crazed, he came at her just the same and shoved her down onto the couch. She fell back and covered her face. Bending over her, Alexander knocked her hands away. \u201cDon\u2019t cover your face!\u201d he shouted, grabbing her cheeks between his fingers and shaking her. \u201cDon\u2019t make me more crazy!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana cried out and tried to push him away, but it was useless. \u201cStop!\u201d she panted. \u201cStop . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe or dead, Tania?\u201d he yelled. \u201cSafe or dead? What will it be?\u201d</p><p>Clutching helplessly at his arms, she wanted to answer him but couldn\u2019t speak. Dead, she wanted to say. Dead, Shura.</p><p>\u201cYou can see what it\u2019s doing to me, your being here!\u201d Alexander squeezed her face harder and harder as she struggled to break free. \u201cYou can see. But you just don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d</p><p>She ceased fighting him, placing her hands over his. \u201cPlease,\u201d Tatiana whispered, trying to catch his eye. \u201cPlease . . . stop. You\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander eased his hold on her but did not let go of her face, nor did Tatiana pull away, even though she could hardly breathe. Underneath him, she lay on the couch, panting. Covering her with his body, he lay on top of her, panting. Through the crashing noise in her head Tatiana remotely heard the air-raid siren and explosive sounds outside her windows. She moved her mouth away from his hands a little. She was suffocating. Her own hands went around his back to clasp him. \u201cOh, Shura,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Alexander got off Tatiana, stood miserably before her, and then dropped to his knees. \u201cTatiana,\u201d he said in a broken voice, \u201cthis frantic wretch begs you, please leave. If you feel any love for me at all, please go back to Lazarevo. Be safe. You just don\u2019t know what kind of danger you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>Still short of breath, her body trembling, her face aching, Tatiana sat up at the edge of the couch and pulled Alexander to her. She couldn\u2019t bear to see him so upset. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re angry,\u201d she said, holding his face. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be angry with me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander moved her hands off him. \u201cDo you hear the bombs? Do you hear, or are you deaf? Do you see there is no food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s food,\u201d she said quietly, putting her hands back on him. \u201cI get 700 grams a day. Plus my lunch and dinner at the hospital. I\u2019m doing well.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s much better than last year. And I don\u2019t care about the bombs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, stop lying to me. It\u2019s not the Germans or the bombs that frighten you. What are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>Outside, the whistling shells whizzed nearby. One sounded close. Tatiana pulled Alexander to her. \u201cListen to me,\u201d she whispered, clutching his head to her breasts. \u201cDo you hear my heart?\u201d</p><p>He surrounded her. She sat for a moment holding on to him, closing her eyes. Dear God, she prayed. Please let me be strong for him. He needs my strength so much, don\u2019t let me weaken right now. Gently pushing him away, she went to her dresser. \u201cYou left something behind in Lazarevo, Shura. Besides me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander got up and sat heavily on the couch.</p><p>Ripping open the inseam on her trousers, Tatiana took out Alexander\u2019s five thousand dollars. \u201cLook. I returned to give you this.\u201d She stared at him. \u201cI see you took only half. Why?\u201d Stop. Breathe.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s bronze eyes were toffee pools of pain. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about this with Inga at our door,\u201d he said, barely moving his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? We do everything else with Inga at our door.\u201d</p><p>They looked away from each other. Tatiana could tell they were both splintering. Who was going to pick up their fragmented pieces? She. She was going to pick them up. Leaving the money on the dresser, Tatiana went to him, straddling him, holding his head to her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Lazarevo, is it, Shura?\u201d she whispered into his hair.</p><p>His voice breaking, his arms encircling her, Alexander whispered back, \u201cWhat is, Tatia?\u201d</p><p>She made love to him, kneeling on top of him, pressing her fragile self into him, bearing down on him, praying to him, wanting him to swallow her, to impale her, to save her and to kill her, wanting from him everything and yet for herself nothing, only to give back to him, only to give his life back to him. At the end she was crying again, all her strength gone, panting and melting and burning and crying.</p><p>\u201cTatiasha,\u201d Alexander whispered, still unceasing, \u201cstop crying. What\u2019s a man to think when every time he makes love to his wife, she cries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he is his wife\u2019s only family,\u201d Tatiana replied, cradling his head. \u201cThat he is her whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs she is his,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cBut you don\u2019t see him crying.\u201d He was turned away from her. Tatiana couldn\u2019t see his face.</p><p>After the air raid was over and they were finished, they bundled up and went out. \u201cToo cold to be out,\u201d Tatiana said, clinging to him.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wear a hat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can see my hair. I know you like it.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>Taking off his glove, he ran his hand across her head. \u201cPut on your scarf,\u201d he said, tying it around her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She took his arm. \u201cI like your new coat. It\u2019s big, like a tent.\u201d In sadness, she lowered her eyes. She shouldn\u2019t have said the word tent. Too many Lazarevo memories. Some words were like that. Whole lives attached to them. Ghosts and lives and ecstasy and sorrow. The simplest words, and suddenly she couldn\u2019t continue to speak. \u201cIt looks warm,\u201d she added quietly.</p><p>Alexander smiled. \u201cNext week I will have better than a tent. I\u2019ll have a room in the main headquarters, just five doors away from Stepanov. There is heat in the building. I\u2019ll actually be warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cDo you have a blanket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy coat is my blanket, and I have another one, yes. I\u2019m all right, Tania. It\u2019s war. Now, where do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Lazarevo \u2014 with you,\u201d she said, unable to look at him. \u201cBarring that, let\u2019s walk to the Summer Garden.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cTo the Summer Garden it is, then.\u201d</p><p>They walked silently for many minutes. With her arm through his, Tatiana kept pressing her head into Alexander\u2019s sleeve. Finally she took a deep breath. \u201cTalk to me, Alexander,\u201d Tatiana began. \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re alone now. We have a little privacy. Tell me. Why did you take half the money?\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing. Tatiana listened. Still nothing. She put her face on his woolen coat. Still nothing. She looked at the slushy snow at her feet, at the trolleybus that went by, at the policeman on a horse that trotted by, at the broken glass they stepped over, at the red traffic light up ahead. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.</p><p>She sighed. Why was this so difficult for him? More difficult than usual. \u201cShura, why didn\u2019t you take all of the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he let out slowly, \u201cI left you what was mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all yours. All the money is yours. What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cAlexander! What did you take five thousand dollars for? If you\u2019re running, you need all of it. If you\u2019re not running, you don\u2019t need any of it. Why did you take half?\u201d</p><p>No reply. It was like Lazarevo. Tatiana would ask, he would answer, tight-lipped and thoughtful, and she would spend an hour trying to decipher what was between the single words. Lisiy Nos, Vyborg, Helsinki, Stockholm, Yuri Stepanov, all multisyllables with Alexander hidden in the middle of them, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Tatiana said, exasperated, detaching herself from him. \u201cI\u2019m tired of this game. In fact, I\u2019m done with it. You either tell me everything without holding back, without stupid guessing games where I\u2019m trying to figure things out and getting them wrong, you tell me everything right now, or just turn around, go and get your things, and get away from me. Go on. The choice is yours.\u201d Tatiana stopped walking near the Fontanka Canal, folded her arms, and waited.</p><p>Alexander stopped walking, too, but didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking it over?\u201d she exclaimed, pulling on his arm, trying to look deeper \u2014 behind his constricted face. Letting go of him, her voice unable to hide her anguish, she said, \u201cI know, Alexander, that when you\u2019re wearing these clothes, your army clothes, you wear them as armor against me, so you don\u2019t have to tell me anything. Because I also know that when you\u2019re naked and making love to me, you\u2019re completely defenseless, and if only I were stronger, I could ask anything then, and you would tell me. Trouble is . . .\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cI\u2019m not stronger. I\u2019m just as defenseless against you. So you, afraid I\u2019m going to see the truth and your agony, afraid I\u2019ll see that you\u2019re saying good-bye to me, you turn me over because you think if I don\u2019t see it, I can\u2019t feel it.\u201d She started to cry. I\u2019m not doing so well, she thought. Where is my strength?</p><p>\u201cPlease, stop,\u201d Alexander whispered, not looking at her.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can feel it, Shura,\u201d Tatiana said, wiping her face and grabbing his hand. He pulled it from her. \u201cYou came here, angry, yes, upset, yes, because you thought you had said good-bye to me for good in Lazarevo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I was angry and upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it turns out,\u201d Tatiana continued, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to say good-bye to me in Leningrad. But you\u2019ll have to do it to my face, all right?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana saw Alexander\u2019s tormented eyes.</p><p>She stepped up. He backed away. What a waltz they danced in the stark morning. But Tatiana\u2019s heart was strong; she could take it. \u201cAlexander. I know \u2014 you think I don\u2019t know? I\u2019ve got nothing to do but think about the things you tell me. You have wanted to escape to America all your Soviet life. It was the only thing that had kept you going the years before me, those years in the army. That someday you might return home.\u201d She stretched out her hand to him. He took it. \u201cAm I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut then I met you.\u201d</p><p>Then I met you. Stop, stop. Oh, the summer last year, the white nights by the Neva, the Summer Garden, the northern sun, his smiling face. Tatiana looked at his heartbreaking face. She wanted to speak. Where were all those words she once knew? Where were they now when she needed them most?</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cTania, it\u2019s too late for me. From the moment my father decided to abandon the life we had in America, he doomed us all. I knew it first \u2014 even then. My mother second. My father third, last, but most heartfelt. My mother could ease her pain by blaming him. I thought I could ease mine by joining the army and by being young, but who did my father have to point a finger to?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana came up to him and held on to his coat. Alexander put his arms around her. \u201cTania, when I found you, I felt for that hour or two we were together \u2014 before Dimitri, before Dasha \u2014 that somehow I was going to right my life.\u201d Alexander smiled bitterly. \u201cI had a sense of hope and destiny that I can neither explain nor understand.\u201d He wasn\u2019t smiling anymore. \u201cThen our Soviet life interfered. You saw, I tried to stay away. I thought, I must stay away. I must keep away. Before Luga. After Luga. Look how I tried after I came to see you at the hospital. I tried to put distance between us after St. Isaac\u2019s, after the Germans closed the ring around Leningrad.\u201d He paused. He shook his head. \u201cI should have, somehow . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to,\u201d Tatiana said faintly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cIf only I hadn\u2019t come to Lazarevo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d she gasped. \u201cWhat are you saying? How can you regret\u2014\u201d She didn\u2019t finish. How could he be regretting them? She stared at him, perplexed and ashen.</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t respond. \u201cSome destiny. I\u2019ve done nothing since the day I met you but hurt your heart and \u2014 worse \u2014 drag you into my own destruction.\u201d He shook his head so hard his cap fell off.</p><p>Tatiana picked up his cap, brushed off the slush, and gave it back to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Hurt my heart? Forget all that, it\u2019s done with. Alexander . . . and I came willingly.\u201d She paused, frowning. \u201cWhat destruction? I\u2019m not doomed,\u201d said Tatiana slowly, not understanding. \u201cI\u2019m lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen open my eyes.\u201d Like you did once before. She pulled the scarf tighter around her neck, wanting to bundle up, wanting to be near a fire, wanting to be in Lazarevo.</p><p>Tatiana watched Alexander gulp down his fear. He turned his face away and started to walk along the canal pavement. Not looking at her, Alexander said, \u201cI took the five thousand dollars because I was going to give it to Dimitri. I\u2019ve been trying to convince him to run by himself\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tatiana laughed without feeling. \u201cStop it.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI suspected that was why you took half the money. The man who wouldn\u2019t go half a kilometer out onto the ice with me? Is that the man you think is going to America by himself? Honestly.\u201d They stopped for a red light just past Engineers Castle, last winter used as a hospital and now nearly unrecognizable after repeated bombings. \u201cDimitri would never go by himself,\u201d Tatiana went on. \u201cI already told you. He is a coward and a parasite. You are his courage and his host. What are you even thinking? As soon as Dimitri realizes you\u2019re not going, he won\u2019t go either, and if he remains in the Soviet Union and sees suddenly that he\u2019s got no hope of escape, then he\u2019s going straight to his new friend Mekhlis of the NKVD, and you will be instantly\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tatiana broke off, staring at Alexander. Something dawned on her. His face was too miserable. \u201cYou know all this. You know he\u2019ll never go without you. You know this already.\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>They began walking again, over the crippled-by-shelling Fontanka Bridge, stepping over the granite pieces. \u201cSo what are you even talking about, then?\u201d Tatiana said, nudging him slightly and looking up into his face, full of incomprehensible fear. She could not imagine that Alexander was afraid for himself. Whom was he afraid for?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of me\u2014\u201d Tatiana wanted to continue, but the words got stuck in her throat.</p><p>Her eyes opened; her heart opened.</p><p>Truth flowed in, but not the truth she had known with Alexander. No. Truth illuminating terror. Truth lighting up those hideous corners of an ugly room, with the rotting wood and the broken plaster and the ratty furniture. Once Tatiana saw it, once she saw what was left\u2014</p><p>She came around and stood in front of Alexander, stopping him from walking. Too many things were making themselves clear on this desolate Leningrad Saturday. Alexander was thinking of her. He was thinking only of her.</p><p>\u201cTell me . . .\u201d Tatiana said faintly, \u201cwhat do they do to wives of Red Army officers arrested on suspicion of high treason? Arrested for being foreign infiltrators? What do they do to wives of American men who jumped out of trains on the way to prison?\u2019</p><p>Alexander said nothing, closing his eyes.</p><p>And suddenly \u2014 the flip side. His eyes were closed. Hers were open.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Shura . . .\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they do to wives of deserters?\u201d</p><p>Alexander did not reply. He tried to go around her, but Tatiana stopped him, putting both her hands on his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t turn your face from me,\u201d she said. \u201cTell me, what does the Commissariat of Internal Affairs do with wives of soldiers who desert, soldiers who run into the woods in marshy Finland, what do they do with the Soviet wives who remain behind?\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>\u201cShura!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat is the NKVD going to do with me? The same thing they do to wives of MIAs? Or POWs? What did Stalin call it, protective custody? What is that a euphemism for?\u201d</p><p>Alexander was silent.</p><p>\u201cShura!\u201d Tatiana wasn\u2019t letting him off the bombed-out bridge. \u201cIs that a euphemism for being shot? Is it?\u201d She was panting.</p><p>Tatiana stared at Alexander in disbelief, inhaling the cold wet air, her nose hurting from the frost, and she thought back to the river Kama \u2014 the icy water every morning on her naked body as it touched him, thought back to all Alexander had tried to hide from her in the corners of his soul where he hoped she would not peek. But in Lazarevo, Tatiana\u2019s eyes saw only the Kama sunrise. It was only here in dreary Leningrad that all was exposed, the darkness and the light, the day and the night. \u201cAre you telling me,\u201d she breathed out, \u201cthat whether you go or stay, I am done for?\u201d</p><p>Turning his agonized face away from her, Alexander said nothing.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s scarf fell off her head. Numbly she picked it up and held it in her hands. \u201cNo wonder you couldn\u2019t tell me. But how could I not have seen?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow? Because you never think of yourself,\u201d Alexander said, grabbing his rifle, moving from foot to foot, not looking at her. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why,\u201d he said, \u201cI wanted you to stay in Lazarevo. I wanted you to stay as far away from here, as far away from me, as possible.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shivered, putting her hands inside the pockets of her coat. \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you kept me in Lazarevo, you\u2019d keep me safe?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHow long do you think it would take the village Soviet right next to the bathhouse to receive the order by that long Lend-Lease telegraph line to have me come in for a few questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I liked Lazarevo so much,\u201d he said, not looking at her. \u201cThe village Soviet didn\u2019t have a telegraph line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you liked Lazarevo so much?\u201d</p><p>Alexander lowered his head to his chest, his warm eyes cooling off, his breath a vapor. His back to the stone wall, he said, \u201cNow do you see? Now do you understand? Are your eyes opened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I see.\u201d Everything. \u201cNow I understand.\u201d Everything. My eyes are opened.</p><p>\u201cDo you see there is only one way out before us?\u201d</p><p>Narrowing her eyes at him, Tatiana stopped talking, backing away from Alexander, tripping over her scarf, and falling on the bombed, deserted bridge under the liquid sky. Alexander went to help her up and then let go. He could not continue to touch her, Tatiana saw that. And for a moment she could not touch him. But it was just a moment. At first it was black, but the clearing inside her own head made her breathless. Suddenly, through the darkness, there was light, light! She saw it up ahead and she flew to it, knowing what it was, and before she opened her mouth to speak, she felt such relief as if her weight \u2014 and his \u2014 had been lifted.</p><p>Tatiana looked at Alexander with her clearest eyes.</p><p>Perplexed, he stared at her. She stretched out her arms to him and said quietly, \u201cShura, look, look here.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her.</p><p>\u201cAll around you is darkness,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in front of you I stand.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her.</p><p>\u201cDo you see me?\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Just as faintly.</p><p>She came closer to him, stepping over the broken granite. Alexander sank to the ground.</p><p>Tatiana studied him for a few moments and then descended to her knees. Alexander put his face into his shaking hands.</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cDarling, soldier, husband. Oh, God, Shura, don\u2019t be afraid. Will you listen to me, please? Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander would not.</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d Tatiana said, clenching her fists to keep her composure. Stop. Breathe. Beg for strength. \u201cYou think your death is our only choice? Remember what I told you in Lazarevo? Do you not remember me in Lazarevo? I cannot bear the thought of you dying. And I will do everything in my pathetic, powerless life to keep that from happening. You have no chance here in the Soviet Union. No chance. The Germans or the Communists will kill you. That\u2019s their sole objective. And if you die at war, your death will mean that for the rest of my life I will be eating poisoned mushrooms in the Soviet Union, alone and without you! And you know it. Your greatest sacrifice will be for my life in darkness.\u201d Come on, Tania, be strong. \u201cYou wanted me to let you go? You wanted my faithful face to free you?\u201d Her voice could not keep from breaking. \u201cWell, here I am! Here is my face.\u201d She wished he would look at her. \u201cGo, Alexander. Go!\u201d she said. \u201cRun to America, and never look back.\u201d Stop. Breathe. Breathe again. She couldn\u2019t even wipe her eyes. All right, I cried, but I think I did well, Tatiana thought. And besides, he wasn\u2019t looking at me.</p><p>Taking his hands away from his face, Alexander glared at her for several moments before he spoke. \u201cTatiana, are you out of your mind? I need you right now,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cto stop being ridiculous. Can you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d Tatiana whispered, \u201cI never imagined that I could love anyone like I love you. Do this for me. Go! Return home, and don\u2019t think about me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, stop it, you don\u2019t mean a word of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she exclaimed, still on her knees. \u201cWhich part don\u2019t you think I mean? Have you be alive in America or dead in the Soviet Union? You think I don\u2019t mean that? Shura, it\u2019s the only way, and you know it.\u201d She paused when he did not speak. \u201cI know what I would do if I were you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cWhat would you do? You would leave me to die? Leave me in the Fifth Soviet apartment, living with Inga and Stan, orphaned and alone?\u201d</p><p>Frantically Tatiana chewed her lip. It was love or truth.</p><p>Love won.</p><p>Steeling herself, she said, \u201cYes,\u201d in a fragment of a voice. \u201cI would choose America over you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander broke down. \u201cCome here, you lying wife,\u201d he said, bringing her close, encompassing her.</p><p>The ice on the Fontanka Canal was just forming where they were crumbled against the granite parapets.</p><p>\u201cShura, listen to me,\u201d Tatiana said into Alexander\u2019s chest, \u201cif no matter which way we twist in this world, we are faced with this impossible choice, if no matter what we do, I cannot be saved, then I beg of you, I beg of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania! God, I will not listen to this anymore!\u201d he shouted, pushing her away and jumping to his feet, holding the rifle in his hands.</p><p>She stared at him pleadingly, still on the ice. \u201cYou can be saved, Alexander Barrington. You. My husband. Your father\u2019s only son. Your mother\u2019s only son.\u201d Tatiana extended her hands to him in supplication. \u201cI am Parasha,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd I am the cost of the rest of your life. Please! There was once a time I saved myself for you. Look at me, I\u2019m on my knees.\u201d She was weeping. \u201cPlease, Shura, please. Save your one life for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d Alexander pulled her up to him so hard, he lifted her off her feet. She clung to him, not letting go. \u201cYou are not going to be the cost of the rest of my life!\u201d he said, setting her down. \u201cNow, I need you to stop this.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head into his chest. \u201cI won\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, you will,\u201d he said, squeezing her to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather we both perish?\u201d she cried. \u201cIs that what you would prefer? You\u2019d prefer all the suffering, all the sacrifice, and no Leningrad at the end of it?\u201d She shook him. \u201cAre you out of your mind? You must go! You will go, and you will build yourself a new life.\u201d</p><p>Alexander pushed her away and walked a few strides from her. \u201cIf you don\u2019t keep quiet,\u201d he said, \u201cI swear to God, I am going to leave you here and go\u201d \u2014 he pointed down the street \u2014 \u201cand I will never come back!\u201d</p><p>Tatiana nodded, pointing in the same direction. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want. Go. But far, Shura,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Alexander yelled, slamming his rifle on the ice. \u201cWhat kind of crazy world do you live in? What, you think you can come here, fly in on your little wings, and say, all right, Shura, you can go, and I just go? How do you think I can leave you? How do you think it\u2019ll be possible for me to do that? I couldn\u2019t leave a dying stranger in the woods. How do you think I can leave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Tatiana said, crossing her arms. \u201cBut you better find a way, big man.\u201d</p><p>They fell quiet. What to do? She watched him from a distance.</p><p>\u201cDo you see how impossible it is what you\u2019re saying?\u201d Alexander said. \u201cDo you even see, or have you completely lost your senses?\u201d</p><p>She saw how impossible it was what she was saying. \u201cI\u2019ve completely lost my senses. But you must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, I\u2019m not going anywhere without you,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept to the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it. You must go.\u201d</p><p>He yelled, \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander!\u201d Tatiana screamed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop, I am going back to Fifth Soviet and I\u2019m going to hang myself over the bathtub, so you can run to America free of me! I\u2019m going to do it on Sunday, five seconds after you leave, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other for a mute, unspeakable moment.</p><p>Tatiana stared at Alexander.</p><p>Alexander stared at Tatiana.</p><p>Then he opened his arms, and she ran into them; he lifted her off her feet, they hugged and did not let go. For many silent minutes they stood on the Fontanka Bridge, wrapped around each other.</p><p>At last Alexander spoke into her neck. \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal, Tatiasha, all right? I will promise you that I\u2019ll do my best to keep myself alive, if you promise me that you\u2019ll stay away from bathtubs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got yourself a deal.\u201d Tatiana looked into his face. \u201cSoldier,\u201d she said clutching him, \u201cI hate to point out the obvious at a time like this, but still . . . I need to point out that I was completely right. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were completely wrong. That\u2019s all,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI said to you that some things were worth a great sacrifice. This is just not one of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Alexander. What you said to me \u2014 your exact words to me \u2014 was that all great things worth having required great sacrifices worth giving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, what the hell are you going on about? I mean, just for a second, step away from the world in which you live and into mine, for a millisecond, all right, and tell me, what kind of life do you think I could build for myself in America knowing that I left you in the Soviet Union \u2014 to die \u2014 or to rot?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe Bronze Horseman would indeed pursue me all through that long night into my maddening dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And that would be your price for light instead of darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not paying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, Alexander, my fate is sealed,\u201d Tatiana said without acrimony or bitterness, \u201cbut you have a chance, right now, while you are still so young to kiss my hand and to go with God because you were meant for great things.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cYou are the best of men.\u201d Her arms were around his neck, and her feet were off the ground.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Alexander, clamping her to him. \u201cRunning to America, abandoning my wife. I\u2019m just f*cking priceless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impossible?\u201d Alexander whispered, setting her down. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s walk a bit before we freeze.\u201d She held on to him as they stepped slowly through the trampled snow down Fontanka to the Field of Mars. Silently they crossed the Moika Canal and walked into the Summer Garden.</p><p>Tatiana opened her mouth to speak, but Alexander shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t say a word. What are we even thinking, walking through here? Let\u2019s go. Quick.\u201d</p><p>Their heads bent and his arm around her, they walked quickly down the path among the tall, bare trees, past the empty benches, past the statue of Saturn devouring his own child. Tatiana remembered that the last time they were here in the warmth, she had yearned for him to touch her, and now in the cold she was touching him and feeling that she did not deserve what she had been given \u2014 a life in which she was loved by a man like Alexander.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you then?\u201d he said. \u201cI told you that was the best time. And I was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were wrong,\u201d Tatiana said, unable to look at him. \u201cThe Summer Garden was not the best time.\u201d</p><p>She was sitting on his bare shoulders in the water, waiting for him to throw her over into the Kama. He wasn\u2019t moving. \u201cShura,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat are you waiting for?\u201d He wasn\u2019t moving. \u201cShura!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kind of man would throw off a girl sitting naked around his neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ticklish man!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Exiting through the gilded iron gates on the Neva embankment, they headed mutely upriver. Weakening by minutes, Tatiana took Alexander\u2019s arm and slowed him down. \u201cCan\u2019t walk our streets with you anymore,\u201d she said hoarsely.</p><p>From the embankment they turned to Tauride Park. They passed their bench on Ulitsa Saltykov-Schedrin, walked a little farther along the wrought-iron fence, stopped, stared at each other and turned around. They sat down in their coats. Tatiana sat for a minute next to Alexander, then got up and climbed into his lap. Pressing her head to his, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>Silently they sat together on their bench in the cold. Tatiana\u2019s whole body struggled with heartbreak. \u201cWhy,\u201d she whispered into his mouth, \u201cwhy can\u2019t we have even what Inga and Stan have? Yes, in the Soviet Union, but together twenty years, still together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Inga and Stan are Party spies,\u201d replied Alexander. \u201cBecause Inga and Stan sold their souls for a two-bedroom apartment, and now they don\u2019t have either.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou and I want too much from this Soviet life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want nothing from this life,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cJust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, and running hot water, and electricity, and a little house in the desert, and a state that doesn\u2019t ask for your life in return for these small things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tatiana said, shaking her head. \u201cJust you.\u201d</p><p>Moving her hair back under her scarf, Alexander studied her face. \u201cAnd a state that doesn\u2019t ask for your life in return for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe state,\u201d she said with a sigh, \u201chas to ask for something. After all, it protects us from Hitler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut, Tania, who is going to protect you and me from the state?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana held him closer. One way or another she had to help Alexander. But how? How to help him? How to save him?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see? We live in a state of war. Communism is war on you and me,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to keep you in Lazarevo. I was just trying to hide my artwork until the war was over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hiding it in the wrong place,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cYou told me yourself there was no safe place in the Soviet Union.\u201d She paused. \u201cBesides, this war is going to be a long one. It\u2019s going to take some time to reconstruct our souls.\u201d</p><p>Squeezing her, Alexander muttered, \u201cI have to stop talking to you. Do you ever forget anything I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all I\u2019ll have left of you.\u201d</p><p>They sat.</p><p>Tatiana brightened. \u201cAlexander,\u201d she said, \u201cwant to hear a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDying to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we get married, I\u2019ll be there to share all your troubles and sorrows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat troubles? I don\u2019t have any troubles,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cI said when we get married,\u201d replied Tatiana, her tearful eyes twinkling. \u201cYou have to admit that you getting killed at the front so I can live in the Soviet Union, and me hanging myself over a bathtub so you can live in America is an ironic tale quite well told, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. But since we are not leaving a scrap of family behind,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cthere will be no one to tell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cBut still . . . how Greek of us, don\u2019t you think?\u201d She smiled and squished his face.</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d he asked. \u201cFind comfort? Through anything. How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been comforted by the master,\u201d she said, kissing his forehead.</p><p>He tutted. \u201cSome master I am. Couldn\u2019t even get one tiny tadpole of a wife to stay in Lazarevo.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana watched him stare at her. \u201cWhat, husband?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania . . . you and I had only one moment . . .\u201d said Alexander. \u201cA single moment in time, in your time and mine . . . one instant, when another life could have still been possible.\u201d He kissed her lips. \u201cDo you know what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d</p><p>When Tatiana looked up from her ice cream, she saw a soldier staring at her from across the street.</p><p>\u201cI know that moment,\u201d whispered Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cRegret that I crossed the street for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Shura,\u201d she replied. \u201cBefore I met you, I could not imagine living a life different from my parents, my grandparents, Dasha, me, Pasha, our children. Could not have conceived of it.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream of someone like you even when I was a child in Luga. You showed me, in a glimpse, in our tremor, a beautiful life . . .\u201d She peered into his eyes. \u201cWhat did I ever show you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat there is a God,\u201d whispered Alexander.</p><p>\u201cThere is!\u201d exclaimed Tatiana. \u201cAnd I felt your need for me clear across the steppes. I\u2019m here for you. And one way or another we will fix this.\u201d She squeezed him. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. You and I will fix this together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? And now what?\u201d came Alexander\u2019s voice at her head.</p><p>Taking a frigid breath, Tatiana spoke, trying to sound as cheerful as possible. \u201cHow, I don\u2019t know. What now? Now we go blindly into the thick forest at the other side of which awaits the rest of our short but oh-so-blissful time on this earth. You go and fight me a nice war, Captain, and you stay alive, as promised, and keep Dimitri off your back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, I could kill him. Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn cold blood? I know you couldn\u2019t. And if you could, how long do you think God would look after you then in war? And me in the Soviet Union?\u201d She paused, trying to get hold of her departing senses. It wasn\u2019t as if she herself hadn\u2019t thought about it . . . but Tatiana had the feeling that it was not the Almighty who was keeping Dimitri alive.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d asked Alexander. \u201cWhat now for you? I don\u2019t suppose you might consider going back to Lazarevo?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Tatiana shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. You must know that having survived last winter\u2019s Leningrad, I\u2019m ready for the worst.\u201d She traced her glove along Alexander\u2019s cheeks, thinking, and the very best, too. \u201cAnd though I do sometimes wonder,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhat\u2019s ahead of me if I needed Leningrad to pave my way into it . . . it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m here for the long haul, or the short haul. I\u2019m here to stay. And I\u2019m paved and ready for it all.\u201d Her heart throbbing, Tatiana hugged him to her. \u201cRegret crossing the street for me, soldier?\u201d</p><p>Taking her hand into both of his, Alexander said, \u201cTania, I was spellbound by you from the first moment I saw you. There I was, living my dissolute life, and war had just started. My entire base was in disarray, people were running around, closing accounts, taking money out, grabbing food out of stores, buying up the entire Gostiny Dvor, volunteering for the army, sending their kids to camp\u2014\u201d He broke off. \u201cAnd in the middle of my chaos, there was you!\u201d Alexander whispered passionately. \u201cYou were sitting alone on this bench, impossibly young, breathtakingly blonde and lovely, and you were eating ice cream with such abandon, such pleasure, such mystical delight that I could not believe my eyes. As if there were nothing else in the world on that summer Sunday. I give you this so that if you ever need strength in the future and I\u2019m not there, you don\u2019t have to look far. You, with your high-heeled red sandals, in your sublime dress, eating ice cream before war, before going who knows where to find who knows what, and yet never having any doubt that you would find it. That\u2019s what I crossed the street for, Tatiana. Because I believed that you would find it. I believed in you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander wiped the tears from her eyes and, pulling off her glove, pressed his warm lips to her hand.</p><p>\u201cBut I would\u2019ve come back empty-handed that day if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. You didn\u2019t start with me. I came to you because you already had yourself. You know what I bring you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His voice choking with emotion, he said, \u201cOfferings.\u201d</p><p>Alexander and Tatiana sat a long time with their wet, cold faces pressed against each other, his arms around her, her hands cradling his head, while the wind blew the last dead leaves off the trees, while the sky was a leaky November gray.</p><p>A tram went by. Three people walked down the street at the end of which Smolny Monastery stood, concealed with scaffolding and camouflage. Down by the granite carapace the river was icy and still. And past the empty Summer Garden the Field of Mars lay flat under blackened snow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A WINDOW TO THE WEST</p><p>AFTER Alexander left, Tatiana wrote to him every day until her ink ran out. When her ink ran out, she went across the street to Vania Rechnikov\u2019s apartment. She had heard he had ink he lent sometimes. Vania was dead at his writing table. He had put his head down on the letter he had been writing and died. Tatiana couldn\u2019t pry the pen from his stiff fingers.</p><p>Tatiana went to the post office every day in hopes of hearing from Alexander. She couldn\u2019t take the silence in between the letters. Alexander wrote her a stream, but the stream would come in a flood instead of a steady trickle. The damn mail.</p><p>She stayed in her room when she was not working and practiced her English. During air raids she read her mother\u2019s cookbook. Tatiana started cooking dinner for Inga, who was sick and alone.</p> <p>One afternoon the postmaster wouldn\u2019t give her any of Alexander\u2019s letters, offering her not only his letters but a bag of potatoes, too, in return for something from her.</p><p>She wrote to Alexander about it, afraid that none of his future letters would get through.</p><p>Tania,</p><p>Please go to the barracks and ask for Lieutenant Oleg Kashnikov. He is on base duty, I think from eight to six. He has three bullets lodged in his leg and can\u2019t fight anymore. He is the one who helped me dig you out in Luga. Ask him for some food. I promise he won\u2019t ask for anything in return. Oh, Tatia.</p><p>Also, give him your letters, and he will bring them to me in a day. Please don\u2019t go to the post office.</p> <p>What do you mean, Inga is alone? Where is Stan?</p><p>Why are you still working such crazy hours? The winter is getting harsher.</p><p>I wish you knew how much solace I have thinking of you not too far from me. I\u2019m not going to tell you that you were right to come back to Leningrad, but . . . Did I mention that we were promised ten days off after we broke the blockade?</p><p>Ten days, Tania!</p><p>I wish until then there were a place you could be comforted. But you hang on until then.</p><p>Don\u2019t be worried about me, we\u2019re not doing anything but bringing troops and munitions in for our assault on the Neva sometime very early in the new year.</p> <p>Wait till you hear this! I don\u2019t even know what I did to deserve it, but I\u2019ve received not only another medal but a promotion to go with it. Maybe Dimitri is right about me \u2014 somehow I manage to turn even a defeat into a victory, don\u2019t know how.</p><p>We\u2019re testing the ice on the Neva. The ice doesn\u2019t seem strong enough. It\u2019ll hold up a man, a rifle, maybe a Katyusha, but will it hold a tank?</p><p>We think yes. Then no. Then yes. Then one general engineer who had been designing the Leningrad subway gets the idea to put the tank on a wooden outrigger, flat wood boards on ice, sort of a wooden railroad, to distribute the pressure from the treads evenly. The tanks and all the armored vehicles would use this outrigger to cross. All right, we say.</p><p>We build the outrigger.</p><p>Who is going to drive the tank out on the water to test it?</p><p>I step up and say, sir, I\u2019ll be glad to do it.</p><p>The next day my commander is not pleased at all when all five generals show up for our little demonstration. Including Dimitri\u2019s new friend. Commander motions to me: don\u2019t blow it.</p><p>So here I go, I get into our best and heaviest, the KV-1 \u2014 you remember them, Tatia? And I drive this monster out onto the ice with my commander walking beside the tank and the five generals right behind us, saying, well done, well done, well done.</p> <p>I went about 150 meters, and then the ice started to crack. I heard it and thought, oops. The generals from the back yelled at my commander, run, run!</p><p>So he ran, they ran, the tank broke a canyon in the ice and sank into it, like a, well, like a tank.</p><p>Me with it.</p><p>The turret was open, so I swam up.</p><p>The commander pulled me out and gave me a swig of vodka to warm me up.</p><p>One general said, give this man the order of the Red Star. I\u2019ve also been made a major.</p><p>Marazov says I have become really insufferable. He says I think everyone should listen only to me. You tell me \u2014 does that sound like me?</p><p>Alexander</p><p>Dearest MAJOR Belov!</p><p>Yes, Major, it does sound like you.</p><p>I\u2019m very proud of you. You\u2019ll be a general yet.</p><p>Thank you for letting me give my letters to Oleg. He is a very nice, polite man and yesterday even gave me some dehydrated eggs, which I found amusing and didn\u2019t know quite what to do with. I added water to them, they\u2019re kind of \u2014 oh, I don\u2019t know. I cooked them without oil on Slavin\u2019s Primus. Ate them. They were rubbery.</p><p>But Slavin liked them and said Tsar Nicholas would have enjoyed them in Sverdlovsk. Sometimes I don\u2019t know about our crazy Slavin.</p><p>Alexander \u2014 there is one place I\u2019m comforted.

First of all he smelled clean. He was thin and small and dark blond, and his head was a little big for the rest of his body, but he radiated confidence that Tatiana had not seen in any man but Alexander and now this man, who entered the room, swung up the chart, looked at the patient, glanced at her, glanced back to the patient, clicked his tongue, shook his head, rolled his eyes, and said, in English, \u201cDoesn\u2019t look so good, does he?\u201d</p><p>Though Tatiana understood him, she remained mute, remembering Alexander\u2019s warnings.</p><p>In heavily accented Russian, the doctor repeated himself.</p><p>Nodding, Tatiana said, \u201cI think he\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d</p><p>Emitting a good, non-Russian laugh, he said, \u201cI bet you have, I just bet you have.\u201d He came up to her and extended his hand. \u201cI\u2019m with the Red Cross. Dr. Matthew Sayers. Can you say Sayers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSayers,\u201d Tatiana said perfectly.</p><p>\u201cVery good! What\u2019s Matthew in Russian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatvei.\u201d</p><p>Letting go of her hand, he said, \u201cMatvei. Do you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Matthew better,\u201d she told him, turning back to the gurgling patient.</p><p>Tatiana was right about the doctor, he was competent, friendly, and instantly improved the conditions in their dismal hospital, having brought miracles with him \u2014 penicillin, morphine, and plasma.

I\u2019m not needed there. Shura, dear, please don\u2019t go insane worrying about me. I\u2019m here, and I\u2019m waiting \u2014 impatiently \u2014 until I can see you again. That\u2019s all I do, Alexander \u2014 wait until I can see you again.</p> <p>It\u2019s dark from morning until night with an hour off in the afternoon. Thinking of you is my sunshine, so my days are perpetually sunny. And hot.</p><p>Tatiana</p><p>P.S. The Soviet Union happened to Stan.</p><p>Dear Tania,</p><p>Pushkin never needed to write again after The Bronze Horseman \u2014 and never did, having died so young. But you\u2019re right \u2014 the righteous do not always forge a path to glory. But often they do.</p><p>I don\u2019t care how busy you are, you need to write me more than a couple of lines a week.</p><p>Alexander</p><p>P.S. And you wanted to have what Inga and Stan have.</p> <p>Dearest Tatiasha,</p><p>How was your New Year? I hope you had something delicious. Have you been to see Oleg?</p><p>I\u2019m not happy. My New Year was spent in the mess tent with a number of people, none of whom was you. I miss you. I dream sometimes of a life in which you and I can clink our glasses on New Year\u2019s. We had a little vodka and many cigarettes. We hoped maybe 1943 would be better than 1942.</p><p>I nodded, but thought about the summer of 1942.</p><p>Alexander</p><p>P.S. We lost all 600. I did not send Tolya. He said he will thank me after this war is over.</p><p>P.S.S. Where are you, damn it? I haven\u2019t heard from you in ten days. You haven\u2019t gone back to Lazarevo, have you, now that I\u2019ve finally grown accustomed to your strengthening spirit from only seventy kilometers away? Please send me a letter in the next few days. You know we\u2019re going and we\u2019re not coming back until the Leningrad front and the Volkhov front shake hands. I need to hear from you. I need one word. Don\u2019t send me out on the ice without a single word from you, Tatiana.</p><p>Darling Shura!</p><p>I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here, can\u2019t you feel me, soldier?</p><p>I myself spent New Year at the hospital, and I just want you to know that I clink my glass against yours every day.</p><p>I\u2019ve been working I cannot tell you how many hours, how many nights I sleep in the hospital and don\u2019t come home at all.</p><p>Shura! As soon as you\u2019re back, you must come and see me instantly. Other than for the obvious reasons, I\u2019ve got the most amazing wonderful fantastic thing I desperately need to talk to you about \u2014 and soon. You wanted a word from me? I leave you with one \u2014 the word is HOPE.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Tania</p><p>IN STORIED BATTLES</p><p>ALEXANDER looked at his watch. It was the early morning of January 12, 1943, and Operation Spark \u2014 the Battle for Leningrad \u2014 was about to begin. There was going to be no further attempt. This was it. On the orders of Comrade Stalin, they were going to break the German blockade, and they weren\u2019t returning until they did.</p><p>Alexander had spent the last three days and nights hidden in the wooden bunker on the banks of the Neva with Marazov and six corporals. The artillery encampment was right outside, hiding from view their two 120-millimeter breech-loading mortars, two portable 81-millimeter muzzle-loading mortars, one Zenith antiaircraft heavy machine gun, a Katyusha rocket launcher, and two portable 76-millimeter field guns. On the morning of the attack Alexander was not just ready to fight, he would have fought Marazov if it meant getting out of the confinement of the bunker. They played cards, they smoked, they talked about the war, they told jokes, they slept \u2014 he was done with it all after six hours, and they had stayed in it for seventy-two. Alexander thought about Tatiana\u2019s last letter. What the hell did she mean by \u201cHOPE\u201d? How was that going to help him? Obviously she couldn\u2019t tell him in the letter, but he wished she wouldn\u2019t go firing up his imagination when he didn\u2019t know when he would be able to get to her.</p><p>He needed to get to her.</p><p>Wearing white camouflage, he peeked out of the encampment. The river was disguised like Alexander, the south shore barely visible in the gray light. He was on the northern bank of the Neva just west of Shlisselburg. Alexander\u2019s artillery unit was covering the outermost flank of the river crossing and the most dangerous \u2014 the Germans were extremely well entrenched and defended in Shlisselburg. Alexander could see the fortress Oreshek a kilometer in the distance at the mouth of Lake Ladoga. A few hundred meters before Oreshek lay the bodies of 600 men, who had made a surprise attack six days ago and failed. Alexander wanted to know if they had failed gloriously or vainly. Bravely and without support, they went across the ice and were laid down one by bloody one. Will history remember them? wondered Alexander as he turned his gaze straight ahead.</p><p>He was on air detail today. Marazov was launching Katyusha\u2019s solid-fuel rockets. Alexander knew this was it. He felt it. They were going to break the blockade or die in the process. The 67th Army was forcing the river along an eight-kilometer stretch at whatever the cost. The strategy for the attack was to close ranks with Meretskov\u2019s 2nd Army in Volkhov that was simultaneously attacking Manstein\u2019s Army Group Nord from the rear. The plan was for the rifle guard divisions and some light tanks to cross the river, four guard divisions in all. Two hours later three more rifle divisions with heavy and medium tanks would follow, including six of the men under Alexander\u2019s immediate command. He would remain behind the Zenith on the Neva. He would cross in the third wave, with another heavily armored platoon, commanding a T-34, a medium tank that had a chance of crossing the river without sinking.</p><p>It was just before nine, barely sunrise, the morning sky a dark lavender.</p><p>\u201cMajor,\u201d said Marazov, \u201cis your phone working?\u201d He put out his cigarette and stepped up to Alexander.</p><p>\u201cPhone\u2019s working fine, Lieutenant. Back to your post.\u201d He smiled. Marazov smiled back.</p><p>\u201cHow many miles of field phone wire did Stalin demand from the Americans?\u201d Marazov asked.</p><p>\u201cSixty-two thousand,\u201d replied Alexander, taking the last deep drag of his cigarette.</p><p>\u201cAnd your phone is not working already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLieutenant!\u201d</p><p>Marazov saluted Alexander. \u201cI\u2019m ready, Major.\u201d He stepped aside to the Katyusha. \u201cI\u2019ve been ready. Sixty-two thousand miles is a bit excessive, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Alexander threw his cigarette butt in the snow, wondering if he had time to light another one. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly enough. The Americans will supply us with five times that much before this war is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think they could supply you with a working telephone,\u201d Marazov mumbled, looking away from Alexander.</p><p>\u201cPatience, soldier,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cPhone is working fine.\u201d He was trying to figure out if the Neva was wider than the Kama. He decided it was, but not by much. He had swum the Kama to the other shore and back in heavy current in about twenty-five minutes. How long would it take him to cross the 600 meters of the Neva ice under German fire?</p><p>Alexander concluded he would have to take less than twenty-five minutes.</p><p>The phone rang. Alexander smiled. Marazov smiled. \u201cFinally,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAll good things come to those who wait,\u201d said Alexander, his heart soaring to Tatiana and away. \u201cAll right, men,\u201d he called. \u201cThis is it. Be ready,\u201d he said, standing slightly behind them, his arms positioning the barrel of the Zenith upward. \u201cAnd be brave.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the phone and flagged the go-ahead command to the corporals on the mortars. The men fired three slow-emission smoke bombs that flew across the river and exploded, temporarily obscuring the Nazi line of sight. Instantly Red Army soldiers poured out onto the ice in long, snakelike formations, one right in front of Alexander, and ran across.</p><p>For two hours the heavy fire from 4,500 rifles did not cease. The mortars were deafening. Alexander thought the Soviet soldiers did better than expected \u2014 remarkably better. With his binoculars he spotted a number of downed men on the other shore, but he also spotted many running up the bank and hiding in the trees.</p><p>Three German planes flew low overhead, firing at the Soviet soldiers and breaking holes in the ice \u2014 more danger zones for trucks and men to avoid. A little lower, a little lower, Alexander thought, opening machine-gun fire on the aircraft. One plane exploded; the other two quickly gained altitude to avoid being hit. Alexander loaded a high-explosive shell into the Zenith and fired. Another of the planes burst into flames. The last one gained more altitude and was now unable to fire at the ice; it flew back to the German side of the Neva. Alexander nodded and lit a cigarette. \u201cYou\u2019re doing well,\u201d he yelled to his men, who were so busy loading the shells and firing they didn\u2019t hear him. He hardly heard himself: his ears were muffled to prevent hearing loss.</p><p>At 11:30 A.M. a green flash went off as a signal for the motorized division to move across the Neva in the second wave of attack.</p><p>The go-ahead was too early, but Alexander hoped the element of surprise would work in their favor \u2014 it might if they could move across the ice quickly. Alexander motioned for Marazov to take his men and run. \u201cGo,\u201d Alexander yelled. \u201cStay covered! Corporal Smirnoff!\u201d One of the men turned around. \u201cTake your weapons,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Marazov saluted Alexander, grabbed the handles of the 76-millimeter field gun, yelled to his men, and they started down the short slope and onto the ice. Two other corporals were running holding the 81-millimeter mortars. The 120-millimeter guns were left behind. They were too heavy to transport without a truck. Three soldiers in the front were running with their Shpagins.</p><p>Alexander watched Marazov knocked down by fire, barely thirty meters onto the ice. \u201cGod, Tolya!\u201d he shouted and looked up. The German plane was making one pass over the Neva, firing at the men on the ice. Marazov\u2019s soldiers dropped. Before the plane had a chance to reverse and return, Alexander swung the barrel of the Zenith, aimed, and fired a high-explosive impact shell. He did not miss. The plane was low enough; it burst into flames and dead-spiraled into the river.</p><p>Marazov continued to lie motionless on the ice. Watching him helplessly, Marazov\u2019s men hovered by the field gun. The river was being pummeled by shell fire. \u201cOh, for f*ck\u2019s sake!\u201d Alexander ordered Ivanov \u2014 the remaining corporal \u2014 to man the Zenith, grabbed his machine gun, jumped off the slope, and ran to Marazov, yelling for the rest of the soldiers to continue across the river. \u201cGo! Go!\u201d They grabbed the field gun and the mortars and ran.</p><p>Marazov was splayed on his stomach. Alexander saw why his men had watched him with such helplessness. Kneeling by him, Alexander wanted to turn him over, but the soldier was breathing so painfully that Alexander was afraid to touch him. \u201cTolya,\u201d he said, panting. \u201cTolya, hang on.\u201d Marazov had been hit in the neck. His helmet had fallen off. Alexander desperately looked around to see if he could find a medic to give him some morphine.</p><p>Alexander saw a man appear on the ice, carrying not a weapon but a doctor\u2019s bag. The man wore a heavy woolen overcoat and a woolen hat \u2014 not even a helmet! He was running to the right of Alexander to a group of downed men near a hole in the ice. Alexander had just enough time to think, what a fool, a doctor on the ice, he is insane, when he heard soldiers behind him screaming at the doctor, \u201cGet down! Get down!\u201d But the gunfire was too loud, black smoke was clouding all, and the doctor, standing erect, turned around and yelled in English, \u201cWhat? What are they saying? What?\u201d</p><p>It took Alexander an instant. He saw the doctor on the ice, in the middle of enemy fire but \u2014 more important \u2014 on the edge of the trajectory path of shells from the German side. Alexander knew he had one quarter second, a splinter of time to think. He jumped up and screamed at the top of his lungs in English, \u201cGET THE F*ck DOWN!\u201d</p><p>The doctor heard immediately and dropped. Just in time. The conical shell flew a meter over the man\u2019s head and exploded on impact just behind him. The doctor was propelled like a projectile across the ice and landed head first in the water hole.</p><p>With clear eyes Alexander glanced at Marazov, who, with fixated pupils, was spurting blood from his mouth. Making the sign of the cross on him, Alexander picked up his machine gun and ran twenty meters across the ice, fell on his stomach, and crawled another ten to the water hole.</p><p>The doctor was unconscious, floating in the water. Alexander tried to reach him, but the man was facedown and too far away. Alexander threw his weapons, ammo, and ruck down onto the ice and jumped in. The water was a piercing, frozen deluge and then an instant whole-body anesthetic, numbing him like morphine. Grabbing the doctor by the neck, Alexander pulled him to the edge of the hole and with all his strength hurled him out with one hand while holding on to the ice with the other. Crawling out himself, he lay breathing heavily on top of the doctor, who came to and groaned. \u201cGod, what happened?\u201d In English.</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d said Alexander in English. \u201cStay down. We have to get you to that armored truck on the wooden boards, do you see it? It\u2019s twenty meters. If we can get behind it, we\u2019ll be safer. We\u2019re out in the open here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t move,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cThe water is freezing me from the outside in.\u201d</p><p>Feeling the wet bitter cold himself, Alexander knew what the doctor meant. He scanned the immediate ice. The only cover was the three bodies near the water hole. Crawling across on his stomach, he pulled one body to the doctor and lay it on top of him. \u201cNow, just lie still, keep the body on you, and don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Then he crawled and retrieved another body, throwing it over his back, and picked up his ruck and his weapons. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he said to the doctor, in English.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on to the bottom of my coat for your life. Don\u2019t let go. You\u2019re going for an ice skate.\u201d</p><p>As quickly as he could with one dead man on top of him, Alexander dragged the doctor and the additional corpse twenty meters to the armored truck.</p><p>Alexander felt as though he were losing his hearing, the bursting noise around him filtering in and out in fits through his helmet and his conscious mind. He had to make it. Tatiana made it through the blockade, and she didn\u2019t have a dead man covering her. I can do this, he thought, pulling the doctor faster, faster, faster amid the black, snarling clatter. He thought he heard the whiz of a low plane and wondered when Ivanov was going to shoot the f*cker down.</p><p>The last thing Alexander remembered was a whistling noise closer than he\u2019d ever heard before, an explosion, then painless but severe impact, as he was propelled with frightening force helmet first into the side of an armored truck. Lucky I have a dead man on top of me, thought Alexander. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>Opening his eyes took too much energy out of him. It was such an effort that as soon as he opened them, he closed them again and slept for what felt like a week or a year. It was impossible to tell. He heard faint voices, faint noises; faint smells trickled in: camphor, alcohol. Alexander dreamed of his first roller coaster, the stupendous Cyclone on the shores of Revere Beach in Massachusetts. He dreamed of the sand on Nantucket Sound. There was a short wooden boardwalk, and on this boardwalk they sold cotton candy. He bought three red cotton candies and ate them in his dreams, and every once in a while something would smell not like cotton candy and not like the salt water, and instead of looking forward to a roller coaster, or swimming, or playing cops and robbers under the boardwalk, Alexander started trying to place the smell.</p><p>There were other memories, too \u2014 of woods, of a lake, of a boat. And other images \u2014 collecting pinecones, stringing together a hammock. Falling into a bear trap. They were not his own.</p><p>Through his closed eyes and closed brain he heard soft female voices, over him, and male voices, too; once he heard something fall loudly to the floor; once the noise of a heartbeat: must be the metronome. Then he was thinking of driving through the desert as a child, sandwiched between his mother and father. It was the Mojave; it wasn\u2019t pretty, but it was hot and the car was stuffy, yet he felt cold. Why was he cold?</p> <p>But the desert. For some reason that smell again in the desert. Not cotton candy, not salt, just the smell of\u2014</p><p>A river rushing morning in.</p><p>He opened his eyes again. Before he closed them, he tried to focus. Blurry vision and all, he made out no faces. Why couldn\u2019t he see any faces? All he saw was hazy glimpses of white. But there was the smell again. A shape bending over him. He closed his eyes and could have sworn he heard someone whisper, Alexander. Then metal clanging. Felt his head being held. Held.</p><p>Held.</p><p>Suddenly his brain came awake. He willed his eyes open. He was on his stomach. That\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t see any faces. Blurry again. The shape of something small and white. A voice whispering. What? What? he wanted to say. He couldn\u2019t speak. That smell. It was breath, sweet breath, close to his face. A distinct smell of comfort, the kind of comfort he had known only once in his life.</p> <p>That brought his eyes into alertness. Not focus, just a steady Gaussian white blur.</p><p>\u201cShura, please wake up,\u201d the voice whispered. \u201cAlexander, open your eyes. Open your eyes, my love.\u201d He felt pillow lips on his cheek.</p><p>Alexander opened his eyes. His Tatiana\u2019s face was next to him.</p><p>His eyes filling with tears, he shut them, mouthing, no. No.</p><p>He had to open his eyes. She was calling him. \u201cShura, right now open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the field hospital in Morozovo,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Trying to shake his head. Couldn\u2019t move. \u201cTatia?\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt can\u2019t be you.\u201d</p><p>He slept.</p><p>Alexander was on his back. A doctor was standing in front of him, talking to him in Russian. Alexander concentrated on the voice. Yes. A doctor. What was he saying? It wasn\u2019t clear. The Russian, he couldn\u2019t understand it.</p><p>A little while later, more clear, more comprehensible. Russian suddenly wasn\u2019t foreign.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s coming out of it. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Alexander tried to focus. \u201cHow have I been?\u201d Slowly.</p><p>\u201cNot too good.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander looked around. He was in a rectangular wooden structure with a few small windows. The beds, full of white- and red-bandaged people, were in two rows with a passageway in between.</p><p>He tried to look at the nurses in the distance. The doctor was calling his attention back to him. Alexander reluctantly returned his gaze to the doctor, not wanting to answer any questions. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The doctor sat by the bed and spoke very quietly. \u201cYou saved my life,\u201d he said in comforting, grateful English.</p><p>Dimly Alexander remembered. The ice. The hole. The cold. He shook his head. \u201cRussian only. Please,\u201d he added. \u201cDon\u2019t want to be trading your life for mine.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, the doctor said, \u201cI understand.\u201d He squeezed his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll come back in a few days when you\u2019re a little better. You can tell me more then. I\u2019m not here for long. But you can be sure I wasn\u2019t going to leave you until you were out of the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking . . . going out on the ice?\u201d Alexander asked. \u201cWe have medics for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cI was going out to save the medic. Who do you think you put on my back as you dragged us to the truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was my first time at the front. Could you tell?\u201d The doctor smiled. A good American smile. Alexander wanted to smile back.</p><p>\u201cHas our sleepy patient come awake?\u201d said a cheery nurse with black hair and black button eyes, coming up to his bed, smiling, bustling, and feeling his pulse. \u201cHello there. I\u2019m Ina, and aren\u2019t you a lucky one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d said Alexander. He did not feel lucky. \u201cWhy is my mouth full of cotton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. You\u2019ve been on morphine for a month. We\u2019ve just begun to cut you back last week. I think you were getting hooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Alexander asked the doctor.</p><p>\u201cMatthew Sayers. I\u2019m with the Red Cross.\u201d He paused. \u201cI was an idiot, and for that you nearly paid with your life.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. He looked around the ward. It was quiet. Maybe he had dreamed it. Maybe he had just dreamed her.</p><p>Dreamed her whole.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that be something? She was never in his life. He had never known her. He could go back to the way it had been. To the way he had been.</p><p>What was that way? That man was dead. Alexander did not know that man.</p><p>\u201cA shell exploded right behind us, and a fragment hit you.\u201d Dr. Sayers said. \u201cYou rammed into the truck and fell. I couldn\u2019t move you myself.\u201d His Russian wasn\u2019t very good, but he continued. \u201cI was waving for help. I didn\u2019t want to leave you, but . . .\u201d The doctor glanced at Alexander. \u201cLet\u2019s just say we needed a stretcher for you immediately. One of my nurses came out onto the ice to help.\u201d Sayers shook his head. \u201cShe is something, that one. Actually crawled out. I said to her, \u2018Well, you\u2019re three times smarter than me.\u2019 \u201d Sayers leaned into Alexander. \u201cAnd not only that, she crawled out pushing the box of plasma in front of her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlasma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood fluid without the blood. Lasts longer than whole blood, freezes great, especially in your Leningrad winter. A miracle for wounded like you \u2014 it replaces fluid you lose until we can get a transfusion into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I . . . need fluid replacement?\u201d Alexander asked.</p><p>The nurse patted him cheerfully on the arm. \u201cYes, Major,\u201d she said, \u201cyou could say you needed fluid replacement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, nurse,\u201d said Dr. Sayers. \u201cThe rule we have in America is that we don\u2019t upset the patient. Are you familiar with that rule?\u201d</p><p>Alexander stopped the doctor. \u201cHow bad was I?\u201d</p><p>Sayers said jovially, \u201cYou weren\u2019t looking your best. I left the nurse with you while I went \u2014 crawled,\u201d the doctor corrected himself, smiling, \u201cto get the stretcher. I don\u2019t know how, but she helped me carry it. She carried the end with your head. After we got you to shore, she looked as if she could have used some plasma herself.\u201d</p><p>Alexander, wanting to make the doctor feel better, said, \u201cCrawling or not, if the shell hits you, you\u2019re done for.\u201d</p><p>The nurse said, \u201cYou were almost done for. A shell hit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you crawl out onto the ice?\u201d Alexander asked, feeling grateful, wanting to pat her hand.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I stay far from the front line. I\u2019m not with the Red Cross.\u201d</p><p>Sayers said, \u201cNo, I brought my nurse with me from Leningrad.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShe volunteered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cWhat hospital were you with?\u201d He felt himself starting to fade again.</p><p>\u201cGrechesky.\u201d</p><p>Alexander couldn\u2019t help it, he groaned in pain. He couldn\u2019t stop until Ina gave him another dose of morphine. The doctor, watching carefully, asked if he was all right.</p><p>\u201cDoctor, the nurse who came with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana Metanova.\u201d</p><p>A wretched sound escaped Alexander.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she now?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, Sayers replied, \u201cWhere isn\u2019t she? Building the railroad, I think. We broke the blockade, you know. Six days after you were hit. The two fronts joined together. Immediately eleven hundred women started to build that railroad. Tania is helping out on this side\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she didn\u2019t start right away,\u201d said Ina. \u201cShe was with you, Major, for most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but now that he\u2019s better, she\u2019s gone to help.\u201d Dr. Sayers smiled. \u201cThey\u2019re calling it the railroad of victory. Too soon if you ask me, seeing the state of the men that are brought in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you bring the nurse in here when she returns from the railroad?\u201d Alexander paused. He wanted to explain but felt shattered. He was shattered. \u201cWhere did you say I was hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour back. Your right side got blown out. But the shell fragment cut open the body on top of you, so it\u2019s a good thing you had him.\u201d Dr. Sayers paused. \u201cWe worked very hard to save your kidney.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cDidn\u2019t want you to be taking on the Germans in the future with just one kidney, Major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Doctor. How did you do?\u201d Alexander tried to think about what hurt. \u201cMy back doesn\u2019t feel great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Major, it wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019ve got a third-degree burn around the periphery of the wound. That\u2019s why we kept you on your stomach for so long. We just started rolling you over on your back.\u201d Sayers patted him on the shoulder. \u201cFeel your head? You hit that truck quite hard. But, listen, you\u2019re going to be as good as new, I figure, once the wound and the burn heal and we wean you off the morphine. Maybe in a month you\u2019ll be out of here.\u201d The doctor hesitated, studying Alexander, who did not want to be studied. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk another time, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Alexander muttered.</p><p>Brightening, the doctor said, \u201cBut on the plus side, you\u2019ve been given another medal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it wasn\u2019t posthumously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you can stand up, they\u2019re going to promote you, I\u2019ve been told,\u201d Sayers said. \u201cOh, and some supply guy keeps coming around asking about you. Chernenko?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring the nurse to me, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Alexander, closing his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>3</p><p>A night passed before he saw her again. Alexander woke up, and there she was, sitting by his side. They sat and stared at each other. Tatiana said, \u201cShura, now, don\u2019t be upset with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God\u201d was all Alexander could manage. \u201cYou are just relentless.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Tatiana quietly said, \u201cRelentlessly married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Just relentless.\u201d</p><p>Leaning toward him, she whispered, \u201cRelentlessly in love.\u201d She added, \u201cYou needed me. I came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need you here,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you? I need you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is going to keep you safe?\u201d She took his hand and smiled. Looking around to make sure there were no nurses or doctors close by, she kissed his hand and then pressed it to her face. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right, big man. You just hang on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, after I\u2019m out of here, I\u2019m getting a divorce.\u201d He was not letting go of her face. For anything.</p> <p>Shaking her head, she said, \u201cSorry. Can\u2019t. You wanted a covenant with God? You got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiasha . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, darling, yes, Shura? I\u2019m so happy to hear your voice, to hear you talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth. How bad was I hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too bad,\u201d she replied in a low voice, smiling at him, her face white.</p><p>\u201cWhat was I thinking running out after Marazov like that? I should have let his men take care of him. They were stuck, though. They couldn\u2019t move forward, they weren\u2019t bringing him back.\u201d He paused. \u201cPoor Tolya.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile never leaving her mouth, Tatiana said, slightly glazed over with sadness, \u201cI said a prayer for Tolya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say one for me, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause you weren\u2019t dying. I said a prayer for me. I said, dear God, please help me heal him.\u201d She held his hand. \u201cBut, Alexander, you could no more help running after Marazov than you could help yelling in English at the doctor, or jumping into the water after him, or pulling him behind you to safety. You could no more help that than you could help returning with Yuri Stepanov. Remember, Shura, we are all a sum of our parts. And what do your parts say about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m a f*cking lunatic. My back feels like it\u2019s on fire.\u201d He smiled, remembering Luga. \u201cIs it just glass cuts, Tania?\u201d</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, she said, \u201cYou got burned. But you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She pressed her cheek harder into his hand. \u201cTell me the truth, tell me you\u2019re not happy to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could say it, but I\u2019d be lying.\u201d He rubbed her freckles, gazing at her without blinking.</p><p>She took out a small vial of morphine from her pocket and attached it to the entry point in his IV drip.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>She whispered, \u201cGiving you a small intravenous morphine push. So your back doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s on fire.\u201d In seconds he felt better. She leaned her head back into his hand.</p><p>Alexander looked her over up and down. Tatiana exuded a porous, evanescent, yet everlasting warmth; her very presence, her satin face in his palm made his back hurt less. Her radiant eyes, her flushed cheeks, her slightly parted loving lips . . . Alexander stared at her, his eyes wide open, his soul wide open, his adoring heart hurting exquisitely. \u201cYou are an angel sent from heaven, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>An electric smile lit up her face. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know the half of it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what your Tania has been cooking up here.\u201d In her delight she nearly squealed.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been cooking up? No, don\u2019t sit up. I want to feel your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m practically on top of you. We need to be very careful.\u201d The smile faded an octave. \u201cDimitri walks around here all the time. Walks in, out, checks on you, leaves, comes back. What\u2019s he worried about? He was quite surprised to find me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the only one. How did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll part of my plan, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat plan is this, Tatiana?\u201d</p><p>She whispered, \u201cTo be with you when I die of old age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura, I have to talk to you. I need to talk to you when you\u2019re lucid. I need you to hear me very carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t now. I said lucid.\u201d She smiled. \u201cBesides, I have to go now. I was sitting for an hour waiting for you to wake up. I\u2019ll come back tomorrow.\u201d She looked around his bed. \u201cSee how I put you here in the corner, so that we can have a wall next to you and a little privacy.\u201d She pointed to the window next to his bed. \u201cI know it\u2019s high, but you can see a bit of sky and two trees, northern pines, I think. Pines, Shura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPines, Tania.\u201d</p><p>She got up. \u201cThe man next to you can\u2019t hear or see. If he can speak, it\u2019s a mystery how.\u201d She smiled. \u201cPlus, do you see the isolation tent around him so he can breathe clearer air? I put the tent around him, to help him, but it blocks you from half the ward. This is almost more private than Fifth Soviet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Inga?\u201d</p><p>Pausing, chewing her lip, Tatiana said, \u201cInga is not at Fifth Soviet anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, finally she moved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana, \u201cshe\u2019s been moved.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other and then slowly nodded. Alexander closed his eyes. He did not, could not let go of her. \u201cTania,\u201d he whispered, \u201cis it true you went out on the ice? In the middle of a ferocious battle for Leningrad, you crawled out onto the ice?\u201d</p><p>Bending over him, she quickly kissed him and whispered, \u201cYes, the bravest soldier of my heart. For Leningrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatia,\u201d said Alexander, his nerve endings aching, \u201ctomorrow don\u2019t wait an hour to wake me up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>4</p><p>Alexander thought of nothing else but when he would see her again the following day. She came around lunchtime, bringing him his food. \u201cI\u2019ll feed him, Ina,\u201d she said brightly to the regular nurse. Ina didn\u2019t look too pleased, but Tatiana paid no attention.</p><p>\u201cNurse Metanova thinks she owns my patient,\u201d Ina said, signing Alexander\u2019s chart.</p><p>\u201cShe does own me, Ina,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cIsn\u2019t she the one who brought me the plasma?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it,\u201d mumbled Ina sulkily, glaring at Tatiana and walking away.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she mean by that?\u201d Alexander asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Tatiana replied. \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, I can feed myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to feed yourself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me take care of you,\u201d she said tenderly. \u201cLet me do what you know I ache to do for you. Let me do for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, where is my wedding ring?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt was hanging on a rope around my neck. Did I lose it?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she pulled the braided rope out of her uniform. Two rings hung next to each other. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it until we can wear them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeed me,\u201d he said, his voice deepening with emotion.</p><p>Before she could feed him, Colonel Stepanov came to see Alexander. \u201cI heard you\u2019d awakened,\u201d he said, glancing at Tatiana. \u201cIs this a bad time?\u201d</p> <p>Tatiana shook her head, put the spoon back on the tray, and stood up. \u201cAre you Colonel Stepanov?\u201d she asked, looking from Alexander to the colonel.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, puzzled. \u201cAnd you are\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tatiana took the colonel\u2019s hand in both of hers and held it. \u201cI\u2019m Tatiana Metanova,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to thank you, Colonel, for all you have done for Major Belov.\u201d She did not let go of his hand, and he did not pull away. \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Alexander wanted to hug his wife. \u201cColonel,\u201d he said, grinning, \u201cmy nurse knows that my commander has been good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you don\u2019t deserve, Major,\u201d said Stepanov. He did not pull his hand away from Tatiana\u2019s until she released him. \u201cHave you seen your medal?\u201d</p><p>The medal hung on the back of the chair by Alexander\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they wait until I was conscious to give it to me?\u201d Alexander asked.</p><p>Stepanov said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot just a medal, Major,\u201d interrupted Tatiana. \u201cThe highest medal of honor there is. A Hero of the Soviet Union medal!\u201d she added breathlessly.</p><p>Stepanov looked from Tatiana to Alexander and back again and said, \u201cYour nurse is very . . . proud of you, Major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d He was trying not to smile.</p><p>Stepanov said, \u201cTell you what, why don\u2019t I come back another time, when you\u2019re less busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, sir,\u201d Alexander said, looking away from Tatiana for a moment. \u201cHow are our troops doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine. They had their ten days off, and now they\u2019re trying to push the Germans out of Sinyavino. Big problems there. But you know, little by little.\u201d Stepanov paused. \u201cBetter news \u2014 von Paulus surrendered in Stalingrad last month.\u201d Stepanov chuckled. \u201cHitler made von Paulus a field marshal two days before surrender. He said no German field marshal in history had ever surrendered.\u201d</p><p>Alexander smiled. \u201cVon Paulus obviously wanted to make history. That is great news. Stalingrad held. Leningrad broke the blockade. We may yet win this war.\u201d He fell quiet. \u201cIt will be a Pyrrhic victory indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Stepanov shook Alexander\u2019s hand. \u201cThe kinds of losses we\u2019re suffering, I don\u2019t know who\u2019ll be left to enjoy even a Pyrrhic victory.\u201d He sighed. \u201cGet better soon, Major. Another promotion is waiting for you. Whatever else happens, we\u2019ll get you away from the front line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to be away from the action, sir.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shoved him in the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI mean, yes, thank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Again Stepanov stared at Alexander and Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you in better spirits, Major. I don\u2019t remember the last time I saw you so . . . cheerful. Near-fatal injury agrees with you.\u201d</p><p>Stepanov left.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve completely flummoxed the colonel,\u201d said Alexander, grinning at Tatiana. \u201cWhat did he mean by near-fatal injury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHyperbole. But you were right. He is a nice man.\u201d Tatiana looked at Alexander with teasing rebuke. \u201cI can see you forgot to thank him for me, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, we\u2019re men. We don\u2019t go around slapping each other on the shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat food did you bring me?\u201d</p><p>She had brought cabbage soup with potatoes and white bread with butter.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get all this butter from?\u201d There was a quarter of a kilo.</p><p>\u201cWounded soldiers get extra butter,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you get extra extra butter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike extra extra morphine?\u201d he asked, smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cMmm. You need to get better quick.\u201d</p><p>Every time the spoon moved to his mouth, bringing her fingers closer to him, Alexander breathed in deeply, trying to smell her hands behind the soup.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shrugged. \u201cWho\u2019s got time to eat?\u201d she said breezily. She pulled up her chair closer to his bed.</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cDo you think the other patients will object if my nurse kisses me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, pulling away a bit. \u201cThey\u2019re going to think I kiss everybody.\u201d</p><p>Alexander looked around. There was a man across the room from them, dying, his legs gone. Nothing could be done for him. In the isolation tent next to Alexander\u2019s bed, he heard a man struggling for his every breath. Like Marazov.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Nikolai Ouspensky? He\u2019s lost a lung,\u201d Tatiana said. She cleared her throat. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. He is a nice man. His wife lives in a village nearby, keeps sending him onions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnions?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shrugged. \u201cVillagers, what can I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cIna told me I needed fluid replacement. How badly\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tatiana quickly said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine. You lost a little blood, that\u2019s all.\u201d She paused, then shook something off. \u201cListen,\u201d she said, lowering her voice to a whisper, \u201clisten carefully\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you here with me all the time? Why aren\u2019t you my nurse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Two days ago you told me to go away, and now you want me here all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDearest,\u201d she whispered, smiling, \u201che is here all the time. Did you not hear me? I\u2019m trying to keep a professional distance. Ina is a good critical care nurse. Soon you\u2019ll get better, and maybe we can move you to a convalescent bed if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where you are? I\u2019ll get better in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Shura. I\u2019m not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I need to talk to you, and you keep interrupting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t interrupt,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cif you hold my hand under the blanket.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stuck her hand under the blanket and took hold of his hand, intertwining her little fingers through his. \u201cIf I were stronger, bigger, like you,\u201d she said softly, \u201cI would have picked you up and carried you off the ice myself.\u201d</p><p>Squeezing her hand tight, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t make me upset, all right? I\u2019m too happy to see your lovely face. Please kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Shura, will you listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look so f*cking incredible? Why are you oozing happiness? I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever looked better.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana leaned toward him, parting her lips and lowering her voice to a husky whisper. \u201cNot even in Lazarevo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, you\u2019re making a grown man cry. You\u2019re just shining from the inside out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive. I\u2019m ecstatic.\u201d She looked ecstatic.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get to the front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you would listen, I\u2019d tell you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhen I left Lazarevo, I knew I wanted to become a critical care nurse. Then after you came to see me in November, I decided to enlist. I was going to the front where you were. If you were going into battle for Leningrad, so was I. I was going to go on the ice with the medics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was your plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t tell me then, and I certainly don\u2019t have the strength for this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more strength when you hear what I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d She could barely contain her excitement. His heart pounded. \u201cSo when Dr. Sayers came to Grechesky,\u201d Tatiana continued, \u201cI immediately asked him if he needed an extra pair of hands. He came to Leningrad at the Red Army\u2019s request to help with the anticipated flow of the wounded in this attack.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cI have to tell you, I think even the Soviets underestimated the number of wounded. There is simply no place to put anyone. Anyway, after Dr. Sayers told me he was going to the Leningrad front, I asked him if there was anything I could do to help . . .\u201d Tatiana smiled. \u201cI learned that question from you. As it turned out, he did need my help. The only nurse he had brought with him took ill. Not a surprise is it, in wintry Leningrad? Poor thing caught TB.\u201d Tatiana shook her head. \u201cImagine. Now she\u2019s better, but she remained in Grechesky. They need her there. Since I hadn\u2019t enlisted yet, I came here with Dr. Sayers as his temporary assistant instead. Look,\u201d Tatiana said proudly, showing Alexander her white armband with the Red Cross symbol on it. \u201cInstead of a Red Army nurse, I\u2019m a Red Cross nurse! Isn\u2019t this great?\u201d She beamed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying being at the front, Tania,\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>\u201cShura! Not at the front. Do you know where Dr. Sayers came from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, where he drove his Red Cross jeep from to come to Leningrad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give up.\u201d</p><p>In a thrilled whisper, she said, \u201cHelsinki!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelsinki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right . . .\u201d Alexander drew out.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you know where he is going back to in a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura! Helsinki!\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t say anything. Slowly he turned his head away and closed his eyes. He heard her calling him. He opened his eyes and turned back to her. Her eyes were dancing, and her fingers were tapping his arm, her warm face flushing red, her breathing rapid.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>A nurse on the other side of the hall turned around.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t laugh,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cKeep quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatia, Tatia, stop. I beg you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you listen to me? As soon as I met Dr. Sayers, I started thinking and thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Grechesky I thought and thought, trying to come up with a plan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, not another plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, plan. I asked myself, can Dr. Sayers be trusted? I thought he could be, yes. I thought I could trust him because he seemed like a good American. I was going to trust him and tell him about you and me, and beg him to help you get back home, beg him to help get us to Helsinki somehow. Just to Helsinki. After that you and I could make it to Stockholm ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, I can\u2019t take any more of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, listen to me!\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf only you knew how God is with us. In December a wounded Finnish pilot came to Grechesky. They come in all the time \u2014 to die. We tried to save him, but he had severe head wounds. Crashed his plane into the Gulf of Finland.\u201d She was barely audible. \u201cI kept his uniform and his ID tag. I hid them in Dr. Sayers\u2019s jeep, in a box of bandages. That\u2019s where they are now \u2014 waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>In astonishment Alexander gaped at Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I was afraid of was asking Dr. Sayers to risk himself for total strangers. I didn\u2019t know quite how to do that.\u201d Tatiana leaned over and kissed his shoulder. \u201cBut you, my husband, you had to intervene. You had to save the doctor. Now I\u2019m sure he will help get you out if he has to carry you on his back.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was speechless.</p><p>\u201cWe will put you in a Finnish uniform, you\u2019ll become Tove Hanssen for a few hours, and we will drive you across the Finnish border in Dr. Sayers\u2019s Red Cross truck to Helsinki. Shura! I will get you out of the Soviet Union.\u201d</p><p>Alexander was still speechless.</p><p>Laughing soundlessly but happily, Tatiana said, \u201cWe have amazing luck, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Pointing to the Red Cross badge on her arm and squeezing his hand under the covers, Tatiana said, \u201cDepending on when you\u2019ll be strong enough, from Helsinki we will take either a merchant vessel, if the ice on the Baltic has broken, or a truck with a protective convoy to Stockholm. Sweden is neutral, remember?\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnd no, I don\u2019t forget a single word of anything you ever tell me.\u201d Letting go of him, she clapped her hands. \u201cIs that not the best plan you ever heard? Much better than your idea of hiding out in the gulf swamps for months.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her with delirium and dizzy disbelief. \u201cWho are you, this woman sitting in front of me?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana got up. Bending over him, she kissed him deeply on the lips. \u201cI\u2019m your beloved wife,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Hope was an amazing healer.</p><p>Suddenly the days stretching out weren\u2019t long enough for Alexander to try to get up, to walk, to move. He couldn\u2019t get out of bed, but he tried supporting himself on his arms, and he sat up finally, and fed himself, and lived for the minutes when Tatiana could come and see him.</p><p>His idleness was making him crazy. He asked Tatiana to bring him pieces of wood and an army knife, and while waiting for her he sat for hours carving the coarse wood into palm trees, into pine trees, into knives and stakes and human forms.</p><p>She would come, every day, many times a day, and sit by him, and whisper. \u201cShura, in Helsinki, we can take a sleigh ride, a drozhki ride. Wouldn\u2019t that be something? And we could actually go to a real church! Dr. Sayers told me Helsinki\u2019s Emperor Nicholas church looks a lot like St. Isaac\u2019s. Shura, are you listening?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he would nod and whittle.</p><p>And she would sit by him and whisper. \u201cShura, did you know that Stockholm is all built out of granite, just like Leningrad? Did you know that our very own Peter the Great took the hotly contested Karelia from Sweden in 1725? Ironic, don\u2019t you think? Even then we were fighting over the land that will now set us free. By the time we get to Stockholm, it\u2019ll be spring, and apparently right on the harbor they have a morning market where they sell fruits and vegetables and fish \u2014 oh, and Shura, they have smoked ham and something called bacon, Dr. Sayers told me. Have you ever had bacon? Shura, are you listening?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he would nod and whittle.</p><p>\u201cAnd in Stockholm we\u2019ll go to this place, called, I can\u2019t remember right now \u2014 oh, yes, called, Sweden\u2019s Temple of Fame, the burial place for her kings.\u201d Delight was all over her face. \u201cHer kings and heroes. You\u2019d like that. We\u2019ll go and see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweet girl,\u201d Alexander said, putting down his knife and his wood, reaching for her, bringing her to him. \u201cWe\u2019ll go and see it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>5</p><p>\u201cAlexander?\u201d Dr. Sayers said, sitting in the chair next to him. \u201cIf I talk quietly, can I speak in English? Russian is so hard for me day in and day out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Alexander replied, also in English. \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear the language again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been able to come by sooner.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI can see I\u2019m getting myself mired in the hell that is the Soviet front. I\u2019m running out of all my supplies, the Lend-Lease shipments can\u2019t come quickly enough, I\u2019m eating your Russian food, sleeping without a mattress\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should have a mattress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wounded have a mattress. I have thick cardboard.\u201d</p><p>Alexander wondered if Tatiana also had thick cardboard.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d be out of here already, but look at me. Still here. My days are twenty hours long. Listen, I have a bit of time finally. You want to talk?\u201d</p><p>Alexander shrugged, studying the doctor. \u201cWhere are you from, Dr. Sayers? Originally?\u201d</p> <p>Sayers smiled. \u201cBoston. Familiar with Boston?\u201d</p><p>Alexander nodded. \u201cMy family was from Barrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well,\u201d Sayers exclaimed. \u201cWe\u2019re practically neighbors.\u201d He paused. \u201cSo tell me. Long story with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me? I\u2019m dying to know how an American ended up as a major in the Red Army.\u201d</p><p>In response Alexander studied the doctor, who said gently, \u201cHow long have you lived not being able to trust anyone? Trust me.\u201d</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, Alexander told him. If Tatiana trusted this man, it was good enough for him.</p><p>Dr. Sayers listened intently and then said, \u201cThat\u2019s some mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not kidding,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Now it was Sayers\u2019s turn to study Alexander. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>Alexander did not reply at first. \u201cYou owe me nothing.\u201d</p><p>Sayers paused. \u201cDo you . . . want to come home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI want to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p> <p>Alexander looked at him. \u201cTalk to my nurse. She\u2019ll tell you what to do.\u201d Where was his nurse? He needed to lay his eyes on her.</p><p>\u201cIna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Tatiana.\u201d The doctor\u2019s face eased into affection. \u201cShe knows about you?\u201d</p><p>Alexander did a double take at the doctor\u2019s expression and then laughed softly, shaking his head. \u201cDr. Sayers, I am indeed going to trust you with everything. You will hold two lives in your hands. Tatiana . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . is my wife.\u201d Those words trickled warmth all over his insides.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife.\u201d</p><p>The doctor stared at him incredulously. \u201cShe is?\u201d</p><p>With quiet amusement Alexander watched the doctor\u2019s reaction as he blanked, then cleared, then thought back, then understood with a spark of mixed sadness and comprehension. \u201cOh, how stupid of me,\u201d he said. \u201cTatiana is your wife. I should\u2019ve known. So many things are suddenly clear.\u201d Breathing hard, Dr. Sayers said, \u201cWell, well. Lucky you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Major. I mean, you\u2019re a lucky man. But never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows but you, Doctor. Talk to her. She is not on morphine. She is not injured. She\u2019ll tell you what she wants you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf that I have no doubt,\u201d said Dr. Sayers. \u201cI can see, I\u2019m not leaving anytime soon. Anyone else you\u2019d like me to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>As he stood up, Dr. Sayers shook Alexander\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIna,\u201d Alexander asked the nurse, who took care of him between Tatiana\u2019s visits, \u201cwhen am I going to be moved to the convalescent wing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your hurry? You\u2019ve just regained consciousness. We will take care of you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I lost is a little blood. Let me out of here. I\u2019ll walk there myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a hole in your back, Major Belov, the size of my fist,\u201d said Ina. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a small fist,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what the big deal is,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere, that\u2019s the big deal. Now, let me turn you so I can clean that nasty wound of yours.\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned over himself. \u201cHow nasty is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNasty, Major. The shell ripped off a hunk of your flesh.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cDid it rip off a pound of my flesh, Ina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. So tell me the truth \u2014 how bad was I hurt?\u201d</p><p>While changing his dressings, Ina said, \u201cBad. What, Nurse Metanova didn\u2019t tell you? She\u2019s impossible. Dr. Sayers took one look at you after they brought you in and said he didn\u2019t think you were going to make it.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t surprise Alexander. He had floated so long on the periphery of consciousness. It hadn\u2019t felt much like life. Yet dying seemed inconceivable. He lay on his stomach while Ina cleaned his wound and listened to her.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor is a good man, and he wanted to save you, feeling personally responsible. But he said you had lost just too much blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in critical care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you are.\u201d Ina shook her head. \u201cYou weren\u2019t here to begin with.\u201d Patting his shoulder, she said, \u201cYou went right to terminal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His smile evaporated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that Tatiana nurse,\u201d said Ina. \u201cShe is . . . well, frankly, I think she\u2019s concentrating too much on the terminal cases. She ought to be helping the critical, but she\u2019s always in the terminal ward trying to save the hopeless.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s where she was. \u201cHow does she do?\u201d muttered Alexander.</p><p>\u201cNot too good. They\u2019re dying left and right there. But she stays with the patients until the end. I don\u2019t know what it is with her. They still die, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey die happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happy, just \u2014 I can\u2019t explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she exclaimed, bending over and looking at Alexander. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Not afraid. I say to her, \u2018Tania, they\u2019re going to die anyway, leave them alone.\u2019 And not just me. Dr. Sayers keeps telling her to come and work in the critical wing. But she doesn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d Ina lowered her voice. \u201cNot even from the doctor!\u201d</p><p>That brought a smile back to Alexander\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got some mouth on her, too. I don\u2019t know how she gets away with a tenth of the things she says to that nice man who is running ragged around this hospital. When they first brought you in, like I said, the doctor looked at you and shook his head. \u2018He is bled out,\u2019 he said, and he said it sadly. I could tell he was upset.\u201d</p><p>Bled out? Alexander paled.</p><p>Ina continued. \u201c \u2018Forget him,\u2019 he said. \u2018There is nothing we can do.\u2019 \u201d She stopped washing Alexander for a second. \u201cAnd do you know what that Tatiana said to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ina\u2019s voice was full of gossipy, hot frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t know who she thinks she is. She came up really close to him, lowered her voice, looked him straight in the eye and said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s good thing, Doctor, that he didn\u2019t say the same thing about you when you were floating unconscious in the river! It\u2019s a good thing he didn\u2019t turn his back on you when you fell, Dr. Sayers.\u2019 \u201d Ina laughed gleefully. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe her nerve. To talk that way to a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was she thinking?\u201d muttered Alexander, closing his eyes and imagining his Tania.</p><p>\u201cShe was determined. It was like some kind of a personal crusade with her,\u201d Ina said. \u201cShe gave the doctor a liter of blood for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did she get it from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHerself, of course.\u201d Ina smiled. \u201cLucky for you, Major, our Nurse Metanova is a universal donor.\u201d</p><p>Of course she is, thought Alexander, keeping his eyes tightly shut.</p><p>Ina continued. \u201cThe doctor told her she couldn\u2019t give any more, and she said a liter wasn\u2019t enough, and he said, \u2018Yes, but you don\u2019t have more to give,\u2019 and she said, \u2018I\u2019ll make more,\u2019 and he said, \u2018No,\u2019 and she said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 and in four hours, she gave him another half-liter of blood.\u201d</p><p>Alexander lay on his stomach and listened intently while Ina wrapped fresh gauze on his wound. He was barely breathing.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor told her, \u2018Tania, you\u2019re wasting your time. Look at his burn. It\u2019s going to get infected.\u2019 There wasn\u2019t enough penicillin to give to you, especially since your blood count was so low.\u201d Alexander heard Ina chuckle in disbelief. \u201cSo I\u2019m making my rounds late that night, and who do I find next to your bed? Tatiana. She\u2019s sitting with a syringe in her arm, hooked up to a catheter, and I watch her, and I swear to God, you won\u2019t believe it when I tell you, Major, but I see that the catheter is attached to the entry drip in your IV.\u201d Ina\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cI watch her draining blood from the radial artery in her arm into your IV. I ran in and said, \u2018Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind? You\u2019re siphoning blood from yourself into him?\u2019 She said to me in her calm, I-won\u2019t-stand-for-any-argument voice, \u2018Ina, if I don\u2019t, he will die.\u2019 I yelled at her. I said, \u2018There are thirty soldiers in the critical wing who need sutures and bandages and their wounds cleaned. Why don\u2019t you take care of them and let God take care of the dead?\u2019 And she said, \u2018He\u2019s not dead. He is still alive, and while he is alive, he is mine.\u2019 Can you believe it, Major? But that\u2019s what she said. \u2018Oh, for God\u2019s sake,\u2019 I said to her. \u2018Fine, die yourself. I don\u2019t care.\u2019 But the next morning I went to complain to Dr. Sayers that she wasn\u2019t following procedure, told him what she had done, and he ran to yell at her.\u201d Ina lowered her voice to a sibilant, incredulous whisper. \u201cWe found her unconscious on the floor by your bed. She was in a dead faint, but you had taken a turn for the better. All your vital signs were up. And Tatiana got up from the floor, white as death itself, and said to the doctor coldly, \u2018Maybe now you can give him the penicillin he needs?\u2019 I could see the doctor was stunned. But he did. Gave you penicillin and more plasma and extra morphine. Then he operated on you, to get bits of the shell fragment out of you, and saved your kidney. And stitched you. And all that time she never left his side, or yours. He told her your bandages needed to be changed every three hours to help with drainage, to prevent infection. We had only two nurses in the terminal wing, me and her. I had to take care of all the other patients, while all she did was take care of you. For fifteen days and nights she unwrapped you and cleaned you and changed your dressings. Every three hours. She was a ghost by the end. But you made it. That\u2019s when we moved you to critical care. I said to her, \u2018Tania, this man ought to marry you for what you did for him,\u2019 and she said, \u2018You think so?\u2019 \u201d Ina tutted again. Paused. \u201cAre you all right, Major? Why are you crying?\u201d</p><p>That afternoon, when Tatiana came to feed him, Alexander took her hand and for a long time couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, darling?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat hurts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy heart,\u201d he answered.</p><p>She leaned from her chair to him. \u201cShura, honey, let me feed you. I need to feed ten other very sick people after you. One of them doesn\u2019t have a tongue. Imagine the difficulty there. I\u2019ll come back tonight if I can. Ina knows me. She thinks I\u2019ve taken a shine to you.\u201d Tatiana smiled. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>Alexander still couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Later that night Tatiana came back. The lights were out, and everyone was asleep; she sat by Alexander\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cTatia . . .\u201d</p><p>Quietly she said, \u201cIna\u2019s got a big mouth. I told her not to upset my patient. I didn\u2019t want you to worry. She couldn\u2019t help herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, what do you think? You think I was going to let you die when I knew we were meant to get out of here? I couldn\u2019t get that close and then lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cHusband,\u201d she said, \u201cdid you forget Luga? God, did you forget Leningrad? Our Lazarevo? I haven\u2019t. My life belongs to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>6</p><p>Alexander woke up and found Tatiana sitting in the chair. She was sleeping, leaning forward on his bed by his side, her blonde head covered with a white nurse\u2019s kerchief. It was quiet and dark in the large room, and cold. He pulled the kerchief off her and touched the wispy strands of hair falling on her eyes, touched her eyebrows, traced his fingers around her freckles, her little nose, her soft lips. She woke up. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said, lifting her hand to pat him. \u201cI\u2019d better go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania . . .\u201d he whispered, \u201cwhen am I going to be whole again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d she said soothingly, \u201cyou don\u2019t feel whole?\u201d She bent over him, cradling him. \u201cHug me, Shura,\u201d she said. \u201cHug me tight.\u201d She paused, and added in a whisper, \u201cLike I love . . .\u201d</p> <p>Alexander put his arms around her. Tatiana\u2019s arms went around his neck as she tenderly kissed his face, her hair brushing against him. \u201cTell me a memory,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cMmm, what kind of memory are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d</p><p>She continued to kiss his face lightly as her breathy voice whispered, \u201cI remember one rainy night running home from Naira\u2019s and putting our blankets in front of the fire, and you making the most tender love to me, telling me you would stop only when I begged you to stop.\u201d Tatiana smiled, her lips on his cheek. \u201cAnd did I beg you to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cYou are not for the weak, Tatiasha.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNor you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd afterward, you fell asleep right on top of me. I was awake a long time holding your sleeping body. I didn\u2019t even move you, I fell asleep, too, and in the morning you were still on top of me. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, closing his eyes. \u201cI remember.\u201d I remember everything. Every word, every breath, every smile you took, every kiss you laid upon my body, every game we played, every Bronze Horseman cabbage pie you cooked for me. I remember it all.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me a memory,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut quietly. That blind man across the ward is going to have a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Alexander pulled the hair away from her face and smiled. \u201cI remember Axinya standing by the door of the banya while we were alone and inside and so hot and soapy, and I kept saying to you, shh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Tatiana whispered breathlessly, glancing over at the sleeping man across the ward.</p><p>Alexander felt her trying to pull herself away. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, holding her to him and looking around the dark ward. \u201cI need something.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled into his face. \u201cYes? Like what?\u201d Alexander knew she knew the look in his eyes. \u201cYou must be healing, soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaster than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Bringing her face flush to his, she whispered, \u201cOh, I can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Alexander began to unbutton the top of her nurse\u2019s uniform.</p><p>Tatiana backed away. \u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, don\u2019t? Tatia, open your uniform. I need to touch your breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Shura,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone will wake up, see us. Then we\u2019ll all get in trouble. Somebody will definitely see. Maybe as a nurse I can get away with holding your hand, but I think this would be frowned upon. I think maybe even Dr. Sayers wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Not letting go of her hand, Alexander said, \u201cI need my mouth on you. I want to feel your breasts against my face, just for a second. Come on, Tatiasha, open the top of your uniform, lean over as if you\u2019re adjusting my pillow, and let me feel your breasts on my face.\u201d</p> <p>Sighing and obviously uncomfortable, she undid her uniform. Alexander wanted to feel her so much that he didn\u2019t care about propriety. Everyone is sleeping, he thought, watching her hungrily as she opened the uniform to her waist, stood very close to him, and lifted her undershirt.</p><p>Alexander gasped so loudly when he saw her breasts that she reeled back and quickly pulled her shirt down. Her breasts had grown to twice their previous size; they were swollen and milky white. \u201cTatiana,\u201d he groaned, and before she could back away farther, he grabbed her arm and brought her close to him.</p><p>\u201cShura, stop, let go,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d Alexander repeated. \u201cOh, no, Tania . . .\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t fighting his hand anymore. Bending over, she kissed him. \u201cCome on, let go,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Alexander did not let go. \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Alexander. I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Speechlessly he stared at her shining face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are we going to do?\u201d he asked finally.</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d she said, kissing him, \u201care going to have a baby! In America. So hurry up and get well, so we can get out of here.\u201d</p><p>At a loss for better words, Alexander found a way to ask, \u201cHow long have you known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince December.\u201d</p><p>He was clammy. \u201cYou\u2019ve known since before you came to the front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went out on the ice, knowing you were pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me your blood, knowing you were pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned his head to the isolation tent, away from the wall, from the chair she was next to, and away from her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t tell you. I know you \u2014 you\u2019d be worried frantic about me, especially because you\u2019re still not well yourself. You feel like you can\u2019t protect me. But I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m better than fine. And it\u2019s still early. The baby is not due till August.\u201d</p><p>Alexander put his arm over his eyes. He couldn\u2019t look at her. He heard her whisper, \u201cYou want to see my breasts again?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll sleep now. Come and see me tomorrow.\u201d He felt her kiss his forearm. After she left, Alexander was awake until morning.</p><p>How could Tania not understand the terrors that haunted him, the fear that clutched his heart when he imagined trying to get through NKVD border troops and hostile Finland with a pregnant wife? Where was her sense, her good judgment?</p><p>What am I even thinking? This is the girl who blithely walked 150 kilometers through Manstein\u2019s Group Army Nord to bring me money so I could run and leave her. She has no sense at all.</p><p>I am not getting my wife and baby out of Russia on foot, Alexander said to himself. His thoughts turned to the Fifth Soviet communal apartment, to the filth, to the stench, to the air-raid sirens every morning and night, to the cold. He remembered seeing a young mother last year, sitting in the snow, frozen, holding her frozen infant on her lap, and he trembled. What was worse to him as a man, remaining in the Soviet Union or risking Tatiana\u2019s life to get her home?</p><p>A soldier, a decorated officer in the largest army in the world, Alexander felt unmanned by his impossible choices.</p><p>The next morning when Tatiana came to feed him breakfast, Alexander said quietly, \u201cI hope you know, I hope you understand that I\u2019m not going anywhere with you pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Shura, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to tell you. I know how you get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I get, Tatiana?\u201d he said hotly. \u201cTell me, how do I get? I can\u2019t get out of bed. How am I supposed to get? Lying here powerless, while my wife\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not powerless!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cEverything you are, you still remain, even wounded. So don\u2019t give me that. This is all temporary. You are permanent. So courage, soldier. Look what I found for you \u2014 eggs. I have an assurance from Dr. Sayers these are real eggs and not dehydrated. You tell me.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shuddered as he thought of going from Helsinki to Stockholm in trucks on ice for 500 kilometers under German fire. He wouldn\u2019t even look at the eggs she was holding out for him.</p><p>He heard her sigh. \u201cWhy is this the nature of your beast?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy do you always get like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this,\u201d she said, giving him the fork for the eggs. \u201cEat, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alexander threw the fork on the metal tray. \u201cTania, have an abortion,\u201d he said adamantly. \u201cHave Dr. Sayers take care of it. We\u2019ll have other babies. We\u2019ll have many, many babies, I promise. All we\u2019ll do is have babies, we\u2019ll be like Catholics, all right, but we can\u2019t do what we\u2019re planning with you pregnant, we just can\u2019t. I can\u2019t,\u201d he added. He took hold of her hand, but she yanked it away and stood up.</p><p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not. Girls have them all the time.\u201d He paused. \u201cDasha had three.\u201d Alexander saw by Tatiana\u2019s face that she was horrified.</p><p>\u201cWith you?\u201d she asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tatia,\u201d he said tiredly, rubbing his eyes. \u201cNot with me.\u201d</p><p>With a breath of relief but still white, Tatiana whispered, \u201cBut I thought abortion has been illegal since 1938?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d Alexander exclaimed. \u201cWhy are you so na?ve?\u201d</p><p>Her hands shook as she fought for control, and through her closed teeth she said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Yes. Well, perhaps, I could have had three illegal abortions myself before I met you. Perhaps that would have made me more attractive and less na?ve in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Alexander\u2019s heart squeezed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d He paused. She was too far away and too upset for him to take her hand. \u201cI thought Dasha might have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d Tatiana said in a low, agonized voice. \u201cShe never talked to me about those things. And yes, my family protected me as best they could. Still, we lived in close quarters in a communal apartment. I knew that my mother had half a dozen abortions in the mid-thirties, I knew that Nina Iglenko had eight, but that\u2019s not even what I\u2019m talking about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? What\u2019s the problem? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing how I feel about you \u2014 do you think it\u2019s something I could ever do?\u201d</p><p>Tightening his lips, Alexander said, \u201cNo, of course not. Why would you?\u201d He raised his voice. \u201cWhy would you ever do anything that would give me peace of mind!\u201d</p><p>Leaning over him, Tatiana whispered angrily, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Your peace of mind or your baby. The choice is tough.\u201d She threw the plate of eggs down on the metal tray and walked away without another word.</p><p>When she did not return all day, Alexander concluded that having Tatiana be angry with him was more than he could endure \u2014 for a minute, let alone for the sixteen hours it took her to come back. He asked Ina and Dr. Sayers to bring her to him, but apparently she was very busy and could not come. Very late that night she finally returned, bringing with her a piece of white bread with butter. \u201cYou\u2019re upset with me,\u201d Alexander said, taking the bread out of her hands.</p><p>\u201cNot upset,\u201d she said. \u201cDisappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s even worse.\u201d Alexander shook his head in resignation. \u201cTania, look at me.\u201d Tatiana raised her eyes to him, and there, around the edges of her ocean current irises, he saw her love for him flow out. \u201cWe will do exactly as you want,\u201d Alexander said, sighing heavily. \u201cLike always.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Tatiana sat on the edge of his bed and took a cigarette from her pocket. \u201cLook what I brought you. Want a quick smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tania,\u201d said Alexander, reaching for her, bringing her to him. \u201cI want to feel your breasts on my face.\u201d He kissed her, undoing her uniform.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to recoil in terror, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come here. Bend over me.\u201d</p><p>It was dark in the ward, and everyone else was sleeping. Tatiana pulled up her shirt. Alexander lost his breath. She bent over and pressed herself into him. Keeping his eyes open, he cupped her full warm breasts, nesting his face in between them. He inhaled deeply and kissed the white skin in front of her heart. \u201cOh, Tatiasha . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, soldier.\u201d She lightly rubbed her breasts back and forth across his mouth, his nose, his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ll have to shave you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re very stubbly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are very soft,\u201d he muttered, his mouth closing around her enlarged nipple. Alexander could tell that Tatiana tried very hard not to moan. Once she moaned, she backed away, pulling her shirt down. \u201cShura, no, don\u2019t excite me. Every one of those men will wake up, I guarantee it. They can smell desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I,\u201d Alexander said thickly.</p><p>All buttoned up and more composed, Tatiana hugged him. \u201cShura,\u201d she whispered, \u201cdon\u2019t you see? Our baby is a sign from God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said, her face sparkling.</p><p>Suddenly Alexander understood. \u201cThat\u2019s the radiance,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re like a flame walking through this hospital. It\u2019s the baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what is meant for us. Think about Lazarevo \u2014 how many times did we make love in those twenty-nine days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He smiled. \u201cHow many? How many zeros follow the twenty-nine?\u201d</p><p>She laughed quietly. \u201cTwo or three. We made love to wake the dead, and yet I didn\u2019t get pregnant. You come to see me for one weekend, and here I am \u2014 how do you say, up the stick?\u201d</p><p>Alexander laughed loudly. \u201cThank you for that. But, Tania, I want to remind you, we did make love quite a bit that weekend, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other for a silent, unsmiling moment. Alexander knew. They had both felt too close to death that gray weekend in Leningrad. And, yet, here it was\u2014</p><p>As if to confirm what he was thinking, Tatiana said, \u201cThis is God telling us to go. Can\u2019t you feel that, too? He is saying, this is your destiny! I will not let anything happen to Tatiana, as long as she has Alexander\u2019s baby inside her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d said Alexander, his hands tenderly stroking her stomach. \u201cGod is saying that, is He? Why don\u2019t you tell that to the woman in the Ladoga truck with you and Dasha, holding her dead baby all the way from the barracks across to Kobona?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel stronger now than ever,\u201d Tatiana said, hugging him. \u201cWhere is your famous faith, big man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, have you talked to Dr. Sayers?\u201d Alexander was caressing her hands under his blanket, kneading her fingers, feeling her knuckles, her wrists, her palms.</p><p>\u201cOf course. All I do is talk to him, go over all the details. We\u2019re waiting for you to walk. Everything is set. He\u2019s already filled out my new Red Cross travel documents.\u201d She purred, leaning closer to him. \u201cThat feels so nice, Shura. I\u2019m going to fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep. Under what name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane Barrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice. Jane Barrington and Tobe Hanssen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother and a Finn. Some couple we make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we?\u201d She half-closed her eyes. \u201cThat feels very nice, Shura,\u201d she murmured. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop,\u201d he whispered huskily, gazing at her. That made her open her eyes.</p><p>A moment. They stared at each other. Remembering. Blink.</p><p>Tatiana smiled. \u201cIn America can I please carry your name?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIn America I will insist on it.\u201d Alexander was thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have passports,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo? You\u2019ll go to the U.S. consulate in Stockholm. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We still have to get from Helsinki to Stockholm. We can\u2019t stay in Helsinki for a second. It\u2019s too dangerous. Crossing the Baltic Sea. It\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana grinned. \u201cWhat were you going to do with your limping demon? Same thing with me.\u201d She paused. \u201cEugene calls to the wherryman \u2014 and he, with daring unconcern is willing, to take him for a quarter-shilling, across that formidable sea.\u201d Smiling happily, she said, \u201cYour mother, you, your ten thousand dollars will get us back to your America.\u201d Both her tiny delicate hands were threaded through his.</p><p>Alexander was suffocating under the weight of his love.</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d Tatiana said, her voice tremulous, \u201cremember the day you gave me your Pushkin book? When you fed me in the Summer Garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it was yesterday.\u201d Alexander smiled. \u201cIt was the night you fell in love with me.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana blushed and cleared her throat. \u201cWere you . . . if I weren\u2019t such a shy chicken . . . would you have\u2014\u201d She broke off, looking away momentarily.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What?\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cWould I have kissed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, you were so terrified of me.\u201d Alexander shook his head at the memory, his body aching. \u201cI was completely gone for you. Kissed you? I would have ravished you right on the bench by the child-eating Saturn if you had given me half a sign.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>7</p><p>Alexander got stronger every day. He could get up and stand near his bed. It still hurt him to be upright, but he was off morphine completely, and now his back throbbed from morning until night, reminding him of his mortality. He was carving constantly. He had just carved a cradle out of another piece of wood. Soon, soon, he kept saying to himself. He wanted to be moved over into the convalescent ward, but Tatiana talked him out of it. She said his location and care were too good to give up his place in critical.</p><p>\u201cRemember,\u201d Tatiana said to him one afternoon as they were both standing by his bed, his arm around her. \u201cYou have to get better so that no one thinks you\u2019re getting better. Or before you know it, they\u2019ll send you back to the front with your stupid mortar.\u201d She smiled up at him.</p><p>Alexander removed his arm. He saw Dimitri walking toward them. \u201cCourage, Tania,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana! Alexander!\u201d Dimitri exclaimed. \u201cNo, how incredible is this? The three of us together again. If only Dasha were here.\u201d</p><p>Alexander and Tatiana said nothing. They did not look at each other.</p><p>\u201cTania, how are the terminal cases coming along? I just got you some more white sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dimitri.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sure. Alexander, here are some cigarettes for you. Don\u2019t worry about paying me. I know you probably don\u2019t have any money on you. I can get your money and bring it to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem.\u201d He stood at the foot of Alexander\u2019s bed, his eyes darting from Alexander to Tatiana. \u201cSo, Tania, what are you doing here in critical care? I thought you were in the terminal ward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. But I see my crossover patients, too. Leo in bed number thirty used to be terminal. Now he is always asking for me.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri smiled. \u201cTania, not just Leo. Everybody is asking for you.\u201d Tatiana didn\u2019t say anything. Neither did Alexander, who sat down on his bed. Dimitri continued to study them. \u201cListen, it was good to see you both. Alexander, I\u2019ll come by and visit you tomorrow, all right? Tania, you want to walk me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have to change Alexander\u2019s dressing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. It\u2019s just that Dr. Sayers was looking for you. \u2018Where is my Tania?\u2019 Dr. Sayers said.\u201d Dimitri smiled warmly. \u201cThose were his exact words. You\u2019re getting to be quite friendly with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He raised his eyebrows to her. \u201cYou know what they say about those Americans.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana did not nod, did not blink. She just turned to Alexander and said, \u201cCome on, lie down.\u201d Alexander did not move.</p><p>\u201cTania, did you hear me?\u201d Dimitri asked.</p><p>\u201cI heard you!\u201d Tatiana said, not looking at Dimitri. \u201cIf you see Dr. Sayers, you can tell him I\u2019ll be with him as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>After Dimitri left, Alexander and Tatiana looked at each other. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cThat I need to change your dressing and go. Lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she replied.</p> <p>Lying down on his stomach, Alexander said, \u201cTania, where is the rucksack with my things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy? What do you need it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was on my back when I got hit . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on your back when we got to you. It\u2019s probably lost, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . .\u201d he drew out. \u201cBut usually the rear units clean up once the battle is over. Pick up things like that. Can you ask around for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, unwrapping his bandages. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Colonel Stepanov.\u201d She paused, and Alexander heard her purr. \u201cYou know, Shura, the only thing I want to do when I see your back is play rail tracks, rail tracks.\u201d She kissed his bare shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I want to do when I see your back,\u201d he said, closing his eyes, \u201cis play rail tracks, rail tracks.\u201d</p><p>Later that night when she was sitting by him, Alexander said to her, \u201cTatiana, you have to promise me \u2014 God help me \u2014 that if something happens to me, you will still go.\u201d He held on to her when he said it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. What can happen to you?\u201d She didn\u2019t look at him when she said it.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to be brave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she said. \u201cAs soon as you\u2019re fit, we\u2019re leaving. Dr. Sayers is ready to go anytime. In fact, he is itching to go. He is a big grumbler. Keeps complaining about everything. Doesn\u2019t like the cold, doesn\u2019t like the help, doesn\u2019t like\u2014\u201d Tatiana stopped. \u201cSo what are you talking about? What can happen? I won\u2019t let you go back to the front. And I won\u2019t leave without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Of course you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Alexander took her hand. \u201cNow listen to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tatiana moved to get up from him, turning her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to listen.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t let her hand go. \u201cAlexander, please don\u2019t scare me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be so brave. Please,\u201d Tatiana said calmly, her breath shallow.</p><p>\u201cTania, many things can go wrong.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou know that there is always the danger I will be arrested.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know. But, if you\u2019re taken by Mekhlis\u2019s henchmen, I will wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for what?\u201d he exclaimed in frustration. Alexander had learned the hard way that the best he could hope for was that Tatiana would agree with him. If she had her own opinion, he didn\u2019t have an icy hope of talking her out of it.</p><p>His emotion must have shown on his face, because she took both his dark war-beaten hands into her flawless white ones, pressed them to her lips and said, \u201cWait for you.\u201d Then she tried to disentangle herself from him. He wasn\u2019t having any of it. Pulling her off the chair, he brought her to sit next to him on the bed. \u201cWait for me where?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn Leningrad. In my apartment. Inga and Stan have left. I have two rooms. I will wait. And when you come back, I will be there with your baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Soviet council will take the hallway and the room with the stove away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will wait in the room that\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>She looked over at the other sleeping patients, at the darkened windows. At anything but him. The hospital room was quiet, with no sound except for his breathing, except for hers. \u201cI will wait as long as it takes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake! You would rather be an old maid in a cold room without plumbing than make yourself a better life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no other life for me, so you can just forget it.\u201d</p><p>Alexander whispered, \u201cTania, please . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t continue. \u201cAnd what about when Mekhlis comes for you? What are you going to do then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go where they send me. I\u2019ll go to Kolyma,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll go to Taymir Peninsula. Eventually Communism will fall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Eventually there won\u2019t be any more people left to reconstruct. And then they\u2019ll let me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear sweet Jesus,\u201d Alexander whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s not just you anymore. You have to think about our baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you even talking about? Dr. Sayers is not going to take me without you. I have no right to \u2014 no claim on \u2014 America,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cAlexander, I will go anywhere in the world with you. You want to go to America? I say yes. You want to go to Australia? Yes, I say. Mongolia? The Gobi Desert? Dagestan? Lake Baikal? Germany? The cold side of hell? I say, when are we leaving? Anywhere you go \u2014 I will go with you. But if you are staying, then I\u2019m staying, too. I\u2019m not leaving my baby\u2019s father in the Soviet Union.\u201d</p><p>Leaning over an overwhelmed Alexander, Tatiana pressed her breasts into his face, kissing his head. Then she sat back and kissed his shaking fingers. \u201cWhat did you say to me in Leningrad? \u2018What kind of a life can I build,\u2019 you said, \u2018knowing I have left you to die \u2014 or to rot \u2014 in the Soviet Union?\u2019 I\u2019m quoting you back to you. Those were your words.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnd on this one point I will have to agree with you.\u201d She nodded and said softly, \u201cIf I left you, no matter which road I would take, with ponderous clatter indeed, the Bronze Horseman would pursue me all through that long night into my own maddening dust.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said with emotion, \u201cTatiana \u2014 it\u2019s war. All around us is war.\u201d He couldn\u2019t look at her. \u201cMen die in war.\u201d</p><p>A tear escaped Tatiana\u2019s eye, no matter how strong she tried to be. \u201cPlease don\u2019t die,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can bury you. I already buried everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I die,\u201d Alexander said, his voice breaking, \u201cwhen you have poured your immortal blood into me?\u201d</p><p>And then Dimitri came one cold morning, holding Alexander\u2019s rucksack in his hands. He was limping badly on his right leg. The errand boy for the generals, the worthless lackey, constantly shuffling cigarettes and vodka and books between camps and tents in the rear, the runner who refused to bear arms, Dimitri hobbled forward, handing Alexander the rucksack. \u201cOh, so it was found,\u201d Alexander said steadily. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you know it? Some stupidity at the embankment. Some guys . . . I don\u2019t know, they were pissed off. Look at my face.\u201d</p><p>Alexander saw the bruises.</p><p>\u201cI was charging too much for smokes, they said. Take it, I said, take it all. They did. Beat the shit out of me anyway.\u201d Dimitri smirked. \u201cWell, they won\u2019t be laughing for long.\u201d He came and sat in the chair under the window. \u201cTatiana did a marvelous job on me. Fixed me right up.\u201d Something in Dimitri\u2019s voice twisted Alexander\u2019s stomach. \u201cShe\u2019s marvelous, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cShe is a good nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood nurse, good woman, good\u2014\u201d Dimitri broke off.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cThanks for my ruck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure.\u201d Dimitri got up to go and then, almost as an afterthought, sat back down and said, \u201cI wanted to make sure you had all you needed in your ruck: your books, your pen and paper. As it turned out, you didn\u2019t have any pen or paper, so it was a good thing I checked, because I put some in for you. In case you wanted to write letters.\u201d He smiled pleasantly. \u201cI also added some cigarettes and a new lighter.\u201d</p><p>Holding his rucksack, Alexander, with darkening eyes, said, \u201cYou looked through my things?\u201d The twisting in his stomach intensified.</p><p>\u201cOh, just to be helpful.\u201d Dimitri again made as if to go. \u201cBut you know . . .\u201d He turned back. \u201cI found something very interesting in it.\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned his face away. Tatiana\u2019s letters he had reluctantly burned. But there was one thing he could not burn. One beacon of hope for light that he continued to carry with him. \u201cDimitri,\u201d Alexander said, throwing the rucksack by the side of his bed and crossing his arms in silent defiance, \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Picking up the rucksack, Dimitri, in a friendly, polite manner, unbuttoned the flap and pulled out Tatiana\u2019s white dress with red roses.</p><p>\u201cLook what I found at the very bottom.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cSo?\u201d His voice was calm.</p><p>\u201cSo? Well, you\u2019re so right. Why shouldn\u2019t you be carrying around a dress owned by your dead fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the surprise to you, Dimitri? That you found the dress? Can\u2019t be that much of a surprise, can it?\u201d Alexander said acidly. \u201cYou were going through my personal belongings looking for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes and no,\u201d Dimitri said jovially. \u201cI was a little surprised, I admit. A little taken aback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaken aback? By what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought, this is so interesting. A whole dress, and there is Tatiana here at the front, working side by side with a Red Cross doctor, and there is Alexander in the same hospital. I suspected it was not a coincidence. I always thought you had feelings for each other.\u201d He glanced at Alexander. \u201cAlways, you know. From the beginning. So then I went to Colonel Stepanov, who remembered me from the old days and was very warm to me. I really like that man. I told him that I would be glad to bring you your pay so you could buy tobacco and papers and extra butter and some vodka, and he sent me to the CO adjutant, who gave me five hundred rubles, and when I expressed surprise that all you were getting was five hundred rubles being a major and all, do you know what the adjutant told me?\u201d</p><p>With a grinding of his teeth to lessen the throbbing in his temples, Alexander said slowly, \u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you were sending the rest of your money to a Tatiana Metanova on Fifth Soviet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, why not? So I went back to Colonel Stepanov and said, \u2018Colonel, isn\u2019t it fantastic that our wanton Alexander has finally found himself a nice girl, like our Nurse Metanova,\u2019 and the colonel said he had been surprised himself that you got married in Molotov on your summer furlough and told no one.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d exclaimed Dimitri in a frank and cheerful manner. \u201cI said that was quite surprising because I was your best friend, and even I didn\u2019t know, and the colonel agreed that you were indeed a very secretive fellow, and I said, \u2018Oh, you have no idea, sir.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Alexander looked away from Dimitri, sitting in the chair, and looked at the other soldiers lying on the beds. He wondered if he could get up. Could he get up? Walk around? What could he do?</p><p>Dimitri got up. \u201cListen, it\u2019s great! I just wanted to say congratulations. I\u2019m going to go find Tania now and congratulate her.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana came to Alexander later that afternoon. After she fed him, she went to get a pail of warm water and some soap. \u201cTania, don\u2019t carry that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too heavy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m carrying your baby. You think a backet is too heavy for me?\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak much. Tatiana washed Alexander and shaved him with a razor and then dried his face. He kept his eyes closed so she wouldn\u2019t see through him. Every once in a while Alexander smelled her warm breath on him, and every once in a while her lips touched his eyebrows or his fingers. He felt her stroking his face and heard her sigh.</p><p>\u201cShura,\u201d she said heavily, \u201cI saw Dimitri today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was not a question.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She paused. \u201cHe was . . . he told me you told him we got married. He said he was happy for us . . .\u201d She sighed. \u201cI guess it was inevitable he was going to find out sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Tatiana,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cWe did as well as we could hiding ourselves from Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I may be wrong, but he didn\u2019t seem to have as much of his usual nervous tension. As if he really didn\u2019t care about you and me anymore. What do you think?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>You think maybe this war has made him into a human being? Alexander wanted to ask her. You think this war is a school for humanity, and Dimitri is now ready to graduate with honors? But then Alexander opened his eyes and saw Tatiana\u2019s frightened expression. \u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t think he cares about you and me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana cleared her throat and touched Alexander\u2019s clean-shaven face. Leaning closer to him, she whispered, \u201cDo you suppose you can get up soon? I don\u2019t want to rush you. I saw you yesterday trying to get around. It\u2019s painful for you to stand? Your back hurts? It\u2019s healing, Shura. You\u2019re doing great. As soon as you\u2019re ready, we\u2019ll go. And we\u2019ll never have to see him again.\u201d</p><p>Alexander looked at her for interminable minutes.</p><p>Before he opened his mouth, Tatiana said, \u201cShura, don\u2019t worry. My eyes are open. I see Dimitri for what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Because like all of us, he, too, is the sum of his parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cannot be redeemed, Tania. Not even by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d She tried to smile.</p><p>Alexander squeezed her hand. \u201cHe is exactly what he wants to be. How can he be redeemed when he has constructed his life on what he believes is the only way to live it? Not your way, not my way, his way. He has built himself on lies and deceit, on manipulation and malice, on contempt for me and disrespect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has found himself a dark corner of the universe and wants us all there with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe very careful with him, all right? And tell him nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would it take for you, Tatiana, to reject him, to turn your back on him? To say, I cannot take his hand because he does not want salvation. What?\u201d</p><p>Her thoughts trickled out from her eyes. \u201cOh, he\u2019ll want salvation, Shura. He\u2019ll just have no hope of it.\u201d</p><p>Walking with the help of a cane, Dimitri came to see Alexander the next day. This is becoming my life, Alexander thought. There is fighting across the river, there is healing in the next room, the generals are making plans, the trains are bringing food into Leningrad, the Germans are slaughtering us from Sinyavino Heights, Dr. Sayers is getting ready to leave the Soviet Union, Tatiana sits with the terminal soldiers, growing life inside her, and I lie here in my crib and get my bedding changed and watch the world rush by me. Watch my minutes rush by me. Alexander was so fed up that he pulled back his covers and got out of bed. He stood up and began unhooking his IV bag when Ina ran up and laid him back down, muttering that he\u2019d better never try that again. \u201cOr I\u2019ll tell Tatiana,\u201d she whispered, leaving Alexander alone with Dimitri, who sank down in the chair.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, I need to talk to you. Are you strong enough to listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dimitri, I\u2019m strong enough to listen,\u201d said Alexander, with a supreme effort turning his head in Dimitri\u2019s direction. He could not meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cListen, I really am sincerely happy that you and Tania got married. I\u2019m past bad feeling. Honestly. But, Alexander, as you know, there is one thing that\u2019s left unfinished with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander replied.</p><p>\u201cTania, she\u2019s very good, she keeps her composure well. I think I\u2019ve underestimated her. She is less of a pushover than I first thought.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri had no idea.</p><p>\u201cI know you two are planning something. I know it. I feel it in my heart. I tried to get her to talk to me. She kept saying she didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. But I know!\u201d Dimitri sounded excited. \u201cI know you, Alexander Barrington, and so I\u2019m asking you if perhaps there is room for little old me in your plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Alexander steadfastly, thinking, there was once a time I had no one else to trust but this man. I put my life in this man\u2019s hands. \u201cDimitri, I have no plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Yes. But you see, I understand so many things now,\u201d Dimitri said with an unctuous smile. \u201cTatiana is the reason you\u2019ve been dragging your feet on running.\u201d He paused. \u201cWanted to work out a way to run with her? Or didn\u2019t want to desert and leave her behind? Either way I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cBut now I say we all must go together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cBut if something changes, I will let you know.\u201d</p><p>An hour later Dimitri limped back, but this time with Tatiana. He sat her down in the chair while he hunkered down close to them on his haunches. \u201cTania, I need you to talk some sense into your wounded husband,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cExplain to him that all I want is for you two to get me out of the Soviet Union. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted. To get out of the Soviet Union. I\u2019m getting very jittery, very nervous, you see, because I can\u2019t take the chance that you two will run off and leave me here. In the middle of war. You understand?\u201d</p><p>Alexander and Tatiana said nothing.</p><p>Alexander looked at his blanket. Tatiana stared straight at Dimitri. And it was when he saw Tania looking unflinchingly at Dimitri that Alexander felt stronger and stared at Dimitri, too.</p><p>\u201cTania, I\u2019m on your side,\u201d Dimitri said, \u201cI don\u2019t want any harm to come either to you or to Alexander. Just the opposite.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI wish you the best of luck. It\u2019s so hard for two people to find happiness. I know. I\u2019ve tried. That you two somehow managed \u2014 I don\u2019t know how \u2014 is a miracle. Now all I want is a chance for myself. I just want you to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-preservation,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cas an inalienable right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d said Dimitri.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Alexander.</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cDimitri, I really don\u2019t know what this has to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, everything, dearest Tanechka, why, it\u2019s got everything in the world to do with you. Unless, of course, it\u2019s the smooth, healthy American doctor you\u2019re planning to run away with and not your injured husband. You\u2019ve been making plans to go with Sayers when he returns to Helsinki, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for these games,\u201d Dimitri snapped coldly, rising to his feet and leaning on his cane. \u201cTania, I\u2019m talking to you. Either you take me with you or I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to keep Alexander here in the Soviet Union with me.\u201d</p><p>Her hand still in Alexander\u2019s, Tatiana sat stoically in her chair and then looked at Alexander and raised her shoulders to form a faint question.</p><p>Alexander squeezed her hand so hard that she emitted a tiny cry.</p><p>\u201cThere, there,\u201d exclaimed Dimitri. \u201cThat\u2019s the moment I want to see. She convinces you, miraculously seeing everything. Tatiana, how do you do that? How do you have such an uncanny ability to see everything? Your husband, who\u2019s got less of that ability, struggles against you but in the end gives in because he knows it\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>Alexander and Tatiana didn\u2019t say a word. He relaxed his hold on her hand, which remained nested in his.</p><p>Dimitri folded his arms and waited. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving here until I hear an answer. Tania, what do you say? Alexander has been my friend for six years. I care for both of you. I don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d Dimitri rolled his eyes. \u201cBelieve me \u2014 I hate trouble. All I want is to have a small portion of what you are planning for yourselves. That\u2019s not too much to ask, is it? I want a tiny piece of it. Don\u2019t you feel you\u2019ll be selfish, Tania, if you don\u2019t allow me a chance for a new life, too? Come on, now \u2014 you, who gave away your oatmeal to a starving Nina Iglenko last year, surely you aren\u2019t going to deny me so little when\u201d \u2014 and here he looked at her and Alexander \u2014 \u201cyou have so much?\u201d</p><p>Pain and anger tripping over each other in their race to his already embattled heart, Alexander said, \u201cTania, don\u2019t listen to him. Dimitri, leave her alone. This is between us. This has nothing to do with her.\u201d Dimitri was quiet. Tatiana was quiet, her fingers rubbing the inside of Alexander\u2019s palm, thoughtfully, intently, rhythmically. She opened her mouth to speak. \u201cDon\u2019t say a word, Tatiana,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cSay the word, Tatiana,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you. But please, let me hear your answer. Because I don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><p>Alexander watched Tatiana rise to her feet. \u201cDimitri,\u201d Tatiana said without blinking, \u201cwoe to him who is alone when he falls, for he has not another to pick him up.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri shrugged. \u201cBy that I take it to mean that you\u2014\u201d He broke off. \u201cWhat? What are you saying? Is that a yes or a no?\u201d</p><p>Her hand holding Alexander\u2019s tightly, Tatiana said, barely audible, \u201cMy husband made you a promise. And he always keeps his word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Dimitri exclaimed, springing to her. Alexander watched Tatiana pull sharply away.</p><p>Tatiana spoke softly. \u201cEvery kindness is repaid by good people,\u201d she said. \u201cDimitri, I will tell you of our plans later. But you need to be ready at a moment\u2019s notice. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready this moment,\u201d Dimitri said with excitement. \u201cAnd I mean that. I want to leave as soon as possible.\u201d He extended his left hand to Alexander, who turned his face away, still holding on to Tatiana. He had no intention of shaking hands with Dimitri.</p><p>It was a pale Tatiana who brought their hands together. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said, her voice quavering slightly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri left.</p><p>\u201cShura, what could we do?\u201d Tatiana said while feeding him. \u201cIt will have to work. It changes things a little bit. But not much. We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned his gaze to her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe wants to survive more than anything else. You told me so yourself.\u201d</p><p>But what did you tell me, Tatiana? thought Alexander. What did you tell me up on the roof of St. Isaac\u2019s under the black Leningrad sky?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take him. He\u2019ll leave us alone. You\u2019ll see. Just please get better soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Tania,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cTell Dr. Sayers that whenever he\u2019s ready to leave, I\u2019ll make myself ready.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana left.</p><p>A day passed.</p><p>Dimitri returned.</p><p>He sat down in the chair next to Alexander, who did not look his way. He was staring into the middle distance, into the long distance, into the short distance of his brown wool blanket, trying to recall the last name of the Moscow residence hotel he had lived in with his mother and father. The hotel kept regularly changing names. It had been a source of confusion and hilarity for Alexander, who was now deliberately focusing his mind away from Tatiana and away from the person sitting in the chair not a meter away from him. Oh, no, thought Alexander, with a stab of pain.</p><p>He remembered the last name of the hotel.</p><p>It was Kirov.</p><p>Dimitri cleared his throat. Alexander waited.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, can we talk? This is very important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all important,\u201d stated Alexander. \u201cAll I do is talk. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d Alexander stared at his IV. How long would it take him to disconnect it? Would he bleed? He looked around the ward. It was just after lunch, and the other wounded were either sleeping or reading. The shift nurse was sitting by the door reading herself. Alexander wondered where Tatiana was. He didn\u2019t need the IV. Tatiana kept it on him to force him to remain in the critical ward, to keep his bed. No. Don\u2019t think about Tatiana. Pulling himself up, Alexander sat upright against the wall.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, I know how you feel about her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I doubt it. What about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is sick.\u201d</p><p>Alexander said nothing.</p><p>\u201cYes. Sick. You don\u2019t know what I know. You don\u2019t see what I see. She is a ghost walking around this hospital. She is fainting constantly. The other day she lay in a faint in the snow for I don\u2019t know how long. A lieutenant had to get her up. We brought her to Dr. Sayers. She put on a brave face\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know she was in the snow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the story. I hear everything. Also I see her in the terminal ward. She holds on to the wall when she walks. She told Dr. Sayers she was not getting enough food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSayers told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Dr. Sayers are getting to be good friends, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just bring him bandages, iodine, medical supplies from across the lake. He never seems to have enough. We talk for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know she was not feeling well?\u201d</p><p>Alexander was thoughtfully grim. He knew why Tatiana was not getting enough food, and he knew why she was fainting. But the last thing he was going to do was trust Dimitri with anything about Tatiana. Alexander kept customarily quiet for a moment and then said, \u201cDimitri, do you have a point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have a point.\u201d Dimitri lowered his voice and pulled the chair closer to the bed. \u201cWhat we\u2019re planning . . . it\u2019s dangerous. It requires physical strength, courage, fortitude.\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned his head to Dimitri. \u201cYes?\u201d he said, surprised that words like \u201cfortitude\u201d could have come from Dimitri\u2019s mouth. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think Tatiana will manage through it all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander! Listen to me for a second. Wait, before you say more. Listen. She is weak, and we have a very hard road ahead of us. Even with Sayers\u2019s help. Do you know there are six checkpoints between here and Lisiy Nos? Six. One syllable out of her at any of them and we\u2019re all dead. Alexander . . .\u201d Dimitri paused. \u201cShe can\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>Keeping his voice low \u2014 it was the only way he could keep it \u2014 Alexander said, \u201cI am not having this ludicrous conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being so obstinate. You know I am right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know no such thing!\u201d Alexander exclaimed, his fists clenching. \u201cI know that without her\u2014\u201d He broke off. What was he doing? Was he trying to convince Dimitri? To keep from shouting required an effort out of Alexander he just wasn\u2019t prepared to make. \u201cI\u2019m growing tired,\u201d he said loudly. \u201cWe\u2019ll finish this another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no other time!\u201d Dimitri hissed. \u201cKeep your voice down. We\u2019re supposed to be going in forty-eight hours. And I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t want to hang because you can\u2019t see clear through the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrystal clear, Dimitri,\u201d snapped Alexander. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. And she will come with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe collapses here after a six-hour day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix-hour? Where have you been? She is here twenty-four hours a day. She doesn\u2019t sit in a truck, she doesn\u2019t sit and have cigarettes and vodka on her job. She sleeps on cardboard, and she eats what the soldiers don\u2019t finish, and she washes her face in the snow. Don\u2019t tell me about her day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if there is a border incident? What if, despite all of Sayers\u2019s efforts, we\u2019re stopped, interrogated? You and I will have to use our weapons. We\u2019ll have to stand and fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do what we have to.\u201d Alexander glared at Dimitri\u2019s cane, at his bruised face, at his hunched body.</p><p>\u201cYes, but what will she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll do what she has to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is going to faint! She is going to collapse in the snow, and you won\u2019t know whether to kill the border troops or help her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t run, she can\u2019t shoot, she can\u2019t fight. She\u2019ll swoon at the first sign of trouble, and believe me, there is always trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you run, Dimitri?\u201d Alexander asked, unable to keep the hate out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cYes! I\u2019m still a soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the doctor? He can\u2019t fight either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man! And frankly, I\u2019m less worried about him either way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about Tatiana? That\u2019s good to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about what she will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that is a fine difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried that you will be so busy fretting about her, you will screw up, make stupid mistakes. She will slow you down, make you think twice about taking the kind of chances we might need to take. The Lisiy Nos forest checkpoint is poorly defended, not undefended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are right. We might have to fight for our freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, listen to me. This is our last chance. I know it. This is a perfect plan; it could work so well. But she will lead us to ruin. She is not up to it. Don\u2019t be stupid now when we are so close. This is it.\u201d Dimitri smiled. \u201cThis is what we\u2019ve been waiting for! There are no more trial runs, there are no more tomorrows, no more next times. This is it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cThis is it.\u201d Closing his eyes briefly, he fought an impulse to keep them closed.</p><p>\u201cSo listen to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will listen!\u201d exclaimed Dimitri. \u201cYou and I have been planning this a long time. Here is our chance! And I\u2019m not saying leave Tania in the Soviet Union for good. Not at all. I\u2019m saying let us, two men, do what we have to do to get out. Get out safely and, most importantly, alive! You\u2019re no good to her dead, and I\u2019m not going to enjoy America if I\u2019m dead myself. Alive, Alexander. Plus, to hide in the swamps\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re driving to Helsinki in a truck. What swamps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we need to, I said. Three men and a frail girl, we\u2019re a crowd. We\u2019re not hiding out. We\u2019re asking to be caught. If something were to happen to Sayers, if Sayers were to get killed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Sayers get killed? He\u2019s a Red Cross doctor.\u201d Alexander studied Dimitri intensely.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But if we had to make it by ourselves across the Baltic \u2014 on ice, on foot, hiding out in convoy trucks \u2014 well, two men can do it, but three people? We will be too easily noticed. Too easily stopped. And she won\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made it through the blockade. She made it through the Volga ice. She made it through Dasha. She will make it,\u201d said Alexander, but his heart was burning with uncertainty. The dangers Dimitri was pointing out were so close to Alexander\u2019s own anxieties for Tatiana, it was brutalizing his stomach. \u201cAll the things you say may be true,\u201d he continued with great effort, \u201cbut you\u2019re forgetting two very important things. What do you think will happen to her here once I\u2019m reported missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo her? Nothing. Her name is still Tatiana Metanova.\u201d Dimitri nodded slyly. \u201cYou have been very careful to keep your marriage hidden. That\u2019ll help you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t help her.\u201d Alexander stopped.</p><p>\u201cNo one will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI will know.\u201d He gritted his teeth to keep the groan of pain from escaping his throat.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you\u2019ll be in America. You\u2019ll be back home.\u201d</p><p>Alexander spoke in a flat voice. \u201cShe cannot remain behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can. She\u2019ll be fine. Alexander, she\u2019s never known anything but this life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have you!\u201d</p><p>Dimitri went on. \u201cShe\u2019ll continue here as if she\u2019d never met you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri laughed. \u201cI know you think a lot of yourself, but she will get over you. Others have. I know she probably cares for you very much \u2014 but with time she\u2019ll meet someone else, and she\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being an idiot!\u201d Alexander said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be arrested in three days. The wife of a deserter. Three days. And you know it. Stop talking horseshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will know who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found out!\u201d</p><p>Ignoring Alexander, Dimitri continued calmly, \u201cTatiana Metanova will go back to Grechesky Hospital and will go on with her life in Leningrad. And if you still want her when you\u2019re settled in America, after the war is over, you can send her a formal letter of invitation, asking her to come to Boston to visit a sick and dying distant aunt. She will come by proper methods, if she can, by train, by ship. Think of this as a temporary separation, until there is a better time for her. For all of us.\u201d</p><p>Alexander rubbed the bridge of his nose with his left hand. Somebody come and rescue me from this hell, he thought. The short hairs on his neck stood on end. He breathed more erratically. \u201cDimitri!\u201d said Alexander, staring straight at him. \u201cYou have a chance, for the second time in your life, to do something decent \u2014 take it. The first time was when you helped me to see my father. What do you care if she comes with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to think of myself, Alexander. I cannot spend all my time thinking about protecting your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time have you spent thinking about that?\u201d Alexander exclaimed. \u201cYou have always thought only of yourself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike, say, you?\u201d Dimitri laughed.</p><p>\u201cUnlike anyone else. Come with us. She extended her hand to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It doesn\u2019t make her hand any less extended. Take it. She will get us out. We will all be free. You will have the one thing you care about the most \u2014 your free life away from war. You do care about that the most, don\u2019t you?\u201d Tania\u2019s St. Isaac\u2019s words swam by Alexander. He covets from you most what you want most. But Alexander would not be defeated. He will never take it all from you, Alexander, his Tatiana had said to him. He will never have that much power. \u201cYou will have your free life \u2014 because of her. We will not perish \u2014 because of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all be killed \u2014 because of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guarantee \u2014 you will not perish. Take this chance, have your life. I\u2019m not denying you what is rightfully yours. I said I would get you out, and I will. Tania is very strong, and she will not let us down. You\u2019ll see. She will not falter; she will not fail. You have nothing to do but say yes. She and I will do the rest. You said yourself, this is our last chance. I agree. I feel that more now than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you do,\u201d Dimitri said.</p><p>Trying to hide his desperate anger, Alexander said, \u201cLet something else guide you! This war has brought you inside yourself, you have forgotten other people. Remember her. Once. You know that if she stays here, she will die. Save her, Dimitri.\u201d Alexander almost said, please.</p><p>\u201cIf she comes with us, we will all die,\u201d Dimitri said coldly. \u201cI\u2019m convinced of it.\u201d</p><p>Alexander turned his body forward and faced the middle distance once again. His eyes glazed over, cleared, glazed over.</p><p>Darkness engulfed him.</p><p>Dimitri spoke. \u201cAlexander \u2014 think of it as dying at the front. If you had died out on the ice, she would have had to find a way to continue living in the Soviet Union, wouldn\u2019t she? Well, it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the difference in the world.\u201d Alexander looked into his stiffening hands. Because now there is light in front of her.</p><p>\u201cIt is no difference to her at all. One way or the other she is without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a small price to pay for America!\u201d Dimitri exclaimed.</p><p>Shuddering, Alexander made no reply, his heart pumping out of his chest. The Fontanka Bridge, the granite parapets, Tatiana on her knees.</p><p>\u201cShe will doom us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDimitri, I already said no,\u201d he said, steel in his voice.</p><p>Dimitri narrowed his eyes. \u201cAre you deliberately not understanding me? She can\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>I am just a means to an end, she had said. I am just ammunition.</p><p>Alexander laughed. \u201cFinally! I was wondering how long it would take you to issue your useless threats. You say she can\u2019t come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d said Alexander with a short nod. \u201cI\u2019m not going either. The whole thing is off. It\u2019s over. Dr. Sayers is leaving for Helsinki immediately. In three days I\u2019m going back to the front. Tania will return to Leningrad.\u201d Steadying his loathing stare on Dimitri, he said, \u201cNo one is going. You\u2019re dismissed, Private. Our meeting is finished.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri looked at Alexander with cold surprise. \u201cAre you telling me you will not go without her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you not been listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Dimitri paused, rubbing his hands. He leaned over, propping himself on Alexander\u2019s bed as he spoke. \u201cYou underestimate me, Alexander. I can see you will not listen to reason. That\u2019s too bad. Perhaps, then, what I should do is go and talk to Tania, explain the situation to her. She is much more reasonable. Once Tania sees that her husband is in grave danger, why, I am certain she herself will offer to stay behind\u2014\u201d Dimitri didn\u2019t finish.</p><p>Alexander grabbed Dimitri\u2019s arm. Dimitri yelped and threw his other hand up, but it was too late, Alexander had them both.</p><p>\u201cUnderstand this,\u201d said Alexander as his thumb and forefinger tightened in a twisting vise around Dimitri\u2019s wrist. \u201cI don\u2019t give a f*ck if you talk to Tania, to Stepanov, to Mekhlis, or to the whole Soviet Union. Tell them anything! I am not leaving without her. If she stays, I stay.\u201d And with a savage thrust, Alexander ruptured the ulnar bone in Dimitri\u2019s forearm. Even through the red of his fury Alexander heard the snap. It sounded like the ax crashing against the pliant pine in Lazarevo. Dimitri screamed. Alexander did not let go. \u201cYou underestimate me, you f*cking bastard!\u201d he said, jerking the wrist violently again and again until the broken bone tore out of Dimitri\u2019s skin.</p><p>Dimitri continued to scream. Clenching his fist, Alexander punched Dimitri in the face, and the uppercut blow would have driven the fractured nasal bone into Dimitri\u2019s frontal lobe had the impact not been weakened by an orderly who had grabbed Alexander\u2019s arm, who literally threw himself on Alexander and yelled, \u201cStop it! What are you doing? Let go, let go!\u201d</p><p>Panting, Alexander shoved Dimitri away, and Dimitri slumped to the floor. \u201cGet off me,\u201d Alexander said loudly to the stunned and grumbling orderly. As soon as the man got off him, Alexander started wiping his hands. He had yanked the IV right out of the vein, which was now dripping blood between his fingers. So it does bleed, he thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world happened here?\u201d yelled the nurse, running up. \u201cWhat kind of awful situation is this? The private comes for a visit, and what do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time don\u2019t let him through,\u201d Alexander said, throwing off his blankets and getting out of bed.</p><p>\u201cGet back into bed! My orders are that you don\u2019t get out of bed under any circumstances. Wait till Ina comes back. I never work the critical ward. Why does something always happen on my shift?\u201d</p><p>After a commotion that lasted a good half hour, a bleeding and unconscious Dimitri was removed from the floor, and the orderly cleaned up the mess, complaining that he already had plenty to do without the wounded making more wounded out of perfectly healthy men.</p><p>\u201cYou call him perfectly healthy?\u201d said Alexander. \u201cDid you see his limp? Did you see his pulverized face? Ask around. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s been assaulted. And I guarantee it won\u2019t be the last.\u201d</p><p>But Alexander knew: he had not merely assaulted Dimitri. Had he not been stopped, Alexander would have killed Dimitri with his bare hands.</p><p>Alexander slept, woke up, looked around the ward.</p><p>It was early evening. Ina was at her station by the door, chatting to three civilian men. Alexander stared at the civilian men. That didn\u2019t take long, he thought.</p><p>Motionless and alone, he remained with the rucksack on his lap, both of his hands inside, on the white dress with red roses. Alexander finally had the answer to his question.</p><p>He knew at what price Tatiana.</p><p>It was Colonel Stepanov who came to see him later that evening, eyes sunk deep into his ashen face. Alexander saluted his commander, who sat down heavily in the chair and said quietly, \u201cAlexander, I almost don\u2019t know how to say this to you. I should not be here. I\u2019m here not as your commanding officer, understand, but as someone who\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alexander interrupted him gently. \u201cSir,\u201d he said, \u201cyour very presence is a balm to my soul. More than you know. I know why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s true? General Govorov came to me tonight and said that Mekhlis\u201d \u2014 Stepanov seemed to spit the word out \u2014 \u201capproached him with a slew of information that you have previously escaped from prison as a foreign provocateur? As an American?\u201d Stepanov laughed. \u201cHow can that be? I said it was ridiculous\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alexander said, \u201cSir, I have proudly served the Red Army for nearly six years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been an exemplary soldier, Major,\u201d said Stepanov. \u201cI told them that. I told them it couldn\u2019t possibly be true. But as you know\u2014\u201d Stepanov broke off. \u201cThe accusation is all. You remember Meretskov? He\u2019s now commanding the Volkhov front, but nine months ago he was sitting in the NKVD cellars waiting for a wall to become available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about Meretskov. How much time do you think I have?\u201d</p><p>Stepanov was quiet. \u201cThey will come for you in the night,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with their operations\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, very familiar, sir,\u201d replied Alexander, not looking at Stepanov. \u201cIt\u2019s all about stealth and cover-up. I didn\u2019t know they had the facilities here in Morozovo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrimitive, but yes. They have them everywhere. You\u2019re too high up, though. They\u2019ll most likely send you across the lake to Volkhov.\u201d He spoke in a whisper.</p><p>Across the lake. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d He managed to smile at his commanding officer. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll promote me to lieutenant colonel first?\u201d</p><p>Stepanov breathed out a choking gasp. \u201cOf all my men I had hoped the most for you, Major.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cI had the least chance, sir. Please, do me a favor. If you yourself are questioned about me, understand\u201d \u2014 he struggled for his words \u2014 \u201cthat despite your valor, there are some battles that are lost from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you understand that, you will not waste a second\u2019s breath defending my honor or my army record. Distance yourself and retreat, sir.\u201d Alexander let his gaze drop. \u201cAnd take all your weapons with you.\u201d</p><p>Stepanov stood.</p><p>The unspoken remained between them.</p><p>Alexander couldn\u2019t think of himself, couldn\u2019t think of Stepanov. He had to ask about the unspoken. \u201cDo you know if there was any mention of my . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t continue.</p><p>Stepanov understood regardless. \u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. So Dimitri didn\u2019t want them both. What he wanted was for them not to have each other, but he still wanted to save his own skin. He will never take all from you, Alexander. There was hope.</p><p>Alexander heard Stepanov say, \u201cCan I do anything for her? Maybe arrange for a transfer back to a Leningrad hospital \u2014 or perhaps to a Molotov hospital? Away from here?\u201d</p><p>After a spasm Alexander spoke, looking in the other direction. \u201cYes, sir, you actually could do something to help her . . .\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t have time to think, and he didn\u2019t have time to feel. He knew the time for that would swallow too soon what was left of him. But right now he had to act. As soon as Stepanov left, Alexander motioned for Ina and asked her to call Dr. Sayers.</p><p>\u201cMajor,\u201d said Ina, \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re allowing anyone near you after this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Alexander glanced at the plainclothed men. \u201cIt was a little accident, Ina, nothing to worry about. Do me a favor, though, don\u2019t tell Nurse Metanova, all right? You know how she gets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how she gets. You better be good from now on, or I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be good, Ina.\u201d</p><p>Sayers came a few minutes later, sat down cheerfully, and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Major? What\u2019s this about some private\u2019s arm? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, Alexander said, \u201cHe lost the arm wrestle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say he lost. What about his broken nose? Did he lose the nose wrestle, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Sayers, listen to me. Forget him for a second.\u201d Alexander summoned his remaining will to speak. What strength he once possessed had left his body and gone to a tiny girl with freckles.</p><p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cwhen we first spoke about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me what you could do to help, remember? And I said to you,\u201d Alexander continued, \u201cthat you owed me nothing.\u201d He paused, collecting himself. \u201cIt turns out I was wrong. I desperately need your help.\u201d</p><p>Sayers smiled. \u201cMajor Belov, I\u2019m already doing all I can for you. Your terminal nurse is quite a persuader.\u201d</p><p>My terminal nurse.</p><p>Shrinking into himself, Alexander said, \u201cNo, listen carefully. I want you to do just one thing for me, and only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? If I can do it, I will.\u201d</p><p>With a halting voice, Alexander said, \u201cGet my wife out of the Soviet Union.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, Major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Doctor. I mean now. Take my wife, take\u2014\u201d He could not get the words out. \u201cTake Chernenko, the prick with the broken arm,\u201d he whispered, \u201cand get them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor, we have very little time. Any minute someone is going to call you away from me, and I won\u2019t be able to finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not.\u201d</p><p>In agitation, Sayers exclaimed, \u201cMajor, what the hell are you talking about?\u201d In English.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cYou will need to leave tomorrow at the absolute latest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget about me,\u201d Alexander said firmly. \u201cDr. Sayers, Tania needs your help. She is pregnant \u2014 did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Sayers shook his head, dumbstruck.</p><p>\u201cWell, she is. And she\u2019s going to be very scared. She is going to need you to protect her. Please get her out of the Soviet Union. And protect her.\u201d Alexander stared away from the doctor. His eyes filled with . . . the river Kama, with the soap on her body. They filled with . . . her hands going around his neck and her warm breath in his ear, whispering, potato pancakes, Shura, or eggs?</p><p>They filled with . . . her coming out of Grechesky Hospital in November, small, alone, wearing a big coat, her eyes at her feet; she couldn\u2019t even lift her eyes as she walked past him to her Fifth Soviet life, alone to her Fifth Soviet life.</p><p>\u201cSave my wife,\u201d whispered Alexander.</p><p>In an emotional voice Dr. Sayers said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand anything.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Alexander said, \u201cDo you see the casually dressed men you had to walk past on your way here? Those are NKVD men. Remember I told you about the NKVD, Doctor? What happened to my mother and father, and to me?\u201d</p><p>Sayers paled.</p><p>\u201cThe NKVD enforces the law of this great land. And they are here for me \u2014 again. Tomorrow,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cI will be gone. Tania cannot stay here a minute after that. She is in grave danger. You must get her out.\u201d</p><p>The doctor still didn\u2019t understand. He protested, he shook his head. He became increasingly nervous. \u201cAlexander, I will call the U.S. consulate personally. I\u2019ll call them tomorrow on your behalf.\u201d</p><p>Alexander became worried about the doctor. Could he even do what was needed? Could he keep his composure when he would need it the most? He didn\u2019t seem composed in the least. \u201cDoctor,\u201d Alexander said, keeping his own composure, \u201cI know you don\u2019t understand, but I don\u2019t have time to explain. Where is this U.S. consulate? In Sweden? In England? By the time you call them and they reach the U.S. State Department back home, the Mekhlis blue boys will have taken not only me but her, too. What does Tatiana have to do with America?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have only my Russian name, the name I married her under. By the time the United States gets together with the NKVD to clear up the confusion, it\u2019ll be too late for her. Forget me, I said. Just take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sayers said. He bucked, he couldn\u2019t sit. He walked around Alexander\u2019s bed, adjusted his blankets.</p><p>\u201cDoctor!\u201d Alexander exclaimed. \u201cYou have no time to think this through, I know. But what do you think will happen to a Russian girl once it\u2019s discovered she is married to a man suspected of being an American and infiltrating the Red Army\u2019s high command? What use do you think the Commissariat of Internal Affairs will have for my pregnant Russian wife?\u201d</p><p>Sayers was mute.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what use \u2014 they will use her as leverage against me when they interrogate us. Tell us everything, or your wife will be \u2018strictly judged.\u2019 Do you know what that means, Doctor? It means I will be forced to tell them everything. I won\u2019t stand a chance. Or they will use me as leverage against her. Your husband will be safe, but only if you tell the truth. And she will. And afterward\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Sayers said, \u201cNo! We will put you in my ambulance right now and take you back to Leningrad, to Grechesky. Right now. Get up. And from there we will drive to Finland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cBut those men\u201d \u2014 he nodded in their direction \u2014 \u201cwill come with us. They will come with us every step of the way. You won\u2019t get either of us out.\u201d</p><p>Alexander could see that Dr. Sayers was grasping at what he could. Glancing toward the door, to Ina, to the shuffling, smoking men standing chatting with her, Alexander shook his head. Sayers was not getting it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him? Chernenko? I don\u2019t know him or owe him anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must take him,\u201d whispered Alexander. \u201cAfter this afternoon, he finally understood. He thought I would sacrifice her to save myself because he could not imagine any other way. Now he knows the truth. He also knows I will not sacrifice her to destroy him. I will not keep her from escaping to keep him from escaping. And he is right. So take him. It\u2019ll help her, and I don\u2019t give a shit about anything else.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Sayers was at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d said Alexander gently, \u201cstop fighting for me. She does that. I don\u2019t want you to worry about me; my fate is sealed. But hers is wide open. Concern yourself only with her.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing his face, Dr. Sayers said, still shaking his head, \u201cAlexander, I\u2019ve seen that girl\u2014\u201d His voice broke. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that girl drain her lifeblood into you. I\u2019m fighting for you because I know what it will do to her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor!\u201d Alexander was nearly at the end of his tether. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping me. Don\u2019t you think I know?\u201d He closed his eyes. Everything she had she gave to me.</p><p>\u201cMajor, do you think she\u2019ll even go without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cGod! So what can I possibly do?\u201d Sayers exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cShe must never know I\u2019ve been arrested. If she finds out, she will not go. She\u2019ll stay \u2014 to find out what happened to me, to help me in some way, to see me one last time, and then it will be too late for her.\u201d</p><p>Alexander told Dr. Sayers what they had to do.</p><p>\u201cMajor, I can\u2019t do that!\u201d Sayers exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. It\u2019s just words from you, Doctor. Words and an impassive face.\u201d</p><p>Sayers shook his head.</p><p>\u201cMany things can go wrong. And they will,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect plan. It\u2019s not a safe plan. It\u2019s not a foolproof plan. But we have no choice. If we\u2019re to succeed at all, we must use all the weapons at our disposal.\u201d Alexander paused. \u201cEven the ones with no ammunition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMajor, you\u2019re out of your mind. She will never believe me,\u201d said Sayers.</p><p>Alexander grabbed the doctor\u2019s wrist. \u201cWell, that will depend on you, Doctor! The only chance she has of living is if you get her out. If you waver, if you\u2019re unconvincing, if when faced with her grief you weaken and she sees for a split second that you are not telling her the truth, she will not go. If she thinks I\u2019m still alive, she will never go, remember that, and if she doesn\u2019t go, know that she has days before they come for her.\u201d Stricken, Alexander said, \u201cWhen she sees my empty bed, she will break down in front of you, her fa?ade will crumble, and she will raise her tearful face to yours and say, \u2018You\u2019re lying, I know you\u2019re lying. I can feel he\u2019s still alive,\u2019 and that\u2019s when you will look at her and you\u2019ll want to comfort her, because you\u2019ve seen her comfort so many. Her grief will be too much for you to take. She will say to you, \u2018Tell me the truth, and I will go with you anywhere.\u2019 You will pause just for a second, you will blink, you will purse your lips, and in that instant know, Doctor, that you are condemning her and our baby to prison or death. She is very persuasive, and she is very hard to say no to, and she will keep on at you until you break down. Know \u2014 that when you comfort her with the truth, you will have killed her.\u201d Alexander let go of Sayers\u2019s wrist. \u201cNow, go. Look her in the eye and lie. Lie with all your heart!\u201d His voice nearly gone, Alexander whispered, \u201cAnd if you save her, you will help me.\u201d</p><p>There were tears in Sayers\u2019s eyes as he stood up. \u201cThis f*cking country,\u201d he said, \u201cis too much for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d said Alexander, extending his hand. \u201cNow, can you get her for me? I need to see her one last time. But come with her. Come with her and stand by my side. She is shy with other people around. She will have to be distant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe alone for just a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor, remember what I told you about looking her in the eye? I can\u2019t face her alone. Maybe you can hide, but I cannot.\u201d</p><p>Alexander kept his eyes closed. In ten minutes he heard footsteps and her choral voice. \u201cDoctor, I told you he\u2019s sleeping. What made you think he was restless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMajor?\u201d Dr. Sayers called.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cMajor? Can you wake up?\u201d And Alexander felt her warm, familiar hands on his head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel hot. He feels fine.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up, Alexander placed his hand on hers.</p><p>Here it is, Tatiana.</p><p>Here is my brave and indifferent face.</p><p>Alexander took a breath and opened his eyes. Tatiana was gazing down at him with a look of such unrelenting affection that he closed his eyes again and said, his lips carrying the cracked words mere centimeters from his mouth, \u201cI\u2019m just tired, Tatia. How are you? How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, soldier,\u201d Tatiana said fondly, caressing his face. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hungry,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut you fed me.\u201d His body was shaking underneath his sheet.</p><p>\u201cWhy is your IV disconnected?\u201d she said, taking hold of his hand. \u201cAnd why is your hand all black and blue, like you ripped the IV out of the vein? What have you been doing here this afternoon while I was gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need the IV anymore. I\u2019m almost all better.\u201d</p><p>She felt his head again. \u201cHe does feel a bit cold, Doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe we can give him another blanket?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana disappeared. Alexander opened his eyes and saw the doctor\u2019s anguished face. \u201cStop it,\u201d Alexander mouthed inaudibly.</p><p>Returning, she covered Alexander and studied him for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really,\u201d he said to her. \u201cI have a joke for you. What do you get when you cross a white bear with a black bear?\u201d</p><p>She replied, \u201cTwo happy bears.\u201d</p><p>They smiled at each other. Alexander did not look away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ll come back tomorrow morning to give you breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cNo, not in the morning. You\u2019ll never guess where they\u2019re taking me tomorrow morning.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVolkhov. Don\u2019t be too proud of your husband, all right, but they\u2019re finally making me lieutenant colonel.\u201d Alexander glanced at Dr. Sayers, who stood by the foot of the bed with a pasty grimace.</p><p>\u201cThey are?\u201d Tatiana beamed.</p><p>\u201cYes. To go with my Hero of the Soviet Union medal for helping our doctor. What do you think of that?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Tatiana leaned into him and said happily, \u201cI think you\u2019re going to become really insufferable. I\u2019ll have to obey your every command, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, to get you to obey my every command, I\u2019ll have to become a general,\u201d Alexander replied.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhen are you coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe following morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy then? Why not tomorrow afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey transport across the lake only in the very early mornings,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cIt\u2019s a little safer. There is less shelling.\u201d</p><p>Sayers said in a weak voice, \u201cTania, we must go.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shut his eyes. He heard Tatiana say, \u201cDr. Sayers, can I have a moment with Major Belov?\u201d</p><p>No! Alexander thought, opening his eyes and staring at the doctor, who said, \u201cTatiana, we really have to be going. I have rounds to make in three wards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take but a second,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd look, Leo in bed number thirty is gesturing for you.\u201d</p><p>The doctor left. He can\u2019t even say no to her when she is asking simple things, Alexander thought, shaking his head.</p><p>Coming close, Tatiana brought her freckled face to him. She glanced around, saw that Dr. Sayers was looking right at them, and said, \u201cGod, I won\u2019t get a chance to kiss you, will I? I can\u2019t wait until I can kiss you out in the open.\u201d Her hands patted his chest. \u201cSoon we\u2019ll be out of the thick forest,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cKiss me anyway,\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana bent, her serene hand remaining on his chest, and her honey lips softly kissed Alexander\u2019s own lips. She pressed her cheek against his. \u201cShura, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen them.\u201d</p><p>Alexander opened them.</p><p>Tatiana gazed at him, her eyes shining, and then she blinked three times quick.</p><p>Straightening up, she put on her serious face and raising her hand in a salute, said, \u201cSleep well, Major, and I\u2019ll see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you, Tania,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>She walked to the end of his bed. No! he wanted to cry out. No, Tania, please come back. What can I leave her with, what can I say, what one word can I leave with her, for her? What one word for my wife?</p><p>\u201cTatiasha,\u201d Alexander called after her. God, what was the curator\u2019s name . . . ?</p><p>She glanced back.</p><p>\u201cRemember Orbeli\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania!\u201d Dr. Sayers yelled across the ward. \u201cPlease come now!\u201d</p><p>She made a frustrated face and said quickly, \u201cShura, darling, I\u2019m sorry, I have to run. Tell me when I see you next, all right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Tatiana walked away from Alexander, past the cots, touching a convalescent\u2019s leg and bringing a small smile to the man\u2019s bandaged face. She said good night to Ina and stopped for a second to adjust someone\u2019s blanket. At the door she said a few words to Dr. Sayers, laughed, and then turned to Alexander one last time, and in Tatiana\u2019s eyes he saw her love, and then she was out the door and gone.</p><p>Alexander whispered after her, \u201cTatiana! Thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night . . . nor for the arrow that flieth by day . . . nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near thee.\u201d</p><p>Alexander crossed himself, folded his arms, and began to wait. He thought back to his father\u2019s last words to him.</p><p>Dad, I have watched the things I gave my life to broken, but will I ever know if I have built them up with my worn-out tools?</p><p>Barefoot, Tania stood at attention in front of Alexander, in her yellow dress and with her golden braids peeking out from under his cap. Her face was ablaze with an exuberant smile. She saluted him.</p><p>\u201cAt ease, Tania,\u201d he said, saluting her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Captain,\u201d she said, coming up and standing on tiptoe on top of his boot-clad feet. Lifting her face to him, she kissed his chin \u2014 it was as high up as she could reach without him bending his head to her. With one hand he held her to him.</p><p>She stepped a meter away and turned her back to Alexander. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m falling. You better catch me. Ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been ready for five minutes. Fall already.\u201d</p><p>Her chortling squeals chimed as she fell, and Alexander caught her, kissing her from above. \u201cAll right,\u201d Tatiana said, straightening up, opening her arms, and laughing joyously. \u201cNow your turn.\u201d</p><p>Good-bye, my moonsong and my breath, my white nights and golden days, my fresh water and my fire. Good-bye, and may you find a better life, find comfort again and your breathless smile, and when your beloved face lights up once more at the Western sunrise, be sure what I felt for you was not in vain. Good-bye, and have faith, my Tatiana. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>IN THE MOONLIGHT\u2019S PALLID GLAMOUR</p><p>LATE the next morning Tatiana came into the critical care ward at the field hospital, the wooden building that was once a school, and found someone else in Alexander\u2019s bed. She had expected his bed to be empty. She did not expect to see a new patient in Alexander\u2019s bed, a man with no arms or legs.</p><p>Staring at the man with incomprehension, she thought she had made a mistake. She had woken up late and rushed and then spent too many hours in the terminal ward. Seven soldiers had died that morning.</p><p>But no, it was the critical ward. Leo in bed number thirty was reading. The two beds next to Alexander had also been emptied and refilled by new patients. Nikolai Ouspensky, the lieutenant with one lung next to Alexander, was gone, and so was the corporal next to him.</p> <p>Why would they have filled Alexander\u2019s bed? Tatiana went to check with Ina, who knew nothing; she wasn\u2019t even on shift duty yet. Ina told Tatiana that late last night Alexander had asked for his dress uniform, which she brought him and then left for the night. Past that she knew nothing. Ina said that maybe Alexander had been moved to the convalescent wing.</p><p>Tatiana went to check. He hadn\u2019t been.</p><p>She came back to the critical ward and looked under the bed. His rucksack was gone. Alexander\u2019s medal of valor was no longer hanging on the wooden chair that stood by the new patient, whose face was covered in gauze, oozing blood near his right ear. Absentmindedly Tatiana said that she would get a doctor to take a look at him and groggily ambled away. She was feeling as well as she could for a woman four months pregnant. Her stomach was beginning to show, she knew. It was a good thing they were leaving, because she could not imagine explaining herself to the nurses and her patients. She was on her way to the mess to eat but found a nagging tick mowing through her insides. She became afraid that Alexander had been sent back to the front, that he had gone across the lake and been made to stay. She couldn\u2019t eat a bite. She went to look for Dr. Sayers.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t find him anywhere, but when she found Ina, who was getting ready to start her shift, Ina told her that Dr. Sayers had been looking for her.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have been looking very hard,\u201d said Tatiana. \u201cI\u2019ve been in terminal all morning.\u201d Tatiana found Dr. Sayers in the terminal ward himself, with a patient who had lost most of his stomach. \u201cDr. Sayers,\u201d she whispered, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on? Where is Major Belov?\u201d She saw that the patient had mere minutes to live.</p> <p>Sayers didn\u2019t look up from the man\u2019s wounds when he said, \u201cTatiana, I\u2019m almost done here. Help me hold his sides together while I sew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Doctor?\u201d Tatiana repeated as she helped him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just finish with him first, all right?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana looked at the doctor, looked at the patient, and put her gloved and bloodied hand on the patient\u2019s forehead. For a few moments she kept her hand on him and then said, \u201cHe is dead, Doctor, you can stop suturing.\u201d</p><p>The doctor stopped suturing.</p><p>Tatiana ripped off her gloves and walked outside. The doctor followed her. It was nearly the middle of March and unremittingly windy. \u201cListen, Tania,\u201d Sayers said, taking hold of her hands and looking white. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Something terrible has happened.\u201d His voice half broke on happened. The circles under his eyes were so dark, it looked as if he had been beaten. Tatiana stared at him for a moment, another moment\u2014</p> <p>She pulled her hands away. \u201cDoctor,\u201d Tatiana said, paling and looking around for something to hold on to. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, wait, don\u2019t shout\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not shouting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry to tell you this, very sorry, but Alexander\u2014\u201d He broke off. \u201cEarly this morning, when he was taken with two other soldiers to Volkhov . . .\u201d Sayers couldn\u2019t continue.</p><p>Tatiana listened motionlessly, her insides becoming anesthetized. She tried to say, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, they were going across the lake when enemy fire\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat enemy fire?\u201d Tatiana whispered vehemently.</p><p>\u201cThey left to cross before the shelling started, but we\u2019re fighting a war. You hear the bombing, the German shells flying from Sinyavino? A long-range rocket hit the ice in front of the truck and exploded.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Five people in that truck . . . nobody survived.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana turned her back to the doctor and shook so violently that she thought she would split open. Without looking back, she asked, \u201cDoctor, how do you know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was called to the scene. We tried to save the men, the truck. But the truck was too heavy. It sank.\u201d His voice was below a whisper.</p><p>Tatiana gripped her stomach and was sick in the snow. Her pulse tearing through her body at over 200 beats a minute, she reached down, grabbed a handful of snow, and wiped her mouth. She took another handful and pressed it to her face. Her heart would not quieten. She could not stop retching. She felt the doctor\u2019s hand on her back, heard his voice dimly calling for her, \u201cTania, Tania.\u201d</p><p>She did not turn around. \u201cDid you see him yourself?\u201d she asked, panting.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI got his cap\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he alive when you saw him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tatiana. No.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand any more.</p><p>\u201cNo, please,\u201d she heard Dr. Sayers\u2019s voice and felt his arms holding her up. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Straightening herself, willing herself to remain upright, Tatiana turned around and leveled her gaze at Dr. Sayers, who touched her face and said, very concerned, \u201cYou need to go and sit down immediately, you\u2019re in a state of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I am in,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cGive me his cap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It breaks my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take his cap,\u201d said Tatiana, but her hand was shaking so badly that she couldn\u2019t grasp it for a moment, and when she did, it fell out of her hands and onto the snow.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold the death certificate either. Dr. Sayers had to hold it up for her. She saw only his name and the place of death. Lake Ladoga.</p><p>The Ladoga ice.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she said faintly. \u201cWhere is he now\u2014\u201d She could not finish.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tania . . . what could we do? We . . .\u201d</p><p>Waving him off, she doubled over. \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me anymore. How could you not have woken me? How could you not have told me instantly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania, look at me.\u201d She felt herself being pulled upright. Sayers had tears in his eyes. \u201cI did look for you after I returned. But I can barely stand in front of you now when you\u2019ve come for me, when I\u2019ve got no choice. If I could, I would have sent you a telegram.\u201d He shivered. \u201cTania, let\u2019s get out of here! You and I. Let\u2019s be done with this place! I have to get out of here, I can\u2019t do it anymore. I need to be back in Helsinki. Come on, we\u2019ll get our things. I\u2019ll call Leningrad, let them know.\u201d He paused. \u201cI have to leave tonight.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cWe have to leave tonight.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana did not respond. Her mind was playing tricks on her. For some reason she couldn\u2019t get past the death certificate. It wasn\u2019t a Red Army certificate. It was a Red Cross death certificate.</p><p>\u201cTatiana,\u201d said Sayers, \u201ccan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said indistinctly.</p><p>\u201cYou will come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think right now,\u201d she managed to utter. \u201cI need to think for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you . . .\u201d Sayers let out. \u201cWill you please come back to my office? You\u2019re not \u2014 Come, sit in my chair. You\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Backing away from Sayers, Tatiana watched him with an intensity she knew was excruciating to him. She turned and walked as fast as she could to the main building. She had to find Colonel Stepanov. The colonel was busy and refused to see her at first.</p><p>She waited outside the front door until he came out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m headed for the mess tent. Walk with me?\u201d Stepanov said to her, not catching her eye and hurrying forward.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Tatiana said into his back, not taking a step, \u201cwhat happened to your officer\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t say his name out loud.</p><p>Stepanov slowed down, stopped, and faced her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your husband,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t speak. Coming close to him, she took Colonel Stepanov\u2019s hand. \u201cSir, you are a good man, and you were his commanding officer.\u201d Wind was whipping her face. \u201cPlease tell me what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana stood small before the uniformed colonel.</p><p>The colonel sighed. \u201cAll I know is that one of our armored trucks carrying your husband, Lieutenant Ouspensky, one corporal, and two drivers exploded this morning under what appeared to be enemy fire and eventually sank. I have no other information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArmored? He told me he was going to Volkhov to get promoted this morning,\u201d she said in a faint whisper.</p><p>\u201cNurse Metanova,\u201d said Colonel Stepanov, pausing and blinking. \u201cThe truck sank. Everything else is moot.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana never looked away from him for a moment.</p><p>Stepanov nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Your husband was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what he was, sir,\u201d Tatiana broke in, holding the cap and the certificate to her chest.</p><p>With a small shiver of his voice, staring at her with hurting blue eyes, Colonel Stepanov said, \u201cYes. We both do.\u201d</p><p>Mutely they stood in front of each other.</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d said Colonel Stepanov emotionally. \u201cGo back with Dr. Sayers. As soon as you can. It\u2019ll be easier and safer for you in Leningrad. Maybe Molotov? Go with him.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana saw him button the top of his uniform. She didn\u2019t take her eyes off him. \u201cHe brought your son back,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Stepanov lowered his eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who is going to bring him back?\u201d</p><p>The bitter wind whistled through her words.</p><p>How to move, how to move now, can I get on my hands and knees and crawl, no, I will walk, I will look at the ground, and I will walk away, and I won\u2019t stumble.</p><p>I will stumble.</p><p>She fell on the snow, and the colonel came over and picked her up, patting her back, and she closed her coat around her and, without looking again at Stepanov, staggered down the road to the hospital, holding on to the walls of buildings.</p><p>To hide him her whole life, to hide him every step of the way, to hide him from Dasha, from Dimitri, to hide him from death, and now to hide him even from herself. Her weakness felt insuperable.</p><p>Finding Dr. Sayers in his small office, Tatiana said, \u201cDoctor, look at me, look me in the eye and swear to me that he is dead.\u201d</p><p>Sinking to her knees, she looked at him, her hands in a plea.</p><p>Dr. Sayers crouched down and took Tatiana\u2019s hands. \u201cI swear,\u201d he said, \u201che is dead.\u201d He did not look at her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said in a guttural voice. \u201cI can\u2019t take it. I can\u2019t take the thought of him dying in that lake without me. Do you understand? I can\u2019t take it,\u201d she whispered wrenchingly. \u201cTell me he\u2019s been taken by the NKVD. Tell me he\u2019s been arrested and he\u2019ll be storming bridges next week, tell me he\u2019s been sent to the Ukraine, to Sinyavino, to Siberia \u2014 tell me anything. But please tell me he did not die on the ice without me. I\u2019ll bear anything but that. Tell me, and I will go with you anywhere, I promise, I will do exactly as you say, but I beg you, tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dr. Sayers said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t save him. With my whole heart I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t save him for you.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana crawled away to the wall and put her face into her hands.</p><p>\u201cI am not going anywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTania,\u201d Sayers said, coming after her and putting his hand on her head, \u201cplease don\u2019t say that. Honey . . . please . . . let me save you for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo point? What about his baby?\u201d exclaimed the doctor.</p><p>She took her hands away from her face and stared dully at Sayers. \u201cHe told you we are having a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Flustered, the doctor said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d His hand was still on Tatiana\u2019s head. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel good. You\u2019re all cold. You\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>She did not reply. She was convulsing.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>She covered her face.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay here? Just stay in my office and wait. Don\u2019t get up, all right. Sleep maybe?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana made a rasping noise that sounded like an animal pressing its gaping wound into the ground, hoping to die before it bled to death.</p><p>\u201cYour patients were asking for you,\u201d Sayers said softly. \u201cDo you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Through her hands. \u201cPlease leave me. I need to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Until night fell, she sat on the floor in Dr. Sayers\u2019s office. She put her head into her knees, and sat against the wall. Until she couldn\u2019t sit up anymore, and then she lay down, curled into a ball.</p><p>Dimly she heard the doctor return. She heard his gasp and tried to get up but couldn\u2019t. Helping her up, Sayers sucked in his breath when he saw her face. \u201cGod, Tania. Please. I need you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor!\u201d Tatiana exclaimed. \u201cAll the things you need me to be, I can\u2019t be right now. I\u2019ll be what I can. Is it time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, Tania. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cLook, I went to your bed and got your backpack. It\u2019s yours, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, taking it.</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything else you need to bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tatiana whispered. \u201cThe backpack is all I have. Is it just you and me going?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Sayers paused before he answered her. \u201cChernenko came to me earlier today and asked if our plans had changed now that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you said . . .\u201d Her weak legs weren\u2019t holding her. She sank into the chair and looked up. \u201cI can\u2019t go with him,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take him either, but what can I do? He told me, not in so many words, that without him we wouldn\u2019t be able to get you through the first checkpoint. I want to get you out, Tania. What else can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>She helped Sayers collect his few things and carried his doctor\u2019s bag and her nurse\u2019s bag outside. The Red Cross vehicle was a big jeep without the enclosed solid steel body customary for ambulances. This one had glass covering the passenger cab but only canvas covering the back, not the safest for the wounded or medical personnel. But it had been the only truck available at the time in Helsinki, and Sayers could not wait for a proper ambulance. The square Red Cross badges were sewn into the tarpaulin.</p><p>Dimitri was waiting by the side of the truck. Tatiana did not look or acknowledge him as she opened the tarpaulin and climbed in to load the first aid kit and the box of plasma.</p><p>\u201cTania?\u201d Dimitri said.</p><p>Dr. Sayers came up from behind, and said to Dimitri, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s hurry along. You get in the back. Once we leave here, you can change into the Finnish pilot\u2019s clothes. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to get your arm through . . . Tania, where are those clothes?\u201d Then to Dimitri, \u201cDo you need morphine? How is your face doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible. I can barely see. Is my arm going to get infected?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana glanced at Dimitri from inside the truck. His right arm was in a cast and sling. His face was swollen black and blue. She wanted to ask what had happened to him, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cTania?\u201d Dimitri called to her. \u201cI heard about this morning. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana retrieved the Finnish pilot\u2019s clothes from their hiding place and threw them on the truck floor in front of Dimitri.</p><p>\u201cTatiana, come,\u201d Dr. Sayers told her. \u201cLet me help you down, we have to get going.\u201d</p><p>Taking Sayers\u2019s hand, Tatiana jumped down past Dimitri.</p><p>\u201cTania?\u201d Dimitri repeated.</p><p>She lifted her eyes to him filled with such unwavering condemnation that Dimitri could not help but look away. \u201cJust put on the clothes,\u201d Tatiana said through her teeth. \u201cThen get down on the floor and lie very still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I know how you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Clenching her fists, Tatiana lunged furiously at Dimitri, and she would have punched him in his broken nose had Dr. Sayers not restrained her from behind, saying, \u201cTania, God. Please. No. No.\u201d</p><p>Backing away, Dimitri opened his mouth and stammered, \u201cI said I was very s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear your f*cking lies!\u201d she yelled, her arms still being held by Dr. Sayers. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to speak to me ever again. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri, mumbling nervously that he didn\u2019t understand why she should be upset with him, got into the back of the truck.</p><p>Dr. Sayers got behind the wheel and stared wide-eyed at Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cReady, Doctor. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Tatiana buttoned up her nurse\u2019s white coat with the Red Cross badge on the sleeve, and she tied her little white hat over her hair. She had all of Alexander\u2019s money, she had his Pushkin book, she had his letters and their photographs. She had his cap, and she had his ring.</p><p>They drove into the night.</p><p>Tatiana held Sayers\u2019s open map but could not have helped him get to Lisiy Nos. Through the northern Russian woods Dr. Sayers drove his small truck, as they made their way on unpaved, muddy, snowy, liquid roads. Tatiana saw nothing at all, staring out the side window into the darkness, counting inside her head, trying to keep herself upright.</p><p>Sayers kept talking to her nonstop in English. \u201cTania, dear, it will be all right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it, Doctor?\u201d she asked, also in English. \u201cAnd what are we going to do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares? He can do what he likes once we get to Helsinki. I\u2019m not thinking about him at all. All I\u2019m thinking about is you. We will get to Helsinki, drop off some supplies, and then you and I will take a Red Cross plane to Stockholm. Then from Stockholm we\u2019ll ride the train to G?teborg on the North Sea, and we\u2019ll take a protected vessel across the North Sea to England. Tania, can you hear me? Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hear you,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn England I\u2019ve got a couple of stops to make, but then we\u2019ll either fly to the U.S. or take one of the passenger liners from Liverpool. And once you\u2019re in New York\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthew, please,\u201d whispered Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to make you feel better, Tania. It\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>From the back Dimitri said, \u201cTania, I didn\u2019t know you could speak English.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana did not reply at first. Then she picked up a metal pipe from under Dr. Sayers\u2019s feet that she knew he kept in case of trouble. Swinging her arm, she smashed the pipe hard against the metal divider separating her from Dimitri, startling Dr. Sayers nearly off the side of the road. \u201cDimitri,\u201d she said loudly, \u201cyou have to stay quiet and stop talking. You are a Finn. Not another Russian syllable out of you.\u201d</p><p>Dropping the pipe onto the floor, she folded her arms around her stomach.</p><p>\u201cTania . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten, have you?\u201d the doctor asked gently.</p><p>Tatiana shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about food at all,\u201d she replied.</p><p>In the middle of the night they stopped by the side of the road. Dimitri had already slipped on the Finnish uniform. \u201cIt\u2019s very big,\u201d Tatiana heard him say to Dr. Sayers. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t have to stand up in it. Anyone will see it doesn\u2019t fit me. Do you have any more morphine? I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dr. Sayers came back a few minutes later. \u201cIf I give him any more morphine, he\u2019ll be dead. That arm is going to give him trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Tatiana asked in English.</p><p>Dr. Sayers was quiet. \u201cHe was nearly killed,\u201d he said at last. \u201cHe has a very nasty open fracture.\u201d He paused. \u201cHe may lose that arm. I don\u2019t know how he is conscious, upright. I thought he\u2019d be in a coma after yesterday, yet today he is walking.\u201d Sayers shook his head.</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t speak. How could he still be standing? she thought. How could the rest of us \u2014 strong, resolute, spirited, young \u2014 be falling on our knees, be demolished by our life, while he remains standing?</p><p>\u201cSomeday, Tania,\u201d Sayers said in English, \u201cyou will have to explain to me the\u2014\u201d He broke off, pointing to the back of the truck. \u201cBecause I swear to Christ, I don\u2019t understand at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not think I could explain,\u201d whispered Tatiana.</p><p>On the way to Lisiy Nos they were stopped half a dozen times at checkpoints for papers. Sayers presented papers on himself and papers on his nurse, Jane Barrington. Dimitri, who was a Finn named Tove Hanssen, had no papers, just a metal dogtag with the dead man\u2019s name on it. He was a wounded pilot being taken back to Helsinki for a prisoner exchange. All six times the guards opened the tarpaulin, shined a flashlight in Dimitri\u2019s battered face, and then waved Sayers on.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be protected by the Red Cross flag,\u201d said Sayers.</p><p>Tatiana nodded.</p><p>The doctor pulled over by the side of the road, turning the engine off. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d Not cold enough. \u201cDo you want me to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how to drive?\u201d</p><p>In Luga, when she was sixteen, the summer before she met Alexander, Tatiana had befriended an army corporal stationed with the local village Soviet. The corporal let Tatiana and Pasha drive around in his truck for the whole summer. Pasha was annoying because he always wanted to be behind the wheel, but the corporal was kind and let her behind the wheel, too. She drove the truck well, better than Pasha, she thought, and the corporal told her she was a quick learner.</p><p>\u201cI know how to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s too dark and icy.\u201d Sayers closed his eyes for an hour.</p><p>Tatiana sat quietly, her hands in her coat. She was trying to remember the last time she and Alexander had made love. It was a Sunday in November, but where was it? She couldn\u2019t recall. What did they do? Where were they? Did she look up at him? Was Inga outside their door? Was it in the bath, on the couch, on the floor? She couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>What did Alexander say to her last night? He made a joke, he kissed her, he smiled, he touched her hand, he told her he was going across to Volkhov to get promoted. Were they lying to him? Was he lying to her?</p><p>He had been trembling. She had thought he was cold. What else did he say? I\u2019ll see you. So casual. Not even blinking. What else? Remember Orbeli.</p><p>What was that?</p><p>Alexander often told her fascinating little tidbits he picked up in the army, names of generals, stories about Hitler, or Rommel, about England or Italy, about Stalingrad, about Richthoffen, von Paulus, El Alamein, Montgomery. It wasn\u2019t unusual that he would say a word she didn\u2019t understand. But Orbeli was a word she hadn\u2019t heard before, and yet there was Alexander \u2014 asking her to remember it.</p><p>Tatiana nudged Dr. Sayers awake. \u201cDr. Sayers, what is Orbeli?\u201d she asked. \u201cWho is Orbeli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Sayers replied sleepily. \u201cNever heard of it. Why?\u201d</p><p>She said nothing.</p><p>Sayers began driving again.</p><p>They got to the silent, sleeping border between the Soviet Union and Finland at six in the morning.</p><p>Alexander had told Tatiana it wasn\u2019t really a border, it was a line of defense, which meant there was anywhere from thirty to sixty meters between the Soviet and Finnish troops. Each side marked its territory and then sat and waited out the war.</p><p>To Tatiana the Finnish conifer and willow woods looked like the Soviet conifer and willow woods they had been driving through for the last long hours of the night. The headlights from their truck illuminated a narrow strip of unpaved road ahead. Sunrise was slow in coming toward the ides of March.</p><p>Dr. Sayers suggested that if everyone was sleeping, maybe they could just drive across and present their papers to the Finns instead of to the Soviets. Tatiana thought that was an excellent idea.</p><p>Suddenly someone yelled for them to halt. Three sleepy NKVD border troops came up to the doctor\u2019s window. Sayers showed them the papers. After thoroughly looking over the documents, the NKVD soldier said to Tatiana in accented English, \u201cA cold wind, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>And in clear English, she replied, \u201cVery bitter. They say it is going to snow.\u201d</p><p>The soldier nodded, and then all three men went around to take a look at Dimitri in the back of the truck. Tatiana waited.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The flashlight shined.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then, \u201cWait,\u201d Tatiana heard. \u201cLet me see his face again.\u201d</p><p>The flashlight shined.</p><p>Tatiana sat immobile and listened intently.</p><p>She heard one of the soldiers laugh and say something to Dimitri in Finnish. Tatiana didn\u2019t speak Finnish, so she couldn\u2019t guarantee that it was Finnish, but the Soviet soldier spoke to Dimitri in a language Tatiana didn\u2019t understand, and obviously Dimitri hadn\u2019t understood either, because he did not reply.</p><p>The Soviet officer repeated his question more loudly.</p><p>Dimitri remained silent. Then he said something in what sounded to Tatiana like Finnish. After a short snickering silence from the troops, one of them said, in Russian, \u201cGet out of the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d whispered Dr. Sayers. \u201cAre we caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d said Tatiana.</p><p>The soldiers repeated their order to Dimitri to get out of the truck. He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Dr. Sayers turned around and said, in Russian, \u201cHe is wounded. He can\u2019t get up.\u201d</p><p>And the Soviet officer said, \u201cHe\u2019ll get up if he wants to live. Talk to your patient in whatever language he speaks and tell him to get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d whispered Tatiana, \u201cbe very careful. If he can\u2019t save himself, he will try to kill us all.\u201d</p><p>The three NKVD soldiers dragged Dimitri out of the truck and then ordered Sayers and Tatiana out. The doctor came around and stood by Tatiana\u2019s side near her open door. His slender body was slightly in front of her. Tatiana, feeling herself weakening, touched Sayers\u2019s coat, hoping for some strength. She felt ready to faint. Dimitri was out in the open in plain sight a few meters away from them, dwarfed by the Finnish uniform, a uniform that would have been just right on a bigger soldier.</p><p>Laughing, their rifles trained on him, one of the NKVD troops said, in Russian, \u201cSo, hey, Finn, we ask you how you got your face wound, and you tell us that you are going to Helsinki. You want to explain?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri said nothing, but stared pleadingly at Tatiana.</p><p>Dr. Sayers said, \u201cLook, we picked him up in Leningrad, he was grievously wounded\u2014\u201d</p><p>Imperceptibly, Tatiana nudged Dr. Sayers. \u201cKeep quiet,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may be grievously wounded,\u201d said the NKVD man, \u201che\u2019s just not grievously Finnish.\u201d The three soldiers laughed. One of the NKVD men walked up to Dimitri. \u201cChernenko, don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d he said in Russian, cracking up. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Rasskovsky.\u201d Dimitri lowered his good arm. \u201cKeep your hand above your head!\u201d the NKVD soldier yelled, laughing. \u201cKeep it up.\u201d Tatiana saw they were not taking Dimitri seriously, his right arm in a sling. Where was Dimitri\u2019s weapon? she wondered. Did he have one on him?</p><p>The two other soldiers stood a short distance away from Dimitri. \u201cYou know him?\u201d one of them asked, lowering his rifle.</p><p>\u201cKnow him?\u201d Rasskovsky exclaimed. \u201cOf course I know him! Chernenko, have you forgotten how much you were charging me for cigarettes? And how I had to pay because I just couldn\u2019t be without my smokes in the middle of the forest?\u201d He laughed. \u201cJust four weeks ago I saw you. Have you already forgotten?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t recognize you just because of the pretty color on your face?\u201d Rasskovsky seemed to be having a very good time. \u201cSo, Chernenko, darling, can you explain what you\u2019re doing wearing a Finnish uniform and lying in the back of a Red Cross truck? The arm and the face I understand. Someone didn\u2019t like your extortionate prices?\u201d</p><p>One of the other two soldiers said, \u201cRasskovsky, you don\u2019t think our runner is trying to escape, do you?\u201d Everyone roared with laughter.</p><p>Under the glare of the lights Dimitri stared at Tatiana, who held his gaze for only an instant. Then she turned her whole body away and moved closer to Dr. Sayers, her arms tight around herself. \u201cI\u2019m cold,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTatiana!\u201d yelled Dimitri in Russian to her. \u201cYou want to tell them? Or should I?\u201d</p><p>Rasskovsky turned to look at her, and said, \u201cTatiana? An American named Tatiana?\u201d He walked over to Sayers. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, here? Why is he talking to her in Russian? Let me see her papers again.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Sayers showed Tatiana\u2019s papers. They were in order.</p><p>Looking right at Rasskovsky, Tatiana said in English, \u201cTatiana? What is he talking about? Listen, what do we know? He said he was Finnish. Right, Doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Dr. Sayers replied, stepping forward and away from Tatiana and the truck, his friendly hand on Rasskovsky\u2019s back. \u201cListen, no trouble, I hope. He came to our hospital\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that moment Dimitri took out his sidearm and shot at Rasskovsky walking in front of Tatiana.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure whom Dimitri was aiming for \u2014 he was shooting with his left arm \u2014 but she wasn\u2019t about to stand there to find out. She dropped down. He could have been aiming at the NKVD man. He could have. But he missed and shot Dr. Sayers instead. Or maybe Dimitri didn\u2019t miss. Or maybe he was shooting at her \u2014 standing behind the two men \u2014 and missed. Tatiana didn\u2019t want to think about it.</p><p>Rasskovsky ran toward Dimitri, who fired again, this time hitting Rasskovsky. Dimitri wasn\u2019t quick enough to turn his fire on the other two NKVD soldiers, who, as if suspended in still life, struggled to remove their rifles from their shoulders. Finally they opened fire on Dimitri, who was thrown several meters by the force of the impact.</p><p>Suddenly there was return fire from the woods. This fire was not slow and methodical bolt-action fire \u2014 the metronome of battle: five cartridges, flip open bolt, thumb in another five, close bolt. No, this was a bursting machine-gun fire that broke apart the truck\u2019s elongated, flattop front end and the entire windshield. The two NKVD men disappeared.</p><p>The window of the cabin door above her shattered, and Tatiana felt something hard and sharp fall and lodge itself in her cheek. She tasted liquid metal, and her tongue ran over and got caught on something sharp inside her mouth. When she opened her mouth, blood dripped out. She had no time to think about it, crawling under the nose of the truck.</p><p>Tatiana saw Dimitri on the ground. Dr. Sayers was on the ground out in the open. There was an endless barrage of fire, a stifling ringing, a constant popping against the steel hood of the Red Cross truck.</p><p>Tatiana crawled out, grabbed hold of Dr. Sayers, and dragged his motionless body with her. Pulling him close and covering him with herself, she thought she saw Dimitri still moving, or was it the strobe lights of gunfire? No, it was him. He was trying to crawl to the truck. From the Soviet side a mortar shell flew into the air and burst in the woods. Fire, black smoke, screams. From here? From there? She couldn\u2019t tell. There was no here or there. There was just Dimitri making his way toward Tatiana. She saw him in the incongruous headlights, searching for her, finding her, and in the second or two when there was no noise she heard him calling for her: \u201cTatiana . . . Tatiana . . . please . . .\u201d with his hand outstretched. Tatiana closed her eyes.</p><p>He will not come near me.</p><p>Tatiana heard a whistling noise, a flash, and then a charge that exploded so close that the wave pushed her head into the undercarriage of the truck, and she lost consciousness.</p><p>When she came to, Tatiana decided not to open her eyes. She couldn\u2019t hear very well, having just come out of a dead faint, but she felt warm, as if she were in the hot bathhouse in Lazarevo when she would throw hot water on the rocks and the rocks would sizzle and release steam. Dr. Sayers was still partially underneath her body. There was nowhere for her to go. Her tongue ran over the sharp object in her mouth again. She tasted metallic salt.</p><p>Sayers felt clammy. Blood loss. Tatiana opened her eyes, felt around on him. A small flame behind the truck illuminated the doctor\u2019s pale face. Where was he hit? With her fingers she felt around under his coat and found the bullet hole in his shoulder. She didn\u2019t find the exit hole, but she pressed her gloved hand into his arm to try to clot the wound. Then she closed her eyes again. There was a blaze behind her, but there were no more gunshots.</p><p>How long did that take? Two minutes? Three?</p><p>She felt herself starting to slip down into a black abyss. Not only could she not open her eyes, she did not want to.</p><p>How long for her life to end, to continue? How long for Dr. Sayers to sleep, how long for Dimitri to stand alone in the glare? How long for Tatiana? How much longer for her?</p><p>How long did it take for Alexander to rescue Dr. Sayers and get hit himself? Tatiana had watched it all from the Red Cross truck, positioned behind the trees on the clearing leading to the slope to the river, the slope down which Alexander ran for Anatoly Marazov.</p><p>Tatiana had watched it all.</p><p>Those two minutes of watching Alexander run for Marazov, shout at Dr. Sayers, run to Dr. Sayers, pull him out, and then drag three men to the truck had been the longest two minutes of Tatiana\u2019s life.</p><p>He had been so close to safety. She watched the shell from the German plane fall on the ice and explode. She watched Alexander fly headfirst into the armored truck. When Alexander went down, Tatiana grabbed a box full of cylindrical plasma containers and her nurse\u2019s bag, jumped down from the back of the Red Cross truck, and ran down the embankment, caught near the ice by a corporal who yanked her down and yelled, \u201cWhat are you, crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a nurse,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to help the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019ll be a dead nurse. Stay down.\u201d</p><p>She stayed down for exactly two seconds. She saw Dr. Sayers hiding behind the armored vehicle that protected him and Alexander from direct fire. She saw him waving for help. She saw Alexander not getting up. Tatiana jumped up and ran out onto the ice before the corporal could utter a sound. She ran at first and then got scared by the crashing artillery shells and dropped onto her stomach, crawling the rest of the way. Alexander was motionless. His shredded white camouflage coat had an enlarging red stain on the right side of his back, surrounded by black ash. Tatiana crawled on her hands and knees to him and pushed the helmet away from his blood-covered head.</p><p>One look at Alexander\u2019s face told Tatiana he was about to die.</p><p>He was gray and flaxen. The ice underneath him was slippery from his blood. She was kneeling in it. Tatiana said, \u201cHypovolemic shock. Needs plasma.\u201d Dr. Sayers instantly agreed. While he was searching for a surgical instrument to cut open Alexander\u2019s sleeve, Tatiana took off her hat and pressed it hard into Alexander\u2019s side to slow his blood loss. Reaching down into his right boot, she pulled out his army knife and threw it to Dr. Sayers, saying, \u201cHere, use this.\u201d She didn\u2019t think she breathed once.</p><p>Sayers cut open Alexander\u2019s coat and his uniform to expose his left forearm, found a vein, and attached a syringe, a tube, and a plasma drip to him. When he left to get the stretcher and some help, Tatiana, by this time sitting on Alexander\u2019s wound, cut open his other sleeve, got out another bottle of plasma, another syringe, another catheter, and attached it to a vein on his right forearm. She adjusted the syringe so that it dripped the fluid into Alexander\u2019s body at sixty-nine drops a minute, the maximum possible. She sat on his back pressing into him as hard as she could, her white hat and her white coat saturated in his blood, waiting for the stretcher and muttering, \u201cCome on, soldier, come on.\u201d</p><p>By the time the doctor came back, her plasma bottle had emptied and Tatiana had attached another one. Taking off her stained coat, Tatiana laid it on the stretcher sideways, and when they lifted Alexander onto it, she wrapped her coat tightly around his wound. He was excruciatingly heavy to lift, because his clothes were wet. Dr. Sayers asked how they were going to carry him, and she replied that they were just going to pick him up on three and carry him, and he said incredulously, you are going to carry him? and she said without blinking, yes, I will carry him, NOW.</p><p>And afterward Tatiana struggled with the Soviet doctors, with the Soviet nurses, and even with Dr. Sayers, who had taken a look at Alexander\u2019s blood loss and the hole in his side and said, forget it. We can\u2019t do anything for him. Put him in the terminal ward. Give him a gram of morphine, but no more.</p><p>Tatiana hooked an IV to Alexander\u2019s vein herself and fed him morphine and fed him plasma. And when that wasn\u2019t enough, she gave Alexander her blood. And when that wasn\u2019t enough, and it looked as if nothing was going to be enough, she trickled blood from her arteries into his veins.</p><p>Drop by drop.</p><p>And as she sat by him, she whispered. All I want is for my spirit to be heard through your pain. I sit here with you, pouring my love into you, drop by drop, hoping you\u2019ll hear me, hoping you\u2019ll lift your head to me and smile again. Shura, can you hear me? Can you feel me sitting by you letting you know you\u2019re still alive? Can you feel my hand on your beating heart, my hand letting you know I believe in you, I believe in your eternal life, I believe you will live, live through this and grow wings to soar over death, and when you open your eyes again, I will be here. I will always be here, believing in you, hoping for you, loving you. I\u2019m right here. Feel me, Alexander. Feel me and live.</p><p>He lived.</p><p>Now as Tatiana lay under the Red Cross truck in the coming of the cold March dawn, she thought, did I save him so he could die on the ice without my arms to hold him, to hold his young, beautiful, war-ravaged body, the body that loved me with all its great might? Could my Alexander have fallen alone?</p><p>She would rather have buried him as she had buried her sister than live through this. Would rather have known she had given him peace than live through another starless second of this.</p><p>Tatiana could not endure another moment of herself. Not another moment. In one more instant there was going to be nothing left of her.</p><p>Dimly she heard Dr. Sayers moan. Tatiana blinked, blinked away Alexander, opened her eyes, and turned to Sayers. \u201cDoctor?\u201d He was semiconscious. The forest was still. The dawn was steel blue. Tatiana disentangled herself from him and crawled out from under the truck. Rubbing her face, she saw it was covered in blood. Her fingers touched a chunk of glass stuck in her cheek. She tried to pull it out, but it hurt too much. Grabbing it by one side, Tatiana wrenched it out, screaming.</p><p>It didn\u2019t hurt enough.</p><p>She continued to scream, her eviscerated cries echoing back to her through the barren woods. Her hands gripping her legs, her stomach, her chest, Tatiana knelt in the snow and screamed as the blood dripped from her face.</p><p>She lay down on the ground and pressed her bleeding cheek into the snow. It wasn\u2019t cold enough. It couldn\u2019t numb her enough.</p><p>There was nothing sharp in her mouth anymore, but her tongue was torn and swollen. Getting up, Tatiana sat in the snow, looking around. It was eerily quiet; the bleak, bare birches contrasted somberly with the white earth. No sound anymore, not an echo, not even of her, not a gray branch out of place. Deep in the marsh, close to the Gulf of Finland.</p><p>But things were out of place. The Red Cross truck was ruined. One NKVD man in his dark blue uniform lay to the right of her. Dimitri was on the ground within a meter of the truck. His eyes were still open, and his hand remained extended to Tatiana, as if by some providential miracle he expected to be delivered from his own eternity.</p><p>Tatiana stared for a moment into Dimitri\u2019s frozen face. How Alexander would enjoy the story of Dimitri\u2019s getting recognized by the NKVD. She looked away.</p><p>Alexander had been right \u2014 this was a good spot to get through the border. It was poorly manned and poorly defended. The NKVD troops were lightly armed; they had their rifles, and from what she could see they had one mortar, but one wasn\u2019t enough to keep them alive \u2014 the Finns had bigger shells. On the Finnish side of the border things were quiet, too. Despite the size of their shells, were they also all dead? Looking through the trees, Tatiana could see no movement. She was still on the Russian side. What to do? New NKVD reinforcements would no doubt be here soon, and she would quickly be whisked away for questioning, and then?</p><p>Tatiana felt her stomach through her coat. Her hands were freezing.</p><p>She crawled back under the Red Cross truck. \u201cDr. Sayers,\u201d she whispered, putting her hands on his neck. \u201cMatthew, can you hear me?\u201d He was not answering. He was in bad shape; his pulse was around forty, and his blood pressure felt weak through his carotid. Tatiana lay down by the doctor, and from his coat pocket she pulled out his U.S. passport and both their Red Cross travel documents. They plainly stated in English that one Matthew Sayers and one Jane Barrington were headed for Helsinki.</p><p>What should she do now? Should she go? Go where? And go how?</p><p>Climbing inside the cabin, she turned the ignition. Nothing. It was hopeless. Tatiana could see what extensive damage had been done by the gunfire to the front end. She peered through the woods across the Finnish side. Was anyone moving? No. She saw human forms on the snow and behind them a Finnish army truck, a little bigger than their Red Cross one. That wasn\u2019t the only difference between them: the Finnish truck didn\u2019t look ruined.</p><p>Tatiana hopped out and said to Dr. Sayers, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d she said, and walked across the Soviet-Finnish border. It felt about the same, she thought, being in Finland as being in the Soviet Union. Tatiana walked carefully among the half dozen dead Finns. In the truck sat another man, dead behind the wheel, his body keeled forward. To get inside she would have to pull him out.</p><p>To get inside she heaved him out, and he fell with a thud onto the trampled snow. Climbing in, Tatiana tried the key, still in the ignition. The truck had stalled. She put it in neutral and tried to start it again. It was dead. She tried again. Nothing. She looked at the gauge on the gas tank. It said full. Jumping down, she went to the back of the truck and climbed under to see if the gas tank was punctured. No, it was intact. Tatiana went around the nose of the truck and opened the hood. For a minute she stared, unfocused, but then something came to her. It was a diesel engine. How would she know that?</p><p>Kirov.</p><p>The word Kirov sent a long shudder through her body, and she fought off the impulse to lie down in the snow again. This was a diesel engine, and she used to make diesel engines for tanks in the Kirov factory. \u201cI made you a whole tank today, Alexander!\u201d What did she remember about them?</p><p>Nothing. Between the diesel engines and the woods in Finland so much had happened that she could barely remember the number of the tram she took to get home.</p><p>One.</p><p>It was tram Number 1. They would take it part of the way home so they could walk the rest down the Obvodnoy Canal. Walk, talking about war and America, their arms bumping into one another.</p><p>Diesel engine.</p><p>She was cold. She pulled the hat down over her ears.</p><p>Cold. Diesel engines had trouble starting in the cold. She checked to see how many cylinders it had. This one had six. Six pistons, six combustion chambers. The combustion chambers were too cold; the air just couldn\u2019t get hot enough to cause the fuel to ignite. Where was that little glowworm Tatiana used to screw in on the side of the combustion chamber?</p><p>Tatiana found all six glowworms. She needed to heat them up a little so the air could get warm enough during compression. Otherwise the engine was drawing below-zero air into the cylinders and expecting it to warm up to 540\u00b0C in the one-up-one-down motion of the pistons.</p><p>Tatiana looked about her. Five dead soldiers lay in the vicinity. She stuck her hand into the small pocket of one of their rucksacks and pulled out a lighter. Alexander had always kept his lighter in the small pocket of his rucksack, too. She used to fetch it to light his cigarettes for him. Flicking the lighter on, she held the small flame to the first glow plug for a few seconds. Then to the second one. Then to the third. By the time she got through all six, the first one was as cold as before she had started. Tatiana had had quite enough. Gritting her teeth and groaning, she broke a low branch off a birch and tried to light it. The branch was too wet from the snow. It wouldn\u2019t light.</p><p>She looked around in frantic desperation. She knew exactly what she was searching for. She found it behind the truck in a small case on the body of one of the Finns. He was wearing a flamethrower. Tatiana yanked the flamethrower off the dead Finn, her jaw set and her face dark, and strapped it to her back like Alexander\u2019s rucksack. Holding the propellant hose firmly in her left hand, she pulled out the ignition plug in the tank, flicked the lighter on, and pressed it to the ignition.</p><p>Half a second passed and all was still, and then a white nitrate flame burst out of the hose, the recoil nearly knocking Tatiana backward onto the snow. Nearly. She remained standing.</p><p>She walked up to the open hood of the truck and pointed the flame over the engine for a few moments. Then a few more moments. She could have stood there for thirty seconds, she couldn\u2019t tell. Finally with her right hand she popped the ignition lever down, and the handheld fire shut off. Flinging the flamethrower off her back, Tatiana climbed into the truck, turned the key, and the engine creaked once and revved into life. She started the truck in neutral, depressed the clutch, put the transmission into first gear, and stepped on the accelerator. The truck lurched forward. She drove slowly across the defense line to pick up Dr. Sayers.</p><p>To get Sayers inside the Finnish truck required more out of her than she had.</p><p>But not much more.</p><p>After she got him in, Tatiana\u2019s eyes caught the Red Cross flag on Sayers\u2019s truck.</p><p>She found Dimitri\u2019s army knife in his boot. Walking over to the truck, Tatiana reached up and carefully cut out the Red Cross badge. How she was going to attach it to the tarpaulin on the Finnish truck, she had no idea. She heard Dr. Sayers moan in the back and then remembered the first aid kit. With mindless determination she got the kit, along with a plasma bottle. Cutting away the doctor\u2019s coat and shirt, she attached the plasma bottle to his vein, and while the plasma was draining, she looked over his inflamed wound, which was red around the entry hole and unclean. The doctor was hot and delirious. She cleaned the wound with some diluted iodine and covered it with gauze. Then with grim satisfaction she poured iodine onto her cheek and sat pressing a bandage to her face for a few minutes. It felt as if the glass were still inside her skin. She wished she had some undiluted iodine and wondered if the cut would need stitches. She thought it would.</p><p>Stitches.</p><p>Tatiana remembered the suture needle in the first aid kit.</p><p>Her eyes clearing, Tatiana took the suture needle and suture thread, jumped down, and, standing on tiptoe, carefully sewed the large Red Cross symbol into the brown canvas of the Finnish truck. The thin thread broke several times. It didn\u2019t matter. It just had to hold until Helsinki.</p><p>After she was done, Tatiana got behind the wheel, turned to the back, said into the small window, \u201cReady?\u201d to Dr. Sayers, and then drove the truck out of the Soviet Union, leaving Dimitri dead on the ground. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tatiana drove down the marshy wooded path, carefully and uncertainly, with both hands clutching the big wheel and her feet barely reaching the three pedals. Finding the road that stretched along the Gulf of Finland from Lisiy Nos to Vyborg was easy. There was only one road. All she had to do was head west. And west she could find by the location of the gloomy, barely interested March sun.</p><p>In Vyborg she showed her Red Cross credentials to a sentry and asked for fuel and directions to Helsinki. She thought he asked her about her face, pointing to it, but since she didn\u2019t speak Finnish, she didn\u2019t answer and drove on, this time on a wide paved road, stopping at eight sentry points to show her documents and the wounded doctor in the back. She drove for four hours until she reached Helsinki, Finland, in late afternoon.</p><p>The first thing she saw was the lit-up Church of St. Nicholas, up on a hill overlooking the harbor. She stopped to ask directions to \u201cHelsingin Yliopistollinen Keskussairaala,\u201d the Helsinki University Hospital. She knew how to say it in Finnish, she just couldn\u2019t understand the directions in Finnish. After she\u2019d made five stops for directions, finally someone spoke enough English to tell her the hospital was behind the lit-up church. She could find that.</p><p>Dr. Sayers was well known and loved at the hospital where he had worked since the war of 1940. The nurses brought a stretcher for him and asked Tatiana all sorts of questions she did not understand: most of them in English, some in Finnish, none in Russian.</p> <p>At the hospital she met another American Red Cross doctor, Sam Leavitt, who took one look at the gash in her face and said she needed stitches. He offered her a local anesthetic. Tatiana refused. \u201cSuture away, Doctor,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need about ten stitches,\u201d the doctor said.</p><p>\u201cOnly ten?\u201d</p><p>He stitched her cheek as she sat mutely and motionlessly on a hospital bed. Afterward he offered her some antibiotic, some painkiller, and some food. She took the antibiotic. She did not eat the food, showing Leavitt her swollen and bloody tongue. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTomorrow it will be better. Tomorrow I will eat.\u201d</p><p>The nurses brought her not only a new, clean, oversize uniform that hid her stomach but also warm stockings and a flannel undershirt, and they even offered to launder her old, soiled clothes. Tatiana gave them the uniform and her woolen coat but kept her Red Cross armband.</p> <p>Later Tatiana lay on the floor by Dr. Sayers\u2019s bed. The night nurse finally came in and asked her to go and sleep in another room, lifting her and leading her out. Tatiana allowed herself to be led out, but as soon as the nurse went down the hall to her station, Tatiana returned to Dr. Sayers.</p><p>In the morning he was worse and she was better. She got her old uniform back, starched and white, and managed to eat a bit of food. She remained all day with Dr. Sayers, staring out the window to the patch of the iced-over Gulf of Finland she could see past the stone buildings and the bare trees. Dr. Leavitt came in the late afternoon to check on her face and to ask her if she wanted to go and lie down. She refused. \u201cWhy are you sitting here? Why don\u2019t you go get some rest yourself?\u201d</p><p>Turning her head to Matthew Sayers, Tatiana didn\u2019t reply, thinking, because that\u2019s what I do \u2014 then, now. I sit by the dying.</p><p>At night Sayers was worse still. He had a high fever of nearly 42\u00b0C, and was parched and sweaty. The antibiotics weren\u2019t helping him. Tatiana didn\u2019t understand what was happening to him. All she wanted was for him to regain consciousness. She fell asleep in the chair next to his bed, her head near him.</p><p>In the middle of the night she woke up, feeling suddenly that Dr. Sayers wasn\u2019t going to make it. His breathing \u2014 it was too familiar to her by now, the last gasping rattles of a dying man. Tatiana took his hand and held it. She placed her hand on his head, and with her broken tongue whispered to him in Russian, in English, about America and about all the things he would see when he got better. He opened his eyes and said in a weak voice that he was cold. She went and got him another blanket. He squeezed her hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Tania,\u201d he whispered, rapidly breathing through his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said inaudibly. Then louder, \u201cDr. Sayers,\u201d she said. \u201cMatthew . . .\u201d She tried to keep her voice from cracking. \u201cI beg you \u2014 please tell me what happened to my husband. Did Dimitri betray him? Was he arrested? We\u2019re in Helsinki. We\u2019re out of the Soviet Union. I\u2019m not going back. I want so little for myself.\u201d She bent her head into his arm. \u201cI just want a little comfort,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cGo to . . . America, Tania.\u201d His voice was fading. \u201cThat will be his comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComfort me with the truth. Did you really see him in the lake?\u201d</p><p>The doctor stared at her for a long moment with an expression that looked to Tatiana to be one of understanding and disbelief, and then he closed his eyes. Tatiana felt his hand trembling in hers, heard his breath sputtering in his chest. Soon it stopped.</p><p>Tatiana didn\u2019t let go of his hand until morning.</p><p>A nurse came in and gently led Tatiana away, and in the hall she put her arms around Tatiana and said, in English, \u201cHoney, you can do your very best for people, and they still die. We\u2019re at war. You can\u2019t save everybody, you know.\u201d</p><p>Sam Leavitt approached her in the hall on the way to his rounds, asking her what she intended to do. Tatiana said she needed to get back to America. Leavitt stared at her and said, \u201cBack to America?\u201d Leaning toward her, he said, \u201cListen, I don\u2019t know where Matthew found you, your English is pretty good, but it\u2019s not that good. Are you really an American?\u201d</p><p>Paling, Tatiana nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your passport? Can\u2019t get back without a passport.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him mutely.</p><p>\u201cBesides, it\u2019s too dangerous now. The Germans bomb the Baltic mercilessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShips go down all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here till April, work until the ice melts? Your face has to heal. The stitches need to come out. And we could use another pair of hands. Stay in Helsinki.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to stay here anyway until we get you a new passport. Do you want me to take you to Senate Square later? I\u2019ll take you to the U.S. consulate. It\u2019ll take them at least a month to issue you new documents. By that time the ice will have melted. Getting to America is hard these days.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana knew that the U.S. State Department, digging around to find a Jane Barrington, would discover only that she was not Jane Barrington. Alexander told her they could not stay a second in Helsinki \u2014 the NKVD had a long arm. Alexander said that they had to get to Stockholm. Shaking her head, Tatiana backed away from the doctor.</p><p>She left the hospital, carrying her backpack, her nurse\u2019s bag, her Jane Barrington travel documents. She walked to the semicircular south harbor in Helsinki and sat on the bench, watching the vendors at Market Square pack up their carts and their tables and sweep the square clean.</p><p>Calm descended again.</p><p>The seagulls screeched overhead.</p><p>Tatiana sat on the bench and waited interminable hours until night fell, and then she got up and walked past a narrow street leading up to the gleaming Church of St. Nicholas. She barely glanced at it.</p><p>In the dark she meandered up and down the harbor until she spotted trucks with the blue-and-white Swedish flag, loading small amounts of lumber lying in piles on the ground. There was quite a bit of activity in the harbor. Tatiana could see that night was the time for the supplies to get across the Baltic. She knew that the trucks did not travel by day, when it was easy to spot them. Though the Germans generally did not bomb neutral trade vessels, sometimes they did. Sweden had finally started sending all its shipping and trucking trade with protective convoys. Alexander told her that.</p><p>Tatiana knew that the trucks were headed for Stockholm because one of the men said the word \u201cStokgolm,\u201d which sounded like \u201cStockholm\u201d in Russian.</p><p>She stood at the edge of the harbor watching the lumber being loaded onto the back of an open truck. Was she scared? No. Not anymore. She approached the truck driver, showing him her Red Cross badge, and said in English that she was a nurse trying to get to Stockholm and could he please take her across the Gulf of Bothnia with him for a hundred American dollars. He didn\u2019t understand a word of what she had said. She showed him a hundred-dollar bill and said, \u201cStokgolm?\u201d Gladly taking the money from her hands, he let her ride with him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak any English or Russian, so they barely talked, which was fine with Tatiana. On the way through the white-out darkness, illuminated by the convoy\u2019s headlights and by the gleaming northern lights above her head, she remembered that the first time she kissed Alexander when they were in the woods in Luga, she was really afraid that he was going to know immediately that she had never been kissed before, and she thought, if he asks me, I\u2019m going to lie, because I don\u2019t want him to think less of me. She thought that for the first second or two, and then she couldn\u2019t think about anything, because his lips were so abundantly passionate for her, because in her hunger to kiss him back she had forgotten her inexperience.</p><p>Thinking about the first time they kissed took up much of the trip. Then Tatiana slept.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long the journey took. The last few hours, they meandered on the ice through the small islands preceding Stockholm.</p><p>\u201cTack,\u201d she said to the driver when they stopped at the harbor. \u201cTack sa mycket.\u201d Alexander taught her that, how to say thank you in Swedish. Tatiana walked across the ice, careful not to slip, walked up granite steps and was out on the cobbled seaside promenade. I\u2019m in Stockholm, she thought. I\u2019m nearly free. Slowly she meandered through the half-empty streets. It was morning \u2014 too early for the stores to be open. What day was it? She did not know. Near the industrial docks Tatiana found a small open bakery, and on its shelves there was white bread. She showed the woman her American money. The shop owner shook her head and said something in Swedish. \u201cBank,\u201d she said. \u201cPengar, dollars.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana turned to go. The woman called after her, but in a strident voice, and Tatiana, afraid the woman suspected she didn\u2019t belong in Sweden, did not turn around. She was already on the street when the woman ran around to stop her, giving her a loaf of warm crusty white bread, the likes of which Tatiana had never smelled, and a paper cup of black coffee. \u201cTack,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cTack sa mycket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVarsagod,\u201d said the woman, shaking her head at the money Tatiana was offering her.</p><p>Tatiana sat on the bench at the docks overlooking the crescent of the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia and ate the whole loaf of bread and had her coffee. She stared unblinkingly into the blue dawn in front of her. Somewhere east of the ice lay besieged Leningrad. And somewhere east of that was Lazarevo. And in between was the Second World War and Comrade Stalin.</p><p>After eating, she walked around the streets long enough to find an open bank, where she exchanged some of her American money. Armed with a few kronor, Tatiana bought some more white bread and then found a place that sold cheese \u2014 in fact, all different kinds of cheeses \u2014 but even better, she found a caf\u00e9 near the harbor that served her breakfast, and not just oatmeal, and not just eggs, and not just bread, but bacon! She bought three helpings of bacon and decided that from now on that was all she was going to have for breakfast.</p><p>The day was still long. Tatiana didn\u2019t know where to go to sleep. Alexander told her that in Stockholm there would be hotels that would rent them a room without asking for their passports. Just like in Poland. She found that beyond belief then. But Alexander, of course, was right.</p><p>Not only did Tatiana rent a hotel room, not only did she get a key to a room that was warm, that had a bed and a view of the harbor, but it had its own bathroom and in the bathroom was the thing that Alexander had told her about, the shower thing that poured water on her from above. She must have stayed under the hot stream for an hour.</p><p>And then she slept for twenty-four.</p><p>It took Tatiana over two months to leave Stockholm.</p><p>Seventy-six days of sitting on the pier bench looking east past the gulf, past Finland, to the Soviet Union, while the seagulls cried overhead.</p><p>Seventy-six days of\u2014</p><p>She and Alexander had planned to stay in Stockholm in the spring while waiting for his documents to come through from the U.S. State Department. They would have celebrated his twenty-fourth birthday in Stockholm on May 29.</p><p>Austere Stockholm was softened by spring. Tatiana bought yellow tulips and ate fresh fruit right from the market vendors, and she had meat \u2014 smoked hams and pork and sausages. She had ice cream. Her face healed. Her stomach grew. She thought of remaining in Stockholm, of finding a hospital to work in, of having her baby in Sweden. She liked the tulips and the hot shower.</p><p>But the seagulls wept overhead.</p><p>Tatiana never did go to Riddarholm Church, Sweden\u2019s Temple of Fame.</p><p>Finally she took a train across the country to G?teborg, where she easily slipped into one of the holds on a Swedish trade cargo vessel bound for Harwich, England, carrying paper products. As during her passage from Finland to Sweden, she and her vessel were surrounded by a heavily armed convoy. Since Norway was German-occupied, there were quite a few incidents of bombings and sinkings in the North Sea. Noncombatant Sweden wasn\u2019t having any of it, and neither was Tatiana.</p><p>All was quiet as she crossed the North Sea and docked in Harwich. To get to Liverpool, Tatiana took a train, which had the most comfortable seats. Out of curiosity she bought herself a first-class ticket. The pillows were white. This would have been a good train to take to Lazarevo after burying Dasha, thought Tatiana.</p><p>She spent two weeks in dank and industrial Liverpool, until she found out that a shipping company called the White Star sailed once a month to New York, but she needed a visa to get on board. She bought a second-class ticket and appeared on the gangplank. When a young midshipman asked for her papers, Tatiana showed him her Red Cross travel document from the Soviet Union. He said it was no good; she needed a visa. Tatiana said she didn\u2019t have one. He said she needed a passport. She said she didn\u2019t have one. He laughed and said, \u201cWell then, dearie, you\u2019re not getting on this boat.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana said, \u201cI do not have visa, I do not have passport, but what I do have is five hundred dollars I would like you to have if you let me pass.\u201d She coughed. She knew that five hundred dollars was a year\u2019s salary for the sailor.</p><p>The midshipman instantly took the money and led her into a small room below sea level, where Tatiana climbed onto the top bunk. Alexander told her he slept on the top bunk at the Leningrad garrison. She wasn\u2019t feeling well. She was wearing the larger of her two white uniforms, the one she had been given in Helsinki. Her original one had long stopped fitting her, and even this one did not button well around her stomach.</p><p>In Stockholm, Tatiana had found a place to wash her uniforms called the tvatteri, where there were things called tvatt maskins and tork tumlares that she put money into, and thirty minutes later the clothes came out clean, and thirty minutes later the clothes came out dry, and there was no standing in cold water, no washboards, no soaping. She didn\u2019t have to do anything but sit and watch the machine.</p><p>As Tatiana sat and watched the machine, she remembered the last time she and Alexander made love. He was leaving at six in the evening, and they finished making love about five fifty-five. He had just enough time to put on his clothes, kiss her, and bolt out the door. When they made love, he had been on top of her. She watched his face the whole time, holding on to his neck and crying and pleading with him not to end, because when he ended he would have to leave. Love. How did they say it in Swedish?</p><p>K?rlek.</p><p>Jag ?lskar dig, Alexander.</p><p>As the tork tumlare twirled her Red Cross uniform and stockings, Tatiana was so grateful that the last time she and Alexander made love, she saw his face.</p><p>The trip across to New York took ten nauseating, spluttering days. When she arrived, it was the end of June. Tatiana had turned nineteen years old on the White Star line in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>On the boat Tatiana coughed and thought about Orbeli.</p><p>\u201cTatiasha \u2014 remember Orbeli\u2014\u201d</p><p>Coughing up blood, Tatiana summoned her sinking strength and the foundering energy of her heart to ask herself \u2014 if Alexander knew he was going to be arrested and couldn\u2019t tell her because he knew she would never go without him, would he have gritted his teeth and set his jaw and lied?</p><p>Yes. Everything she knew about Alexander told her that would be exactly what he would do. If he knew the truth, he would give her one word.</p><p>Orbeli.</p><p>Her chest hurt so much it felt as if it were about to tear apart her breastbone.</p><p>When the White Star line docked in the Port of New York, Tatiana could not get up. Not that she wouldn\u2019t. She just couldn\u2019t. Delirious after a passage of violent coughing, she felt as if something inside her were leaking out.</p><p>Soon she heard voices, and two men came into the room, both of them dressed in white.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, what do we have here?\u201d said the shorter man. \u201cNot another refugee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, this one is wearing a Red Cross uniform,\u201d said the taller man.</p><p>\u201cShe obviously stole it somewhere. Look, it barely buttons over her stomach. It\u2019s obviously not hers. Edward, let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll report her to the INS later. We\u2019ve got to empty this ship.\u201d</p><p>Tatiana moaned. The men came back. The taller man looked her over. \u201cChris, I think she\u2019s going to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat \u2014 now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d The doctor felt for something underneath her. \u201cHer water may have broken.\u201d</p><p>Chris came up to Tatiana and put his hand on her head. \u201cFeel her. She\u2019s burning up. Listen to her breathing. I don\u2019t even need a stethoscope. She\u2019s got TB. God, how many of these cases can we see? Forget it. We still have all the cabins to go through. She\u2019s our first. I guarantee she won\u2019t be the last.\u201d</p><p>Edward kept his hand on Tatiana\u2019s stomach. \u201cShe\u2019s very sick,\u201d he said. \u201cMiss,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you speak English?\u201d</p><p>When Tatiana didn\u2019t answer, Chris exclaimed, \u201cYou see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she has papers? Miss, do you have any papers?\u201d</p><p>When Tatiana didn\u2019t answer, Chris said, \u201cI\u2019m done. I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Edward said, \u201cChris, she\u2019s sick, and she\u2019s about to have a baby. What do you want to do, leave her?\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhat kind of a damn doctor are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tired and underpaid one, that\u2019s what kind. PHD doesn\u2019t pay me enough to care. Where are we going to take her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s bring her to the quarantine hospital on Ellis Island Three. There\u2019s room. She\u2019ll get better there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith TB?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s TB, not cancer. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward, she\u2019s a refugee! Where is she from? Look at her. If she were just sick, I\u2019d say all right, but you know she\u2019s going to have the kid on American soil, and bam! She\u2019s entitled to stay here like the rest of us. Forget it. Deliver her baby on the boat, so that she\u2019s got no claims on U.S. soil, and then put her in Ellis. As soon as she\u2019s better, she\u2019ll be deported. That\u2019s fair. All these folks think they can come into America without permission . . . well, no more. Look how many we\u2019ve got. Once this damn war is over, it\u2019s going to get even worse. The entire European continent is going to want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to want to what, Chris Pandolfi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, easy for you to judge, Edward Ludlow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here since the FrenchIndian wars. I\u2019m not judging.\u201d</p><p>Chris waved Edward off and left. Then, sticking his head back into the room, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll come back for her. She\u2019s not ready to have a kid now. Look how still she is. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Edward was about to walk away when Tatiana groaned slightly. He came back and stood by her face. \u201cMiss?\u201d he said. \u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>Lifting her hand, Tatiana found Edward\u2019s face and placed her palm on his cheek. \u201cHelp me,\u201d she said in English. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a baby. Help me, please.\u201d</p><p>Edward Ludlow found a stretcher for Tatiana and fetched a reluctant and grumpy Chris Pandolfi to help him carry her down the plank and onto the ferry that took her to Ellis Island in the middle of New York Harbor. Years after the heyday of Ellis, the island\u2019s hospital had been serving as a detention center and quarantine for immigrants and refugees coming to the United States.</p><p>Tatiana\u2019s eyes were so clouded she felt half blind, but even through her haze and the ferry\u2019s unwashed windows she could see the valiant hand offering a flame up to the sunlit heaven, lifting her lamp beside the golden door.</p><p>Tatiana closed her eyes.</p><p>At Ellis she was carried to a small, spartan room, where Edward laid her on a bed with starched white sheets and got a nurse to undress her. After examining her, he looked at Tatiana with surprise, and said, \u201cYour baby has crowned. Do you not feel that?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana barely moved, barely breathed. Once the baby\u2019s head came out, she convulsed, gritting her teeth through palpitations that felt like distant pain.</p><p>Edward delivered her baby for her.</p><p>\u201cMiss, can you hear me? Please, look. Look what you have. A beautiful boy!\u201d The doctor smiled, bringing the baby close.</p><p>\u201cLook. He\u2019s a big one, too \u2014 I\u2019m surprised you could get a baby this size out of little you. Brenda, look at this. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Brenda wrapped the baby in a small white blanket and laid him next to Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s early,\u201d mouthed Tatiana, staring at her baby. She placed her hand on him.</p><p>\u201cEarly?\u201d Edward laughed. \u201cNo, I\u2019d say he was right on time. If he were any later, you\u2019d be having him back in \u2014 where are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Soviet Union,\u201d Tatiana said indistinctly.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. The Soviet Union. How did you ever get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would not believe it if I told you,\u201d said Tatiana, lying on her side, shutting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, forget all that now,\u201d Edward said brightly. \u201cAs it is, your boy is a U.S. citizen.\u201d He sat by the chair near her bed. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, right? It\u2019s what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>Tatiana suppressed a groan. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, pressing her swaddled son to her feverish face. \u201cIt is what I wanted.\u201d It was hurting her to breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got TB. It hurts right now, but you\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he said gently. \u201cEverything you\u2019ve been through, it\u2019s all behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d whispered Tatiana.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s good!\u201d the doctor exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay here at Ellis, get better \u2014 Where did you get a Red Cross uniform? Were you a nurse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cYou see? You have a valuable skill. You\u2019ll be able to get a job. You speak a little English, which is more than I can say for most people who come through here. It\u2019ll separate you from the chaff. Trust me.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do very well. Now, can I get you something to eat? We have sandwiches with turkey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think you\u2019ll like turkey. And cheese. I\u2019ll bring it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a good doctor,\u201d Tatiana said. \u201cEdward Ludlow, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dr. Ludlow to you!\u201d Brenda, the nurse, exclaimed loudly.</p><p>\u201cNurse! Let her call me Edward if she wants. What do you care?\u201d</p><p>Huffing, Brenda left, and Edward took a small towel and wiped Tatiana\u2019s tears. \u201cI know you must be sad. It is frightening. But I have a good feeling about you. Everything is going to be just fine.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Through her grieving green eyes, Tatiana looked at the doctor and said, \u201cYou Americans do like to promise.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Edward said, \u201cYes, and we always keep our word. Now, let me get our Public Heath Department administrative nurse for you. If Vikki is a little grouchy, don\u2019t worry. She\u2019s having a bad day, but she\u2019s got a good heart. She\u2019ll bring you the birth certificate papers.\u201d Edward stared at the boy warmly. \u201cHe\u2019s a cute one. Look, he\u2019s got a full head of hair. A miracle, isn\u2019t it? Have you thought about a name for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Tatiana, weeping into her baby\u2019s black hair. \u201cHe is going to have his father\u2019s name. Anthony Alexander Barrington.\u201d</p><p>Soldier! Let me cradle your head and caress your face, let me kiss your dear sweet lips and cry across the seas and whisper through the icy Russian grass how I feel for you . . . Luga, Ladoga, Leningrad, Lazarevo . . . Alexander, once you carried me, and now I carry you. Into my eternity, now I carry you.</p><p>Through Finland, through Sweden, to America, hand outstretched, I stand and limp forward, the galloping steed black and riderless in my wake. Your heart, your rifle, they will comfort me, they\u2019ll be my cradle and my grave.</p><p>Lazarevo drips you into my soul, dawn drop by moonlight drop from the river Kama. When you look for me, look for me there, because that\u2019s where I will be all the days of my life.</p><p>\u201cShura, I can\u2019t bear the thought of you dying,\u201d Tatiana said to him when they were lying on the blanket, having made love by the fire in the dewy morning. \u201cI can\u2019t bear the thought of you not breathing in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy about the thought of that myself.\u201d Alexander grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not going to die. You said so yourself. You said I was meant for great things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are meant for great things,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut you better keep yourself alive for me, soldier, because I can\u2019t continue to live without you.\u201d That\u2019s what she said, looking up into his face, her hands on his beating heart.</p><p>He bent down and kissed her freckles. \u201cYou can\u2019t continue? My cartwheeling queen of Lake Ilmen?\u201d Smiling, he shook his head. \u201cYou will find a way to live without me. You will find a way to live for both of us,\u201d Alexander said to Tatiana as the swelling Kama River flowed from the Ural Mountains through a pine village named Lazarevo, once when they were in love, and young. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>LEV AND MARIA\u2019S STORY</p><p>Paullina Simons\u2019s Tribute to Her Grandparents, Survivors of Russia\u2019s Terrible Twentieth Century</p><p>My grandparents, Lev and Maria Handler, met in a factory in Leningrad when he was twenty-five and she was twenty-one. Maria was an assembly line worker and Lev was an engineer and designer of engines. They went together for two years before they married in 1934. My father, Yuri, was born in 1936, my uncle, Alex, in 1938. They lived in Leningrad on a street called Fifth Soviet, in the two rooms in a communal apartment that I use as a setting for The Bronze Horseman. There were six of them before World War II began: my grandparents, my father and his brother, and my grandfather\u2019s parents.</p><p>My grandmother was one of the very few Soviet women at that time who did not work outside the home. My grandfather did not want an exhausted wife coming home late, and so she stayed home and took care of him, his parents, and her children. She was very happy with that arrangement, \u201cBecause it pleased your grandfather.\u201d</p> <p>In August of 1941, my grandmother with her boys, ages five and two, and her in-laws, rode one of the last trains out of Leningrad. They were evacuated to a small village 1500 miles away in Saratov County on the Volga, a hundred miles north of Stalingrad. My grandfather, a skilled and essential worker, remained in Leningrad. His factory was quickly retrofitted to manufacture airplanes, and he was assigned to design and repair their engines.</p><p>During the evacuation, my grandmother became separated from her children and her in-laws \u2014 she was aboard one boat on the Volga while they traveled on another. She had all the money (though not for long: she would be robbed during the night) and her in-laws had the documents, the luggage, and the kids. It was several days before they were all reunited at their designated evacuation post, but now they were broke and would remain penniless until my grandfather\u2019s paycheck finally reached the village where they would live out the war.</p><p>My grandmother\u2019s mother, Dusia, had stayed behind in Leningrad to be with her partner of thirty years, Mikhail; but only a few weeks after the evacuation he would be dead of tuberculosis. Dusia then moved in to the Fifth Soviet apartment with my grandfather. They lived there during that first terrible winter of the German blockade when half a million Soviet civilians perished from famine and pestilence. My grandfather says that he only survived because of Dusia\u2019s daily excursions across the frozen Neva River to barter with her farmer friends, trading personal items for potatoes.</p><p>Believing, however, that he would not make it through another winter in a blockaded city, my grandfather joined the Red Army in the summer of 1942. His talent for repairing all types of engines was much in demand and he became a decorated lieutenant. Dusia remained in Leningrad for the remainder of the war, ever the survivor \u2014 until cancer of the stomach claimed her in 1977 at the age of eighty-three.</p><p>My grandfather\u2019s father, Wolf Lazarevich, was a professor of mathematics. He died of pneumonia in September of 1943 at the age of sixty-one. During his short time in evacuation, Wolf taught mathematics to the villagers and was so beloved that when he died they gave him a funeral procession \u2014 carrying his body above their heads through the village \u2014 and a Christian burial (although he was a Jew). My grandfather\u2019s lifelong regret is that he never again saw his father after the day he put him on the evacuation train in 1941. Wolf was already dead by the time his son was finally granted a ten-day furlough to visit his family in their village. To this day, my grandfather grieves for his father and loves him deeply.</p> <p>After the war was over, my grandparents and my father and uncle lived in Moscow with relatives while Leningrad was being rebuilt. They came back to Fifth Soviet in the late 1940s and continued to live there until 1963. Both my widowed great-grandmothers lived in the rooms with them. My grandfather\u2019s mother died in 1953 of heart failure. In 1962, my father, twenty-six, met my mother, twenty-two, and married her two months later (despite the inconvenience of a prior wedding engagement). My parents continued to live separately after their wedding because there was no room for my mother in my grandparents\u2019 rooms.</p><p>It was when my mother became pregnant with me (I don\u2019t know how!) that life slightly improved. My grandparents, after spending years on a waiting list, were finally given a small one-bedroom apartment of their own into which they took my great-grandmother. And so my mother, my father, and I, remained in one room on Fifth Soviet while my uncle, my aunt, and their baby lived in the other.</p><p>My parents and I left the Soviet Union for America in 1973 and my uncle and his new family soon followed. My grandparents, now retired, missed their children and grandchildren terribly. So in 1979 they accepted my father\u2019s invitation to come and live with us in the United States. My grandfather, then seventy-two, arrived at JFK carrying his prized Soviet fishing rod \u2014 because he didn\u2019t think they could make fishing rods like that in America.</p><p>They lived with my parents in their house for five years, and then on their own in Maine for ten. For the last six they have been back on their own in my father\u2019s house. My parents and my uncle are in North Carolina. In July of 2001, Lev and Maria will have been married for nearly sixty-seven years \u2014 though my grandmother, coyly batting her eyelashes, likes to say that they\u2019ve been \u201ctogether for sixty-nine.\u201d He will be ninety-four in July and she is turning ninety in August. He says, \u201cYour grandmother may not be the most beautiful woman in the world but she is the most dear.\u201d</p><p>My grandfather still digs his garden in the spring and plants tomatoes and cucumbers though his back is beginning to bother him; my grandmother still bakes and cooks all their dinners herself though she complains of arthritis. They argue and fight as if they were seventeen and spend every minute of every day together. After watching them go at each other for a while, my father once asked, \u201cHas there been one day in your marriage when you two have not argued?\u201d And my grandfather replied, \u201cYes, but that was a wasted day.\u201d</p><p>They read constantly, avidly follow current events, are hockey fanatics, watch American movies though they don\u2019t speak English, and really enjoy Mexican soap operas translated into Russian (apparently they\u2019re even better in translation). My grandfather has two satellite dishes so he can catch Russian programming on one and movies on the other.</p> <p>My grandmother says, \u201cWe can\u2019t die; everything in life is still so fascinating.\u201d</p><p>My grandfather says, \u201cI won\u2019t die until after I get your translated Bronze Horseman into my hands, Paullina. As soon as I finish reading it, then I can die.\u201d</p><p>April 2001</p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p><p>PAULLINA SIMONS was born and raised in Leningrad and immigrated to the United States with her family in the 1970s.
