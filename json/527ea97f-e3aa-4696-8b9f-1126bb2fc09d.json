You can\u2019t expect me to believe this crap!\u201d</p><p>Phineas McKinney frowned at his younger brother, who was clutching the steering wheel with white-knuckled desperation. Obviously, last night\u2019s confession had not gone as well as he had thought. \u201cFreemont, you gotta know I would never lie to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that!\u201d Freemont shot him a frantic look, then turned the windshield wipers up to a higher speed to combat the rain that pelted his thirteen-year-old, dented Chevy Impala. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t leave me with a lot of options, you know? First I thought you\u2019d gone crazy. Then I thought you must be doing drugs. Then when I tried to talk to you this afternoon, I thought you were dead! I mean, seriously, start-the-damned-funeral dead!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy,\u201d Phineas muttered. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t do drugs.\u201d</p><p>The atmosphere in the car sizzled with tension, interrupted only by the noise of the wipers swishing back and forth. A wet, slushy sound, followed by a high-pitched, prolonged screech reminiscent of fingernails on a blackboard.</p><p>Phineas winced. There were times when having supersensitive hearing was not an advantage.</p><p>Freemont gave him a wary look. \u201cWhat\u2014what about that last part? The . . . dead part?\u201d</p><p>Slush-screech. Slush-screech.</p> <p>Freemont gulped audibly. \u201cYou weren\u2019t really dead, were you?\u201d</p><p>Slush-screech. Slush-screech.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alive now,\u201d Phineas said quietly, then gave his brother a reassuring smile. \u201cDon\u2019t I look alive to you?\u201d</p><p>Freemont didn\u2019t look reassured. His eyes had grown so wide, the whites gleamed as his gaze darted back and forth from his brother to the busy street in the Bronx. \u201cYou\u2019re alive now? What the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means my heart is beating. I\u2019m breathing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t breathing this afternoon! You scared the shit out of me! I almost called Aunt Ruth\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you not to.\u201d Phineas didn\u2019t want his aunt and sister to know the truth. Aunt Ruth would probably drag him into church and insist the Reverend Washington perform an exorcism on him. Luckily, the female members of his family were out of town this weekend, singing with the choir at some event in Buffalo.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do! I thought about calling an ambulance, but\u2014\u201d Freemont stomped on the brakes, tires spinning on the wet cement before the Impala halted with a lurch. He slammed a fist on the horn, and the blaring noise made Phineas grit his teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you stopping for, asshole?\u201d Freemont hollered at the car in front of them.</p><p>\u201cPeople usually stop for red lights. You should try it sometime.\u201d Phineas\u2019s attempt at a joke fell flat. His brother was still looking at him like he\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cI have excellent night vision, you know. You want me to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Freemont leaned forward, a possessive glint in his eyes as he squeezed the steering wheel with fisted hands. \u201cI need to drive. It keeps me calm.\u201d</p><p>This was calm? Phineas hadn\u2019t expected a full-fledged panic attack this evening. Last night his brother had remained quiet during the confession, just nodding his head as if he accepted it all. But Phineas had to admit now that it was highly unusual for his brother to remain quiet for more than sixty seconds. Freemont had been stunned speechless.</p><p>\u201cI did warn you,\u201d Phineas reminded his brother. \u201cI told you not to go down into the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were quoting a line from a bad movie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell would I know?\u201d Freemont yelled. \u201cI told you, I thought you\u2019d gone crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI explained it all last night, how I ended up a vampire, and how I needed to do my death-sleep all day in the basement with the window boarded up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t really catch that last part, you know what I\u2019m saying? The minute you said \u2018vampire,\u2019 I thought you\u2019d gone bat-shit on me. I didn\u2019t hear nothin\u2019 after that. I was too busy trying to figure out how we could afford to send you to a nut hut so you could get your head screwed back on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine, Freemont. I was just . . . dead for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not normal, bro!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is for a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Freemont flinched, then turned to glare at the stoplight.</p><p>Slush-screech. Slush-screech.</p><p>The light turned green, and Freemont accelerated slowly. \u201cYou really believe this stuff, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not shittin\u2019 you, Freemont. Didn\u2019t you see me drink a bottle of blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was blood, but what the hell, you could have had a V8. If you were really a vampire, wouldn\u2019t you be chomping down on people\u2019s necks? Not that I\u2019m offering mine, you understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hang with the good Vamps. We don\u2019t bite people.\u201d Phineas sighed. He\u2019d explained all this last night, how some bad vampires had transformed him and held him prisoner until he\u2019d been able to join the good Vamps and help them fight the bad vampires they called Malcontents. He\u2019d even shown Freemont his fangs, although he hadn\u2019t extended them. He\u2019d tried his best not to freak his brother out. \u201cYou saw my fangs, remember?\u201d</p><p>Freemont waved a hand in dismissal. \u201cYou could have had them filed into points. It\u2019s totally wack, but there are crazy people who do weird shit to themselves. Hell, I saw a guy on TV who had his tongue split so he\u2019d look like a snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re a vampire. If that\u2019s not seriously crazy, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d Freemont took a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you better, Phin. I\u2019ll get a full-time job, drop out of school\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You just finished your freshman year, and you\u2019re doing great. I\u2019m not letting you drop out.\u201d</p><p>Freemont stiffened with an indignant look. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do. You\u2019ve been taking care of us, paying all the bills, for eight years. It\u2019s my turn now. I can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finishing college,\u201d Phineas said sharply, then noticed the stubborn clench of Freemont\u2019s jaw. Sheesh. His little brother was becoming a man.</p><p>Five years ago, when Phineas had been transformed at the age of twenty-three, his brother had been a skinny fourteen-year-old, all bony elbows and knobby knees. The aging process had screeched to a halt for Phineas, so he tended to forget that his younger brother and sister kept growing. He and Freemont looked close to the same age now.</p><p>Phineas softened his voice. \u201cI need your help, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, man. Whatever medical attention you need. I\u2019ll get it for you. You can count on me.\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s chest expanded with warmth. His brother had grown into a good man. Now if he could just convince him of the truth. \u201cTurn right at this next street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I thought you wanted to go to Brooklyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but we need to make a stop first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Freemont turned onto a street lined with narrow wooden-framed houses with sagging front porches.</p><p>\u201cPull in there.\u201d Phineas pointed at an empty space between two parked cars.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be blocking a driveway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be here long.\u201d While his brother stopped and shifted into park, Phineas surveyed the neighborhood. Because of the rain, the sidewalks were empty. The house was dark, no lights glowing in the windows.</p><p>Slush-screech. Slush-screech.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s home,\u201d Freemont said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Then why are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA demonstration.\u201d Phineas unlatched his seat belt. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere. Keep your eyes on the porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 on the porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d Freemont\u2019s words cut off when Phineas teleported to the dark porch. He waved at the car, then teleported back to the front seat.</p><p>Freemont was a few shades paler, and his mouth was hanging open.</p><p>Slush-screech. Slush-screech.</p><p>Phineas couldn\u2019t help but smirk. \u201cNow do you believe me?\u201d</p><p>Freemont gulped, then his jaw dropped open again.</p><p>Slush-screech. Slush-screech.</p><p>Phineas snapped his seat belt on. \u201cTold you I wasn\u2019t crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I must be crazy,\u201d Freemont whispered. \u201cI\u2019m trippin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not crazy.\u201d</p><p>Freemont shook himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you get out of the car. You\u2019re not even wet, bro. How did you get to the porch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeleportation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTele-what? Isn\u2019t that some sort of spaceman shit?\u201d Freemont stiffened. \u201cWere you abducted by aliens? Did they stick a probe up your ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Freemont, I\u2019m a vampire!\u201d Phineas grabbed the rearview mirror and twisted it toward himself. \u201cCan you see me?\u201d</p><p>Freemont leaned over to peer into the mirror. He gasped, looked at Phineas, then back at the mirror. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Phineas shoved the mirror back in place. \u201cDo you believe me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re really a vampire?\u201d Freemont whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, Phineas.\u201d Freemont sat back with a horrified look. \u201cAre you sure? I mean, this is some weird-assed, spooky shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it\u2019s true, bro. I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suck. I drink from bottles.\u201d Phineas motioned toward the gearshift. \u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d</p><p>Freemont continued to stare at him. \u201cHow did it happen?\u201d</p><p>Phineas waved a dismissive hand. \u201cI was attacked by some bad vampires. Can we go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttacked?\u201d Freemont grimaced. \u201cWhat did they do to you, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. It was scary as hell and really nasty.\u201d</p><p>Freemont\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThey stuck a probe up your ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! They ripped my fuckin\u2019 throat out, okay? So now that you know how grisly it was, will you shut up and take me to Brooklyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Freemont shifted into drive and pulled out into the street. \u201cSheesh. You act like you got a bug up your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it!\u201d</p><p>While Freemont drove, he shook his head and muttered to himself, \u201cA vampire? Damn. I thought he was a security guard for some old white dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old white dude is a five-hundred-year-old vampire named Angus MacKay. He and his wife, Emma, run MacKay Security and Investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive hundred years old? Sheesh! Can he still get it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would assume so, since they seem happily married, but I\u2019ve never asked.\u201d Phineas looked out the window at the rain pouring in sheets off storefront awnings and splattering on broken sidewalks. It was thanks to Angus and Emma that he\u2019d discovered the good Vamps. He\u2019d found more than employment with them. He\u2019d found a new extended family, mostly guys. He\u2019d laughed with them, fought with them, mourned with them. The guys had become his brothers.</p><p>It had started off like one big bachelor party, but in the last few years, the men had fallen like flies. Even Gregori, the famous playboy of the vampire world. He\u2019d hooked up with the president\u2019s daughter.</p><p>Phineas enjoyed teasing them that all their newfound marital bliss was due to his expertise as the Love Doctor, but the joke was on him. He was like the painter who owned the only house in the neighborhood that needed painting. Everybody could find love but the Love Doctor.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying. He\u2019d dated some Vamp women he\u2019d met at the vampire clubs. He\u2019d thoroughly enjoyed playing the role of a popular ladies\u2019 man until he realized they saw him as nothing more than a novelty act, something to try out of curiosity before they flitted away to the next distraction.</p><p>He wanted to be more than that. He wanted someone who would look past his outward appearance to connect with his soul. Someone who would see him as special. Worthy of a lifetime, not a single night.</p><p>He\u2019d tried over and over with the mortal LaToya, believing his perseverance would eventually pay off. It never did. She\u2019d taunted him that the Love Doctor didn\u2019t know what love was.</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>Meanwhile, the other guys were all snagging some luscious babes. Shoot, Connor had even scored a real live angel. Carlos had found a girl willing to risk death in order to become a were-panther like him. The ladies who\u2019d married Vamps were all willing to give up mortality to stay with their husbands. Angus\u2019s wife, Emma, was a Vamp, and just recently, Roman\u2019s wife, Shanna, had changed over. And they all did it for love.</p><p>Where was the love for the Love Doctor? Who would ever see him as worthy? Certainly not her . . .</p><p>\u201cYou look bummed out,\u201d Freemont said, dragging Phineas away from his depressing thoughts. \u201cIs it hard being a . . . you know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire?\u201d Phineas gave him a wry look. \u201cYou can say the word without getting bitten. And yeah, sometimes it\u2019s kinda hard.\u201d He\u2019d gained a life that could last for centuries, but it could only happen in darkness.</p><p>Freemont grimaced. \u201cIf I was a vampire, I\u2019d miss fried chicken. And waffles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss . . . blue. I can never see a blue sky again.\u201d His brain was instantly flooded with a memory of her pretty blue eyes. Her again. He quickly shoved her from his mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brynley Jones was beautiful, brave, and clever\u2014the perfect female human, except for one problem. She wasn\u2019t always human. And her hatred of vampires was as big as the snout on her face when she shifted. She was the worst possible woman to obsess over. But that didn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>His brother took a deep breath. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m with you, bro. What kind of help do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already doing it. I needed a place to stay. Some wheels. I quit my job last night.\u201d</p> <p>Freemont\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat happened? Did you get pissed off with the old dude?\u201d</p><p>Phineas shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I already have another career lined up. We\u2019re going to the Digital Vampire Network in Brooklyn. It\u2019s a TV network just for Vamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shittin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I made a commercial there about two weeks ago for a drink called Blardonnay\u2014half synthetic blood, half Chardonnay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being punked, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s true.\u201d First Phineas had made a commercial with the president\u2019s daughter just as a joke, but he\u2019d performed so well, the director had asked him to do it for real with a vampire costar named Tiffany. The commercial had enjoyed an instant success, making Phineas McKinney an overnight sensation in the vampire world. \u201cThey call me the Blardonnay Guy now. I\u2019m really popular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom a commercial?\u201d Freemont pulled to a stop at another red light. \u201cHow come I haven\u2019t seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a DVN commercial. Only Vamps see it. And now they want me to star in one of their TV shows.\u201d</p><p>Freemont blinked. \u201cHot damn, Phineas! Are you famous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . guess. But only around other vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome, man.\u201d Freemont\u2019s eyes gleamed with pride. \u201cI always knew you\u2019d be famous someday, although I thought it would be with boxing. Never could figure out what happened with that.\u201d</p> <p>Phineas quickly changed the subject. \u201cWe\u2019re going to DVN, \u2019cause I\u2019m doing a special interview at the end of the Nightly News.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going on television tonight?\u201d When Phineas nodded, Freemont looked him over, frowning. \u201cOh no. Hell no. Not like that.\u201d</p><p>Phineas looked down at his jeans and bright orange, number seven Knicks T-shirt. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with\u2014\u201d He stopped when his brother stomped on the gas, swinging the car into a U-turn. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple, dude. If you want to be a celebrity, you gotta look like one. Right now, you look like a giant Cheez-It. You just leave it to me. I know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Phineas smiled. \u201cWhat are you, my agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be?\u201d Freemont\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of everything, bro. You can count on me.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, Phineas was slipping on a black tuxedo jacket in a dressing room at Leroy\u2019s House of Class.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about this.\u201d The white shirt had ruffles on the cuffs. He\u2019d look like a gigolo, or a Scotsman, he thought with a snort. He\u2019d seen Angus and some of the other guys wear frilly shirts like this with their fancy kilts. \u201cYou don\u2019t think this is overdoing it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking fine, bro.\u201d Freemont clenched a fist. \u201cSolid. Like James Bond, going to a casino. You want to take a look in the mirror?\u201d</p><p>Phineas gave him a wry look.</p><p>Freemont grimaced. \u201cSorry, I forgot. Sheesh. How do you shave in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce the sun comes up, I don\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Freemont handed him a black silk tie. \u201cYou gonna be able to put this on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want some new shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the boots need to stay.\u201d Phineas knotted the tie around his neck. \u201cHow much is this gonna set me back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s free, bro. Leroy is Lamont\u2019s dad. You know, Lamont?\u201d</p><p>With a smile, Phineas nodded. Lamont was Freemont\u2019s best friend from high school. When the two were together, the other kids called them the Full Monty. \u201cI didn\u2019t know his dad ran a tuxedo rental place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is a lot more than tuxedos. Leroy\u2019s House of Class has everything! Wedding dresses and fancy gowns. Costumes for everything from Renaissance fairs to pimp-and-ho parties. He\u2019s even got hula skirts and tiki torches if you want to do a luau. He\u2019s got canopies and tables and chairs and fancy tablecloths.\u201d Freemont yanked his T-shirt over his head, then put on a gold silk shirt. \u201cLamont works here full-time, but they let me work part-time as much as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d</p><p>Freemont shucked his jeans and pulled on some black leather pants. \u201cI do deliveries, help set up tables and chairs. I usually drive one of their limos on Saturday night, but there\u2019s nothing happening tonight, so they didn\u2019t need me. Which is good news, \u2019cause Leroy is letting us borrow a limo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. Thanks.\u201d Phineas paused a moment while his brother put on some shiny black dress shoes. \u201cI appreciate you working to help pay your tuition, but don\u2019t overdo it. You need to keep your grades up.\u201d</p><p>Freemont rolled his eyes like he usually did when Phineas acted more like a father than a brother. But with nine years\u2019 difference in their ages, it was something Phineas had trouble avoiding. He was the one who had run off their father, so he felt responsible for his younger siblings.</p><p>Freemont shrugged on a purple velvet jacket trimmed with faux leopard fur, then plopped a leopard-skin fedora on his head. \u201cNow I\u2019ll look like your agent.\u201d</p><p>Phineas winced. \u201cYou look like a pimp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPimp? Agent? What\u2019s the difference?\u201d Freemont flipped up his collar. \u201cShow me the money!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreemont\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, bro.\u201d He grabbed a wooden walking stick with a gold knob on the end and twirled it through his fingers. \u201cShould I ask Leroy to loan us a few party girls for the evening? You\u2019ll look more like a celebrity with some pretty ladies on your arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParty girls?\u201d Phineas frowned, wondering if Leroy had a little business going on the side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s legit, man. Sometimes people want a few pretty girls to tend bar and wait tables at their parties. The girls are under strict orders not to fraternize. Believe me, I\u2019ve tried.\u201d</p><p>Phineas snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about women. There\u2019ll be plenty at DVN, hoping to get on TV. And my costar will be there. Tiffany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlond and booty-licious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn!\u201d Freemont gave him a knuckle pound. \u201cYou da man!\u201d He led Phineas down a hall toward the back door of Leroy\u2019s establishment. \u201cAs your new agent, I\u2019m gonna need a name that\u2019s tight. You need one, too, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Phang in the vampire world. Also known as the Love Doctor.\u201d</p><p>Freemont\u2019s eyes narrowed as he nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s buck. I bet you get laid all the time.\u201d</p><p>Phineas winced inwardly. The silly names had worked well enough for one-night stands, but eventually, he\u2019d grown tired of feeling like a joke that was funny only one time.</p><p>Freemont grabbed a set of keys off a peg by the back door. \u201cWill you introduce me to the Tiffany babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but remember she\u2019s a Vamp. She might see you as a snack more than a stud.\u201d</p><p>Freemont gulped and eased a finger around the collar of his gold silk shirt. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a weird life, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d Phineas patted him on the back. \u201cAnd I appreciate your help.\u201d Thanks to his brother, he now looked a lot more convincing in his new role as a television star.</p><p>Freemont opened the back door and strode into the parking lot. \u201cSo if you\u2019re Dr. Phang . . .\u201d</p><p>Phineas followed him, grateful that the rain had finally stopped. He stepped around puddles to keep his boots as dry as possible.</p><p>Freemont halted with a jerk. \u201cI know! I\u2019ll be Da Freeze. Kinda like Freemont, but better. Da Freeze, the Ice Man. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Phineas bit his lip to keep from grinning. His brother reminded him of himself five years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than cool, man. I\u2019m an icy cold blast of refreshment!\u201d Freemont opened the door to a purple limousine. \u201cOnly the best for my famous brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a bunch of hot babes,\u201d Freemont whispered as they entered the lobby of the Digital Vampire Network. \u201cAre you sure they\u2019re all . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they are,\u201d Phineas whispered back. \u201cAnd they all have super hearing, so be careful what you say.\u201d</p><p>Freemont nodded, his wide-eyed gaze darting around the crowded lobby. \u201cYour life is seriously weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet,\u201d Phineas muttered, then headed toward the reception desk.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s the Blardonnay Guy!\u201d a pretty brunette squealed.</p><p>More gasps and squeals emanated from the scantily clad young ladies who frequented the lobby every night, hoping to be discovered. They rushed toward Phineas, all talking at once.</p><p>\u201cI just love your commercial!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re even more handsome than Denzel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have an autograph please?\u201d</p><p>Phineas held up his hands to ward off the full-court press, but before he could say anything, Freemont blocked the girls with his walking stick.</p><p>\u201cLadies!\u201d He flashed a wide grin. \u201cWe appreciate your enthusiasm, but Dr. Phang has to do an interview right now. If you can wait till he\u2019s finished, he might be able to spare you a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be here!\u201d A blonde held up a Blardonnay bottle. \u201cWill you sign my bottle, Dr. Phang?\u201d</p><p>A brunette in a cheerleader costume winked at Phineas. \u201cI want you to sign my thigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you sign my breast!\u201d Another posed, showing off her most talented assets, barely contained in a tight spandex halter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all good.\u201d Freemont used his walking stick to herd them back. \u201cBut I will need to thoroughly inspect all writing surfaces before I can allow my client to sign. Security protocol, you understand.\u201d</p><p>Phineas snorted as he approached the receptionist\u2019s desk. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up? It\u2019s Susie, right?\u201d</p><p>She blushed, almost as red as the dyed streaks in her black hair. \u201cYou remembered. I just love your commercial, Dr. Phang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his agent.\u201d Freemont slid his pinched thumb and forefinger along the brim of his fedora. \u201cYou can call me Da Freeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you. For security reasons, we ask all our visitors to wear name tags.\u201d Susie smiled shyly at Phineas. \u201cOf course, you don\u2019t need a name tag, Dr. Phang. Everyone knows who you are.\u201d She wrote Freemont\u2019s new name on a name tag. \u201cHere you go, Mr. DeVries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Da Freeze. The Ice Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d A confused look flitted over Susie\u2019s face, then she scribbled another name. \u201cMr. Theismann.\u201d She passed him the name tag, then scurried toward the double doors behind her.</p><p>Frowning at his name tag, Freemont whispered, \u201cDoesn\u2019t she understand English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really should hurry now.\u201d Susie held open the door. \u201cThey were expecting Dr. Phang in makeup five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>After a few minutes in the makeup chair, Phineas was escorted to Recording Studio #3 where he greeted Gordon, the director.</p><p>\u201cHey, Phineas.\u201d Gordon shook hands with him, then gave Freemont and his name tag a curious look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Phang\u2019s agent,\u201d Freemont boasted.</p><p>\u201cAnd my brother,\u201d Phineas added with a grin.</p><p>Gordon nodded, his eyes twinkling with excitement. He and Stone Cauffyn were the only ones at DVN who knew what Phineas was really up to tonight. \u201cStone and Tiffany are ready for you. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>As Phineas approached the set, which consisted of three chairs on a carpeted dais, Tiffany jumped to her feet, her breasts jiggling and dangerously close to falling out of the sexy red dress she was wearing.</p><p>\u201cDr. Phang!\u201d With a big grin, she threw her arms around his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t you just love it? We\u2019re famous! I want to kiss you, but I don\u2019t dare mess up my makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting fan mail, can you believe it? And all the girls want to know if I\u2019ve slept with you. You don\u2019t mind if I say yes, do you?\u201d She pressed closer, rubbing her breasts against him as she slid her hands down his chest. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have to be a lie, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d Phineas grabbed her hands to keep them from venturing too far south. How could he put this? He didn\u2019t want to have sex with her just to give her something to talk about with her fans.</p><p>\u201cPlaces!\u201d Gordon shouted. \u201cWe go live in three minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later,\u201d Phineas told Tiffany, then he took a seat, sandwiched between her and Stone Cauffyn, the newscaster who had just finished doing the Nightly News in Studio #2.</p><p>The sound guy clipped tiny microphones onto the guys\u2019 lapels, then struggled to find a place to attach Tiffany\u2019s mike.</p><p>She giggled. \u201cOooh, that tickles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes my hair look all right?\u201d Stone asked the makeup girl.</p><p>\u201cYou look perfect,\u201d she replied, then winked at Phineas. \u201cSo do you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwo minutes,\u201d Gordon announced.</p><p>\u201cTesting, testing,\u201d Stone said, and the sound guy gave him a thumbs-up. \u201cTake a taxi, tally-ho.\u201d</p><p>Phineas gave him a questioning look, then realized the newscaster was warming up.</p><p>\u201cThe voluptuous vampire ventured into the velvet night,\u201d Stone announced in a serious tone. \u201cPeter Potter from Poughkeepsie packs a pretty pickle in his pants.\u201d</p> <p>Phineas glanced at his brother who was being herded toward the back of the room. Freemont grinned at him and punched the air with his fist.</p><p>\u201cBilly Baker bumped into a barmaid and barfed his Blissky on her bosom,\u201d Stone continued, then lowered his voice to a soft whisper. \u201cI hope this works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will.\u201d Phineas shifted in his chair and unbuttoned his tuxedo jacket. He took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. You can do this.</p><p>\u201cTen seconds,\u201d Gordon announced, then held up his hand to show them five seconds, four, three, two, then he pointed his index finger at them.</p><p>They were live on the air.</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d Stone focused on the camera with the red glowing light. \u201cTonight, the Digital Vampire Network is proud to bring you the moment you\u2019ve been waiting for\u2014our special bonus feature.\u201d</p><p>The red light blinked to a second camera, and Stone shifted his gaze. \u201cAs the threat of global Vampire Apocalypse fades into the sunset, the Undead have turned their attention to . . . something completely different. I\u2019m referring to the latest sensation on DVN\u2014not a show, but an advertisement for the most recent addition to Vampire Fusion Cuisine, a mixture of synthetic blood and Chardonnay called Blardonnay, which is, of course, manufactured by one of our sponsors, Romatech Industries.\u201d</p><p>Stone motioned to his guests as the camera backed up for a wider shot. \u201cIt is my pleasure to introduce the actors from that commercial: Dr. Phang and Tiffany, otherwise known as the Blardonnay Guy and Girl.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany giggled and waved at the camera, while Phineas smiled.</p><p>\u201cNow that your acting careers have skyrocketed,\u201d Stone continued, \u201ccan you tell us how your lives have changed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so happy now!\u201d Tiffany clasped her hands together. \u201cI\u2019ve always known I was destined to be a star. I mean, when you look like this\u201d\u2014she twisted in her chair to strike a provocative pose\u2014\u201cit\u2019s obvious you belong in front of a camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Stone\u2019s face remained expressionless as he regarded her. \u201cThere is a theory that those who are extremely good-looking could also be considered more attractive.\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cA bold theory, Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have been incredibly blessed, but\u201d\u2014Tiffany heaved a forlorn sigh that carried the added bonus of causing her breasts to heave\u2014\u201cunfortunately, beauty such as mine tends to be overwhelming. Some might even call it . . . a curse.\u201d With a sniffle, she wiped away an imaginary tear.</p><p>Phineas struggled to keep a straight face as he patted Tiffany\u2019s hand. \u201cBuck up, sweetness. It\u2019ll all be good.\u201d</p><p>She leaned to the side to give him a hug, which mashed her breasts together. \u201cYou\u2019re so wonderful, Dr. Phang. And I have to say that I\u2019m ever so grateful to DVN for giving me this opportunity to show the vampire world how truly talented I am. Now everyone will know that I have much more to offer than an exquisitely beautiful face.\u201d</p><p>Stone\u2019s gaze flitted to her breasts. \u201cYes, I can tell you are truly gifted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you.\u201d She giggled. \u201cI\u2019m just thrilled everyone is taking me seriously now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d Phineas winked at her. As far as he knew, half the men at DVN had already taken Tiffany quite seriously. No way was he getting in line.</p><p>\u201cAnd how about you, Dr. Phang?\u201d Stone asked. \u201cHas your life changed for the better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it has. I was finally able to quit my old job.\u201d</p><p>Stone nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s a rumor going around DVN that you\u2019ve agreed to play a role on one of our popular soap operas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a rumor.\u201d Phineas aimed a dashing grin at the camera. \u201cI\u2019m in contract negotiations to star on As the Vampire Turns.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany squealed and latched on to his arm, leaning toward him for another hug. \u201cOh, Dr. Phang! I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d She grinned at Stone. \u201cI have good news, too. I was just hired to do a commercial for Vampos, the after-dinner mint that gets rid of blood breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I plan to make more Blardonnay commercials,\u201d Phineas added, then touched Tiffany\u2019s hand. \u201cWith you, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, Dr. Phang! I just love working with you.\u201d She squeezed his arm and gave the camera a dramatic look. \u201cWe\u2019ve become very close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, Dr. Phang,\u201d Stone continued. \u201cHow did you acquire such an interesting name? Are you really a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took on the name five years ago when I was transformed,\u201d Phineas explained. \u201cThe title of doctor is honorary and refers to my high level of expertise in all manners of love.\u201d</p><p>Stone\u2019s face remained blank. \u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They call me the Love Doctor.\u201d It was a load of crap that Phineas felt like he\u2019d outgrown, but it probably fit his new persona of an up-and-coming, super-sexy star. \u201cI don\u2019t like to brag, you understand, but I\u2019m naturally attuned to universal love vibrations, and that gives me an uncanny ability to sense a woman\u2019s needs and fulfill her every desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes!\u201d Tiffany pressed against his arm. \u201cNobody fulfills me like Dr. Phang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d Stone continued. \u201cWell, I can certainly attest to Dr. Phang\u2019s newfound popularity. DVN has been flooded with calls and e-mails. The women love the way you look in a bath towel, and the men want to know if you have a special workout regimen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a gorgeous chest,\u201d Tiffany purred while she rubbed a hand over his tuxedo jacket.</p><p>Phineas grabbed her hand before she could get carried away. \u201cI was already in good shape when I was transformed. I used to be a boxer.\u201d And a drug dealer on the side, but he didn\u2019t want his family to know about that. Hell, he didn\u2019t want anyone to know.</p><p>\u201cA boxer? How fascinating,\u201d Stone continued in his bland voice. \u201cYou mentioned quitting a job. Weren\u2019t you employed by MacKay Security and Investigation?\u201d</p><p>Phineas nodded. Finally, Stone was getting to the point of the interview. \u201cYeah, I worked for Angus MacKay. For five lousy years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLousy?\u201d Stone asked.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how lousy. Seven nights a week, no time off, no vacation. And no hazard pay! They ordered me to risk my life, over and over again, and for what? Minimum wage?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Stone\u2019s face showed an expression. He frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize Angus MacKay was a bad employer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad?\u201d Phineas snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s the worst. And you know what really pisses me off? That he has the gall to pretend that he\u2019s the good guy!\u201d</p><p>Stone sat back with a stunned look. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe Angus MacKay is a good guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no! I tell you, the whole time I worked for him, I never saw any of his employees get killed. But boy did they slaughter a bunch of other vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re referring to the Malcontents they killed in battle?\u201d Stone asked.</p><p>Phineas waved a hand. \u201cAngus calls them Malcontents, but I like to call them by their real name: the True Ones. I mean, since when is it a crime to stick to old traditions? The True Ones just want to be left alone so they can eat the old-fashioned way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean feeding off mortals till they die,\u201d Stone muttered.</p><p>Phineas shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we have a shortage of mortals in the world. Besides, this is about basic vampire liberties. We should be able to feed however we like. Angus and his sanctimonious friends\u2014who the hell are they to decide what\u2019s the right way for the rest of us to live our lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t see anything wrong with the so-called Malcontents?\u201d Stone asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. They\u2019re the ones who transformed me and gave me eternal life. I\u2019m grateful for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you worked for MacKay S and I for several years,\u201d Stone reminded him. \u201cThey\u2019re the number one enemy of the Malcontents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed a paycheck, you know. I\u2019m a young vampire, so I haven\u2019t had centuries to acquire wealth like those rich old farts who ordered me around like a servant. But now that I have a new career, I can finally do what I\u2019ve wanted to do for a long time.\u201d Phineas glared at the camera. \u201cAngus MacKay, you old turd, go to hell!\u201d</p><p>Stone winced. \u201cThose are strong words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d Phineas insisted. \u201cAll those Vamps make me sick. Acting so morally superior because they drink out of bottles while they go around murdering other vampires. They\u2019re a bunch of hypocrites! Do you know they executed Casimir without even giving him a chance to surrender? What kind of shit is that?\u201d</p><p>Stone shifted in his chair. \u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to hear something really funny?\u201d Phineas continued. \u201cFor the last couple of years, Angus thought one of the Malcontents, Stanislav Serpukhov, was betraying the Russian coven in Brooklyn and reporting to me. But the truth was, I was reporting to him.\u201d</p><p>A series of gasps reverberated around the studio. Tiffany tilted her head with confusion, while Stone stared at him with his mouth open.</p><p>Phineas narrowed his eyes on the camera. \u201cSo you guys out there who\u2019ve been trying to assassinate Stanislav, you need to stop. Cut it out. He\u2019s not a traitor.\u201d</p><p>Stone cleared his throat. \u201cAre you saying you were a double agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. No harm in letting out the big secret now that I\u2019ve changed careers.\u201d Phineas winked at the camera. \u201cI like to live dangerously, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Stone took a deep breath. \u201cWell, that\u2019s all the time we have for tonight. I\u2019d like to thank our guests for coming and congratulate them once again for their phenomenal rise to stardom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Tiffany blew a kiss at the camera. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank all the little people for admiring me so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for watching DVN, the world\u2019s leading vampire network,\u201d Stone added with a bland smile.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d Gordon announced. \u201cGood work.\u201d He gave Phineas a thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cYou are living dangerously.\u201d Stone stood as he unclipped his mike.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be worth it.\u201d Phineas handed his mike to the sound guy, then strode toward his brother, who was studying him with a puzzled frown.</p><p>\u201cWait for me!\u201d Tiffany latched on to his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Freemont asked.</p><p>\u201cI can explain.\u201d Phineas motioned to Tiffany, who clung to his arm. \u201cYou wanted to meet my lovely costar? Tiffany, this is my brother and my agent, Da Freeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d She grinned at Freemont. \u201cAren\u2019t you adorable! You look like Phineas, except younger and more . . . alive.\u201d Her gaze drifted to his neck.</p><p>Freemont stepped back. \u201cI just ate a bunch of garlic.\u201d</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go somewhere private,\u201d Phineas said.</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou want a threesome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I need to talk to my brother.\u201d</p><p>Freemont scowled at him. \u201cYeah, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you don\u2019t want me?\u201d Tiffany\u2019s shoulders slumped.</p><p>Phineas sighed. \u201cAll right. You can come, too.\u201d</p><p>She perked up and grinned. \u201cI know the perfect place. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>She ushered them out of the studio and down the hall to an unmarked door. \u201cThis is a storage room for old costumes. I have secret rendezvous here all the time.\u201d</p><p>Phineas followed her inside, flipped on the lights, and shut the door. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a secret if you meet all the guys here.\u201d</p><p>Freemont snorted, then strode down an aisle lined with crowded clothes racks on each side. He was pissed, Phineas could tell, but Phineas would deal with him later.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Tiffany.\u201d He grabbed her by the shoulders. \u201cListen to me good.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cYes, Dr. Phang?\u201d</p><p>He dragged her hands off his shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re not having sex with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not? Then . . . ?\u201d Her gaze flitted toward Freemont, who turned left at the end of the aisle and disappeared behind a rack of clothes.</p><p>\u201cNo, not with him, either,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cTiffany, look at me. You have a contract for three more Blardonnay commercials and a Vampos commercial. You don\u2019t need to sleep around anymore.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him blankly. \u201cBut it\u2019s worked well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiffany, you made it. Put your old life behind you, and let you talent shine through. You\u2019re a success now, and you deserve it.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and whispered, \u201cI . . . deserve it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glistened with tears. \u201cThat\u2019s the nicest thing anyone\u2019s ever told me.\u201d</p><p>Phineas gave her a wry smile. \u201cI learned the hard way how easy it is to screw up your life when you don\u2019t respect yourself.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cThank you, Dr. Phang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow off you go. I need to talk to my brother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d With a shy smile, she headed toward the door.</p><p>Phineas turned and couldn\u2019t spot his brother. \u201cFreemont, where are you?\u201d</p><p>A hand waved in the back corner, so Phineas tunneled between some dresses on a rack and found himself in a second aisle. He dove through another rack of clothes and discovered a wall lined with shelves. Shoes, handbags, and hats decorated the shelves, and toward the back wall, Freemont was examining a pair of cowboy boots.</p> <p>Phineas heard the click of the door, signaling Tiffany\u2019s departure. \u201cOkay, we can talk now.\u201d</p><p>Freemont grimaced as he stuffed the boots back on the shelf. \u201cYou told me you were a good vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what was all that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working undercover.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I heard what you said! You\u2019re a stinkin\u2019 double agent, working for the nasty vampires that kill people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a good guy,\u201d Phineas insisted, then lowered his voice. \u201cFreemont, you gotta trust me. I still work for MacKay S and I. The interview was a setup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see a video on the Internet a few weeks ago that claimed vampires were true? It showed a swordfight, and a guy in a kilt decapitated another guy who turned to dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Freemont nodded. \u201cI thought it was a movie trailer. Lamont and I wanted to see the movie, but we could never find the name of it. It just disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe government removed it. Because it was real.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a real battle. I was there.\u201d</p><p>Freemont\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou fought in a real battle? With a sword?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve been in several battles, and I\u2019ve killed a few Malcontents. The guy whose head was cut off was Casimir, the leader of the Malcontents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the bad guys were defeated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but there are still a few Malcontents out there. Casimir had a girlfriend, Corky Courrant, who does a TV show called Live with the Undead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe recorded the video of Casimir\u2019s execution, then posted it on YouTube. That means she broke the secret of vampire existence. That\u2019s about the biggest crime you can commit in our world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer name is Corky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Stay with me, Freemont. After she posted the video, she came back here to DVN and continued doing her show as if she\u2019d done nothing wrong. She claims she\u2019s heir to the Malcontent throne and vampires all over the world should follow her and call her Queen Corky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, I hate her!\u201d Tiffany hissed from across the room.</p><p>Phineas jerked around, but couldn\u2019t see her. \u201cTiffany! You were supposed to leave the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She emerged through a rack of hanging clothes. \u201cI won\u2019t breathe a word. I hate Corky as much as anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this Corky is really bad?\u201d Freemont asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s evil,\u201d Tiffany hissed.</p><p>\u201cEvil queen bitch,\u201d Phineas clarified. \u201cShe\u2019s been badmouthing us good Vamps on her show, calling us a bunch of thugs and murderers. She even bragged about how she started the Vampire Apocalypse. Roman summoned her to Coven Court three times, but she ignored him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoman?\u201d Freemont asked.</p><p>\u201cRoman Draganesti, Coven Master for the East Coast,\u201d Phineas explained. \u201cAnd he\u2019s owner of Romatech Industries where they make synthetic blood and where I\u2019m head of security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Freemont nodded.</p><p>\u201cCorky\u2019s been mocking Roman and the good Vamps, claiming she\u2019s above our system of law and justice,\u201d Phineas continued. \u201cRoman had no choice but to issue a warrant for her arrest, but then she went into hiding and now she records her show somewhere in secret. We haven\u2019t been able to locate her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh,\u201d Tiffany whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s why you acted like a Malcontent sympathizer during the interview. You want to convince Corky you\u2019re on her side, so you can flush her out.\u201d</p><p>Phineas regarded Tiffany with surprise. She wasn\u2019t as stupid as she pretended to be. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThis is awesome! You really are working undercover.\u201d</p><p>Freemont\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cHot damn! We\u2019re undercover brothers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited.\u201d Phineas gave his brother a stern look. \u201cI want you to stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! I\u2019ve got your back, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that, but I don\u2019t want you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to stay out of this,\u201d Freemont interrupted with a scowl. \u201cYou involved me when you invited me here.\u201d</p><p>Phineas sighed. \u201cI needed to convince everyone that I\u2019d left MacKay S and I, and that I\u2019m hanging with a new crowd. I suggested going to you, and Angus agreed. We always have a shortage of day guards, since not many mortals know about us, so Angus is interested in hiring you. He said they could work around your college schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Freemont\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI could work with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I told him you might be interested.\u201d Phineas winced inwardly. He had jumped at the chance to include his brother, but now he wondered if his decision had been selfish.</p><p>For the past few years, he\u2019d felt like there was a ticking bomb over his head. Sooner or later, and probably sooner, it would explode the instant that his family realized he wasn\u2019t aging. When that happened, he would be left with only two options. One: Tell his family the truth and deal with the consequences. Two: Disappear. He could fake his death, leave them to mourn, and never see them again. Or he could spare their grief by erasing himself from their memories. As if he had never existed.</p><p>Angus recommended the last option. A swift surgical strike, he called it, somewhat like amputating a limb. A part of you would be forever lost, but you would survive.</p><p>For Phineas, the thought of losing his family felt more like having his heart ripped out. Too painful to consider, so he\u2019d settled on telling them the truth, starting with his brother. When Angus offered to hire Freemont, it had seemed like the perfect solution. Guarding Vamps in their death-sleep during the day was usually a safe job since the Malcontents were in their death-sleep, too.</p><p>But now that his current mission was under way, Phineas worried that his decision would expose his brother to some real danger. Had he selfishly saved himself pain, only to foist it onto his family? \u201cFreemont, listen to me. It\u2019s already dangerous enough for you to be here, pretending to be my agent. I don\u2019t expect anything more from you. I have backup, so when things get dicey, I\u2019ll be covered. I want you to lay low and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle the spy stuff.\u201d Freemont lifted his chin. \u201cThis is my mission if I decide to accept it. As usual, if I am captured, the government will disavow any knowledge of my actions. See? I know how it works!\u201d</p><p>Tiffany nodded. \u201cI want to help, too!\u201d</p><p>Phineas groaned. He had a bad feeling about this. \u201cAll right. But this is what you do. You continue to play the roles you\u2019re doing now. And if anything dangerous comes up, you stay clear of it, understood?\u201d When they nodded, he continued, \u201cWe\u2019ll hang out in the lobby, sign autographs, and see if Corky sends any of her minions for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be quick to take her prisoner, or she\u2019ll teleport away,\u201d Tiffany warned him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phineas conceded. That was always a major problem when it came to catching bad vampires. Casimir had eluded them for years by simply teleporting away whenever they got close. \u201cGo on to the lobby. We\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tiffany strode toward the door, and this time, Phineas watched to make sure she left.</p><p>He turned to his brother. \u201cAre we good now?\u201d</p><p>Freemont nodded with a sheepish look. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have doubted you, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Phineas clapped him on the back. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a lot of weird shit thrown at you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201d Freemont followed him to the door. \u201cOne thing I don\u2019t understand, though. Why didn\u2019t you take Tiffany up on her offer? She\u2019s beautiful and willing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her. As a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but she\u2019s willing, dude. And you\u2019re the Love Doctor. You gotta spread the cure.\u201d</p><p>Phineas smiled. His brother kept reminding him of himself about five years back. \u201cI admit there was a time when I would have jumped her.\u201d He cracked the door and peered outside. The coast was clear.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you, bro? You seem different these days.\u201d</p><p>Phineas shrugged. \u201cI grew up.\u201d And he\u2019d seen some bad shit. Ravaged, dead bodies left behind by Malcontents. Whole families, even children, murdered because the Malcontents enjoyed terrorizing the innocent. He\u2019d been thrust into life and death situations, and he\u2019d killed in battle. He could no longer pretend life was one big party.</p><p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re older doesn\u2019t mean you have to be boring,\u201d Freemont muttered.</p><p>Phineas led him down a hall lined with dressing rooms and offices. \u201cWhen I first discovered I was Undead and I could possibly live forever, it sorta went to my head, you know, like I was invincible and super-macho and could do whatever the hell I pleased with as many Vamp ladies as I pleased. But then I realized they were all doing whatever they pleased, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that if you\u2019re having fun?\u201d</p><p>Phineas slowed his steps and lowered his voice. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see me as a person. You think we\u2019re a minority in the real world, you should try the vampire one. I was a curiosity that all the ladies wanted to experience, and once it was over, they moved on to the next form of entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you got tired of one-night stands?\u201d Freemont wrinkled his nose. \u201cIs that even possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. Eventually, I realized that being wanted as an oddity is an insult. I want to be appreciated for being myself.\u201d</p><p>Freemont nodded his head slowly. \u201cYou want . . . respect. And that\u2019s why you told Tiffany that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, bro.\u201d Phineas continued down the hall toward the lobby. Yes, he wanted respect. He wanted love. He wanted the brass ring, the whole shebang, the happily-ever-after that the other guys were getting. But he was having trouble finding the dream girl. LaToya had slipped through his fingers like mist, a dream that never became reality.</p><p>A different vision invaded his mind. Sky-blue eyes and a long mane of hair that glimmered with shades of brown, red, and gold. Beautiful, impossible Brynley. She wasn\u2019t a dream, but a nightmare. Dressed in a fur coat.</p><p>He gestured to a door they passed by. \u201cThat\u2019s Corky Courrant\u2019s office. I snuck in there two weeks ago when we were shooting the Blardonnay commercial. I was searching for a clue as to where she could be hiding, but she\u2019d already cleaned it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer.\u201d</p><p>Phineas nodded. \u201cIf she takes the bait tonight, we\u2019ll find her.\u201d He pushed open the doors to the lobby, and they were greeted with a chorus of high-pitched squeals.</p><p>He joined Tiffany, signing autographs, while Freemont protected him from any ominous-looking legs, arms, and breasts he was asked to sign. The fun lasted about ten minutes, and then it happened.</p><p>Three armed men crashed through the front doors, shouting and waving their weapons. The crowd, mostly women, screamed and scrambled toward the back doors.</p><p>\u201cEveryone down on the floor and shut the hell up!\u201d one of the intruders yelled. In case anyone had trouble understanding his thick Russian accent, he punctuated his demands by shooting a few bullets into the ceiling.</p><p>As the blare of gunfire echoed about the lobby, the screams quickly hushed. Sheetrock particles rained down, leaving traces of white powder on the intruders\u2019 black coats. The crowd dropped to the floor, women huddled together, quivering with a few frightened whimpers.</p><p>Phineas remained standing and motioned to his brother to stay put. Freemont had crouched behind the receptionist\u2019s desk with Susie and Tiffany.</p><p>The Russian guy was the leader, Phineas figured. A Malcontent, no doubt, sent by Corky. He was armed with an automatic pistol and an AK\u201347. The guys flanking him were mortal, judging from the bite marks on their necks. They either served Corky voluntarily, or she had them under vampire mind control. One was tall and skinny, with a narrow face and long nose. Rat Face, Phineas dubbed him. And the other guy, short and square, was Blockhead. The three thugs scanned the room before focusing on him.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d The Russian Malcontent smirked. \u201cYou are the one called Dr. Phang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>\u201cYou will come with us. The queen wants you.\u201d</p><p>Phineas paused as if considering the invitation, then shrugged. \u201cNo thanks. I don\u2019t know any queens.\u201d</p><p>The Russian pointed his automatic at the nearest girl, the cheerleader with Phineas\u2019s autograph on her thigh. \u201cYou will come, or this one will die. Her Majesty, Queen Corky, must be obeyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that queen!\u201d Phineas raised his hands. \u201cSure. Why not?\u201d</p><p>With a sneer, the Russian motioned to his minions. \u201cPrepare him for the journey.\u201d</p><p>Rat Face and Blockhead approached him slowly, slipping their pistols into the shoulder holsters beneath their black coats.</p><p>\u201cTake off your jacket,\u201d the Russian ordered, keeping his pistol and AK\u201347 trained on nearby girls.</p><p>After Phineas removed his tuxedo jacket, Blockhead grabbed it and rifled through the pockets. He stuffed Phineas\u2019s wallet and cell phone into his own coat pockets. Phineas kept his face blank, careful not to show how relieved he was that he\u2019d deleted all contacts and messages from his phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRoll up your sleeves,\u201d the Russian demanded. \u201cWe have heard MacKay embeds tracking chips in all his vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI no longer work for them.\u201d Phineas shoved his shirtsleeves up to his elbows. \u201cAngus cut the chip out last night.\u201d</p><p>The Russian gave him a dubious look. \u201cYou have no wound on your arm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt healed during my death-sleep.\u201d</p><p>The Russian jerked his head toward Rat Face. \u201cCheck him.\u201d</p><p>Rat Face took a small electronic device from his pocket and skimmed it up and down Phineas\u2019s arms. \u201cHe\u2019s clean, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck him for weapons,\u201d the Russian ordered.</p><p>Blockhead skimmed his hands over Phineas. \u201cHe\u2019s clean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Dimitri inclined his head. \u201cWe will now escort you to the queen, where you will appear on her show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Phineas put his jacket back on. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good publicity.\u201d</p><p>Freemont straightened and adjusted his hat. \u201cMy client will expect reimbursement, you understand. He doesn\u2019t do appearances for free.\u201d</p><p>Phineas shook his head, glaring at his brother.</p><p>Dimitri narrowed his eyes on Freemont. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody,\u201d Phineas said at the same time Freemont said, \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Phang\u2019s agent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFreemont,\u201d Phineas gritted out through clenched teeth. \u201cStay out of this.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri\u2019s sharp eyes darted back and forth between Phineas and his brother, then he smiled. \u201cYou have a mortal friend, Dr. Phang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s a pain in the ass,\u201d Phineas growled.</p><p>Dimitri chuckled. \u201cCuff them both. Having the mortal with us will ensure Dr. Phang\u2019s good behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d Phineas muttered, glowering at his brother while Rat Face and Blockhead snapped silver handcuffs around their wrists.</p><p>\u201cThe cuffs are just a precaution,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have Dr. Phang teleporting away and taking his mortal friend with him.\u201d</p><p>Rat Face and Blockhead seized Phineas and Freemont by the napes of their necks and steered them toward the front door. Outside in the parking lot, Phineas and his brother were shoved into the back of a delivery van. It was empty, except for stained carpet on the floor. The back doors slammed shut, and they were locked inside. No windows, Phineas noted, so he wouldn\u2019t know where they were going.</p><p>But just seconds earlier, he had spotted a black SUV across the parking lot. Robby and Jack were prepared to follow.</p> <p>Phineas heard more doors on the van bang shut. That was probably Dimitri and his buddies climbing into the front seat. Corky had to be located fairly close by if they were driving to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Freemont whispered.</p><p>Phineas scowled at him. \u201cYou have a lousy way of following directions. You were supposed to stay out of danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to leave you alone with them.\u201d Freemont glared back. \u201cI\u2019m not a coward.\u201d</p><p>The van lurched into motion.</p><p>Freemont gulped. \u201cDo we have a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Phineas motioned with his head toward the front seat of the van, then mouthed the words, Super hearing.</p><p>Freemont nodded.</p><p>Phineas slid the heel of his right boot to the side, revealing a hidden red button. He punched the button, activating the new soundless tracking beam Roman and Laszlo had perfected in the lab at Romatech. He slid the heel back in place.</p><p>Freemont\u2019s eyes twinkled with excitement.</p><p>Phineas smiled. Oh yeah, Queen Bitch. We\u2019ve got you now.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you to appear on my show,\u201d Corky Courrant said, smiling for the camera.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Phineas returned her smile. As far as he could tell, Corky\u2019s makeshift studio was in the basement of a duplex somewhere in Brooklyn or Queens. They hadn\u2019t driven far, and he\u2019d been able to catch a glimpse of the residence after Corky\u2019s minions had hauled him and Freemont from the back of the van.</p><p>He sat on a tufted footstool, low to the ground to emphasize his inferior status, while next to him, Corky posed in a high-backed, ornately carved, red velvet upholstered chair. He had to crane his neck to avoid peering straight at her massive bosom, which threatened to escape her low-cut, shimmering gold gown. Her jeweled tiara and numerous rings glittered under the bright overhead lights.</p><p>They had started the show with a recording of a trumpet fanfare befitting a queen. Corky had confided in him that she\u2019d first heard the piece at the court of Henry VIII where she\u2019d been one of the king\u2019s favorites. Phineas figured she had a long history of using powerful men to get ahead.</p><p>The wall behind them was draped in purple silk. In front of them, Rat Face worked the camera, and Blockhead held the boom suspended over Corky\u2019s head. Across the room, Freemont perched stiffly on a metal folding chair while Dimitri aimed his automatic pistol at him. Another armed Malcontent stood by the door, and Phineas had counted three more upstairs on the ground floor. A total of seven men, but that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Angus was planning to hit with a dozen guys from MacKay S&amp;I.</p><p>Even though the mission was simple\u2014capture Corky\u2014a nagging fear pricked at Phineas. His orders were to stick close to Corky and to not let her get away, but he hadn\u2019t counted on his brother being here.</p><p>He swallowed hard, then pasted a smile back on his face. \u201cThank you for inviting me, Corky\u2014\u201d</p><p>She kicked him in the shin.</p><p>\u201cMiss Corky.\u201d Another kick. \u201cQueen Corky.\u201d His smile barely wavered. \u201cYour most glorious Majesty. I\u2019ve always been a big fan of your show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course you are.\u201d She waved her hand in a regal fashion. \u201cMy show has always enjoyed the highest ratings of any show on DVN. Everyone adores my show. Naturally, since everyone adores me. But enough about me.\u201d</p><p>She gave a throaty laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s talk a moment about those despicable, hateful bastards who\u2019ve been persecuting me, forcing me to take my spectacular show into hiding. I\u2019m talking, of course, about those bottle-drinking cowards who refuse to behave like true vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m especially referring to their ringleaders,\u201d Corky continued. \u201cRoman Draganesti, who invented that nasty swill he calls synthetic blood, and then he contaminated it even further with his disgusting Vampire Fusion Cuisine.\u201d She paused, looking down her nose at Phineas. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually enjoy that Blardonnay, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, no.\u201d Phineas made a face. \u201cI can barely stomach it. But a man\u2019s got to make a living, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d She patted the top of his head like he was her new pet. \u201cSadly, there are times when we must suffer for our art. But back to those vicious ringleaders\u2014the worst one, without a doubt, is that wretched Angus MacKay, the head of MacKay Security and Investigation. Of course, we all know that organization is nothing more than a notorious gang of armed thugs.\u201d</p><p>Phineas nodded. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I finally got away from them. They treated me like a dog.\u201d</p><p>Corky gasped with indignation. \u201cYou poor man. Do tell us more.\u201d Her smile turned vicious. \u201cEvery vile and disgusting detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. First of all, I think they\u2019re mentally unstable.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes gleamed. \u201cI\u2019ve always suspected as much.\u201d</p><p>Phineas shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s just a personal opinion, you understand, but I think they carry those huge swords around \u2019cause they\u2019re compensating. When a guy runs around in a skirt for five hundred years, you gotta wonder about him, you know.\u201d</p><p>Corky snorted. \u201cSo true. The bastard who murdered my poor, beloved Casimir was wearing one of those stupid kilts. Those Scottish barbarians will never\u2014\u201d She gasped when the door crashed open and a horde of kilted barbarians rushed in at vampire speed.</p><p>On second look only Angus, Robby, Ian, and Dougal were wearing kilts. The others wore pants, but would probably enjoy being called barbarians.</p><p>Swords clashed upstairs, and Phineas realized some of Angus\u2019s team had engaged the guards on the ground floor.</p><p>He leaped on Corky and wrapped his arms around her. If she tried to teleport away, she\u2019d have to take him with her, along with his boot that still emitted a tracking beam.</p><p>Corky struggled against his hold. \u201cLet me go, you traitor!\u201d She froze, stunned by the sight of Robby zooming toward her with a silver chain stretched taut between his gloved hands. Not only would the silver burn if it came into contact with her skin, but it would prevent her from teleporting.</p><p>She shrieked.</p><p>\u201cRelease her!\u201d Dimitri yanked Freemont to his feet and jabbed a pistol against his temple. \u201cOr I\u2019ll kill him!\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s heart lurched. His brother would never be able to overpower a vampire. He shoved Corky toward Robby, then teleported behind Dimitri and wrenched the gun from his hand. He pulled back his arm to punch Dimitri, but the Russian vanished. Shit. The damned Malcontents were always running away.</p><p>But to his surprise, Dimitri didn\u2019t bail on his queen. He rematerialized behind Robby, who had looped the silver chain around Corky. A knife flashed in the bright studio lights.</p><p>\u201cRobby, behind you!\u201d Phineas shouted.</p><p>Robby spun to face his attacker and grabbed Dimitri\u2019s arm. Angus zoomed toward them and clunked the Russian on the head with the hilt of his claymore. Dimitri collapsed on the floor unconscious.</p><p>Meanwhile, Corky wiggled free from the silver chain, and just as Robby made a grab for her, she teleported away.</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d Robby and Angus shouted in unison.</p><p>A pall of disappointment fell with a whoosh over the room. They had taken everyone prisoner except the target.</p><p>\u201cShe got away?\u201d Freemont asked. \u201cCan you follow her?\u201d</p><p>With a curse, Phineas kicked the metal folding chair. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where she went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn,\u201d Freemont whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many booty-licious babes in one room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can hear you.\u201d Phineas cast an apologetic look at Caitlyn, Toni, and Lara, then leaned close to his brother. \u201cWatch what you say once their husbands arrive. They have super hearing and super strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Freemont stopped ogling the women and gazed forlornly at the leopard-skin fedora he\u2019d placed in front of him on the long wooden table.</p><p>They were sitting in a conference room at Romatech, waiting for the strategy meeting to begin. After the fiasco at Corky\u2019s hideout, Phineas had offered to teleport his brother back to DVN, so he could return the limo to Leroy\u2019s House of Class, but Freemont had insisted on sticking by his side.</p><p>\u201cA friend of yours is a friend of mine,\u201d Freemont had told him. \u201cAnd an enemy of yours is an enemy of mine. I\u2019ve got your back, bro, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>Phineas had pulled him into a hug, his heart swelling with love and pride. Then he\u2019d teleported Freemont to Romatech and introduced him to his friends.</p><p>The two mortals, Rat Face and Blockhead, had been teleported to Romatech, along with an unconscious Dimitri. The prisoners were downstairs in the basement, the mortals in an interrogation room, and Dimitri in the silver room to keep him from teleporting away.</p><p>\u201cI screwed up, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Freemont mumbled. \u201cThe old dude will never hire me now.\u201d</p><p>Phineas shifted in his chair. \u201cYou never know. Angus is pretty cool\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the bitch got away \u2019cause you had to save me. I should have stayed out of it, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d Phineas gave him an annoyed look. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to lay low?\u201d</p><p>Freemont winced and slumped lower in his chair. \u201cI totally blew it.\u201d</p><p>Most of the MacKay S&amp;I employees were busy elsewhere, but a few of the ladies had gathered early in the conference room. Across the table, a very pregnant Caitlyn Panterra was discussing baby things with Toni MacPhie.</p><p>\u201cAre all the women here knocked up?\u201d Freemont whispered.</p><p>\u201cToni and Caitlyn are,\u201d Phineas mumbled. These days, he was surrounded with happily married couples.</p><p>Lara di Venezia grinned at them. \u201cScary, isn\u2019t it? Olivia\u2019s expecting, too. I feel all alone these days.\u201d</p><p>Freemont sat up, smiling at the pretty redhead. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to keep you company.\u201d</p><p>Phineas nudged him with an elbow. \u201cLara is married to Jack, one of the best swordsmen in the vampire world.\u201d</p><p>Freemont huffed with disappointment. \u201cAre all the babes here married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery happily married,\u201d Phineas grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen LaToya lately?\u201d Lara asked him.</p><p>He groaned inwardly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lara\u2019s smile faded. \u201cI thought you might have gone to New Orleans for her birthday. I sent her a card last week, but I haven\u2019t heard back from her.\u201d</p><p>Phineas sighed. LaToya had never told him her birth date. Probably because she didn\u2019t want a present from him. Hell, who was he kidding? She\u2019d never wanted anything from him.</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d Freemont asked.</p><p>\u201cLaToya Lafayette,\u201d Lara replied. \u201cWe were roommates when we both worked for the NYPD. More than roommates, actually. Best friends. But she\u2019s never been able to accept the fact that I married a Vamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer,\u201d Freemont mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lara heaved a big sigh. \u201cI miss her. She moved back to New Orleans, and joined the police force there. You went to see her at Christmastime, didn\u2019t you, Phineas?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded.</p><p>Freemont eyed him curiously. \u201cYou have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Not unless there was a new tradition for mistletoe that involved a girlfriend threatening to shoot off her boyfriend\u2019s head. \u201cWe don\u2019t get along very well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it hasn\u2019t worked out for you,\u201d Lara said, then shook her head sadly. \u201cI tried so many times to tell her what a nice guy you are, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Phineas interrupted her. \u201cShe just doesn\u2019t like Vamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Lara agreed. \u201cSo you shouldn\u2019t take it personally. She would have rejected any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Phineas gritted his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>Lara gave him a dubious look, then thankfully turned her attention to Freemont. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry, but I heard you talking about MacKay S and I. Are you going to work with us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to.\u201d Freemont glanced at Phineas. \u201cIt would be buck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget you need to finish college,\u201d Phineas murmured.</p><p>Freemont rolled his eyes. \u201cI can do both. I\u2019m free for the rest of this summer. And I could take night classes from now on.\u201d He made a face. \u201cI\u2019m just afraid I blew my chance. The old dude\u2019s not going to want me now. I screwed up his last mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Lara insisted. \u201cVampires and shifters are stronger than us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters?\u201d Freemont\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat the hell is a shifter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d Lara whispered.</p> <p>Phineas winced. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>Freemont sat back. \u201cWhat do you mean? There\u2019s more spooky shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Some of the people you\u2019ll meet tonight aren\u2019t vampires. They\u2019re not exactly human, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re aliens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re from Earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Freemont exhaled with relief. \u201cThose aliens really freak me out. I mean, why do they travel a jillion light-years just to stick a probe up someone\u2019s ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not aliens,\u201d Phineas muttered, aware that the ladies in the room were snickering. \u201cThey\u2019re shifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how do they shift? Do they phase from one alternate reality to another?\u201d</p> <p>Phineas scoffed. \u201cWhat kind of crap have you been watching? There is no alternate reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d Freemont\u2019s gaze darted suspiciously around the room. \u201cBut how can you be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is it! Has anyone in the entire history of our planet ever found a portal to another dimension?\u201d</p><p>Freemont lifted a finger to make a point. \u201cIf they stepped through, then they\u2019re not here to tell us about it.\u201d</p><p>Lara chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s a good point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t encourage him,\u201d Phineas muttered.</p><p>\u201cSo how does the shifting thing work?\u201d Freemont\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI know! They ascend into a more advanced, spiritual form, one that goes beyond the restraints of a physical body, so they exist as pure transcendent energy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey shift into animals,\u201d Phineas repeated. \u201cLike wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean werewolves?\u201d Freemont stiffened, his expression tinged with panic. \u201cYou\u2019re messing with me, right? I mean, vampires are bad enough, but I figure they like to pick on the pretty ladies, so I\u2019m safe. But werewolves! They\u2019ll chew on anything. They\u2019re big! And bad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ll blow your house down.\u201d Phineas\u2019s smile quickly faded as the same old vision flitted through his mind. Pale blue eyes the color of a summer sky. Why did the most beautiful woman on Earth have to belong to the canine family? Stop thinking about her! Brynley was all wrong. And she hated Vamps even more than LaToya.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he do like most of the Vamp guys and fall for a nice mortal girl? A mortal girl would be safe. And logical.</p><p>Maybe Freemont was right, and he needed to go to a psychiatric hospital. He had to be crazy to have a female shifter constantly invading his thoughts. And not just any hairy old shifter, but a rich princess wolf who enjoyed snarling and growling at him. And that was when she was in human form.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not punkin\u2019 me?\u201d Freemont asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet Phil. He\u2019s a werewolf.\u201d And twin brother to Big Bad Wolfie-Girl. Don\u2019t think about her! If she knew how much he obsessed over her, she\u2019d probably bite off one of his ears. While she was still in human form. God knows what she\u2019d do to him as a wolf.</p><p>\u201cThere are other kinds of shifters, too,\u201d Lara added. \u201cHoward is a were-bear, and Rajiv\u2019s a were-tiger. Caitlyn here is a were-panther.\u201d</p><p>Caitlyn raised a hand in greeting. \u201cMeow!\u201d</p><p>Freemont gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re a cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment.\u201d Caitlyn grinned. \u201cThe lack of fur is a major clue.\u201d</p><p>Freemont\u2019s gaze drifted down and then back up. \u201cBut you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Still smiling, she patted her big belly. \u201cTwins.\u201d</p><p>He gulped and shifted his gaze to Toni. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most awesome creature on the planet,\u201d she replied with a wry look. \u201cA human female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go, girl.\u201d Lara gave her a high five.</p><p>Freemont gave Phineas an incredulous look. \u201cYour life just gets weirder and weirder.\u201d</p><p>The door swung open, and a group of MacKay employees filed in. Ian MacPhie and Jack di Venezia pulled up chairs to squeeze in next to their wives.</p><p>\u201cAnother cat?\u201d Freemont whispered when Carlos Panterra sat next to Caitlyn.</p><p>Phineas nodded. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the werewolf taking the chair beside you.\u201d</p><p>Freemont glanced warily at Phil, who gave him a wolfish grin.</p><p>At the foot of the table, Emma MacKay set Phineas\u2019s wallet and cell phone on the table and slid them down to him. \u201cOne of the mortal prisoners had them.\u201d</p><p>He pocketed them. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Emma took a seat. \u201cAngus will be here shortly to begin the meeting. Howard and J.L. are still at Corky\u2019s place, scouring it for clues. Robby and Olivia are handling the mortals. Rajiv\u2019s in the security office, keeping an eye on things, and we left Mikhail and Austin in the silver room to guard the Malcontent.\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cThey piss him off the most. Dimitri hates Mikhail for being a Russian on our side, and he hates Austin because he\u2019s immune to vampire mind control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you let me talk to him.\u201d A newcomer strode into the room, talking with a thick Russian accent. \u201cI would make him really mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Stan.\u201d Phineas gave him a knuckle pound as the former Malcontent passed by.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Stanislav,\u201d Emma said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t let any Malcontents know you\u2019re here, not with the bounty they\u2019ve put on your head.\u201d</p><p>Stan nodded, then sat next to Phineas. \u201cThat was good what you said in the interview. Maybe now my old friends not be so eager to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked yer interview.\u201d Ian\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cEspecially the part about Angus being a rich old fart.\u201d</p><p>Everyone chuckled, including Emma.</p><p>\u201cAnd then, ye told him to go to hell,\u201d Ian continued. \u201cWhat was it ye called him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old turd.\u201d</p><p>The laughter ended abruptly at the sound of Angus\u2019s stern voice. He stood in the doorway, his arms crossed over his chest as he glowered at Phineas.</p><p>Freemont gulped and gave Phineas a worried look.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to sound convincing,\u201d Phineas said.</p><p>Angus continued to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cIt was all an act, you know,\u201d Phineas added.</p><p>Angus strode toward him, then grinned and slapped him on the back. \u201cI was just playing with you, lad. Ye did verra well. Ye led us straight to our target.\u201d</p><p>Phineas winced. \u201cBut she still got away.\u201d</p><p>Freemont jumped to his feet. \u201cIt was my fault, sir. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>Angus turned to regard him curiously. \u201cYe\u2019re Phineas\u2019s brother? Freemont, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d He squared his shoulders. \u201cIt was my fault Corky escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d Phineas began.</p><p>\u201cWhy do ye say that?\u201d Angus interrupted, focused on Freemont.</p><p>\u201cMy brother told me to lay low, and I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Angus asked.</p><p>Freemont glanced at Phineas. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let him go into danger alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, so ye\u2019re verra loyal to yer brother?\u201d Angus narrowed his eyes. \u201cCan ye be that loyal to his friends?\u201d</p><p>Freemont nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Angus rested a hand on his shoulder. \u201cDoona blame yerself for what happened. \u2019Tis no easy task to capture a vampire. It took us years to catch up with Casimir. We\u2019ll get Corky, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Freemont looked relieved as he sat back down.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s get on with the briefing.\u201d Angus strode to the head of the table and gripped the back of the chair. \u201cSo far, Dimitri has told us nothing.\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cHe will once he gets hungry enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Angus agreed. \u201cBut we willna know if he\u2019s telling us the truth. Olivia\u2019s lie-detecting skills only work on mortals. She\u2019s verified our two mortal prisoners are telling the truth. They know nothing, other than the nonsense they were programmed to believe. They love Queen Corky and want to die for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will we do with them, then?\u201d Toni asked.</p><p>\u201cRobby will erase their memories, and we\u2019ll take them back to their homes,\u201d Angus replied. \u201cHopefully, they can go back to their normal lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we have no idea where Corky may have teleported to?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>Angus drummed his fingers on the back of the chair. \u201cWe can make a good guess. The Malcontents we encountered on the ground floor teleported away when they realized they were outnumbered. But we heard them talk to each other, and it sounded like Hungarian. And of course, Dimitri is Russian.\u201d</p><p>Ian leaned back in his chair. \u201cMost Malcontents are Eastern European or Russian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Angus nodded. \u201cAs for Corky\u2019s whereabouts, since Roman issued a warrant for her arrest here in the States, I doona think she\u2019ll remain here. She\u2019s declared herself the Malcontent queen, so I believe she\u2019ll seek refuge with them. She\u2019s originally from England, so she probably teleported there, and then plans to move on to Eastern Europe or Russia whenever it grows dark there.\u201d</p><p>Everyone murmured their agreement.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have three search teams working out of three different bases,\u201d Angus continued. \u201cOne in Moscow at Mikhail\u2019s house, one in Budapest at Zoltan\u2019s house, and the last one at Stanislav\u2019s house in Minsk. Emma and I will be in charge in Moscow, Robby and Stan in Minsk, and Jack and Lara will assist Zoltan in Budapest. We doona expect any trouble at the school, so Ian and Carlos, I apologize for separating you from yer wives when they\u2019re expecting, but we need every available man to help with the search.\u201d</p><p>Carlos touched his wife\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCaitlyn is due in about two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring you back in a week, or sooner, if need be,\u201d Emma assured him.</p><p>Angus went on to assign everyone, making sure each team had at least two day guards. Olivia, Toni, and Caitlyn, the three pregnant women, would remain behind to protect the Dragon Nest Academy, a fairly easy job since no Malcontents knew the school even existed.</p><p>\u201cPhineas, ye\u2019ll remain here at Romatech, in charge of security,\u201d Angus announced.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you needed every available\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to leave someone here in charge, and I trust you,\u201d Angus said.</p><p>Phineas sighed. He would have liked to see some faraway places, but he knew the other guys were better suited for the search. Jack could speak Czech and Italian. Austin knew several Slavic languages. Robby and Angus knew French and Russian. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an important job,\u201d Emma reminded him. \u201cOur attempt to capture Corky will have angered the few remaining Malcontents here in the States, and you know that Romatech is one of their favorite places to attack. We also need you to keep Roman safe.\u201d</p><p>Phineas nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Angus smiled. \u201cAnd since ye\u2019ll be here, ye can start yer brother\u2019s training. That is, if he\u2019s interested in working for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Freemont sat up. \u201cPhineas will train me real good. I\u2019ll be solid. Hard-core.\u201d</p><p>Angus nodded, his smile widening. \u201cI\u2019m sure ye will. Welcome to MacKay S and I.\u201d</p><p>Everyone at the table congratulated Freemont.</p><p>With a grin, Phineas gave his brother a knuckle pound. \u201cWay to go, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas can get you the forms to fill out,\u201d Angus said, then strode toward the door. \u201cAs for everyone else, gather the weapons and supplies ye need. We start teleporting to the London office in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>A week passed by at Romatech with Phineas and Freemont manning the MacKay security office at night. Eventually, Freemont would guard Vamps during the day, but with most of the Vamps overseas hunting for Corky, there weren\u2019t many left behind, just the night shift at Romatech. Phineas and his brother were responsible for their safety\u2014Vamps like Roman, Laszlo, and Gregori, and a few mortals like Gregori\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Abigail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a mortal security team that worked out of a separate office during the day, and they guarded Romatech\u2019s mortal employees. Most of the day shift was blissfully unaware of what happened at Romatech after sunset. That was when the night shift came in to make Vampire Fusion Cuisine.</p><p>For right now, Freemont needed to work the same hours as his brother so Phineas could train him. They began with lessons in fencing and martial arts, and they practiced marksmanship in the shooting range in the basement. Freemont also learned how to make the rounds and file reports.</p><p>With so many MacKay employees out of the country, it was quiet at Romatech. Roman\u2019s usual day guard, Howard Barr, was in Budapest, so whenever Roman wasn\u2019t working at Romatech, he teleported to the Dragon Nest Academy, where his wife, children, and mother-in-law were now living.</p> <p>Angus and his Vamp employees e-mailed their reports to Phineas since they were awake while he was in his death-sleep. The shifters, Howard, Carlos, and Phil, called to give him updates. So far, no luck in tracking down Corky. To help out, Phineas made an old-fashioned wanted poster with Corky\u2019s picture on it and faxed it to every vampire Coven Master and shifter contact on Angus\u2019s list.</p><p>The Malcontent prisoner, Dimitri, had been released after a tracking device had been embedded in the back of his neck while he was in his death-sleep. They couldn\u2019t be sure how long the device would remain on Dimitri, but it was worth a shot in case he tried to reunite with his queen. According to the device, he was still in the Brooklyn area, hanging out with the few Russian Malcontents who remained there. Roman\u2019s father-in-law, Sean Whelan, had his CIA Stake-Out team watching the Russian Coven House. No sign of Corky there.</p><p>After a few nights, Phineas decided his brother could handle a few hours on his own, so he agreed to do another Blardonnay commercial. The next night, he teleported to DVN, where his costar, Tiffany, was waiting, along with Gordon, the director, and Maggie, the producer.</p><p>This time, the set was made to look like a tropical island. The backdrop showed a lush green rainforest to his right and a tropical blue lagoon to his left. Lighting had been set up to look like there was a full moon overhead.</p><p>He stood ankle-deep in white sand with a brightly striped beach towel tied around his hips. Tiffany wore a red bikini that emphasized her considerable talents. After a few takes, Gordon and Maggie declared the commercial a great success and broke open a few bottles of Bubbly Blood to celebrate.</p> <p>Maggie poured some of the synthetic blood and champagne concoction into a flute glass and handed it to Phineas. \u201cYou really have a flair for this. Any of the soap operas would snatch you up in a minute.\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of Bubbly Blood. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun, but I don\u2019t want to quit my job at MacKay.\u201d</p><p>Maggie gave him a sly smile. \u201cSo you like working for that rich old fart?\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cThat was acting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s my point. You\u2019re good at it, Phineas. If you ever need another job, you can find one here. They\u2019re getting a lot of disappointed e-mails that you\u2019re not going to appear on the soap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d He had announced a possible acting gig during his interview with Stone, but it had been a sham. Since then, Stone had reported on the Nightly News that contract negotiations had fallen through. \u201cI like working for MacKay. When I was a mortal, I totally screwed up, but now that I have a second chance, I want my life to count for something. I want to be one of the good guys.\u201d</p> <p>Maggie\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cYou are a good guy, Phineas. We\u2019re all very proud of you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. Only the married women seemed to think that way.</p><p>\u201cI have some good news.\u201d Maggie refilled their flute glasses with more Bubbly Blood. \u201cSince Corky\u2019s show is off the air, and there\u2019s a gap in the schedule, Darcy Erickson and I pitched an idea for a new show, and they bought it!\u201d</p><p>Phineas clinked his glass against hers. \u201cThat\u2019s great! Congratulations!\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cDarcy and I are so excited! I was getting kind of tired of working on the ranch, and Darcy\u2019s been wanting to quit MacKay S and I now that she has two kids. So now we\u2019re coproducers of DVN\u2019s new celebrity talk show, Real Housewives of the Vampire World!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn, woman! That\u2019s gonna be a hit!\u201d</p><p>Maggie laughed. \u201cI hope so! We\u2019re going to travel to different locations to interview wives of famous vampires. We\u2019ll tour their houses or castles or wherever they\u2019re living, and what\u2019s really cool is that Darcy can record what their homes look like during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Darcy was the only Vamp Phineas knew of who had managed to become mortal once again. The procedure couldn\u2019t work on him, though, because he didn\u2019t have a sample of his blood from when he was mortal.</p> <p>\u201cCan you imagine actually seeing things in daylight?\u201d Maggie asked. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be an image on television, of course, but I think it will be very exciting for Vamps.\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s chest tightened. He would love to see a blue sky again. His world was now black with shades of gray, and it would remain that way for centuries. A pair of sky-blue eyes invaded his thoughts, but he quickly chased the image away. Brynley was impossible. As impossible as his chances to ever see the sky again.</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Maggie. Vamps are going to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather Echarpe has agreed to be our first victim, so we\u2019re off to Texas tomorrow to start filming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d Phineas said his good-byes to everyone, then teleported back to Romatech.</p><p>Still no luck in finding Corky. According to the latest reports, Angus, Mikhail, and Phil were following a lead in Siberia. Zoltan, Jack, and Carlos were investigating another lead in Bulgaria, while Stan, Robby, and Austin were checking out a nest of Malcontents in Lithuania. The rest of the MacKay employees remained at the bases comparing reports and searching for new leads.</p><p>Sean Whelan and his Stake-Out team were still watching the Russian vampires in Brooklyn. The tracking device on Corky\u2019s minion, Dimitri, was still working, and he had remained at the Russian Coven House.</p><p>At the end of the week, Phineas received a call from the police chief in Wolf Ridge, Maine. Wolf Ridge was a werewolf community near the compound Angus had confiscated from the Malcontent Apollo. The compound was now used as a summer camp for the werewolf boys who attended Dragon Nest Academy.</p><p>\u201cWe got your wanted poster regarding the female vampire,\u201d Chief explained. \u201cAnd we may have a possible lead for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has seen her?\u201d Phineas couldn\u2019t imagine Corky hiding out in the northern wilderness of Maine.</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d Chief replied. \u201cBut my sons are on all the Lycan loops and chat rooms, and they heard something interesting. Some werewolf guys were hunting in Wyoming and came across an unconscious mortal. When they took him to the local emergency room, they discovered he\u2019d lost a lot of blood and had two puncture wounds in his neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s a vampire in Wyoming,\u201d Phineas concluded, not terribly impressed. There were thousands of vampires around the world.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a normal place for a vampire,\u201d Chief continued. \u201cThe area is too sparsely populated. Anyway, after the mortal gained consciousness, he said the last thing he remembered was a beautiful blonde with huge breasts who approached his campfire at night and asked for help. He thought it was his lucky day.\u201d</p><p>Phineas snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky to be alive. The description sounds sorta like Corky, so I\u2019ll check into it. Thanks, Chief.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Freemont was sitting in front of the desk, munching on a hamburger from the Romatech cafeteria.</p><p>\u201cA possible lead on Corky.\u201d Phineas paced across the security office. \u201cOr more like impossible. Wyoming is the last place we would expect her to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words\u201d\u2014Freemont popped a French fry into his mouth\u2014\u201cit\u2019s the perfect place for her to hide.\u201d</p><p>Phineas halted. Could it be true? Could Angus have ninety-nine percent of his employees on a wild-goose chase halfway around the world while Corky was hiding in their backyard?</p><p>\u201cI need to call Angus.\u201d Although he was probably in his death-sleep right now. Phineas grabbed the phone off the desk and dialed Angus\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dr. Phang,\u201d Phil answered. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot some news, Wolf-Bro.\u201d Phineas repeated what Chief had told him.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Phil murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll pass it on to Angus as soon as he wakes up. But you can guess what he\u2019ll say. He\u2019ll expect you to check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be the one checking it out,\u201d Phineas insisted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that place in Wyoming, and you know the territory.\u201d Phil Jones\u2019s father was Supreme Pack Master of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, so Phil had grown up there. He owned a bunch of land and a cabin in Wyoming, a gift he\u2019d received on his eighteenth birthday.</p><p>In the werewolf world, Phil had the status of a prince, which meant his sister, Big Bad Wolfie-Girl, was a princess. Don\u2019t think about her. Phil had been banished shortly after acquiring the cabin, and over the following years, his sister had used the site to hide other young werewolf boys who were banished. Now the Lost Boys lived at Dragon Nest Academy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stuck here in middle of Siberia,\u201d Phil grumbled. \u201cI can\u2019t leave Angus and Mikhail unguarded, and I doubt they\u2019ll want to teleport me back when we\u2019re following a legitimate lead here. Why don\u2019t you go? You\u2019ve teleported to my cabin before, so you know the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave Romatech unguarded. My brother\u2019s here, but he\u2019s a rookie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Freemont gave him an indignant look.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Phil continued, \u201cRoman and Gregori aren\u2019t helpless. They know how to fight. They\u2019ll be fine with your brother. And if Roman thinks it\u2019s too dangerous, then he can close Romatech for a few nights and take a vacation. He won\u2019t mind. He wants Corky captured as much as anyone. She\u2019s making a mockery of his position as Coven Master.\u201d</p><p>Phineas took a deep breath. Phil was making a lot of sense. He would discuss the matter with Roman, but it was a safe bet that Roman would urge him to check out this latest lead. As Coven Master of East Coast Vampires, Roman couldn\u2019t afford to have his authority questioned and his court decisions blatantly ignored.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Phineas conceded. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d But he still didn\u2019t know his way around Wyoming. \u201cDo you think any of your werewolf boys from school could go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, but I\u2019m not sure if Toni will let them go right now. You\u2019ll have to check with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let Angus know what\u2019s happening. I\u2019ll e-mail a report when I have more details.\u201d Phineas hung up.</p><p>Now he\u2019d have to teleport to the Dragon Nest Academy. And she was there. Phil\u2019s twin sister, Big Bad Wolfie-Girl. If he was lucky, he\u2019d get in and out without having to see her. And her beautiful sky-blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll be in charge here? And you\u2019re going to Wyoming?\u201d Freemont stuffed the last bite of hamburger into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Think you can handle it?\u201d</p><p>Freemont nodded with his mouth full.</p><p>Phineas took a deep breath. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll be headed out West with a couple of werewolf boys.\u201d</p><p>Freemont snickered. \u201cYee haw! Git along, little doggies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not possible,\u201d Toni MacPhie said, seated behind the administrator\u2019s desk in the main office of the Dragon Nest Academy. \u201cWe start finals in a few days, so we need all the students to remain here.\u201d</p><p>Phineas groaned inwardly. It was dangerous for a Vamp to go into strange territory alone. Without a day guard, he would be too vulnerable while in his death-sleep.</p><p>He glanced at Phil\u2019s wife, Vanda, who perched on the corner of Toni\u2019s desk. She was a Vamp, so she couldn\u2019t guard him during the day, but it was better than being alone. \u201cHow about you? Want to come hunt for Corky?\u201d</p><p>Vanda snorted. \u201cI\u2019d love to see that bitch in chains. She tried to sue me for a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did assault her,\u201d Toni murmured. \u201cYou practically squeezed her head off on live television.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe deserved it!\u201d Vanda protested. \u201cShe was rude to Ian.\u201d</p><p>Toni grinned. \u201cI know. I was cheering for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you want to come, Vanda?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>She made a face. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be much help. I\u2019m as useless as you are during the day. And I\u2019ve never ventured very far from the cabin, so I don\u2019t know the area at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think Corky could be there?\u201d Toni asked with a dubious look. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem like the Wild Wild West type to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur husbands call us every day, and they\u2019re not finding her,\u201d Vanda said. \u201cMaybe Corky\u2019s doing the unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know for sure until I check it out,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t spare one wolfie-boy?\u201d</p><p>Vanda ran a hand through her spiky purple hair. \u201cNormally, one of the seniors could help you, but not now. They can\u2019t graduate if they don\u2019t take their final exams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan one of them postpone his tests for a week?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>Toni shook her head. \u201cTheir final in Werewolf Studies requires them to shift, and the moon will be full three nights from now. I\u2019d send Davy with you\u2014he graduated last year\u2014but with Phil gone, we need him here to administer the test.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d Vanda jumped to her feet. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of this before? There\u2019s a perfect solution.\u201d She gave Toni a pointed look. \u201cRight down the hall in the teachers\u2019 lounge.\u201d</p><p>Toni sucked in a deep breath. \u201cOf course!\u201d She and Vanda smiled slowly and turned toward Phineas.</p><p>He stepped back. The glint in their eyes looked downright suspicious. Surely, they weren\u2019t thinking\u2014</p> <p>\u201cNo one knows the territory better,\u201d Toni said. \u201cShe grew up there.\u201d</p><p>With a gulp, he stepped back again. Oh no. Hell no.</p><p>\u201cAnd she could guard you during the day,\u201d Vanda added.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d probably kill me,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Vanda exchanged another sly smile with Toni, then gave Phineas a wide-eyed innocent look. \u201cYou know of whom we speak?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not setting me up with her,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a job, not a date.\u201d Vanda\u2019s eyes twinkled with humor. \u201cUnless you would like a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking Big Bad Wolfie-Girl with me, and that\u2019s final!\u201d</p><p>Toni\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cBig Bad Wolfie-Girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a term of affection to me,\u201d Vanda murmured.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Phineas shouted. \u201cWhy would I have any affection for her when she hates me?\u201d Why, indeed? He had to be crazy.</p> <p>Toni stood. \u201cWe\u2019ll just ask her about it.\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s breath caught. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask her. I know why she hates me. I\u2019m a Vamp. She hates all Vamps\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Phineas,\u201d Toni interrupted him. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to ask her if she\u2019ll go to Wyoming with you.\u201d She strode toward the door.</p><p>\u201cBut I told you I\u2019m not taking her,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a wuss,\u201d Vanda fussed at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine with Brynley.\u201d Her mouth twitched. \u201cAs long as you follow her Three-Step rule.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Toni snickered. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask her. We\u2019ll get her. She\u2019s just down the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Vanda accompanied Toni into the hallway, and he heard their poorly concealed laughter.</p> <p>His hands curled into fists. This was bad. He couldn\u2019t share a cabin with Brynley Jones. It would be sheer torture. In many ways. She would torment and tease him. He would waffle between wanting to jab at her or jump her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t jump her. She was the daughter of the most powerful werewolf Pack Master in North America, a rancher with huge amounts of land, money, and influence. She was a freaking princess.</p><p>And he was a poor Vamp from the Bronx. If he laid a finger on her, she\u2019d probably bite it off. Hell, she\u2019d chew all ten of his digits down to mere stubs, and then her father would sic a pack of werewolves on him to rip apart the rest of this body.</p><p>Her dad was already pissed that his eldest son, Phil, had married vampire Vanda. Pissed enough that he\u2019d disowned Phil and declared his second son the heir to his empire.</p><p>So as much as Phineas was tempted by Brynley, he didn\u2019t dare pursue her. For her sake, as well as his own. She could end up disowned and rejected by her own people. She could lose her status as princess.</p><p>Jumping her was out of the question, so all that was left was jabbing at her to keep her at a distance. And since she always poked back, that had to mean she didn\u2019t want anything to do with him. Why would she? She could have her pick of any werewolf in the world. Someday her prince would come. And he\u2019d be a rich and hairy Alpha dude who howled at the moon and pissed on fire hydrants.</p><p>Phineas hated him already. He hated this whole situation. Tension coiled inside him, threatening to spring into full panic. He couldn\u2019t allow Brynley to accompany him. He had to find someone else. Fast.</p><p>LaToya. She knew about Vamps and could guard him during the day. If he could explain how much he needed her help, she might agree to come with him. As a police officer, she understood the importance of catching bad guys.</p><p>Anger seethed inside him that he was forced to beg a favor from a woman who had rejected him. Damn. What a desperate fool he was. He\u2019d do anything to avoid being with Brynley.</p><p>He pulled out his cell phone, then recalled LaToya\u2019s threat to never answer a call from him. He grabbed the phone off Toni\u2019s desk, so the call would come from the Dragon Nest Academy.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, LaToya.\u201d There was a pause, so he quickly told her what was going on before she could hang up. \u201cSo what do you say? You could have an all-expense-paid vacation in Wyoming while we hunt down a nasty vampire villain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to be stopped, LaToya. She betrayed vampires in the worst way, and she\u2019s killed mortals. The world would be a safer place if you help me bring her in.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, then LaToya finally spoke. \u201cCan\u2019t you find someone else? Why don\u2019t Lara and her husband go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara\u2019s in Budapest. I told you, all the MacKay employees are across the world. There\u2019s no one else available. I wouldn\u2019t have called you if I wasn\u2019t desperate.\u201d</p><p>LaToya sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t take a week off work on such short notice. And frankly, I\u2019m too busy chasing down live criminals to worry about the Undead ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really bad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she is, but you need to find someone else to help you. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d He stopped her from hanging up. \u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t like vampires, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI know Lara is happy with Jack, and I know she\u2019ll eventually become a Vamp, too. It\u2019s her life and her decision, so I\u2019m trying to be understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re starting to accept Vamps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose Lara, so I\u2019ve decided to accept Jack for her sake.\u201d</p><p>Phineas bit back a sharp reply. Three years it had taken her to come this far? If she hadn\u2019t been so damned slow, he might have had a chance with her.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to get the wrong idea,\u201d LaToya continued. \u201cJust because I\u2019m making an exception for Jack, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m accepting the rest of you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m morally opposed to the whole vampire thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain. I know why you rejected me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you understand,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cEven if you were mortal, I wouldn\u2019t go out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d All this time he\u2019d thought it was his Undeadness that turned her off. It wasn\u2019t personal, he\u2019d told himself.</p><p>LaToya huffed. \u201cThe problem is you, Phineas. I just don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cSo who do you think is the father?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>Brynley shrugged and stuffed a handful of popcorn into her mouth. She was in the teachers\u2019 lounge at the Dragon Nest Academy with Sarah, a mortal who taught preschool and elementary grades; Teddy, another mortal who served as headmaster and taught math and science; and Marta, Vanda\u2019s vampire sister who worked in the office.</p><p>The vampire sisters. Brynley couldn\u2019t see either of them without being reminded of the sister she\u2019d had to leave behind. She missed Glynis something awful, and that just added fuel to the anger that simmered inside her. She couldn\u2019t even call Glynis. Her father might trace the call and find her.</p><p>They were watching the soap opera All My Vampires on the Digital Vampire Network. One of the Vamps, rich and debonair Rodrigo, had a gold-digging mortal wife named Lola, and he\u2019d just discovered she was pregnant. Since all his sperm was dead, she\u2019d obviously cheated on him.</p><p>\u201cCould be the pool boy,\u201d Marta suggested.</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d Teddy wrinkled his nose. \u201cHe\u2019s only sixteen years old.\u201d</p><p>Brynley shook her head as she gathered another handful of popcorn. That wasn\u2019t too young for the Three-Step rule.</p><p>Marta used the remote control to mute a commercial for custom-made coffins. Room for two, lined with red silk, and equipped with a built-in ice chest for stashing a few bottles of Bubbly Blood.</p><p>The vampire version of a love nest, Brynley thought with a snort. She crammed more popcorn into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the gardener,\u201d Marta continued.</p><p>\u201cOr the mailman.\u201d Sarah reached for the popcorn.</p><p>Brynley passed her the bowl. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised she cheated on Rodrigo. Who would want to be married to a vampire? The guy is literally dead all day.\u201d</p><p>Sarah aimed a flirtatious smile at Teddy, who sat beside her on the couch. \u201cI definitely prefer a live boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back, regarding her with a look akin to worship.</p><p>True love. With an inward groan, Brynley sank deeper into her comfy chair.</p><p>Marta sipped from her bottle of Chocolood. \u201cNot all of us asked to be vampires, you know.\u201d</p><p>Brynley leaned her head back, frowning at the ceiling. She knew Marta and her sister, Vanda, had both been attacked and turned by a Malcontent. Same thing with Phineas. It wasn\u2019t his fault he was a Vamp, but it still stuck in her craw.</p><p>She hated vampires. She hated the way they\u2019d existed for centuries by seducing the innocent so they could feed off them. They were naturally seductive, damn them. Gorgeous, mysterious, powerful, charming\u2014it was all part of their vampire allure. And these Vamp men who took on the role of superheroes, battling the forces of evil, they were even more seductive because they appeared to be good. But if she looked past the fa\u00e7ade, she could see their true nature. They were still vampires. Parasites. Users.</p><p>And she hated users more than anything. She\u2019d grown up surrounded by them. Werewolves who catered to her powerful father in hopes of using him, while he encouraged it so he could use them in return. It was a constant, never-ending game of deceit and manipulation, and she\u2019d spent most of her life as an unwitting pawn, forced to exist in an atmosphere that made her feel like a helpless, trapped bargaining chip. Used.</p><p>She was alone now, alone with her anger and resentment. She\u2019d escaped the Lycan world, but had landed in the Undead world with another group of users. They\u2019d used her brother for years, keeping him away from his pack and his family. Keeping him away from her when she\u2019d needed him the most. Sure, it had been Phil\u2019s choice to remain far away from the pack. But he\u2019d abandoned his own twin sister. He\u2019d chosen vampires over her.</p><p>She hated them. And she hated how damned susceptible she was to vampire allure.</p><p>Especially from Phineas.</p><p>She sat up to reach for the popcorn bowl, then halted with a jerk, her gaze riveted on the television screen.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Marta set down her bottle of Chocolood. \u201cIt\u2019s the new Blardonnay commercial! Look at Dr. Phang!\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah, she was looking. Brynley bit her bottom lip to keep the drool from escaping. Phineas was gorgeous. Broad shoulders, bulging biceps, and corded muscles that deliciously defined his bare chest and abs. He was standing on a beach with a striped towel tied around his hips. The beach was obviously fake, but who gave a damn when Phineas was standing there, proud and defiant liked a bronze god.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Sarah breathed. \u201cWhat a chest.\u201d</p><p>Teddy rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cQuick! Unmute it!\u201d Brynley snatched the remote away from Marta and punched the mute button. She couldn\u2019t miss hearing his voice.</p><p>\u201cHello, ladies.\u201d Phineas\u2019s deep voice filled the room.</p><p>An electric thrill sizzled through Brynley. Oh God, his voice could melt chocolate. It certainly left her feeling all warm and gooey.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so handsome!\u201d Marta exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Brynley hushed her so she wouldn\u2019t miss anything he said.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to join me on the beach?\u201d Phineas focused his dark chocolate eyes on the camera with an intensity that made Brynley forget to breathe.</p><p>\u201cLook at the man beside you,\u201d Phineas continued. \u201cNow look at me. Him? Or me?\u201d The camera zoomed in on his chest. \u201cYes, ladies. You made the right choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Sarah breathed.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Teddy gave her an injured look.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so hot,\u201d Marta whispered.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Brynley hushed them again.</p><p>The camera pulled back to show a beautiful blonde jogging toward Phineas, her breasts jiggling in her skimpy red bikini. \u201cOh yes, Dr. Phang! I want you!\u201d</p><p>He gave her a seductive look. \u201cOf course you do. Now look at my hand. Yes, I have the family jewels.\u201d</p><p>The blonde gasped, then the camera jumped to Phineas\u2019s hand. In his palm was a stash of loose diamonds and rubies.</p><p>\u201cOh, Dr. Phang! What lovely stones you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll for you, baby.\u201d In a flash, the jewels were gone, and Phineas was regarding her sternly, his fists planted on his narrow hips. \u201cWhat do you have for me?\u201d</p><p>The camera shifted to a bottle clutched in her hand. \u201cI brought your favorite drink\u2014Blardonnay!\u201d</p><p>Phineas smiled. \u201cA moonlit beach, you, and Blardonnay\u2014what more could a man want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could think of something.\u201d The blonde leaned into him and caressed his muscular chest.</p><p>Brynley\u2019s hands curled into fists.</p><p>\u201cLater, baby. First, we\u2019ll enjoy our Blardonnay, and then\u2014\u201d He whipped off his towel.</p><p>Marta and Sarah squealed. Brynley\u2019s heart lurched up her throat.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t naked, but the little swimsuit he had on left no doubt that the Love Doctor was truly gifted in his field of expertise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Dr. Phang.\u201d The blonde\u2019s hand drifted down his washboard abs. \u201cLet me pop your cork.\u201d</p><p>Phineas took the bottle from her and gazed into the camera. \u201cRemember, ladies. If you want me, you\u2019ll want my Blardonnay.\u201d</p><p>Brynley dragged in a shaky breath as the commercial ended. Another one started, one for Vampos, the vampire after-dinner mint guaranteed to get rid of blood breath, and she muted it.</p> <p>\u201cI just love the Blardonnay commercials!\u201d Marta exclaimed. \u201cPhineas is so hot!\u201d</p><p>Brynley clenched her jaw shut. Stay cool. Don\u2019t let anyone know how strongly he affects you.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy, too,\u201d Sarah added. \u201cHe helped rescue Lara and me at Apollo\u2019s compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds wonderful. And so hot!\u201d Marta gave Brynley a sly look. \u201cDon\u2019t you think he\u2019s hot?\u201d</p><p>She squeezed the remote in her fist. Did they suspect her true feelings? \u201cHe\u2019s a Vamp. He\u2019s not my type.\u201d</p> <p>Marta scoffed. \u201cHandsome, muscular hunks aren\u2019t your type?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m used to werewolf guys. They\u2019re all well built. Phineas is nothing special.\u201d</p><p>Toni chuckled as she strode into the room. \u201cThen you won\u2019t mind seeing him. He\u2019s waiting for you in the main office.\u201d</p><p>The remote control tumbled from her hand.</p><p>Vanda grabbed it off the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this while you go talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brynley whispered in a faint voice.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to talk to him.\u201d Vanda\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cYou remember how to talk?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. Phineas was here? He wanted to see her?</p><p>\u201cDr. Phang is here?\u201d Marta pressed a hand to her chest. \u201cOh my gosh, do you think he would give me an autograph?\u201d</p><p>Sarah lifted a hand. \u201cI\u2019d like one, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here for me,\u201d Brynley snapped, then winced at the fierceness of her tone. Dammit. She was too much on edge. Her inner wolf had wakened and jumped to her defense.</p><p>She softened her voice. \u201cI\u2019ll ask him about the autographs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! Thanks!\u201d Marta exchanged an amused look with her sister, Vanda.</p><p>Anger sparked inside Brynley. They were finding her situation humorous. She sprawled in her chair as if she had no intention of getting up for a week. \u201cOn second thought, I have no interest in seeing him at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not too keen about seeing you, either,\u201d Vanda said wryly.</p><p>Her fingers dug into the chair\u2019s upholstery. \u201cThen why is he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs help.\u201d Toni quickly explained his mission to Wyoming and why she\u2019d had to refuse his request for assistance from the werewolf boys. \u201cBut then we realized you were the perfect solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Vanda agreed. \u201cYou know the territory, and you can guard him during the day.\u201d</p><p>Brynley\u2019s heart raced. Her inner wolf trembled, ecstatic at the thought of returning home. But how could she live alone with Phineas in a tiny hunting cabin? Guard him? \u201cI\u2019d be more tempted to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Toni snickered. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he said.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Somehow that hurt, coming from him. He didn\u2019t trust her. Hell, he didn\u2019t even like her. He was always calling her ugly names like Snout-Face. She couldn\u2019t do this.</p><p>She needed a legitimate excuse, and unfortunately, she had a doozy. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can go back to Wyoming. My father would hunt me down and force me into a marriage against my will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you find yourself in a bad situation,\u201d Vanda said, \u201cthen Phineas can simply teleport you back here.\u201d</p><p>Only at nighttime. During the day, he was useless. He couldn\u2019t protect her against the numerous minions that her father controlled. She crossed her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>Everyone regarded her with disapproving frowns. Even her inner wolf snarled at her.</p><p>\u201cCorky must be brought to justice,\u201d Teddy said.</p><p>\u201cNot my problem,\u201d Brynley muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s a vampire thing.\u201d</p><p>Toni helped herself to some popcorn. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s how you feel, you\u2019ll have to tell him no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Vanda sat next to her sister, Marta. \u201cYou can tell him.\u201d</p><p>Brynley remained seated, her anger spiking. One more game of manipulation. They thought it was amusing to force her to talk to Phineas. She jumped to her feet. \u201cFine! I\u2019ll tell him to buzz off. And I\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>She marched down the hall, then halted in the office doorway, ready to berate him from afar before making a quick exit.</p><p>He was on the phone, his back to her, and her extra-sharp hearing could pick up the voice that was talking to him.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is you, Phineas. I just don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>Brynley\u2019s breath caught. Who was this woman?</p><p>Phineas stiffened. \u201cYou should have told me that before I wasted two and a half years pursuing you.\u201d</p><p>The voice on the phone heaved an exasperated sigh. \u201cSheesh, I was trying to chase you away from the beginning. It\u2019s not my fault if you were too stupid to get the message.\u201d</p><p>Brynley\u2019s eyes narrowed. This lady was a real bitch.</p><p>\u201cI was being persistent,\u201d Phineas muttered. \u201cI thought I could win you over with time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be won over,\u201d the bitch insisted. \u201cNot by a former drug dealer.\u201d</p><p>Brynley\u2019s jaw dropped. What the hell? Phineas had a dark past?</p><p>\u201cI told you I could explain that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it! I\u2019m subjected to stories all day long from the criminals I bring in. It\u2019s never their fault. They\u2019re always innocent. They\u2019re just victims. Blah, blah, blah. It\u2019s all a bunch of bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a criminal, LaToya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. There\u2019s an outstanding warrant for your arrest. And if drug dealing isn\u2019t bad enough, you have this whole Love Doctor thing that really turns me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a joke,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cI thought it would make you laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a clown?\u201d</p><p>Brynley shook her head. This LaToya bitch was a judgmental shrew. She didn\u2019t deserve Phineas.</p><p>\u201cI never trusted you!\u201d LaToya\u2019s voice rose. \u201cI know you\u2019re a sleazebag. You\u2019re always coming on to women with your slimy Dr. Phang routine. \u2018I\u2019m the Love Doctor and I\u2019ve got the cure.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Brynley\u2019s hands balled into fists. Now the bitch was mocking him. She affected a sweet, but loud voice that LaToya would be sure to hear. \u201cOh, Phineas, darling! When are you coming back to bed?\u201d</p><p>He jumped. The receiver popped from his hand and clattered onto the desk as he whirled around.</p><p>She smirked at the flabbergasted look on his face. \u201cOh, please, Phineas! Make love to me one more time! No one makes me scream like you.\u201d</p><p>A shriek erupted from the phone. \u201cYou see? I knew you were a womanizing asshole! If you ever call me again\u2014\u201d</p><p>Phineas snatched up the receiver. \u201cNot a problem. You\u2019ll never hear from me again.\u201d He slammed the receiver down, then glared at Brynley. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? You have no right to interfere in my personal life.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to listen to her anymore. She\u2019s a bitch.\u201d</p><p>He glowered at her. \u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. \u201cInstead of insulting me, you should be thanking me. I helped you get rid of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you do. I heard you need someone to guard your dead carcass during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dead carcass is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cThen who\u2019s going to keep the field mice from nibbling on your toes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep my boots on.\u201d</p><p>She took a step toward him. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for you to be alone during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when would I be safe with you?\u201d</p><p>Ouch. He really didn\u2019t trust her at all. She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cI can show you around Wyoming and help you with your mission.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you volunteering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hard of hearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father? I thought you ran away from him. You\u2019re not afraid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou calling me a coward?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Phineas studied her a moment, his dark eyes searching her own.</p><p>She stared back, determined not to back down. But dammit, he could probably hear her heart racing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the bravest woman I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Her chest tightened. She didn\u2019t know what to say, so responded by crossing her arms. She had to be crazy, agreeing to go to Wyoming with him. But she hated the way that bitch LaToya had treated him. He deserved better than that.</p><p>And there was another reason. Ever since she\u2019d run away from home, her inner wolf had grown increasingly pervasive. She could feel it inside her now, snarling and demanding to go home. It didn\u2019t care about Phineas or Corky. It just wanted to go home.</p><p>Phineas cleared his throat, drawing her attention. \u201cVanda said you would want me to follow a Three-Step rule?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. Holy cow, she\u2019d been set up. She might have to kill Vanda for this. And that would really upset her brother.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your rules?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I don\u2019t think they apply to you.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cWhy not? Because I\u2019m a Vamp?\u201d</p><p>Because you don\u2019t like me. She quickly changed the subject. \u201cBefore I forget, Marta and Sarah want your autograph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Brynley snorted. \u201cBecause Marta wants to steal your identity and become the next Blardonnay guy. She\u2019ll look great, topless with a towel around her hips. I don\u2019t think anyone will notice the difference.\u201d</p><p>Phineas frowned at her. \u201cI don\u2019t have breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan-boobs.\u201d Brynley motioned toward his chest. \u201cThey do stick out a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s muscle!\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand dismissively. \u201cThe autographs, please. Your rabid fans are waiting.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a pen and pad of paper off the desk. \u201cOne to Marta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and one to Sarah.\u201d</p><p>He scrawled their names and his signature on two pieces of paper, then handed them to her. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want one?\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cI know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He tossed the pen and pad of paper on the desk. \u201cCan you be ready to leave in thirty minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She stuffed the autographs in her jeans pocket. \u201cI suggest you pack more than a beach towel and your skimpy little swimsuit. You\u2019ll need boots, a hat, and a jacket. You\u2019re only alive at night, and it can get chilly then. And make sure you bring plenty of bottled blood.\u201d</p><p>His brow arched. \u201cAfraid I\u2019ll bite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid I will?\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward her. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>It was obvious he didn\u2019t trust her. She lifted her chin in defiance. \u201cAre you worried, Phineas? You should be. Who knows what I\u2019ll do to you when you\u2019re completely helpless and totally at my mercy. I painted Connor\u2019s fingernails pink, you know.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted with a wry look. \u201cDo you enjoy playing with dead bodies, Brynley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I just enjoy seeing you dead, bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnout-Face.\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cI know you hate Vamps, so why are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI heard you were desperate. Must be your charming personality. It\u2019s left you all alone with no one to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m charming enough that you agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was your last choice.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted some of the boys to go with you, but they can\u2019t leave school. I\u2019m the last one you wanted.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened as he stared at her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look away, even though her heart pounded in her ears.</p><p>He lifted a hand, then stopped with his fingers a mere inch from her cheek. \u201cYou have no idea what I want.\u201d</p><p>The intensity of his gaze made her arms pebble with gooseflesh.</p><p>He stepped back, lowering his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll return for you in thirty minutes.\u201d His form wavered, then vanished.</p><p>She dragged in a deep breath to calm her racing heart, then reached up to press her fingertips against the cheek he\u2019d come so close to touching.</p><p>Oh God, what had she gotten herself into? She\u2019d let her emotions dictate her actions. And her inner wolf. It was thrilled to be going home. Excited that in a few nights, it would be running through the forest, feeling completely free.</p><p>As a teenager, she\u2019d been trained to pay attention to the desires of the inner wolf. Its instincts were raw and simple. Animalistic, but blatantly honest. Trust the wolf, the elders had always told her. The wolf knows best.</p><p>But this time, she feared the wolf was wrong. Going to Wyoming was dangerous. If her father found her, he\u2019d drag her back home. She would end up losing her freedom.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t let Phineas know she was hopelessly attracted to him. She\u2019d have to be strong. And ruthless. Or she might end up losing her heart.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you wearing?\u201d Brynley demanded.</p><p>\u201cPolite, as always,\u201d Phineas muttered. Thirty minutes had passed, and he\u2019d returned to the main office at the Dragon Nest Academy to pick up Brynley. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced down at his stylish new clothes. Maybe a little too stylish, but Leroy of Leroy\u2019s House of Class had personally selected his new Western wardrobe with assurances that he looked one hundred percent authentic.</p><p>He hooked his thumbs into the snakeskin belt that sported a huge buffalo-shaped brass buckle. \u201cI\u2019m dressed like a cowboy now. I thought it would be best to fit in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? On stage at the Grand Ole Opry?\u201d Brynley moved closer and skimmed her fingertips across his white silk shirt. \u201cFringe?\u201d</p> <p>His chest expanded in response to her touch, so he stepped back, out of her reach.</p><p>Her gaze lifted to his head. \u201cOh, God help us. Your hat is . . . sparkly.\u201d</p><p>He removed the black Stetson. All the cowboy hats at Leroy\u2019s House of Class had sparkled. Some had sparkled all over. He\u2019d thought he\u2019d done well, selecting a plain black hat with a narrow band of red sequins. \u201cI went with the understated look. It seemed more buck.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The black hat matches the black fringe on my shirt, and the red sequins go with the embroidered red roses. But Leroy wanted me to pick the red hat, because it had lots of sequins and some feathers\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough!\u201d She snatched the Stetson out of his hands, ripped the red sequined band off, then tossed the hat onto the desk, where it landed next to her plain leather handbag and duffel bag. \u201cMaybe I can find some scissors to cut off the fringe.\u201d She rummaged in a drawer.</p><p>Phineas frowned. \u201cIs it that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to live through the night? If we go into a bar with you looking like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would we go into a bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ask questions. We\u2019re hunting for Corky, right? You go around looking like that, and I\u2019ll have to break some arms.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot during the day. You\u2019ll be totally helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sleeping in the basement during the day. And my clothes won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d He gave her a pointed look. \u201cI won\u2019t be wearing any.\u201d</p><p>She gulped.</p><p>Damn but he enjoyed shocking her.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Her cheeks blushed a pretty pink as she slammed the desk drawer shut. \u201cYou\u2019ll still have to wear clothes when you\u2019re awake, so I\u2019ll run up to my brother\u2019s room and see if he has anything you can borrow.\u201d Her gaze drifted over him once again. \u201cYou look about the same size. Actually, those . . . jeans you\u2019re wearing will do just fine.\u201d</p><p>Was it his imagination or did her eyes linger on his groin area a little too long? \u201cAre you sure? I didn\u2019t know if I should go with a zipper or a button fly. I\u2019ve got a zipper here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine!\u201d Her blush deepened. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She rushed from the office.</p><p>He took a seat, smiling to himself. There was something about Big Bad Wolfie-Girl. He was always tense with excitement around her. Part of him longed to touch her. The other part urged him to run. Fast. No doubt, that was the part controlled by his brain. Unfortunately, his brain never worked well around her.</p> <p>She was part animal, that was the problem. It gave her a wild, aggressive nature, and that appealed to a primitive need inside him. An ancient and raw caveman need to possess her.</p><p>But the civilized part of him knew Brynley was not the kind of woman who should ever be possessed. She was a free spirit. A wolf. A princess.</p><p>She would always be beyond his reach.</p><p>He drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly. In the last thirty minutes, he\u2019d zipped through a bunch of tasks as quickly as possible. He\u2019d stocked an ice chest full of bottled blood, then he\u2019d teleported it to the cabin.</p><p>It had been a few years since he\u2019d been to Phil\u2019s cabin in Wyoming, and a quick inspection had left him pleasantly surprised. Phil had modernized the place into a vacation home for himself and Vanda, and it now had electricity and running water. A bathroom and utility room had been added onto the back of the cabin.</p><p>It was still basically one room\u2014combination den and kitchen with a table and chairs, and some furniture arranged around a large stone fireplace. A trapdoor led to the basement, which was now furnished with a king-sized bed. A second bed was in the loft above the kitchen, which could be reached by climbing a ladder.</p><p>He made several trips to the cabin, teleporting back and forth from Romatech. He brought a laptop and Internet card, plus a stash of weapons and ammo from the security office. Then he raided the cafeteria for food to stock the refrigerator and pantry. Brynley was doing him a big favor, agreeing to go with him, so he wanted to make sure she was comfortable.</p><p>With the cabin ready, he turned his attention to himself. The MacKay uniform of khaki pants and navy polo shirt wasn\u2019t going to blend in. He needed to remain as inconspicuous as possible. Freemont told him there was Western wear at Leroy\u2019s House of Class, so he made a quick trip there.</p><p>Freemont also remembered there was a great pair of cowboy boots in the wardrobe closet at DVN, so Phineas teleported there to grab them. Back at Romatech, Laszlo had embedded a tracking device into one of the boots while he packed a duffel bag with underwear, socks, T-shirts, jeans, toiletries, and his fancy new shirts from Leroy\u2019s House of Class.</p><p>He teleported the duffel bag to the cabin, then back at Romatech, he went over all the job details with Freemont one more time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, dude,\u201d Freemont assured him. \u201cI got it covered. Besides, you\u2019re just a phone call away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be sure I\u2019ll always get a connection,\u201d Phineas warned him. \u201cI\u2019ll be out in the middle of werewolf country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Big Bad Wolfie-Girl.\u201d Freemont snickered.</p><p>Phineas winced. He shouldn\u2019t have shared that name with his little brother. \u201cThis is a business trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I know what kind of business the Love Doctor\u2019s into.\u201d Freemont slapped him on the back. \u201cJust don\u2019t let her bite you.\u201d</p><p>Phineas groaned inwardly as he waited in the school office. He had to be crazy, taking Brynley with him. He glanced at his watch. She\u2019d been gone ten minutes. Maybe she\u2019d changed her mind about going. To his surprise, that thought didn\u2019t bring him relief, but a twinge of sadness.</p><p>He enjoyed being with her, looking at her beautiful sky-blue eyes, creamy skin, and mane of wild hair. He even enjoyed the way she prodded and poked at him. It was a challenge to keep up with her. And fun.</p><p>A smile tugged at his mouth when he recalled how she\u2019d given LaToya a shock. She\u2019d been outrageous, calling him back to bed, claiming he made her scream. He\u2019d known, of course, that she was joking, but his groin had still responded. Now he had to wonder\u2014why had she come to his defense? Had she felt angry on his behalf?</p><p>No, he pushed that thought aside. She hated vampires. She\u2019d made that clear many times in the past. Still, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder. Had she objected to his clothes because she enjoyed picking on him, or was she trying to protect him? And if she was concerned about protecting him, was she doing it out of a sense of duty or because she actually liked him?</p><p>He sighed. He needed to stop looking for emotions that didn\u2019t exist. He\u2019d wasted two and a half years imagining that LaToya actually liked him. How pathetic it would be to make the same mistake twice.</p><p>He heard footsteps approaching and rose to his feet.</p><p>Brynley entered with a few shirts draped over her arm. Behind her, a group of women hurried into the room. Toni, Caitlyn, Olivia, Marta, Vanda, and Sarah. They greeted him as Brynley dropped the shirts on the desk.</p><p>He nodded at them. \u201cHello, ladies.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged looks and giggled.</p><p>\u201cI told you he\u2019d say it,\u201d Sarah whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe sounded just like he does on TV,\u201d Marta added.</p><p>Olivia smiled at him. \u201cWe really enjoy your commercials, Phineas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Brynley shook out a plaid shirt and gave the women an annoyed look. \u201cYou heard his sexy voice. You can go now.\u201d</p><p>Sexy voice? Phineas studied her, not sure what to think. One time she\u2019d told Connor and Marielle that he had a tight ass, but he could never figure out if she was complimenting him or insulting him.</p><p>\u201cTry this on.\u201d She handed him the shirt.</p><p>He glanced at the blue plaid shirt, then at the other women. They showed no sign of leaving.</p><p>\u201cCome on, guys.\u201d Brynley waved her hands to shoo them away. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he be embarrassed?\u201d Vanda asked. \u201cHe has a great chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he has to know it,\u201d Marta added. \u201cWhy else would he show it off on television?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Did people think he was an exhibitionist? \u201cI\u2019m sure the clothes will fit. Brynley and I need to get going.\u201d</p><p>The women all moaned with disappointment.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dr. Phang,\u201d Sarah whined. \u201cWe\u2019re your biggest fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, get a grip,\u201d Brynley fussed at them. \u201cIt\u2019s just a chest. If you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all.\u201d</p><p>Oh really? Phineas had a sudden desire to prove her wrong. He dropped the blue plaid shirt on the chair, then unbuttoned his fringed shirt with vampire speed and tossed it on the floor.</p><p>The ladies squealed and clapped, but he ignored them, focusing only on Brynley to see how she reacted. Her gaze darted over him, then quickly looked away as if she wasn\u2019t interested.</p><p>With so many people in the room, he found it difficult to focus on her heartbeat alone, but he could swear that hers was the one that was pounding the fastest. And her cheeks were blushing again. She was affected, dammit. He could feel it.</p><p>His own heartbeat sped up as he put on Phil\u2019s blue plaid shirt. Instead of buttons, there were snaps. A vision flitted through his mind of Brynley popping all the snaps open as she ripped off his shirt. And then they would get naked and it would be\u2014</p><p>\u201cA perfect fit!\u201d Vanda announced.</p><p>He jumped. Oh, she meant the shirt. He pushed aside the vision.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d Marta clapped her hands. \u201cNow we can send you off to Wyoming looking your best.\u201d</p><p>Toni stepped forward to shake his hand. \u201cBest of luck to you and Brynley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He was going to need luck. And a lot of cold showers.</p><p>All the women shook his hand and hugged Brynley. Vanda stuffed her husband\u2019s shirts into a Dragon Nest Academy tote bag and handed it to him.</p><p>Brynley swung her handbag over her shoulder and grabbed hold of her duffel bag. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d She approached him hesitantly.</p><p>He slipped a hand around her waist to draw her closer. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to hold on to me when we teleport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how it works,\u201d she muttered, then placed her hands on his shoulders while staring at a white button on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up here,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her gaze lifted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s debatable. Can we go now?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her closer. \u201cYou need to hold me tighter.\u201d</p><p>She made a face but slipped her hands around his neck. \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at the ladies, who were still watching with smiles on their faces. \u201cGood-bye, ladies.\u201d</p><p>They waved as everything went black.</p><p>Brynley hung her shirts and jeans in the armoire in the loft. She\u2019d packed light for this trip, knowing the cabin now boasted a washer and dryer and a fully stocked bathroom.</p><p>She had to admit she was impressed by how much Phineas had managed to do in thirty minutes. The pantry and refrigerator had food, and the kitchen table was covered with pistols, knives, two rifles, and ammo. She\u2019d figured their first task would be a trip to the grocery store and gun shop, but it was all taken care of.</p><p>She climbed down the ladder to the ground floor, then peered through the open trapdoor. He\u2019d gone down into the basement a few minutes earlier to settle in.</p><p>Since Phil and Vanda came here often on vacation, the basement had been made cozier for Vanda\u2019s death-sleep. It now sported a real bed and bedroom furniture, two recliners, and a flat-screen television. Obviously, Phil spent a lot of time down there with Vanda.</p><p>\u201cNeed any help?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m almost done,\u201d he called up.</p><p>\u201cYou took down the ladder.\u201d She spotted it on the cellar floor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it. I can levitate in or out.\u201d</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me coming down there to check on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. Once I fall into my death-sleep, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just afraid of what I\u2019ll do.\u201d She straightened with a smile. \u201cI think I\u2019ll draw a rainbow and unicorn on your chest with permanent markers. It\u2019ll be so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d he growled, suddenly behind her.</p><p>She squealed, jumped away from him, and teetered on the edge of the open trapdoor, her arms flailing.</p><p>He grabbed her and pulled her back against his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She spun away from him and shoved him hard in the chest. \u201cDon\u2019t ever attack me from behind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t attack you. I rescued you.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him, her heart pounding, her whole body trembling. Tears blurred her vision, and she blinked them away. Her inner wolf hissed. Dammit. She hated to show any weakness. \u201cYou teleported behind me. Don\u2019t ever do it again.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Damn. He was wondering why she\u2019d freaked. She strode toward the kitchen area. Get a grip. \u201cI think we should eat while we wait.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He closed the trapdoor. \u201cWait for what?\u201d</p><p>She exhaled with relief. He wasn\u2019t going to ask why she\u2019d freaked. \u201cTransportation.\u201d</p><p>She opened the refrigerator and took out a bottle of blood for him and a cola for herself. \u201cWhile you were busy bringing supplies here, I was busy, too. I called a few female friends who live close by, and they agreed to help us. They both have sons at Dragon Nest.\u201d She unscrewed the top off her cola. \u201cI have to warn you, though. If we run into any werewolf guys, you have to act like you never met these women. If their husbands find out\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019d get in trouble for helping you?\u201d Phineas stuck his bottle of blood into the microwave. \u201cWhy? Because you left home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because of the Lost Boys at school. They were all banished.\u201d Brynley took a sip of cola. \u201cThat means they\u2019re dead to the pack, and their families can\u2019t have anything to do with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been. The dads go along with it \u2019cause it\u2019s the law, and they don\u2019t want to get kicked out, too. The pack is everything to them. But the moms\u2014well, they tend to see things differently. No pack can tell them to stop caring for their children.\u201d</p><p>Phineas nodded. \u201cGood for them.\u201d</p> <p>Lights flashed outside.</p><p>\u201cThat could be one of them now.\u201d Brynley rushed to the front window and peered through a narrow gap between the window frame and the curtains. She needed to make sure it was Sherry or Trudy before stepping outside. \u201cIf it\u2019s one of my father\u2019s men, I\u2019ll hide in the laundry room while you go outside to meet him.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at Phineas. \u201cTell him you\u2019re one of Phil\u2019s friends, and he\u2019s letting you stay here a few days. Don\u2019t let him inside the cabin. He might pick up my scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Phineas strode to the kitchen table and loaded a clip into an automatic pistol.</p><p>A pickup truck pulling a horse trailer came to a stop in the gravel driveway.</p><p>Brynley exhaled in relief as she saw a woman emerging from the truck. \u201cIt\u2019s Trudy. Corey\u2019s mom.\u201d She rushed over to her handbag she\u2019d left on the sofa, pulled out two envelopes, then hurried out the front door.</p> <p>\u201cTrudy!\u201d She met her in front of the truck.</p><p>\u201cBrynley!\u201d Trudy hugged her, then stepped back to look her over. \u201cYou\u2019re looking good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. And thank you so much for helping us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do. How is Corey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s great. I saw him about thirty minutes ago and told him I\u2019d be seeing you, so . . .\u201d Brynley waved an envelope in the air.</p><p>\u201cHe wrote to me?\u201d Trudy snatched the letter from Brynley\u2019s hand and pressed it to her chest. \u201cThank you! I thank God every day that you were able to find a home and a school for my boy. Is he eating all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. The food is great at Dragon Nest. I swear I\u2019ve gained five pounds\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a gasp, Trudy stiffened.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brynley turned to see what Trudy was staring at with such an alarmed look.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man on the porch,\u201d Trudy whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Phineas. Remember, I said there would be two of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s . . .\u201d Trudy stepped closer. \u201cHoney, he\u2019s not one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good guy, a friend of my brother\u2019s.\u201d Brynley glanced back at Phineas, who was staring into the woods, frowning. No doubt he could hear everything with his supersensitive vampire ears.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re alone here with him?\u201d Trudy asked. \u201cIf your father finds out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d Brynley gave her a pointed look. \u201cYou never saw him. Or me. Just like we never saw you.\u201d</p><p>Trudy took a deep breath. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Brynley glanced at the horse trailer. \u201cYour husband isn\u2019t going to wonder why two of your horses are missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was invited to your dad\u2019s ranch in Montana for the monthly hunt, and you know he can\u2019t refuse that. So he\u2019ll be gone for a full week.\u201d</p><p>Brynley nodded. Her father held a huge hunt every month at the full moon. No werewolf would dare refuse an invitation from the Supreme Pack Master. It was considered a great honor. \u201cHave you seen my sister lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few weeks ago.\u201d Trudy gave her a sad smile. \u201cYou miss her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Brynley looked away, determined not to get emotional.</p><p>\u201cWell, let me get these horses into the barn for you.\u201d Trudy strode to the back of the horse trailer. \u201cAnd I brought some hay in case you didn\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect. Thank you.\u201d Brynley followed her, then noticed Phineas had come down the front steps to stand on the grass.</p><p>\u201cHorses?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She walked toward him. \u201cIn case we need to go off-road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what four-wheelers are for?\u201d He grimaced at the first horse being led out of the trailer.</p><p>Brynley smiled slowly. \u201cYou\u2019ve never ridden a horse before, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever wanted to,\u201d Phineas muttered.</p><p>The horse pranced about, clearly upset.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s too happy about it, either,\u201d Phineas added.</p><p>\u201cShe,\u201d Brynley corrected him. \u201cThat\u2019s a mare. And she\u2019s probably nervous because she\u2019s picking up your scent. It would be different from ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not one of you.\u201d</p><p>She winced. So he had heard Trudy\u2019s remark. \u201cI\u2019m afraid werewolves tend to be a bit clannish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit?\u201d he asked wryly.</p><p>She shrugged as she watched Trudy lead the mare and a gelding toward the barn. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned over the centuries that it\u2019s best to stick together. It\u2019s basic self-preservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would a horse get upset over my scent?\u201d Phineas asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you guys smell like a pack of wolves? How do you even keep horses and cows? It\u2019s like a fox guarding the chicken coop. Seems like they\u2019d get one sniff of you and run away.\u201d</p><p>Brynley grinned. \u201cMy father\u2019s been ranching for over a hundred years. The animals are used to our scent. Come on, help me get the hay into the barn.\u201d</p><p>With Phineas\u2019s superior vampire strength, he had no trouble transporting whole bales of hay to the barn. Brynley introduced him to Trudy, then brought her up-to-date on her son\u2019s progress at school while Phineas finished moving the hay.</p><p>A Honda Civic pulled up next to the pickup truck, and Brynley and Trudy strode from the barn to greet the driver.</p><p>\u201cSherry!\u201d Brynley hugged her. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Sherry handed her the car keys. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours for a week. And the tank is full. How is Gavin doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s great.\u201d Brynley retrieved the second envelope from her jacket pocket. \u201cHe wrote a letter for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh thank you!\u201d Sherry grabbed the envelope. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes for both of us,\u201d Trudy said.</p><p>Sherry\u2019s gaze shifted to Phineas as he emerged from the barn. \u201cIs that young man staying here with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung is right,\u201d Trudy murmured. \u201cI think he\u2019s only about twenty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Sherry\u2019s mouth twitched as she regarded Brynley. \u201cAre you a wolf or a cougar, girl?\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth. As far as she was concerned, she didn\u2019t look any older than Phineas. Sure, she was thirty, but as soon as werewolves reached maturity, their aging process slowed to a near halt. That was how they managed to live for five centuries.</p><p>And although Phineas had been transformed at a young age, that was a few years ago. They had to be fairly close to each other\u2019s age now.</p><p>With a start, she realized she was mentally defending herself and Phineas as a couple. And they weren\u2019t. They couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Sherry\u2019s eyes widened as she caught Phineas\u2019s scent. \u201cHe\u2019s not one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Brynley ground out.</p><p>\u201cA shame,\u201d Trudy said. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly strong. You should have seen him tossing around those bales of hay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Sherry gave Brynley a pointed look. \u201cGreat stamina, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know about that,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d Sherry added, then she and Trudy snickered.</p><p>Brynley sighed. They thought Phineas was her mortal boy toy. A logical mistake, since werewolves tended to be highly sexual creatures. \u201cThis is a business trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Trudy murmured. \u201cBecause there\u2019s so much business going on around here.\u201d</p><p>Brynley glanced over at Phineas. He was standing by the barn, pretending not to listen, but there was a definite glint of amusement in his eyes.</p><p>She turned back to the women. \u201cThank you for helping us. And remember, you didn\u2019t see us here.\u201d</p><p>Sherry nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d Trudy asked her.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Sherry climbed into the passenger seat of the pickup, then Trudy drove off, pulling the empty horse trailer behind her.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Brynley waved the car keys in her hand as Phineas approached. \u201cWe\u2019ve got wheels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd horse power.\u201d Phineas glanced back at the barn, frowning.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s our first move?\u201d Brynley asked.</p><p>\u201cWe track down the guy who was bitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he didn\u2019t remember much.\u201d</p><p>Phineas shrugged. \u201cI can use vampire mind control to take a look inside his head.\u201d</p><p>Brynley grimaced. She hated the way vampires could manipulate people\u2019s minds. \u201cBloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth curled up. \u201cSnout-Face.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Phineas frowned as he slipped a knife into the sheath he\u2019d attached around his calf so that it nestled just inside his cowboy boot. He\u2019d made one simple decision, that they would teleport to the medical clinic, and Brynley had gone ballistic.</p><p>He recalled the way she\u2019d reacted when he\u2019d teleported behind her. She\u2019d yelled at him then, and now she was shouting again. Were all werewolves this high-strung? She was behaving like one of those overbred, expensive little dogs that yapped all the time. He couldn\u2019t recall Phil ever acting like this. Apparently, the little princess was used to always getting her way.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this!\u201d She glared at him, her hands on her hips. \u201cI go to all this trouble to make sure you have a car, and you don\u2019t even want to use it?\u201d</p><p>He tugged his pants leg down and straightened. \u201cI explained why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t appreciate what I\u2019ve done. Or the trouble those ladies went to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s drive the damned car!\u201d</p><p>Yap, yap, yap. Would he have to put a muzzle on her? \u201cBrynley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I want to be more than just a babysitter for you when you\u2019re dead. I want to help you when you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>That gave him pause. It didn\u2019t sound like something a spoiled princess would say. He dragged a hand over his short hair, wishing he could figure her out. \u201cYou are helping. I\u2019m really glad we have the car. At some point, we\u2019ll need it.\u201d He wasn\u2019t so sure about the damned horses, though. \u201cI thought it was very clever, the way you arranged it all.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cNow you\u2019re just being condescending.\u201d</p><p>Damn, she was touchy. \u201cI mean it. I think you\u2019re very clever. And brave. You and your friends have got this whole underground female liberation thing going on. And you\u2019re the leader. It\u2019s radical. Rebellious. Totally cool.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks turned pink. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is big. And it\u2019s gutsy. I like it.\u201d</p><p>She looked away and waved a dismissive hand. \u201cSomeone had to help the Lost Boys.\u201d</p><p>Phineas blinked when it finally clicked. She had trouble accepting a compliment. And that seemed really strange. A princess should be used to flattery, but obviously, Brynley wasn\u2019t.</p><p>What if he\u2019d misinterpreted other things about her? He\u2019d always thought her anger stemmed from being a spoiled princess who would throw a temper tantrum if she wasn\u2019t getting her way. But what if she was angry because she never got her way? What if her prickly nature was due to a lifetime of criticism rather than compliments?</p><p>It was a bizarre theory, so he needed to put it to the test one more time. \u201cYou know, your brother\u2019s really proud of you. Brags about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>Her blush deepened. She opened her mouth to speak, then closed it and looked away.</p><p>Amazing. She didn\u2019t know what to do with a compliment. And even more amazing\u2014he\u2019d found a guaranteed way to shut her up. It was sad, though, if she\u2019d grown up never receiving any kind words. He knew she\u2019d run away from home because her dad had tried to force her into an unwanted marriage. Maybe the dad had a long history of being an overbearing jerk.</p><p>He slipped on a shoulder holster. \u201cYou know what I really like about your underground rebellion? The way you\u2019re sticking it to your dad.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cI . . . he . . . this has nothing to do with him. And I still think we should take the car.\u201d</p><p>Man, did she change the subject in a hurry. Some major denial going on. He strongly suspected dear old dad was the source of her problems. Which meant, he thought with a wry smile, that he and Brynley had something in common after all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she wasn\u2019t the spoiled princess he had thought. She\u2019d risked everything to help the Lost Boys, and she\u2019d given up her cushy life when she ran away from home.</p><p>Damn. The more he got to know her, the more he liked her. And admired her. Don\u2019t think about it. Stick to business.</p><p>He checked his automatic pistol to make sure it was loaded, then slipped it into the shoulder holster. \u201cThe hospital is in Buffalo. It could take over an hour to drive there, and we can teleport there in just a second.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a twenty-four-hour emergency room,\u201d she argued. \u201cThere\u2019ll be people there. We can\u2019t just pop in and scare everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that.\u201d He slipped a large sheepskin jacket on to conceal his weapon. \u201cI can erase people\u2019s memories if I need to.\u201d</p><p>She made a face at him. \u201cYou seem awfully eager to use your vampire mind control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem awfully sensitive about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying you\u2019d better not try it on me. Mess with me and I\u2019ll mess with you while you\u2019re in your death-sleep. I could do something terrible like . . . donate one of your kidneys.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have no desire to invade your brain.\u201d Her body, yes, but not her brain. \u201cSome places are just too scary to visit.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m so complicated you\u2019d get lost and never find your way out.\u201d</p><p>That was the problem. He wouldn\u2019t want to find his way out.</p><p>He checked the information he\u2019d written about the emergency room. \u201cI\u2019m going to call now and teleport. Are you coming with me?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI can\u2019t let any werewolves see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d He extended a hand toward her. \u201cI can protect you.\u201d</p> <p>She took a small step in his direction. \u201cCan you avoid using my name in public? My dad\u2019s a powerful landowner, so even mortals could recognize my name. And if the news gets back to him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d He slipped his hand around her waist and urged her closer. \u201cWe have to keep you secret.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound paranoid about it. I just don\u2019t want to be forced to marry against my will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never let that happen.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how ruthless my father can be.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her tightly around the waist. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how determined I can be.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and her heartbeat accelerated. \u201cWhy are you willing to protect me?\u201d</p><p>Because no matter how much she fussed and snarled, it was music to his ears. When he breathed in her scent, he was in heaven. And when he gazed into her sky-blue eyes, an eternity wasn\u2019t long enough.</p> <p>But he couldn\u2019t tell her that, so he shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t like people to be unhappy.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou don\u2019t even consider me \u2018people.\u2019 You call me Snout-Face.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and tapped the end of her nose. \u201cBut it\u2019s such a beautiful snout.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open, drawing his gaze there. Soft, luscious lips, ripe for kissing and sweet to taste. He pulled her close, and his groin hardened as her lips turned a rosy pink.</p><p>She inhaled sharply. \u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened with the sudden realization that the whole cabin was now tinted pink. And that could mean only one thing. His eyes had turned red.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d He looked away, squeezing his eyes shut. Shit. He\u2019d gotten hot from just touching her nose?</p><p>\u201cAre you all right? You look like you\u2019re in pain.\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just a vampire thing. It\u2019ll pass.\u201d Although it was difficult to ignore her sweet body pressed up against his.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me a minute.\u201d He zoomed at vampire speed into the bathroom and splashed cold water on his face. Shit. He hadn\u2019t made it through one night without his eyes betraying him. His attraction to her was stronger than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. What he needed was self-control. He pictured a snowy blizzard in his mind, then a pack of growling wolves. Bared teeth. Snapping jaws. They hated him. They wanted to rip him to shreds. And Brynley was leader of the pack.</p><p>He opened his eyes. His image didn\u2019t show up in the bathroom mirror, but the room was no longer pink, so his vision must have returned to normal.</p><p>He dashed back to the table and grabbed his cell phone. \u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d He dialed the number of the emergency room and wrapped an arm around Brynley without looking at her.</p><p>When a woman answered, he teleported, taking Brynley with him.</p><p>Nothing? Ha! Brynley glanced quickly around the emergency room\u2019s waiting area. It was empty, except for the mortal receptionist. No werewolves in sight. She was safe. Safe enough to freak out over what had just happened. If it was nothing, why had Phineas run off so fast to the bathroom?</p><p>A vampire thing? That was a huge understatement. She knew good and well what red glowing eyes meant. Vanda had explained it to her and the angel, Marielle. A vampire\u2019s eyes turned red when he wanted sex.</p><p>And that meant Phineas was attracted to her! Her heart lurched up her throat. Why hadn\u2019t she realized this before? Well, how could she when the rascal was always tormenting her and calling her Snout-Face? That was not the way to win a woman\u2019s affections.</p><p>Her heart plummeted. The conclusion was obvious. Phineas was rude because he didn\u2019t want to win her affections. That was why he\u2019d shot off to the bathroom like the hounds from hell were after him. He didn\u2019t want to get involved with a werewolf.</p><p>Well. She squared her shoulders. She didn\u2019t want to get involved with a vampire, so there. They were even.</p><p>And alone.</p><p>It was a bloody shame. While all the Lycan males would want her for her werewolf status, Phineas rejected her for it.</p><p>Her heart sank even further. His red glowing eyes were probably nothing more than an indication that he was susceptible to the Three-Step rule. It was a theory she\u2019d come up with years ago that at any given time, a man\u2019s thoughts were only three steps away from sex. She should have known it would apply to Phineas. He was about the sexiest man she\u2019d ever met. He was probably attracted to every woman he met, and his eyes were constantly turning red.</p><p>After all, he called himself the Love Doctor. And he was the Blardonnay Guy, too. Every woman who watched DVN wanted him. She had a sudden urge to slap his handsome face. And then kiss it to make it better. She groaned inwardly. The man had no right being so sexy. It had to be that damned vampire allure.</p><p>She glanced at him. He\u2019d been quiet since they arrived, but she figured his brain was busy zapping the receptionist with vampire mind control. He approached the receptionist\u2019s desk, staring intently at the woman sitting there. The nurse had gasped when they\u2019d teleported into the waiting room, but now she was simply gazing at Phineas with a blank look.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI believe you had a patient here a few days ago with bite marks on his neck?\u201d</p><p>Brynley joined him at the counter. \u201cCan you tell us his name?\u201d</p><p>The nurse looked at her, then shook her head slightly as if she were dispelling cobwebs from her mind. \u201cAre you from the newspaper? We figured you guys would show up eventually with a bunch of questions, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t discuss the case with you.\u201d</p><p>Phineas leaned close to Brynley and whispered, \u201cYou messed up my control. Let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>She shot him an irritated look, but he ignored her and refocused on the nurse, who soon regained her glassy-eyed blank expression.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re from the Centers for Disease Control.\u201d He whipped out his wallet and flashed a credit card at her.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The nurse nodded. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Inspector Mc\u2014\u201d Phineas halted, obviously having second thoughts about using his real name.</p><p>\u201cMan-boob,\u201d Brynley finished for him.</p><p>He stiffened.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Inspector McMan-boob?\u201d the nurse asked.</p><p>He gritted his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s muscle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInspector Muscle?\u201d the nurse asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Exactly.\u201d He gave Brynley a triumphant look. \u201cAnd this is my assistant, Nurse\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d Brynley corrected him.</p><p>\u201cDoctor . . .\u201d He glanced down at her chest. \u201cA-cup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-cup!\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to prove it.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cMaybe I will.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk, he turned back to the nurse. \u201cWe need to see the file on the patient who came in with bite marks.\u201d</p><p>She stood. \u201cThat would be Jason Pritchard. One moment, please.\u201d She wandered into the adjoining office that housed the file cabinets.</p><p>Brynley leaned close to him and whispered, \u201cI know why a Vamp\u2019s eyes turn red. Vanda told us.\u201d She stifled a grin when he visibly gulped. Let him worry about that for a while.</p><p>He glanced at her with a stern look. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later.\u201d Again his gaze dropped. \u201cDoctor B-cup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInspector McMan-bo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s muscle,\u201d he interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d He turned back to the nurse as she came forward with the file. \u201cThank you.\u201d He opened it on the counter.</p><p>Brynley sidled up closer so she could see what was in the file. The top page listed all the vital information about Jason Pritchard.</p><p>Phineas handed that page to the nurse. \u201cWill you make a copy of this for us, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Inspector Muscle.\u201d She took the paper and strode into the adjoining office.</p><p>Phineas pointed at the bottom of another page. \u201cHe was released this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Brynley glanced over her shoulder when she heard the emergency room door opening, then quickly turned her back as a man entered and his scent wafted toward her.</p><p>Werewolf.</p><p>Beside her, Phineas stiffened. He opened his jacket, the side without the shoulder holster, then abruptly pulled her against his chest and covered her halfway with his jacket.</p><p>Brynley let out a surprised and muffled moan, her face pressed against his chest. A very hard chest. He\u2019d been right about the muscle.</p><p>She listened to the werewolf\u2019s steps as he approached the receptionist\u2019s desk and came to a stop behind her. She winced. He would smell werewolf, too. Hopefully, he would think the scent was coming from Phineas.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the damned nurse?\u201d the werewolf growled. \u201cI think I cracked a rib.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gotta hurt,\u201d Phineas said with a sympathetic tone.</p><p>Obviously, this werewolf wasn\u2019t an Alpha, Brynley thought. Or he would have simply shifted to wolf form and back to heal himself.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I fell off a damned ladder,\u201d the werewolf grumbled. \u201cWhat are you here for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s my girlfriend here. Betsy. She\u2019s in a lot of pain.\u201d</p><p>Brynley let out a miserable-sounding moan.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, darlin\u2019.\u201d Phineas patted her on the back. \u201cWe\u2019ll get your medication. Don\u2019t go psycho on me again, okay?\u201d</p><p>Psycho? She pinched him underneath his jacket and heard him wince.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got leprosy, you know,\u201d Phineas continued. \u201cGoes a little crazy when a body part falls off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the werewolf squeaked.</p><p>Brynley smiled as she heard him scurrying to the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your paper, Inspector Muscle,\u201d the nurse said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Phineas answered. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Betsy.\u201d He steered her toward the door with her face still hidden beneath his jacket.</p><p>She exhaled with relief as they stepped onto the sidewalk.</p><p>Phineas paused. \u201cOkay, I released the nurse from my control, and she won\u2019t remember us. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Brynley ran around to the back of the building with him. \u201cLeprosy? You made me a leper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked. It kept the wolf dude away from you.\u201d He stuffed the paper from the clinic into a jacket pocket as he scanned their surroundings. \u201cCoast is clear. Let\u2019s teleport back.\u201d</p><p>With a smile, she slipped her hands around his neck. \u201cThank you for protecting me, Inspector Muscle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, Betsy B-cup.\u201d His dark chocolate eyes twinkled as he flashed his perfect smile at her, and a flood of desire almost knocked her off her feet.</p><p>She tightened her grip around his neck. She\u2019d felt twinges before around Phineas, pleasant little bursts of lust that passed quickly, but this\u2014this was a strong surge that swept over her entire body and clung to her, refusing to let go. This was a desire that went past the physical. It was seeping into her soul.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He knows. She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both are.\u201d His eyes glinted with a hint of red, then everything went black.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Much to Brynley\u2019s disappointment, Phineas simply let go of her when they arrived at the cabin. He didn\u2019t even look at her, just retrieved the paper about Jason Pritchard from his jacket pocket and studied it.</p><p>She folded her arms over her chest. \u201cAren\u2019t we going to discuss this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. This Jason dude lives in Sheridan. I think we should call his number and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an irritated look. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m gonna drink some blood, then I\u2019ll teleport to Jason\u2019s house. You can come with me if you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glared at him as he strode toward the refrigerator. \u201cI saw your eyes turn red twice now. Are you going to deny that you\u2019re attracted to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stuffed a bottle of blood into the microwave.</p><p>Not the most romantic of confessions, but it still made her heartbeat speed up. \u201cSo you like me?\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at her. \u201cDon\u2019t get excited. Nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. \u201cNo need to be rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just being realistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking, that we both face reality. And the truth is we\u2019re . . . mildly attracted to each other.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cYou call that the truth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge. \u201cYou already admitted you\u2019re attracted to me. You can\u2019t take it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am attracted.\u201d He retrieved his bottle of blood from the microwave. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing mild about it.\u201d</p><p>The bottled water slipped from her hand and tumbled onto the wooden floor. She snatched it up quickly. \u201cDamned thing is slippery.\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of blood. \u201cIt\u2019s simple. We\u2019re here to do a job. We do it as quickly as possible, then go back to our normal lives and put this all behind us.\u201d</p><p>She groaned inwardly. He thought that was simple? About as simple as torture. \u201cWhat about our attraction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d He strode toward the couch, then sat and stared at the empty fireplace. \u201cIt would be wrong for us to get involved. You know as well as I do that it could never work. And never last.\u201d</p> <p>She winced. Part of her acknowledged that he was right, but another part wanted to curl up on the floor and cry. It hurt. Hurt enough that she wanted to hurt him back.</p><p>He took a long swig from his bottle, then glanced at her. \u201cHow can you be attracted to me? Did you stop hating vampires all of a sudden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think you\u2019re a disgusting bunch of parasites and users.\u201d She gave him a wry look as she wrenched the top off her bottle. \u201cBut don\u2019t take it personally.\u201d</p><p>With a frown, he plunked his booted feet onto the coffee table. \u201cThen it\u2019s good you haven\u2019t forgotten I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. That\u2019s why I ignored my feelings for so long. You have to admit we\u2019re horribly, dreadfully mismatched.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it is. A real disaster waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI guess your father would find me totally unsuitable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat goes without saying.\u201d Though to be honest, she couldn\u2019t care less what her father thought.</p><p>Phineas gritted his teeth. \u201cHe\u2019d never accept a poor guy from the Bronx for his princess.\u201d</p><p>She winced. She hated being called that. \u201cI was never a princess. I was more like a pawn.\u201d</p><p>When he gave her a curious look, she waved a dismissive hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore. I refuse to let my father dictate my life.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back against the sofa cushions, studying her. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re attracted to me? Is it part of the rebellion against your father? So you can piss him off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she snapped. But could he be right? No, she didn\u2019t want to think that. Her feelings had always felt genuine, not like some sort of twisted, sordid quest for revenge. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought you were gorgeous. And courageous. And\u2014\u201d What was she doing, complimenting him when he\u2019d rejected her? \u201cBut like you said, there\u2019s no future for us. I\u2019m sure I can manage to resist you for the few nights that we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>His jaw shifted. \u201cFine. I\u2019m sure I can resist you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She put the bottle back into the fridge. \u201cThen let\u2019s get back to business, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me.\u201d He strode back to the kitchen table, set down his empty bottle, and picked up his cell phone. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She strode toward him, then jerked to a stop a few inches away. This was awkward.</p><p>He punched in the number. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to hold on to me, but don\u2019t let it bother you. I\u2019m sure you can resist fondling my manly body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d She slipped her hands around his neck. \u201cThis is business.\u201d</p><p>With an abrupt move, he pulled her close. \u201cExactly.\u201d He gave her a fierce look, then everything went black.</p><p>Phineas was relieved when Jason Pritchard didn\u2019t answer the phone. It was so much easier to teleport to an answering machine that talked for a minute without asking any questions.</p><p>They landed in a dark foyer, and his eyes quickly adjusted. Most of the house was dark, not surprising since it was after midnight. It was also Saturday night, so a young guy like Jason might be out on the town, but Phineas suspected he was asleep in his bedroom. After all, he\u2019d just been released from the hospital that morning.</p><p>He placed a finger against his lips to remind Brynley to be quiet, and she nodded, giving him an annoyed look that probably meant she didn\u2019t need reminding. Prickly, as always.</p><p>He moved quietly through the small house, relieved they couldn\u2019t talk right now. Their last chat had ripped his ego to shreds. She thought he was a disgusting parasite? They were horribly, dreadfully mismatched? A disaster waiting to happen? Sheesh, she acted like the polar ice caps would melt if they got together. Half of Wyoming would blow up like a giant geyser. The sun would go supernova, and a freakin\u2019 black hole would swallow the universe.</p><p>Thank God she found him so easy to resist. The universe would remain safe for one more night.</p><p>What was really frustrating was he knew this situation was his fault. The truth had come out because his eyes had turned red. He\u2019d known it was dangerous to spend time alone with her. He\u2019d known he needed to keep his attraction to her a secret, but damn, his feelings for her were too strong. He hadn\u2019t survived one night without blowing it.</p><p>Now she knew. And what was even more shocking, she appeared to be attracted to him, too.</p><p>Not too attracted, he thought wryly. Not if she considered him easy to resist. After all, they were horribly, dreadfully mismatched. A disaster waiting to happen.</p><p>The den and kitchen were empty. He stalked down a hallway and peeked inside the first door. An empty bedroom. He was tempted to drag Brynley inside to prove they weren\u2019t so horribly, dreadfully mismatched after all. But making love to her might knock the Earth off its axis, so he\u2019d have to resist.</p><p>He checked the second door. Bingo. Jason Pritchard was sound asleep in bed.</p><p>He eased the door open as he slipped inside Jason\u2019s mind. Keep on sleeping. This is just a dream.</p><p>He motioned for Brynley to follow him inside, and she tiptoed after him.</p><p>You are under my control. You will sleep and answer my questions.</p><p>Jason rolled onto his back, but his eyes remained shut and his breathing normal.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember who attacked you?\u201d Phineas asked softly.</p><p>\u201cA woman,\u201d Jason mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she look like? What did she do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlonde. Pretty.\u201d Jason frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she did to me.\u201d</p><p>Phineas delved through Jason\u2019s memories and spotted blank spaces, a sure sign that the man\u2019s mind had been tampered with. Still, he persisted, digging deep in search of a memory that would show him the attacker\u2019s face.</p><p>Jason moaned and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t remember her face,\u201d Phineas told Brynley, then tried another tactic. \u201cDid you hear her voice, Jason? Did she say anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe . . . she said she was my queen.\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s breath caught.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh,\u201d Brynley whispered. \u201cThat sounds like Corky.\u201d</p><p>Phineas leaned over the sleeping man. \u201cWhere were you when she attacked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloud Peak Glacier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where that is,\u201d Brynley said quietly.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Phineas touched Jason\u2019s forehead. This was all a dream. Sleep and forget about me.</p><p>Jason let out a loud snore and rolled onto his side.</p><p>Phineas reached a hand out to Brynley. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She stood stiffly in his arms as he teleported back to the cabin. As soon as they arrived, she jumped away and strode into the kitchen.</p><p>He scowled. How noble of her. She was so determined to keep the polar ice caps from melting. \u201cSo where is the Cloud Peak Glacier?\u201d</p><p>She pulled a map out of a drawer and unfolded it on the kitchen island counter. \u201cSee this area here?\u201d She jabbed a finger at a northern area of Wyoming. \u201cThis is where we are.\u201d</p><p>He joined her at the island and studied the map. The sweet scent of her hair filled his nostrils. Peaches. And vanilla. It reminded him of the homemade peach cobbler his aunt Ruth made. He used to love it hot and topped with vanilla ice cream. Come to think of it, he wouldn\u2019t mind a taste of Brynley topped with some vanilla ice cream. Or was he lactose intolerant now?</p><p>\u201cAnd this,\u201d Brynley continued, \u201cis the Bighorn National Forest. It lies east of Phil\u2019s land. Inside the forest, you\u2019ll find the Cloud Peak Wilderness Area. The glacier is located about here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a wry look. \u201cAre you going to call the glacier? They don\u2019t generally come equipped with a telephone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll take the car.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSee? I knew it would come in handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wilderness area. That means no motorized vehicles are allowed off the main roads.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded. \u201cThen how do you get around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou walk.\u201d Her mouth twitched. \u201cOr you ride a horse.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, Phineas. It\u2019ll be fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose horses don\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know you.\u201d She gave him a sly grin. \u201cTo know you is to like you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. Was she flirting with him? Didn\u2019t she know that was torture? \u201cI tried getting to know them. When you and Trudy left the barn to greet the other lady, I stayed behind for a little while. I tried mentally communicating with the horses to let them know I would never hurt them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that was sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too sweet. One of them tried to bite me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They all look alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorses look alike?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re such a city boy.\u201d</p><p>His brow arched. \u201cCountry girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd proud of it. I can bring down an elk in sixty seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think your breath was that bad.\u201d</p><p>She huffed and punched him in the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAh, foreplay.\u201d He rubbed his shoulder. \u201cAnd here I thought you were going to resist me.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s not my idea of foreplay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, then she looked away.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>She shrugged and turned back to the map. \u201cNo big deal. And actually, I don\u2019t think we should ride in at night. Our best bet is for me to go in the late afternoon. Trudy can bring her trailer and drop me and the horses off. I\u2019ll ride one and lead the other, then set up a base camp below the glacier. As soon as the sun sets, I\u2019ll call you and you can teleport.\u201d She winced. \u201cAlthough the cell phone probably won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can zip back to Romatech and pick us up some satellite phones,\u201d Phineas suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat would work.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cThe problem with this plan is it\u2019ll leave you alone here for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the basement trapdoor. Did he dare risk it? \u201cHow often do people come around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. And I would lock up. But still . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would worry about me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged in an unconcerned manner. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to guard you.\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. We can move the couch to conceal the trapdoor. I\u2019ll teleport in and out of the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>She was worried about him, he knew it. She just didn\u2019t want to show it. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t sure, I\u2019d spend the day at Romatech.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOkay. Then we have a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He sat at the kitchen table and booted up the laptop. \u201cI\u2019ll find a map of the wilderness area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloud Peak, and the Bighorn National Forest.\u201d She rummaged inside the fridge and pulled out some sliced roast beef. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a sandwich. You want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He pulled up a search engine. \u201cThere are camping areas in the forest, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Over thirty of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to check those. Corky may have commandeered one of them.\u201d He glanced at Brynley. \u201cDon\u2019t check anything without me. It could be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>She opened a loaf of bread. \u201cSeems to me that it would be safer to look for her during the daytime when she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t dare sleep unprotected. She\u2019ll have a few mortals under her control, and they\u2019ll be brainwashed to kill anyone who comes close to her. Don\u2019t do any investigating without me.\u201d</p><p>Brynley glowered at him. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He found a good map that detailed all the camping areas. \u201cI\u2019ll zip over to Romatech and print this out and grab our sat phones.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She slathered some mustard on her bread.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably stay there for a few hours.

File a report and catch up on what the other guys are doing.\u201d It would be a lot easier to resist her if he put over a thousand miles between them.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She slapped her sandwich together.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right here?\u201d</p><p>She shot him an irritated look. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot to do tomorrow. You should get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and teleport. I know you don\u2019t want to hang around me for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like you. Quite the opposite\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d With a sick feeling in his stomach, he vanished.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s afraid of the big bad wolf?\u201d Brynley sang to herself in the shower. She\u2019d finished her snack, then checked on the horses in the barn. Phineas had not returned.</p><p>She turned off his computer, then gathered up some supplies for the trip to Cloud Peak Glacier. Some beef jerky, a few granola bars, some bottles of water, a roll of toilet paper, and a sleeping bag. Phineas might be able to teleport in and out, but she\u2019d be with the horses, so she\u2019d have to do things the old-fashioned way. She made a note to herself to bring some weed-seed-free feed for the horses.</p><p>By one o\u2019clock in the morning, he still wasn\u2019t back. She took a shower and sang the Big Bad Wolf song at the top of her lungs, hoping he\u2019d come back and hear it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p> <p>She left the light on in the bathroom with the door partially closed, so the cabin wouldn\u2019t be totally dark, then climbed the ladder to the loft and crawled into bed.</p><p>With a groan, she punched a pillow. It was her fault he was uncomfortable around her. She shouldn\u2019t have told him that she knew what the red eyes meant. She\u2019d wanted to tease him, but to be honest, she was flattered. More than flattered. Amazed. Astounded. He\u2019d admitted he was attracted to her. The real Brynley.</p><p>All the guys in the past who had pursued her had never bothered to find out who she really was. They\u2019d simply seen her as the Supreme Pack Master\u2019s daughter, the ticket to win more power and prestige in the werewolf world.</p><p>Phineas had nothing to gain from a relationship with her. Unless you counted gaining a bunch of enemies. Her father and his countless followers would want to kill him.</p><p>She sighed and nestled under the covers. It was for the best that he was staying away from her. They couldn\u2019t be together. He knew it. She knew it. Her inner wolf knew it. They were from two different worlds.</p><p>How much did she actually know about him? Had he really been a drug dealer? Was it true there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest? It didn\u2019t seem to fit the Phineas she knew. She\u2019d always felt safe around him. She knew her brother and the Vamp guys liked and respected him. Angus MacKay had promoted him to head of security at Romatech. He wouldn\u2019t have done that if he didn\u2019t believe Phineas was absolutely trustworthy.</p><p>But how well could she trust him? He was the Love Doctor, the Blardonnay Guy. Hundreds of Vamp women would gladly throw themselves at him. She rolled over and punched a pillow. Lucky Phineas. He could see his brother whenever he wanted. She didn\u2019t dare even contact her sister.</p><p>She must have dozed off, for when she next looked at the bedside clock, it was almost four. The cabin was totally dark. The bathroom door had been shut. And the water was running.</p> <p>Phineas was back. And taking a shower. She pictured him the way he looked in the commercials with a towel wrapped low around his hips. And his chest, his glorious chest would glisten with droplets of water. A tiny rivulet would sluice down his chest, right between his man-boobs\u2014</p><p>Her breath caught. The water had turned off. She slipped out of bed and tiptoed to the edge of the loft.</p><p>The moon, now low in the sky, shone through the windows, softly illuminating the room below. He\u2019d moved the couch back a few feet to cover up the trapdoor to the basement. And he\u2019d moved the chairs back, too, so the whole arrangement would look normal.</p><p>The bathroom door opened, and the light switched off.</p><p>Her heart pounded, and she took a deep breath to try to stay calm. She didn\u2019t want him to hear her racing heartbeat.</p><p>He moved into view, and her heart stuttered. He was wearing a towel, just like in the commercials. Oh God, his shoulders really were broad. And his back . . . so strong and muscular. She bit her lip. If only he would turn around so she could see his chest.</p><p>Suddenly, he yanked the towel off and rubbed it over his head. She gasped. His rear end was showing!</p><p>He stiffened and turned his head slightly.</p><p>She slapped a hand over her mouth. He must have heard her gasp. But oh my God, when he had stiffened, it had caused the muscles in his buttocks to flex. It was about the most beautiful sight she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cBrynley?\u201d He turned toward her with the towel lowered to cover his groin.</p><p>She scrambled back onto the bed and held her breath. Her heart was beating too damned fast. He was going to hear it.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Brynley,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>The cabin was quiet. She strained her ears, but heard only crickets chirping outside. And an owl hooting.</p><p>She eased back to the railing and peeked over. The room was empty. He must have teleported into the basement.</p><p>She crawled back into bed and lay there, staring at the ceiling. If she had the nerve, she\u2019d shove the couch aside, open the trapdoor, and jump down into the basement. Straight into his arms.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t. She squeezed her eyes shut, and the vision of his naked back and buttocks filled her mind.</p><p>With a moan, she pulled the covers over her head. Easy to resist, she\u2019d told him. What a big fat liar.</p><p>She\u2019d never wanted anyone as badly as she did Phineas.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>The next evening, Brynley sat on her sleeping bag at the camp she\u2019d established at the base of Cloud Peak and watched the sun slip over the horizon. Any second now, Phineas would be waking from his death-sleep. She\u2019d give him a few minutes to dress and drink some blood before calling him.</p><p>She breathed deeply of air scented with spruce and lodgepole pine. The two horses munched on the green grass of the meadow where she\u2019d camped. Far up the side of the mountain, nestled in a beautiful cirque, the glacier gleamed white in the moonlight. Patches of snow still dotted the mountainside. Tiny bits of ice sparkled as if a divine hand had tossed a stash of diamonds across the side of the mountain.</p><p>Beautiful. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the crisp night breeze that nipped at her cheeks. Home. Her inner wolf trembled with joy. It knew instinctively that she\u2019d returned, and it was eager for the full moon that would come in two nights. Eager to burst free from her human skin and run wild through the forests, chasing deer and elk.</p><p>She would have to explain to Phineas that she needed the night off. It wasn\u2019t a choice for her. On the first night of a full moon, she shifted, no matter where she was.</p><p>The teaching job at Dragon Nest Academy was perfect for her since she was able to live in the same building with her brother and the banished werewolf boys. She shifted with them every month and roamed the extensive grounds around the school. It was fun being with her brother, but she missed her sister. And the Adirondacks were not the same as the mountains out West. Her inner wolf knew the difference and had longed for her to return home.</p><p>While the wolf celebrated, her human half tensed. She was taking a terrible risk. If she stayed here, her father might find her. And if he captured her, he\u2019d make it extremely hard for her to escape a second time. He knew not to trust her now.</p><p>A twinge of paranoia skittered through her. She stood and surveyed the woods that encircled her camp, her extra-keen eyesight adjusting to the darkness. She listened with her extra-sharp hearing. A rustling in the grass as a field mouse scurried to its home, the beating of the air as an owl took wing.</p><p>\u201cHurry, little mouse,\u201d she whispered. She knew the feeling of being stalked, the terror of being hunted. Princess, my ass. Phineas had no idea. In her father\u2019s world, she was prey.</p><p>She felt a sudden need to have Phineas there with her. He\u2019d said he would never allow her to be forced into a marriage against her will. He would protect her.</p><p>Because he wants you for himself. And why should she object? A spark of rebelliousness ignited inside her, inciting an urge to tell the world to buzz off. She wanted Phineas.</p><p>But since when did she ever get what she wanted?</p><p>She grabbed the sat phone off the sleeping bag and called him.</p><p>\u201cHello, Brynley.\u201d</p><p>His voice did the usual warm, fluttery things to her stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re all right! I was so worried about leaving you all alone in the cabin. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay. Are you ready to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have.\u201d</p><p>Her heart lurched and the phone tumbled from her hand as she whirled around and found him standing behind her. \u201cDon\u2019t do that! I told you to never sneak up behind me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on purpose.\u201d He pocketed his sat phone. \u201cI\u2019m never exactly sure where I\u2019ll end up when I teleport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pressed a hand to her chest as she willed her heart to stop pounding. Great. She\u2019d freaked out again.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d He was regarding her curiously, so she quickly changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful around here, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He glanced around quickly, then focused again on her. \u201cAre you sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the glacier over there,\u201d she interrupted, motioning to the cirque. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where Jason was attacked. The mountain still has a lot of snow on it. I can\u2019t imagine anyone trying to hike up there in the dark, so I\u2019m figuring Jason was attacked somewhere down here. I\u2019m glad you wore that heavy coat. It\u2019s pretty chilly.\u201d</p><p>He studied her silently for a while, and she felt her cheeks grow warm. She was babbling, and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look around,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAll right. But don\u2019t take too long. We have a lot of campgrounds to check out. I\u2019ll get the horses ready.\u201d</p><p>He gave the horses a wary look, then zipped around the meadow and nearby woods at vampire speed.</p><p>With a sigh, she rolled up her sleeping bag. She needed to stop freaking out whenever he was behind her. The attack had happened five years ago. Time to get over it. She attached her sleeping bag behind the saddle on the gelding. Phineas was an inexperienced rider, so she\u2019d let him ride the gentler mare.</p><p>He zoomed toward her in a blur of movement, and she gripped the reins of the horses as they shied away. \u201cCut it out!\u201d she fussed at him. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He stopped abruptly, casting a worried look at the horses. \u201cI found the spot where the attack happened.\u201d He gestured toward a giant spruce. \u201cThe grass is crushed, and I found a few drops of human blood on the ground.\u201d</p><p>Impressive. She hadn\u2019t detected any blood, and her sense of smell was excellent, although not nearly as good as when she was in wolf form. \u201cCan you tell if it\u2019s Jason\u2019s blood?\u201d</p><p>Phineas winced. \u201cThe older Vamps probably could, but I\u2019m not as experienced as them. I can\u2019t tell if Corky was here, either.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He seemed embarrassed, but that only made him more attractive to her. Werewolf men, especially the Alphas, tended to be overconfident to the point of arrogance, and that had always annoyed her.</p><p>He retrieved a piece of paper from his jacket pocket and unfolded it. \u201cI printed out a map that shows the location of campgrounds. Vampires would need a cabin or a cave to stay protected from sunlight.\u201d</p><p>She patted the sheath attached to her belt. \u201cI brought a good hunting knife. I\u2019m ready for them.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hands. \u201cWait a minute, Wolfie-Girl. If there\u2019s any fighting, you have to stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother would kill me if I let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cSo it\u2019s just my brother you\u2019re worried about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need to hear, Brynley? That I couldn\u2019t bear it if anything happened to you? That if I failed to protect you, the shame would kill me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! So stay the hell out of trouble, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She smiled, her cheeks flushing with heat. \u201cLet\u2019s go, bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you, Snout-Face.\u201d He handed her the map.</p><p>She pointed at a spot on the map. \u201cWe\u2019ll head to this one first. It\u2019s not too far.\u201d She folded the map, stuffed it into her jacket pocket, then mounted her horse.</p><p>He stood still, eyeing the mare with an anxious look.</p><p>\u201cCome on, city boy.\u201d She bit her lip to keep from grinning. \u201cMount up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the one that tried to bite me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Molly. She\u2019s as gentle as can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil she sinks her teeth into you.\u201d</p><p>Brynley snorted. \u201cA vampire afraid of biting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, if I\u2019m on the wrong side of the bite.\u201d He inched closer to the horse. \u201cDo you just sort of jump on their back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your foot in the stirrup. No, the other foot.\u201d Brynley chuckled. \u201cUnless you want to ride backwards.\u201d</p><p>He put his left foot in, then hopped on his right foot as the horse shied away. \u201cWhoa, Nelly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Molly.\u201d Brynley gasped when Phineas suddenly teleported right onto the horse\u2019s back.</p><p>With a frightened whinny, Molly reared up and dumped him on the ground. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOw. Damn.\u201d He hefted himself to his feet and glared at the horse. \u201cWhat did it do that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou frightened her.\u201d Brynley dismounted and grabbed Molly\u2019s reins. \u201cHere. I\u2019ll hold her still while you mount.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his rear, scowling at the horse. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d</p> <p>Brynley smiled as she patted Molly\u2019s neck. \u201cPoor Phineas. Must be hard, mounting a female who doesn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>He glowered at her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. They\u2019ve always been willing.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded. How many women had been seduced by the Love Doctor\u2019s sexy voice and handsome face? \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve had a whole herd of willing females? And you rode them like a cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did, would you be jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, more like nauseated.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted, then slipped his foot into the stirrup and mounted neatly. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Gorgeous. She was sorely tempted to pull him to the ground and give him the ride of a lifetime. Make him forget about the herd of willing females he might have had in the past. Instead, she handed him the reins. \u201cHold them lightly. Molly won\u2019t need a lot of direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows what she wants?\u201d His hands brushed slightly against hers as he took the reins.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cWe don\u2019t always get what we want.\u201d She hurried back to the gelding and mounted up.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t so bad once you got used to it, Phineas thought. The trail was wide and smooth, and well lit with a nearly full moon and a million stars.</p><p>His horse was happy to follow Brynley\u2019s gelding. And he was happy to watch her from behind. Her back was graceful and curved into a slim waist. Her long ponytail swayed from side to side.</p> <p>The stars shone more brightly here than at home, and the sky seemed bigger. Even the Earth seemed bigger, more expansive without the cramped and crowded feel he was used to in the city. Here, he could easily believe that he and Brynley were the only two people on the planet.</p><p>It was a tempting fantasy\u2014he and Brynley all alone with a moral obligation to repopulate the Earth. And no angry werewolf father to object. But in reality, his sperm was dead, and Brynley hated vampires. He was ninety-nine percent positive that she had spied on him when he\u2019d gotten out of the shower, but of course, she\u2019d found him easy to resist.</p><p>He took a deep breath. The air was definitely fresher here. No smoky scent of meat grilling at the local street vendor or stench of trash overflowing from a Dumpster.</p><p>At first, it seemed deathly quiet. No horns honking, no sirens, no throbbing bass from passing cars. But slowly, he became aware of different sounds. More subtle. A breeze ruffling the leaves, a twig snapping beneath a paw. The scenery appeared peaceful on the surface, but danger lurked in the dark depths of the forest. A different set of predators existed here\u2014wolves, bears, mountain lions. But the predator that had attacked Jason Pritchard was one he knew well\u2014a vampire.</p><p>Just like other predators, a vampire always left a trail. It was their need for blood, and their options were limited. They could order blood from Romatech, raid a blood bank, or drain animals dry. Or if they were Malcontents, they left human victims in their wake.</p><p>As Phineas relaxed into the swaying movement of the horse, he congratulated himself. This cowboy stuff wasn\u2019t so hard after all. Brynley would have to stop calling him a city boy. Unfortunately, at that moment his horse decided to leave the path and turn right into the forest.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He sat up. \u201cHorse! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Brynley glanced back over her shoulder. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Brynley pulled to a stop. \u201cSteer her back onto the path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no steering wheel!\u201d He looked frantically about as his horse continued to walk into the forest. \u201cHow do I put this thing into reverse?\u201d</p><p>Brynley\u2019s laughter drifted toward him. Dammit, he couldn\u2019t even see her now.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a thing. She\u2019s a mare,\u201d Brynley yelled. \u201cYou have to let her know you\u2019re in charge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was!\u201d Typical female. The mare had only let him think he was in charge.</p><p>\u201cPull on the reins,\u201d Brynley called. She sounded closer, thank God.</p><p>He pulled hard, and the horse reared up, dumping him onto the ground. \u201cUmph.\u201d He fell back, hitting his head. Stars danced around the sky. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d he mumbled as she walked past him.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to Molly.\u201d She smirked as she grabbed Molly\u2019s reins. She rubbed the horse\u2019s neck. \u201cPoor girl.\u201d</p><p>With a grunt, he hefted himself to his feet. The muscles in his rump and legs twinged with pain. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Brynley led his horse back to the path, her mouth twitching as she passed him by. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your hat, city boy.\u201d</p><p>He spotted his hat on the ground, but when he leaned over to pick it up, his muscles objected. \u201cOuch. Damn.\u201d He walked slowly and stiffly back to the path.</p><p>Meanwhile, Brynley had tied a rope from Molly to her gelding. \u201cI\u2019ll have to lead your horse since you don\u2019t know how to control her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault the horse is weird.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cDo you need help mounting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can mount just fine.\u201d He ignored her dubious look, and swung his leg over the horse. His muscles groaned as he settled into the saddle. \u201cSee?\u201d He grimaced, hoping it looked like a smile. \u201cPiece of cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d With a grin, she headed back to her horse, then mounted up.</p><p>After about half an hour, they arrived at the first campsite. It was bare. No cabins. No pitched tents. No heartbeats. They dismounted, and he wobbled on legs that now felt like rubber. He gritted his teeth, determined not to show any weakness.</p><p>Brynley chuckled. \u201cCity boy.\u201d</p><p>Dammit, she knew he was in pain. \u201cCountry girl.\u201d He tipped his cowboy hat as she gathered the reins from both horses. \u201cMighty obliged, ma\u2019am. I heard that in a movie.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a wry look. \u201cWhy, land sakes! You\u2019re practically a cowboy.\u201d</p><p>He reached inside his coat to remove his pistol from his shoulder holster and winked at her. \u201cPardon me while I whip this out.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve seen bigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, you ain\u2019t seen what I\u2019m packing.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitched. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all you Vamps shoot blanks.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cYou want some cowpoke with a quick trigger finger, or a man like me who can go all night long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t referring to your finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither was I.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks blushed a pretty pink. \u201cFancy talk coming from the Love Doctor.\u201d She turned to tether the horses to a hitching post.</p><p>He was tempted to tell her the whole Love Doctor act was just that, an act. It had started out as a joke, a way to make ladies laugh. But it seemed to have backfired on him, because no one wanted to take him seriously.</p><p>He paced along the camp\u2019s perimeter as he surveyed their surroundings. \u201cI\u2019ll check the boulders over there. Maybe there\u2019s a cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you find one, make sure there aren\u2019t any bears inside,\u201d Brynley called after him. \u201cOr cougars.\u201d</p><p>Sheesh. What a friendly place. He trod carefully with his pistol ready. The wilderness was beautiful, but primitive. He couldn\u2019t imagine Queen Corky hiding here. If she was in the area, she\u2019d use vampire mind control to land herself some better accommodations. A fancy ski lodge, maybe, or a ranch house.</p><p>He holstered his sidearm and returned to Brynley. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here. And I can\u2019t tell if anyone has been here recently.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the \u2018leave no trace\u2019 program. You\u2019re not supposed to\u2014\u201d She stopped suddenly with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He reached for his gun once again.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she whispered, her voice hushed with awe. She pointed at the far side of the meadow. \u201cDo you see him?\u201d</p><p>Relief rushed through him and he released the weapon. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not just any horse. It\u2019s the wild white stallion. Isn\u2019t he beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks like a horse.\u201d When Brynley gave him an exasperated look, he continued, \u201cYou\u2019ve seen him before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only seen him a few times in my life. He just seems to appear out of nowhere like magic. He\u2019s totally wild. No one has ever been able to catch him, and believe me, they\u2019ve tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds cool.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him, her face radiant in the almost full moon. \u201cHe is cool. The coolest horse in the entire world. Even my father couldn\u2019t catch him.\u201d</p><p>Behind them, Molly whinnied and tugged at the reins Brynley had looped over the hitching post.</p><p>\u201cI think Molly likes him, too,\u201d Phineas added with a wry smile.</p><p>Brynley patted the mare to calm her down. \u201cShe has excellent taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why she veered off the path? Did she catch his scent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Phineas watched as the stallion reared up, then galloped off into the woods. \u201cThere he goes.\u201d</p><p>Brynley nodded, still smiling. \u201cHe roams a wide area. I\u2019ve spotted him in Montana a hundred miles from here. He goes wherever he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely free,\u201d Phineas murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Brynley\u2019s smile faded as she untethered the horses. \u201cI\u2019ve always had this feeling that if the wild white stallion remained free, then all was right in the world.\u201d She shrugged and looked embarrassed. \u201cThat probably sounds silly to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d He moved closer to her. \u201cYou figure that as long as he\u2019s free, you have a chance to be free, too.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou do understand.\u201d She glanced away, her cheeks blushing. \u201cNot bad for a city boy.\u201d</p><p>He brushed back a wavy tendril of hair that had come loose from her ponytail and tucked it behind her ear. \u201cI could understand a lot more if we talked to each other instead of sparring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d She shifted her weight. \u201cMaybe we could be . . . friends. There wouldn\u2019t be any harm in that, right?\u201d</p><p>It would be sheer torture. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good. We can talk while we ride.\u201d She mounted the gelding.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He mounted Molly, wincing inwardly at the pain. Thank you for giving me a ride, he attempted to communicate mentally.</p><p>Molly snorted and shook her head, and he felt an air of resignation about her as if she\u2019d accepted long ago that she must do as she was told. He wondered briefly if she wanted to be free like the white stallion. Or when the snow piled up in winter, was she grateful to have a warm stable?</p><p>Freedom versus security. It was the choice Brynley had been forced to make when she\u2019d left home.</p><p>They rode side by side, but neither of them spoke. Now that they\u2019d called a truce, he didn\u2019t know what to say. It had been easier to communicate with her when he had picked on her and pretended not to like her.</p><p>The awkward silence stretched out, broken only by the thudding of horse hooves and the occasional birdcall.</p><p>Say something, he slapped himself mentally. \u201cI like your eyes.\u201d He slapped himself again. That was not something a mere friend would say.</p><p>She tilted her head toward him. \u201cMy eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019re . . . blue.\u201d Sheesh, now he sounded like a preschooler who had just learned his colors.</p><p>\u201cI like your eyes, too,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cMine? They\u2019re the color of mud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark chocolate,\u201d she corrected him, then smiled. \u201cI love dark chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours are like the sky on a bright sunny day. I . . . I can\u2019t see the sky anymore. Unless I look at you.\u201d He cast a nervous glance at her.</p><p>She was staring at him like he\u2019d grown a second head.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she interrupted him softly. \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing anyone has ever told me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like compliments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do. I\u2019m just not used to receiving them.\u201d She smiled sadly. \u201cBut I think I could adjust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. \u2019Cause I have a lot more where that last one came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sweet man, Phineas.\u201d</p><p>Sweet? Was that why she wanted him for a friend? Next, she\u2019d be asking him to go to the mall with her to get a manicure. \u201cI\u2019m not always sweet,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>She gave him a curious look. \u201cIs it true what that woman said on the phone? You were a drug dealer, and there\u2019s a warrant for your arrest?\u201d</p><p>He winced. He should have stuck with the sweet perception. The more Brynley found out about him, the more she would want to avoid him. The truth would only convince her that she was right.</p><p>They were horribly, dreadfully mismatched.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Boy, did he clam up fast. Brynley slanted a glance at Phineas. She must have pushed a button. Well, she could hardly blame him. She had things in her past she refused to talk about, too.</p><p>A sudden notion pricked at her. Maybe they had something in common after all. Maybe they were both . . . survivors. Their wounded souls recognized each other and were being pulled together by a magnetic force they couldn\u2019t stop or control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head. What romantic nonsense. She\u2019d been slapped around by reality too much to believe that souls could be destined for each other. Phineas was like any man, and they were all governed by the Three-Step rule. He couldn\u2019t help but think about sex, and since she happened to be the only female in the vicinity, she automatically became the subject of his sexual thoughts.</p><p>She waved aside a mosquito that buzzed past her ear. \u201cDamned bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to me?\u201d Phineas gave her a wry look.</p> <p>\u201cShould I? I thought you\u2019d stopped talking to me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThere are things in my past I\u2019m not proud of. I\u2019d rather be judged for the real me and not for my mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ll judge you?\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cHaven\u2019t you already? I\u2019m a disgusting parasite. A user. Your words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your words? You call me Snout-Face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do have a snout when the moon is full. Would you rather I talk about your hairy legs?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, and her inner wolf bristled. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with my fur. If you weren\u2019t so ignorant about wolves, you\u2019d know that I have a very nice pelt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re extremely argumentative\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd touchy. I\u2019ve never met anyone so prickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d</p> <p>His mouth twitched as he gave her a pointed look.</p><p>Her face grew warm as a sheepish smile tugged at her mouth. \u201cAll right. I might be a little touchy. But I have good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. No way was she talking about her past. She needed to change the subject fast. \u201cHairy legs? If that\u2019s how you flatter a woman, then you\u2019ve got a lot to learn, Mr. Love Doctor.\u201d</p><p>He flashed his perfect smile at her. \u201cI was getting to it. My point is that even with your pretty snout and gorgeous legs and cheerful personality, I would never hold it against you. I like you exactly the way you are.\u201d</p><p>She tightened her grip on her horse\u2019s reins as her heart started to race. He likes me. For myself.</p><p>Last night, he\u2019d admitted he was attracted to her. She\u2019d figured that was simply lust. A common result of the Three-Step rule. But now, with this latest confession, she could no longer pretend the attraction was purely physical.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t sure she liked that. Lust was easy to handle. If it itched too much, you simply scratched it. But once the heart was dragged into a relationship, it always ended in heartache. Abandonment, betrayal, abuse. She\u2019d endured them all and couldn\u2019t bear to go through it again.</p> <p>She gave him a wary look. \u201cI suppose a Love Doctor like you has enjoyed a lot of conquests.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cWhat conquests? You heard how LaToya talks to me. She judges me on my past mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you hold it against me that I\u2019m a vampire? A disgusting parasite?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s not personal. I just don\u2019t like users.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I ever used you?\u201d</p><p>She rode in silence for a moment. She could accuse him of using his vampire allure on her, but she was beginning to question that idea. She\u2019d lived at Dragon Nest Academy for a few months now, and she\u2019d never felt any kind of allure from the other male Vamps she came in contact with. They were handsome guys, but they never affected her like Phineas.</p><p>She needed to face the truth. It was only Phineas who attracted her. She liked him exactly the way he was.</p><p>Did she dare tell him?</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d he said softly. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ve used you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI think you\u2019re a . . . a good guy.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth tilted up. \u201cWell, I guess we found something we can agree on.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, her cheeks growing warm. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>His gaze met hers and their eyes locked for a few seconds. Her heart squeezed in her chest, and she looked away.</p><p>Oh God, who was she kidding? Her heart was already involved.</p><p>A silence stretched out between them, but she could sense an undercurrent that sizzled with electric energy. This was dangerous. Feelings this intense had a way of filtering through to her inner wolf. It was becoming aware of the desires of her heart, sharply attuned to the lustful needs of her body. And once the animal inside her latched on to the scent of her chosen prey, it didn\u2019t give up.</p><p>Phineas wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>Phineas stiffened as they approached the next campsite. This one was definitely inhabited. The stench of unwashed human was strong enough to knock over a moose.</p><p>Brynley wrinkled her nose as she stopped the horses. \u201cI think whoever is camping here had a run-in with a skunk.\u201d</p><p>He winced inwardly as he dismounted. \u201cI\u2019ll check it out. Stay here with the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d She dismounted quickly and tethered the horses to a nearby aspen tree. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be helping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are helping me, but I don\u2019t want you in any danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a wuss, Phineas. I can handle myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two gonna fuss at each other all night?\u201d a gruff voice rumbled from behind a large lodgepole pine.</p><p>Phineas whipped out his automatic as he spun toward the voice.</p><p>\u201cYou call that little stick a weapon?\u201d A huge man stepped from behind the tree, chuckling. He carried a double-barreled shotgun with the breech open. A fly buzzed around his head, and he waved it aside.</p><p>His smell wafted toward Phineas, making his eyes water. Still, he focused on the shotgun to make sure the safety catch was visible. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any trouble, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can defend ourselves if we need to.\u201d Brynley drew her shotgun out of its leather case attached to her saddle.</p><p>The huge man tilted his head back and laughed. \u201cWill you look at that? The little lady\u2019s got the big weapon. I reckon we can tell who\u2019s the boss here.\u201d</p><p>Phineas gritted his teeth. Before he could reply, Brynley butted in.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, and what\u2019s your business here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>With a chuckle, the huge man removed his battered, sweat-stained hat and held it to his chest. \u201cPleased to meet you, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m Digger. Spent so many years digging for gold and silver that the name stuck. And you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Bryn\u2014\u201d She stopped herself from saying her full name. \u201cAnd this is Phineas.\u201d</p><p>Phineas nodded at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Digger looked up, then shrugged. \u201cNot much. It\u2019s been pretty quiet till you two showed up.\u201d He regarded them as he scratched his scraggly long beard. \u201cAre you two running from the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phineas replied. \u201cWe\u2019re cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just like riding at night,\u201d Brynley added.</p><p>In the middle of nowhere, Phineas thought with a snort. They probably did look suspicious.</p><p>But Digger nodded as if it were normal. \u201cPut away your weapons. I ain\u2019t gonna hurt you. Mine ain\u2019t loaded right now. And come on to my campsite. I\u2019ve got some beans cooking.\u201d He turned and lumbered through the woods.</p><p>Phineas holstered his sidearm.</p><p>\u201cShould I keep my shotgun ready?\u201d Brynley whispered.</p><p>Phineas shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s mortal and harmless, as far as I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf his smell doesn\u2019t kill us.\u201d</p><p>Phineas smiled. \u201cIf we get into any danger, I\u2019ll just teleport you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She slid her shotgun back into its case, then took the reins of the horses. \u201cHe reminds me of the old mountain men. I thought they were all gone.\u201d</p><p>They walked the horses into the camp. While Brynley tethered them to a hitching post, Phineas surveyed the area. Three small cabins, no heartbeats inside. Digger appeared to be here alone. He was squatting and stirring the contents of a black cast-iron pot that sat on a rock near the fire. His shotgun was resting against a tree.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re camping here alone?\u201d Phineas asked as he approached.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Digger straightened with a grunt. \u201cI got my boy, Jake, with me. You want some beans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I just ate.\u201d Although this camp had cabins, Phineas couldn\u2019t imagine Corky staying anywhere near this smelly mortal. Or trying to feed off him. Beneath Digger\u2019s battered hat, hanks of greasy gray hair fell to his shoulders. His tattered jeans were held up with suspenders, and his undershirt had once been white, but was now stained and gray with age.</p><p>Digger nodded at Brynley as she approached. \u201cWould you care for some beans, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d When Digger slumped with disappointment, she added, \u201cBut they sure do smell good.\u201d</p><p>He brightened with a smile that showed a few crooked teeth and a few more gaps where teeth were missing. \u201cIt\u2019s my own special recipe. You gotta add some bacon fat and squirrel meat.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll try that sometime. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anything odd around here?\u201d Other than you? Phineas added in his thoughts.</p><p>Digger\u2019s eyes lit up and he slapped his thigh, which caused a cloud of dust to puff around him. \u201cDagnabbit, I knew it! I knew that was why you\u2019re gallivantin\u2019 around at night. You\u2019re hunting them, ain\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d Brynley asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. They\u2019re new to these parts, but I\u2019m on to them.\u201d Digger scratched at his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m hunting them, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know the Carson ranch south of here?\u201d Digger asked. \u201cTwo cows mutilated last week. That\u2019s what they do, you know. They drain all the blood, then cut up the carcasses so no one will figure out what they\u2019re doing.\u201d He pointed to his head. \u201cBut some of us are too smart for them. We got \u2019em figured out.\u201d</p><p>Phineas exchanged a look with Brynley. Had Corky become so desperately hungry that she\u2019d fed off cows?</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re hiding in these here woods.\u201d Digger turned his head and spit on the ground. \u201cThey\u2019re some sneaky devils, that\u2019s for sure. You only see them at night.\u201d He nodded with a knowing look. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re riding around in the dark. You\u2019re hunting them, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Brynley drawled. \u201cI reckon you got us all figured out.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and slapped his leg. \u201cThat\u2019s right! You can\u2019t put one past old Digger.\u201d His eyes gleamed as he looked Brynley over. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty little thing. Are you taken?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I had me a woman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s taken,\u201d Phineas interrupted, and moved quickly to Brynley\u2019s side. \u201cWe\u2019re married.\u201d He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and pulled her close.</p><p>She stiffened, then gave him a hesitant smile. \u201cYes, we\u2019re . . . newlyweds.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Digger motioned to her hand. \u201cYou ain\u2019t wearing no ring.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, then she blurted out, \u201cIt\u2019s a secret. We . . . we haven\u2019t told anyone yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father doesn\u2019t approve of me,\u201d Phineas added.</p><p>Digger gave him a sad look. \u201cNow ain\u2019t that a shame? Is it because you\u2019re black?\u201d</p><p>Brynley flinched. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Phineas answered at the same time.</p><p>\u201cPhin,\u201d she whispered and touched his cheek. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s true,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cYour father will never accept me.\u201d If his race didn\u2019t upset the old werewolf, the fact that he was a vampire certainly would.</p><p>The pained look in Brynley\u2019s eyes made his heart swell with tenderness. He slipped his hand around the back of her neck to pull her closer and kissed her brow.</p><p>\u201cYep, you two are newlyweds, all right.\u201d Digger chuckled. \u201cI ain\u2019t never seen two people so in love.\u201d</p><p>Brynley\u2019s gaze lifted to his with an alarmed look, and he swallowed hard. In love? Was he? Damn. If he couldn\u2019t fool Digger, why was he trying to fool himself?</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Digger bellowed.</p><p>With a start, Phineas turned toward him, making sure he kept a safe grip on Brynley. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just makes me so damned mad! A nice couple like you, having to keep your marriage a secret. I mean, can you help who you fall in love with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Phineas glanced at Brynley. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Time seemed to halt for a second as their gazes locked and sizzled. Would she think he\u2019d just confessed to loving her? Or would she think this was all an act?</p><p>\u201cOf course you can\u2019t help it,\u201d Digger growled. \u201cWhy, my own Jake fell in love with a squirrel.\u201d</p><p>Brynley blinked, and they screeched back to reality.</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. He\u2019s in love with a damned squirrel.\u201d Digger leaned toward them and lowered his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him about the squirrel meat in the beans. It\u2019ll upset him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t say a word,\u201d Brynley assured him.</p><p>Digger grunted, then turned toward some bushes that were trembling. \u201cI know you\u2019re back there, Jake. Stop spying on us and come on out.\u201d</p><p>There were two crazy guys? Phineas held on to Brynley in case he needed to teleport her away.</p><p>The bushes parted and a dog padded into the clearing. He was big, yellow, and dirty, but his most striking feature was the hat strapped to his head. It looked like an old leather football helmet, crowned with a layer of aluminum foil that gleamed in the light of the campfire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, the poor thing,\u201d Brynley murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s had a head injury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Digger regarded the dog fondly. \u201cMy Jake is sharp as a tack. He\u2019s what you call a receiver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a football team?\u201d Phineas asked.</p> <p>Digger broke into laughter, slapped his thigh hard, then coughed when the cloud of dust reached his face. \u201cThat\u2019s the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever heard! Dogs don\u2019t play football!\u201d</p><p>Phineas exchanged a look with Brynley as Digger started to laugh once again.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to wear that hat to keep them from talking to him,\u201d Digger explained. \u201cFirst, they tried talking to me, but I was too wily for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>\u201cThem aliens, boy! The ones mutilating all the cattle around here. They\u2019ve been using my Jake as a receiver.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do they say to him?\u201d Brynley asked.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell would I know? You think I can talk to a dog?\u201d Digger snickered. \u201cI ain\u2019t crazy, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Phineas murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been hunting those little devils, so they\u2019ll leave my Jake alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very thoughtful of you,\u201d Brynley said.</p><p>\u201cWe should be going now.\u201d Phineas retreated, taking Brynley with him. \u201cSo you can get back to your hunting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to hunt together?\u201d Digger asked with a hurt expression.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but we prefer to be alone,\u201d Phineas explained. \u201cNewlyweds, you know.\u201d</p><p>Digger chuckled. \u201cI got you. You two are making more hay than hunting. Well, I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Brynley mounted her horse. Phineas mounted, too, ignoring the painful twinges in his rump and thighs. He waved at the old man.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Digger called after them. \u201cThem nasty aliens are close by. I can feel \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Phineas rode down the path alongside Brynley. Neither said a word until they were sure Digger wouldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>She pulled her shirt up to her nose and sniffed. \u201cI may need to change clothes. And shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could teleport you to Phil\u2019s place. I\u2019ll come back to watch the horses while you clean up.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Sweet. He was starting to hate that word. Why didn\u2019t she see him as sexy and desirable? Why couldn\u2019t she ache for him the way he did for her? Was it because she considered them horribly, dreadfully mismatched?</p><p>It was true what he\u2019d said earlier. Her father would never accept him. A poor guy from the Bronx. A vampire.</p><p>Brynley could have any man she wanted. A rich rancher. An Alpha wolf. She could have wealth, land, and security. Why would she give all that up for him?</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming to the rescue,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The pain in his rear was rapidly becoming unbearable. Maybe he should walk the rest of the way. \u201cWhat rescue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rescued me from Digger\u2019s advances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sweet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cAre you angry?\u201d</p><p>Yes! Digger could tell I\u2019m in love with you, and you can\u2019t! \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I . . . I need to get off this damned horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She pulled the horses to a stop. When he dismounted, she gave him a sympathetic look. \u201cIt\u2019s normal to feel sore the first few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He gritted his teeth and walked stiffly beside her. \u201cI\u2019m just annoyed that we\u2019re not finding anything about Corky. I don\u2019t think she would hide out here. It\u2019s too primitive. She\u2019d use her vampire mind control to take over a ranch or ski lodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may be right,\u201d Brynley murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m wondering about those dead cows. Digger said they were drained of blood. We should check that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Corky would feed off cows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she was desperate enough, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why mutilate them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hide what she did. When Malcontents feed off humans, they slit the throats to conceal the teeth marks.\u201d</p><p>Brynley nodded slowly. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll have Trudy help me bring the horses back to the cabin during the day, and then tomorrow night, we can go to the Carson ranch and ask Nate about the cows.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at her. \u201cNate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan Carson.\u201d She smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s an old friend. And a mortal. A really sweet guy.\u201d</p><p>Phineas ground his teeth. Sweet Nate was probably rich. \u201cDid he want you, too? Like Digger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She gave him an exasperated look. \u201cNot every man who sees me wants me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome men are fools.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNate is plenty smart. His brother\u2019s a problem though. If we\u2019re lucky we won\u2019t run into Kyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Kyle?\u201d</p><p>She was silent a moment. \u201cHe did want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Phineas muttered. She could have her pick of a million men. Why would she ever choose him?</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s afraid of the big bad wolf?\u201d Brynley sang to herself as she rolled out her sleeping bag.</p><p>He\u2019d run away again.</p><p>Over an hour had passed since they\u2019d arrived at the trailhead campsite where Trudy would meet her in the morning. After helping Brynley take care of the horses, Phineas had teleported her to her brother\u2019s cabin so she could shower and change. He\u2019d returned to the camp to babysit the horses, and then, thirty minutes later, he\u2019d teleported to the cabin to bring her back here.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stay. He claimed he needed to shower, too, and he needed to drop by Romatech for some bottled blood and to see how his brother was faring. He also wanted to see if Angus was sending anyone back to the States to help them with their search. She suspected he didn\u2019t want to continue the mission alone with her.</p><p>I ain\u2019t never seen two people so in love. Digger\u2019s words had haunted Brynley ever since they\u2019d left his campsite.</p><p>The old man was crazy as a loon, so maybe she shouldn\u2019t read too much into it. Still, she wondered how strong Phineas\u2019s feelings were for her. He\u2019d been quick to pretend they were married when Digger had shown interest in her. He\u2019d held on to her and kissed her brow. Last night he\u2019d admitted he was physically attracted to her. And tonight he\u2019d said that he liked her.</p><p>But love? Could he ever love her? She didn\u2019t know.</p><p>And she sure didn\u2019t know how she felt about him. Yeah, she wanted to jump his bones, but that wasn\u2019t love. That wasn\u2019t something you based a long-term commitment on. And yet, when Phineas had claimed they were married, her heart had nearly leaped out her throat. Shock. Then a tingly spark of excitement. And then . . . an odd sense of contentment.</p><p>Dammit, she wanted to be loved. She wanted to be cherished and treasured. For herself. Not for being a werewolf, or for being her father\u2019s daughter.</p><p>Her dad had been trying to marry her off for years, but she\u2019d never felt a need to rush into anything. As a werewolf, she could live another five hundred years. Why saddle herself with a husband now?</p><p>But if a husband truly loved her, wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful? Why couldn\u2019t she be as happy as Vanda? Or Toni or Caitlyn? Any day now, Caitlyn would be giving birth to twins. Why couldn\u2019t she do that? Why couldn\u2019t she make her own family that was based on love instead of power and manipulation?</p><p>She stretched out on her sleeping bag in the bare cabin. She was wearing a clean pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt to sleep in, and she had a flashlight and her shotgun on the floor beside her. It was a quiet and peaceful place, and she was exhausted, but still she couldn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>I ain\u2019t never seen two people so in love. Could Phineas fall in love with her? Did she want him to? What did she really know about him?</p><p>You\u2019re just scared, she told herself. You\u2019ve been burned and abused too many times before. Phineas was sweet, smart, and respectful. He made her laugh. He made her horny. He made her want to jump\u2014</p><p>She jumped when a man\u2019s form materialized in the dark cabin. \u201cPhineas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still awake?\u201d He wandered over to her with a plastic bag in one hand and a Styrofoam cup in the other.</p><p>A delicious smell wafted toward her. \u201cYou brought food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He handed her the cup topped with a plastic lid and straw. \u201cA chocolate shake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I love chocolate!\u201d She took a long sip, then moaned. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I was really getting tired of water and beef jerky.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a Styrofoam box out of the bag. \u201cThis is a hamburger and French fries from the Romatech cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet.\u201d She grabbed the box and wondered why he suddenly looked pissed. \u201cIs something wrong? Is your brother all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good.\u201d Phineas dug a ketchup packet out of the bag and handed it to her. \u201cAngus is sending some guys to help us out. Since Jason said the lady who attacked him insisted on being called his queen, it\u2019s one of the best leads we\u2019ve had. So as soon as it gets dark over there, Zoltan, Jack, and Lara will start teleporting our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Zoltan?\u201d Brynley asked as she squeezed ketchup over the French fries.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Coven Master for Eastern Europe. He doesn\u2019t work for Angus, but he\u2019s always helpful when it comes to fighting Malcontents.\u201d</p><p>Brynley nodded and took a bite out of her hamburger.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I can bring you?\u201d Phineas asked. \u201cSome pillows or blankets?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a wry look. \u201cIn a hurry to run off again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to make sure you\u2019re comfortable. Since you\u2019re stuck here with the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. More than good.\u201d She stuffed a French fry into her mouth. \u201cNothing like home delivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. If you don\u2019t need anything else . . .\u201d</p><p>He was going to run off again, dammit. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay for a while? I\u2019m tired of being alone.\u201d Boy, was that an understatement. She\u2019d felt alone for twelve years, ever since her mom died and Phil ran off. \u201cWe could talk. Until I fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>He gave a wary look. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. Why don\u2019t you tell me your life story?\u201d She smirked. \u201cThat would probably put me to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. Talk. I want to know more about you.\u201d Her wolfish instincts told her she could trust him, but the human part of her wanted to make sure.</p><p>He eased slowly into a sitting position beside her. Even though he kept his face blank, it was obvious he was sore.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel better after your death-sleep, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d He scooted back to lean against the wall.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d She turned toward him, sitting cross-legged. \u201cTell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that. You don\u2019t get a warrant for your arrest doing nothing.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cI\u2019ve done a few things I\u2019m not proud of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t we all?\u201d She ate a few fries, and when he remained quiet, she prompted him. \u201cYou were born in the Bronx?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I grew up in my grandmother\u2019s house with her, my great-aunt, and my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to jail when I was a baby. Armed robbery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh wow. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I had a great childhood.\u201d He smiled with a faraway look in his eyes. \u201cI had my gran, my aunt Ruth, and my mom, all taking care of me, making sure I always felt loved and cared for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds wonderful.\u201d She ate another fry. \u201cThree women spoiling you rotten. No wonder you became a ladies\u2019 man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did learn how to sweet-talk them.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cIt didn\u2019t last. Gran passed away when I was eight, and soon after that, my dad got out of prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She had a bad feeling his dad was as domineering as her own father.</p><p>\u201cHe moved in with us, and about a year later, my mom had a baby. My little brother. She wanted to name him Lamont, but my dad wanted to name him Freedom to commemorate his getting out of jail. They ended up naming him Freemont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s working at Romatech now?\u201d Brynley took another bite of hamburger.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s nineteen years old now. Going to college. He\u2019s real smart.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the obvious pride in Phineas\u2019s voice when he talked about his brother.</p><p>\u201cTwo years after Freemont, my little sister, Felicia, was born. I was about eleven then, and I started to notice things. Like my mom would walk with a limp sometimes, or her arms would be bruised.\u201d</p><p>Brynley winced. \u201cYour dad was abusing her?\u201d</p><p>Phineas nodded. \u201cI could hear him yelling at her late at night, but I kept telling myself that was all he was doing. I couldn\u2019t admit what was really happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were just a kid,\u201d Brynley murmured. \u201cDenial can be the safest way to go.\u201d She knew that all too well.</p><p>\u201cOne morning when I was twelve, my mom had a black eye, and my aunt Ruth started fussing at my dad, and he threatened to shut her up for good. That\u2019s when it finally hit me. Something snapped in me that day, and I told him if he ever hurt my mother or Aunt Ruth again, I\u2019d kill him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my gosh, Phineas.\u201d She set the box of food down and moved closer to him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe beat the crap out of me.\u201d</p><p>She gasped and touched his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. It changed my life. I\u2019d been a little kid before that with no purpose or direction. I was a lousy student and a lazy athlete, but that day, I woke up. I realized I needed to man up. I started working hard in school, so I could get a good job to support the family. And I started going to a gym every afternoon to learn how to box.\u201d</p><p>Man up? Brynley\u2019s heart ached for the twelve-year-old boy who\u2019d tried to become a man overnight so he could provide for his family and protect them.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I was fourteen, I was a pretty good boxer. I won a few local bouts. And I was as tall as my dad, so he started being more careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt didn\u2019t last. He came home drunk one night and started in on my mom. That time, I beat the crap out of him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d Brynley breathed. He\u2019d stood up to his dad. Something she\u2019d never had the nerve to do with her own dad.</p><p>\u201cThen I told him to leave and never come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Phineas shrugged. \u201cTurned out he had another woman on the side, so he just moved in with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got what he deserved. His girlfriend had cheated on him and passed the AIDS virus to him.\u201d Phineas sighed. \u201cHe\u2019d passed it on to my mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>Phineas was silent for a moment with his eyes closed. When he opened his eyes, they glinted with unshed tears. \u201cShe died of AIDS when I was nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Phineas.\u201d Brynley leaned her head against his shoulder and rested a hand against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I know how it feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d He placed his hand on top of hers.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. \u201cI lost my mom when I was eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cI thought werewolves could live for centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with lung cancer.\u201d Or a broken spirit. She\u2019d always suspected her mother hadn\u2019t fought to survive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He laced his fingers with hers.</p> <p>\u201cDo you still have your aunt?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He leaned his head back against the wall. \u201cShe worked hard to support us. And I won some money in boxing matches, so we managed all right. But toward the end when Mom was really sick, we ran up some bad medical bills. And then there was the cost of the funeral.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI did something really stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agreed to throw a fight for a lot of money. I thought it would solve all our problems. It did pay everything off, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt screwed up your career?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, Phineas.\u201d Tears crowded her eyes once again. He\u2019d destroyed his boxing career in order to bury his mother.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t get a decent fight after that. Or when I did, they expected me to throw it, and I refused. They didn\u2019t want me around anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried getting a regular job, but it wasn\u2019t enough to support everyone, especially when Aunt Ruth had to retire. She has diabetes really bad. I felt responsible for my younger brother and sister. I was the one who\u2019d chased off their father. So I . . . I made another stupid mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when you sold drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t ever tell my family. It would kill them. It . . . well, it did kill me. The Malcontents attacked and transformed me so they would have a drug connection.\u201d He heaved a long sigh. \u201cSo now you know what a screwed-up, miserable excuse for a mortal I was. And why I didn\u2019t want to tell you. You\u2019ll probably hate me now.\u201d</p><p>She blinked away the tears in her eyes. She could never hate him. \u201cWhy did you tell me, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember how I said I like you just the way you are? I guess . . . I want you to like me the way I am. And so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me everything,\u201d she finished his sentence. She\u2019d been right. He was a survivor. Like her. He\u2019d lost his mother like her. He\u2019d tried to take care of his younger siblings like she had. All this time she\u2019d thought they had nothing in common, when in truth they were very much alike. Their wounded souls were reaching out to each other.</p><p>And she was falling for him. A tear rolled down her cheek. God, no. She didn\u2019t want to feel this strongly for him. Not when there was no future for them.</p><p>\u201cI know you hate vampires, Brynley, but it\u2019s really the best thing that ever happened to me. It gave me a second chance. I have a good job now, and I provide for my family. And I\u2019m doing something important, helping to keep the world safe from Malcontents.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re able to be a hero now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to be. Angus and the other guys have given me some good examples to follow. I want to be . . . honorable like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas.\u201d She touched his cheek. \u201cHow can you be so dense?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were always honorable.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cI was a damned drug dealer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a young man, desperate to take care of his family. You threw away a promising career to get the money to bury your mother. You were brave and selfless.\u201d Another tear fell down her cheek. \u201cYou were always a hero.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her with a stunned look. \u201cYou don\u2019t think badly of me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re wonderful.\u201d Desire swelled up inside her. She wanted him so bad. But she didn\u2019t want to love him. It would hurt something awful if she lost him. And she would definitely lose him if her father and his minions found out about him.</p><p>Then don\u2019t love him, her inner wolf whispered. Just screw him.</p><p>She drew in a sharp breath, and her inner wolf latched on to Phineas\u2019s scent. Animal lust flooded her, overwhelming her womanly desire. Take him. You know you want him.</p><p>Her heart raced. She couldn\u2019t do this. She was just distraught, and that always made her wolf aggressive. Give in to me. Trust the wolf. The wolf knows best.</p><p>Moisture seeped between her legs, and she stifled a groan. It would kill her if she got close to Phineas, only to lose him. Don\u2019t think about the future. Take him now!</p><p>Phineas stiffened when she suddenly straddled his lap. \u201cBrynley? What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Her hands trembled as they skimmed over his shoulders. \u201cI have a sudden, insatiable hunger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought you a hamburger\u2014\u201d He inhaled sharply when she popped the snaps open on his shirt. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh.\u201d She smoothed her hands under his shirt. \u201cYou were right. Your chest is pure, hard muscle.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a dubious look. \u201cWhat happened to last night\u2019s \u2018you\u2019re so easy to resist\u2019 strategy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy fight it? You want me. I want you.\u201d She brushed her hand over his jaw, and the prickle of his whiskers made her all fluttery inside. Just like his voice did. \u201cSay it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. The line you say in the commercial. \u2018Hello, ladies.\u2019 I love it when you say that.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know why women like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know how sexy your voice is?\u201d She skimmed her hand down his neck to his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re sexy all over.\u201d She leaned closer, pressing her hands against his chest. \u201cSay it. Say the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, ladies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d More moisture pooled between her legs. Her inner wolf caught the scent of her arousal and clawed its way to the surface. Take him! She ripped open the rest of his shirt, then attacked the huge buffalo-shaped buckle on his belt. \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . we haven\u2019t even kissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She let go of his buckle. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d She lunged forward, planting her mouth on his.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he grumbled as she ground her mouth against his. He grabbed her shoulders and pushed her back. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you all of a sudden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? You said you were attracted to me. And that you liked me. I saw your eyes turn red. That means you want sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they red now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but they will be.\u201d She nipped at his ear.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d He pushed her back again. \u201cLook, I sorta figured we\u2019d take this slowly. You know, kiss a few times, and then make out before we . . . and I sure the hell thought I would be the one initiating it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d She glared at him. \u201cThen go ahead. Initiate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ordering me to initiate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want sex, Phineas! Is that a crime? I want you, and my inner wolf wants you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy inner wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. Is that why you\u2019re so aggressive?\u201d</p><p>She huffed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. Are you going to analyze this to death? Let\u2019s just have sex and get it over with!\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cGet it over with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! That\u2019s why we\u2019re bickering all the time. \u2019Cause we\u2019re hot for each other. So let\u2019s get it out of our system\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we can go back to our normal lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She jabbed a finger at his chest. \u201cAre you man enough to handle it?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand. \u201cStop and think about this. If your father finds out about us, he\u2019ll disown you forever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what my father thinks. He\u2019s always treated me like shit!\u201d</p><p>Phineas flinched. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going on, isn\u2019t it? This is your way to get back at him. Screw the man he would most hate for you to screw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it so complicated! It\u2019s simply lust.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cLust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it like it\u2019s a dirty word. If you weren\u2019t lusting for me, your eyes wouldn\u2019t have turned red. I\u2019m just saying there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a little bit of fun. No one would ever know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would keep our relationship secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would keep it private.\u201d She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cYou said yourself there\u2019s no future for us. So screw the future. Let\u2019s just do what we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a secret affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She brushed her hair over her shoulder. \u201cI guess you don\u2019t understand. Werewolves are by nature lusty creatures. We never deny ourselves the pleasure whenever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deny it.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. You\u2019re not gettin\u2019 any.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. He was rejecting her? \u201cAre you crazy? What man turns down sex?\u201d</p><p>He moved her off his legs and onto the sleeping bag, then stood. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow night, Brynley. Get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She scrambled to her feet. \u201cYou can\u2019t just leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d He vanished.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cDammit! Dammit to hell!\u201d Phineas strode across the grounds at Romatech where he\u2019d materialized just seconds earlier. He was not in the mood to see anyone, so instead of going inside, he\u2019d headed for the nearby woods.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d He punched a tree trunk. The rough bark ripped at his knuckles, but he punched again. And again. \u201cLet\u2019s get it over with? Let\u2019s keep it secret? It\u2019s simply lust?\u201d With one last bellow of outrage, he slammed his fist into the tree.</p><p>Damn, that hurt. He clenched his bloodied hands, relieved to have the pain torment him. Anything to keep him from feeling desire. Anything to keep him from teleporting back to Brynley. God, he was crazy. Brynley wanted him, and he\u2019d refused her? You fool! Go back and make love to her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d It wasn\u2019t love for her. It was lust. And a desperate, pathetic way to get back at her father. She\u2019d admitted in a fit of anger that he\u2019d treated her like shit. She thought dear old dad had used her like a pawn? She was doing the same damned thing to him.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d He paced toward the basketball court. His hands throbbed so much he no longer felt the pain in his legs.</p><p>Dammit. Had he made a terrible mistake? What if rejecting her destroyed what little affection she had for him? What if he\u2019d lost her for good?</p><p>\u201cPhineas!\u201d Freemont ran toward him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, bro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He kept walking.</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I saw you on a monitor, beating the crap out of a tree.\u201d Freemont caught up with him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Go back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got against the tree? Did it look at you funny?\u201d</p><p>Phineas ground his teeth. His brother\u2019s attempt to cheer him up wasn\u2019t working. \u201cGo back inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were here less than an hour ago,\u201d Freemont continued. \u201cEverything was cool. And now it\u2019s not? Did you take the food to the wolfie-girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were worried about her camping alone. You were going to hang out with her to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Phineas gritted out. She had a shotgun and an inner wolf that was scary as hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOooh.\u201d Freemont halted. \u201cI sense some lady trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real sensitive guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t snarl at me. Is that what happened? The wolfie-girl snarled at you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour shirt\u2019s open. Did you make a pass at her?\u201d</p><p>Phineas snorted. He pressed a few snaps together to close his shirt and left the plaid material stained with blood.</p><p>\u201cYour hands are bleeding, bro,\u201d Freemont said quietly. \u201cYou should come inside and get cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll heal during my death-sleep.\u201d But his heart might never be the same. Phineas retrieved a basketball from the large Rubbermaid bin, then dashed onto the court and levitated to do a slam dunk.</p> <p>\u201cCool!\u201d Freemont retrieved the ball and started some fancy dribbling around his legs.</p><p>Phineas grabbed for the ball, but his brother neatly passed it between his legs and out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cGive me the ball,\u201d Phineas growled.</p><p>Freemont dribbled down the court, heading for the other basket.</p><p>\u201cGive me the damned ball!\u201d Phineas zoomed past him at vampire speed and blocked him.</p><p>Freemont screeched to a halt. \u201cHey! No fair pulling your vampire tricks when I don\u2019t have any.\u201d He twisted when Phineas made a grab for the ball. \u201cIs that what happened? You tried some vampire tricks on her, and she rejected you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t reject me!\u201d He lurched for the ball, but Freemont surprised him, throwing it at him hard.</p><p>It hit him in the stomach, knocking him back a few steps. \u201cWhat the hell was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me!\u201d Freemont scowled at him. \u201cWhy are you so pissed? Why are you attacking trees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she wanted sex!\u201d Phineas threw the ball all the way down court and it plopped neatly through the hoop.</p><p>Freemont\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cWow, you scored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I turned her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you turned down sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Phineas trudged down the court to retrieve the ball.</p> <p>\u201cHow could you do that?\u201d Freemont followed him. \u201cYou\u2019re the Love Doctor.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot anymore. I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Freemont gasped. \u201cYou can\u2019t get it up?\u201d</p><p>Phineas shot him an incredulous look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, bro.\u201d Freemont smiled encouragingly. \u201cThere are doctors for that sort of thing. And drugs. We\u2019ll get help for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not impotent, dammit! I\u2019m falling in love!\u201d</p><p>Freemont\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou are?\u201d He grimaced. \u201cWith a wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolf. And I\u2019m falling for the human part of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Phineas yelled. \u201cI love her just the way she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Freemont held up his hands. \u201cSo I guess she doesn\u2019t return your feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t.\u201d Phineas picked up the ball and tossed it back into the plastic bin.</p><p>\u201cBut she wanted to have sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He slammed the lid down.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>He glared at his bloody hands. \u201cShe wants to keep our relationship a secret. I want to shout it to the world. She wants to jump right into it. I want to take it slow and savor every moment. She wants to get it over with, and I want it to never end.\u201d</p><p>Freemont was silent a moment, then said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got it bad.\u201d</p><p>Phineas sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve had one-night stands with women I can hardly remember. I\u2019m not doing that with Brynley. It would be an insult to her and to the feelings I have for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re tough, bro. I don\u2019t think I could have turned her down.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sadly. \u201cBelieve me, I want to make love to her more than anything. But I want it to be love.\u201d</p><p>Freemont nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get your hands cleaned up.\u201d He motioned toward the side entrance. \u201cDon\u2019t give up, bro. She could still fall in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Phineas groaned inwardly. Even if his wish came true, and she somehow magically fell for him, there were still major obstacles in the way. She would never be happy if she were forced to live in the vampire world. And he would never be accepted in the Lycan world. Hell, her father would probably send his minions to kill him.</p><p>The next evening, Brynley paced nervously about her brother\u2019s cabin. The sun was setting. Phineas would be waking soon. And when he teleported to the cabin, her mortification would be complete.</p><p>If he teleported to the cabin. She wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d come. He might never want to see her again.</p><p>Early that morning, Trudy had arrived at the trailhead campsite with her trailer, and they\u2019d transported the horses back to the stable at her brother\u2019s cabin. After Trudy left, Brynley had dashed into the cabin to see if Phineas was all right. She shoved the sofa away from the trapdoor, then moved the ladder from the loft to climb down into the basement.</p><p>No Phineas. He hadn\u2019t returned to the cabin.</p><p>After lunch, she fell asleep on the sofa, exhausted from a sleepless night at the campsite. She hadn\u2019t been able to relax after Phineas had left. She\u2019d felt too insulted. Too angry. Too frustrated. And eventually, too embarrassed. Mortified.</p><p>She\u2019d practically forced herself on him! What had come over her? She\u2019d never behaved like that before. Sure, the inner wolf was a lusty creature, but she\u2019d always had control over it. Until last night.</p><p>Her inner wolf had never been so strong before. And she\u2019d allowed it to overwhelm her. Hell, she\u2019d welcomed it. The wolf had given her the wild boldness she\u2019d craved. It had matched her desperate passion with its fierce power. Together, she\u2019d never felt stronger. She\u2019d felt invincible. Her prey was targeted, and he couldn\u2019t escape.</p><p>But he had. He\u2019d abandoned her without explanation. And it had hurt. It hurt so bad, she knew she could no longer deny what was happening. She was falling in love. And she\u2019d chased him away!</p><p>What if he never came back?</p><p>What if he did? How could she ever face him? Mortified.</p><p>She strode outside to the porch and watched the last rays of the sun disappear over the horizon. If Phineas had spent the night at Romatech in New York, he was already awake.</p><p>The nearly full moon tugged at the wolf inside her, and it tensed in anticipation. Tomorrow night, it would be free. A surge of power shot through her, and she gasped. Why was the wolf so strong? Was it because she\u2019d come home? Or because she\u2019d fallen prey to such strong emotions?</p><p>A sound in the cabin made her heart lurch. She whirled around to peer in the window. Phineas was back! And he was loading bottled blood into the refrigerator. That meant he intended to stay. Yes!</p><p>Her sense of relief was short-lived. She still had to face him.</p><p>She opened the door and stepped inside.</p><p>He glanced at her and smiled. \u201cYou made it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She inched forward. At least he was smiling. \u201cSo did you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought some more blood from Romatech.\u201d He shut the refrigerator door and motioned to a box on the island. \u201cAnd I brought you a dessert from the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She eased toward the island. He didn\u2019t seem to be angry about last night.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Chocolate cake. You like chocolate, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She peeked inside the box and nearly drooled at the sight of a seven-layer double chocolate piece of heaven.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot to cover tonight.\u201d He retrieved a folded piece of paper from his jacket pocket. \u201cI hope you got some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I slept most of the afternoon.\u201d She shifted her weight. \u201cMaybe we should talk . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He unfolded the paper. \u201cI got an e-mail from Angus. After reading my report, he thought we should check all the local clinics and hospitals to see if any other people were admitted with a severe loss of blood. So I made a list here, and we\u2019ll hit as many as possible tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were going to the Carson ranch? To check out the cow mutilations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will, if we can fit it in. But Angus thinks, and I agree with him, that Corky will stick to human victims if at all possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Brynley retrieved a fork from the cutlery drawer and tried a bite of the cake. It looked like Phineas didn\u2019t want to talk about last night\u2019s fiasco. Maybe he was as mortified as she was. The chocolate melted in her mouth, a warm, gooey comfort.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d He smiled, his eyes softening and looking as sweet as chocolate.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cYes, thank you. So, did you want to teleport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I mapped the trip for us.\u201d He handed her the paper. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind driving me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her heart swelled, grateful that she could help him. \u201cSure. Let me get my purse and a bottle of water, and we\u2019ll hit the road.\u201d</p><p>They were halfway to the town of Shell when Brynley finally worked up the nerve to talk.</p><p>She glanced at Phineas, who was sitting calmly beside her, sipping from a bottle of blood and looking out the window. \u201cI owe you an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do. I . . . I practically attacked you last night.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNo big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is! I scared you away.\u201d</p><p>His head turned slowly toward her. \u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I chased you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d He glowered at her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared. And I wasn\u2019t chased. I chose to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I attacked you. I\u2019m really sorry. I don\u2019t know what got into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew last night. You called it lust.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cYes. But I don\u2019t usually lose control like that. My inner wolf seems to be unnaturally strong all of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can feel the wolf inside you? I always thought you were either human or wolf, not both at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wolf is always with me.\u201d She pressed a hand to her chest. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never felt it so strongly before. It\u2014it\u2019s very strange.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her silently for a while. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because the moon is almost full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I suppose.\u201d Though she\u2019d never experienced this before when the moon was waxing. \u201cI thought it might also be because I\u2019ve returned home. The wolf is very excited about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to turn tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I won\u2019t have any choice. For ordinary werewolves like me, we have to turn on the first night of the full moon. The two nights after that, we can choose to shift or remain human. Alphas like my father or Phil can shift or even partially shift whenever they like.\u201d She gave him an apologetic look. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to help you tomorrow. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>He waved that aside. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize for what you are.\u201d</p><p>She recalled the words he\u2019d said the night before. He liked her just the way she was.</p><p>He took another sip from his bottle. \u201cAnd don\u2019t apologize for last night. I was . . . flattered.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, then back at the road. \u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I hope someday we will make love.\u201d</p><p>Her heart jumped up her throat. He did want her! She clenched the steering wheel as her heart pounded. Calm yourself. He could probably hear her heart racing.</p><p>A question popped into her mind. If he wanted to make love, why did he turn her down last night?</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s the town.\u201d He motioned to the lights up ahead.</p><p>She parked in front of the emergency clinic and accompanied him inside. In a matter of seconds, he had the receptionist\u2019s mind under his control and she gave them the news. No one had been admitted in the past two weeks with bite marks or a low level of blood. No unexplained deaths.</p><p>They went on to Greybull, Manderson, and Worland. No victims there. Brynley headed east to Ten Sleep.</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>The receptionist nodded, glassy-eyed. \u201cYes, we had a patient last night. Dead on arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about it?\u201d Phineas pressed.</p><p>The receptionist tilted her head. \u201cIt was very strange. No sign of trauma, but somehow he had bled out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay we see his file?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>Brynley leaned close to read the page detailing the victim\u2019s personal information. Earl Giddons had worked as a cowhand on a nearby ranch. \u201cSee this?\u201d She pointed at Nate Carson\u2019s address.</p><p>Phineas nodded and closed the folder. \u201cLooks like we\u2019ll be visiting your old friend after all.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about Nate?\u201d Phineas asked as Brynley drove toward the Carson ranch house.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a really nice guy. A mortal. Served in the army. He would never get involved with the Malcontents.\u201d</p><p>She was quick to defend him, Phineas noted. \u201cIf Corky\u2019s taken over his mind and his ranch, then it doesn\u2019t matter how nice a guy he is.\u201d</p><p>Brynley winced. \u201cI hope he\u2019s all right. He\u2019s been through so much already, poor guy.\u201d</p><p>Another twinge of jealousy pricked at Phineas. \u201cIf he\u2019s a mortal, how did you meet him? At college?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cRodeo circuit. I used to do barrel racing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou raced barrels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my horse and I raced around them.\u201d She gave him an incredulous look. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been to a rodeo?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not big in the Bronx.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cWell, they\u2019re a lot of fun. You should see one sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised your dad let you hang out with a bunch of mortals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, he wasn\u2019t very happy about it. When I first started, I thought I was being so clever, that I\u2019d found a way to get away from him and make some money of my own. But I soon realized that the rodeo had plenty of werewolves, and they were reporting everything I did to my dad. He could have ordered them to bring me home whenever he wanted. My freedom was only an illusion.\u201d She made a face. \u201cStill, it was a lot better than being at home. It was one of the happier times in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this guy Nate was in the rodeo, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. He and his brother were into team roping. Kyle was the header, and Nate was the heeler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyle would lasso the head of the calf, and then Nate would manage to lasso the hind legs. It\u2019s really amazing to watch.\u201d</p> <p>Phineas frowned, picturing her gazing at Nate in amazement. \u201cSo it takes two guys to tie up a little cow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe calf is moving at the time.\u201d Brynley shot him an annoyed look. \u201cAnd they\u2019re on horseback. It takes a lot of skill, and they manage to do it in a matter of seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So what was the problem with Kyle?\u201d</p><p>Brynley waved a dismissive hand. \u201cIt was no big deal. He kept pestering me for a date and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. Nate told him to leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Phineas strongly suspected that was the sanitized version of what had happened. He recalled her fear of being attacked from behind. \u201cDid this Kyle hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cReally. It was never bad enough to make me quit the rodeo circuit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why did you quit?\u201d</p><p>Her hands gripped the steering wheel, and he heard her heartbeat speed up. He\u2019d touched on something, but he wasn\u2019t sure what.</p><p>They rounded a hill, and some bright lights came into view in the distance.</p><p>\u201cNate\u2019s house.\u201d She motioned ahead. \u201cDo you really think Corky could be there?\u201d</p><p>Phineas winced. The house looked more like a mansion. Nate had to be rich. And he probably had a thing for Brynley. \u201cCorky would definitely prefer this to a cabin in the woods. And she would have some handsome cowboys here to nibble on.\u201d</p><p>Brynley snorted. \u201cNot all cowboys are handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d He checked the knives he had hidden in each of his boots and the automatic in his shoulder holster. \u201cYou have the silver chains I gave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She patted her jacket pockets.</p> <p>\u201cIf we see her, I\u2019ll grab her. You get the silver around her as fast as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Brynley turned into the long driveway. \u201cI\u2019m glad you included me in the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for your help as long as it\u2019s safe. But if we come under attack, I\u2019m teleporting you out.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not helpless, you know. I\u2019ve fought in a few of your vampire battles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you were in wolf form.\u201d He gave her a wry look. \u201cWhich makes you even scarier than usual.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019d better believe it, bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnout-Face.\u201d He spotted a surveillance camera by the front door. \u201cWe\u2019re being watched. Stop in front and wait in the car till I come around to your door.\u201d</p><p>She braked and turned off the engine. \u201cI don\u2019t see any guards. It looks peaceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppearances can be deceiving.\u201d He climbed out of the car, and scanned the area. Listened. Nothing but the rustle of the wind blowing through trees.</p><p>He skirted the front of the car and opened Brynley\u2019s door. \u201cStick close to me, so I can teleport you out if I need to.\u201d</p><p>She groaned with frustration, then climbed out of the car and dropped the keys into her handbag. \u201cStop worrying so much about me, Phin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible, Bryn.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his for a second, and a wave of desire ripped through him. He clenched his fist to keep from caressing her face and looked away. This was not the time. Nate\u2019s house could be infiltrated with Malcontents.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He escorted her to the front door.</p><p>She glanced warily at the camera and pressed the doorbell. \u201cIt\u2019s almost midnight. They may not answer.\u201d</p><p>Phineas slipped his hand inside his jacket, ready to pull his weapon. When the last jangle of the door chimes faded away, he could hear footsteps echoing in what sounded like a large foyer. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming. Maybe it\u2019s Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She stopped when the door swung open and a well-dressed elderly man glared at them.</p><p>\u201cIt is a bit late to be calling, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asked with a British accent.</p><p>A butler? Phineas removed his hand from his jacket. As far as he could tell, the man was mortal and not suffering from any vampire mind control. \u201cWe\u2019d like a word with Nate Carson, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>The butler looked down his nose. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas McKinney, and this is Brynley Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan and I are old friends,\u201d Brynley added.</p><p>The butler glanced at her. \u201cQuite old, obviously, since you\u2019ve never darkened this doorstep in the three years of my employment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d a voice called from across the foyer. \u201cLet them in.\u201d</p><p>An annoyed look flitted over the butler\u2019s face, and he lowered his voice. \u201cVery well. You may come in, but do not overly tire Mr. Carson.\u201d He stepped back and motioned for them to enter.</p><p>\u201cNate!\u201d Brynley ran into the foyer.</p><p>Phineas followed and stopped short. Nate was hurrying toward Brynley. As fast as he could in his wheelchair.</p><p>\u201cYou seem surprised,\u201d John murmured as he shut the door. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>Phineas shook his head. \u201cI heard he was in the rodeo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before his unit was called up and he was sent to Iraq,\u201d John explained. \u201cHe jumped on some fellow soldiers to protect them from an explosion. Took some shrapnel in his back. Saved his buddies, but injured his spinal cord.\u201d</p><p>Phineas watched Brynley hug her heroic friend and felt lousy that he\u2019d ever entertained bad thoughts about the guy. \u201cSo he\u2019s paralyzed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the waist down, yes. But he manages the ranch. By the way, I\u2019m John Brighton, his personal valet and physical therapist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Phineas shook hands with him. \u201cI thought you were a butler.\u201d</p><p>John smiled. \u201cMy father was a butler. I\u2019ll take that as a compliment. Good evening.\u201d He inclined his head and strode away.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Phineas.\u201d Brynley waved him over. \u201cThis is Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, dude.\u201d He shook Nate\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d With a grin, Nate turned to Brynley. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you again. You\u2019re looking good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cI should have come sooner. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Nate waved a dismissive hand. \u201cI heard that you\u2019d flown the coop, and I was relieved you\u2019d managed to escape.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cYou heard about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody around here gossips about the mighty Jones family. According to the rumor I heard, your dad threw a big birthday party for you when you turned thirty, then announced you were engaged to be married. In three days. When everyone woke up the next morning, you were gone.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Phineas asked. She was thirty years old?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Brynley muttered. \u201cMy father arranged a wedding with a groom and a twenty-piece orchestra, but forgot to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he knew you would refuse,\u201d Nate added. \u201cWho was the groom? Some rancher from around here?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSome dude from Alaska. I never met him. He was supposed to arrive the day I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father has some gall,\u201d Nate grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, speaking of which\u2014\u201d Brynley lowered her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to know that I\u2019m back. I\u2019ll only be here a few nights, and I really need to avoid him and his minions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. I won\u2019t say a word.\u201d Nate motioned toward an open door. \u201cLet\u2019s go into my office, so we can talk.\u201d He started wheeling his chair in that direction.</p><p>Brynley held back, then whispered to Phineas, \u201cWell? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thirty years old?\u201d</p><p>She swatted his shoulder. \u201cAbout Nate. Is he under vampire mind control? Do you think there are any Malcontents around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks safe so far. And your friend is fine.\u201d Phineas rubbed his shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019re thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she hissed. \u201cI\u2019ll look this young for hundreds of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will I.\u201d He arched a brow. \u201cWe have more in common than you might think.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed a pretty pink. \u201cYou\u2019re still a bloodsucker, and I\u2019m a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnout-Face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d She motioned with her head toward Nate. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Phineas accompanied her into Nate\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you two anything to drink?\u201d Nate asked as he pulled open the door to a small fridge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a diet cola.\u201d Brynley took the bottle he handed her.</p><p>\u201cNothing for me, thanks,\u201d Phineas said.</p><p>Nate dropped a water bottle in his lap, then wheeled behind his desk. \u201cSo what brings you out here so late at night?\u201d He unscrewed the bottle and took a sip.</p><p>Phineas sat in the chair next to Brynley. \u201cYou had a ranch hand named Earl Giddons who passed away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Nate frowned. \u201cI heard he died last night. Terrible news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what happened?\u201d Brynley asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Nate replied. \u201cKyle found him and rushed him to the clinic in Ten Sleep. He\u2019s supposed to report back to me, but I haven\u2019t heard anything yet. When I called the clinic, all they could tell me was that Earl was dead on arrival.\u201d</p><p>As far as Phineas could tell, the rancher was telling the truth. His heartbeat had remained steady. \u201cHave there been any other strange occurrences lately?\u201d</p><p>Nate gave him a curious look. \u201cAre you with the sheriff\u2019s department?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacKay Security and Investigation.\u201d Phineas pulled his ID from his wallet and showed it to the rancher.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Nate examined his ID. \u201cNever heard of them. It\u2019s international?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We provide security for select clientele around the world.\u201d They also conducted investigations related to the vampire world, but Phineas needed a safe way to explain his interest in Earl Giddons\u2019s death. \u201cWe specialize in investigating odd, unexplainable events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the X-Files?\u201d Nate handed the ID back.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Phineas pocketed his wallet. \u201cFor instance, according to his medical file, Earl Giddons suffered no visible trauma, but he was completely drained of blood.\u201d</p><p>Nate flinched.</p><p>\u201cThat surprises you?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d Nate ran a hand through his thick sandy hair. \u201cWe had two cows mutilated the night before last, and they were drained dry, too.\u201d</p><p>Phineas exchanged a glance with Brynley.</p><p>\u201cI figured it was wolves that attacked the cows.\u201d Nate grimaced. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot more wolves than usual this year. I told Kyle to shoot them, but he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of wolves draining all the blood from their prey,\u201d Brynley said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Nate conceded. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how else to explain the mutilations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t believe Earl Giddons was attacked by an animal,\u201d Phineas said.</p><p>Nate\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou think a person is behind all this? Some crazy person is out there collecting blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very possible,\u201d Phineas murmured.</p><p>Nate\u2019s fists clenched. \u201cWhoever he is, he\u2019s graduated from cattle to humans. He\u2019s a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe agree,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cWe have reason to believe the murderer is female.\u201d</p><p>Nate blinked. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know of any new women in the area?\u201d Brynley asked. \u201cShe could be living at one of the nearby ranches.\u201d</p><p>Nate tilted his head, considering. \u201cA few of the ranch hands have mentioned a beautiful blonde they\u2019ve seen recently at the old Haggerty ranch. Some wealthy guy from out of state bought the place about six months ago, but I haven\u2019t met him. Don\u2019t get out much. I have to rely on Kyle a lot these days.\u201d</p><p>Brynley smiled. \u201cYou two were always close.\u201d</p><p>A pained look crossed Nate\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . not the same. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Kyle has been great. He was always insisting that I\u2019d walk again and he\u2019d take care of things while I recovered. But after a few years, he . . . well, I think he\u2019s tired of doing so much work on a ranch that\u2019s not his. I don\u2019t blame him. I pay him as well as I can afford, and he does a great job, but . . .\u201d Nate drifted off with a sad look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Brynley whispered.</p><p>Nate shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault. He . . . fell into a bad crowd\u2014the rich guy who bought the Haggerty ranch. Kyle was talking about him all the time, and then, four months ago, he changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the better!\u201d a voice declared from the doorway.</p> <p>Phineas spun around to see a younger and more muscular version of Nate standing in the doorway.</p><p>Brynley rose to her feet. \u201cKyle!\u201d She stepped back with a gasp.</p><p>Phineas understood her reaction the instant Kyle\u2019s scent wafted toward him. Nate had been right about his brother changing.</p><p>He\u2019d become a werewolf.</p><p>Kyle smirked as he approached Brynley. \u201cOh yeah, princess. How do you like the new me?\u201d His mouth twisted into a snarl. \u201cMaybe you won\u2019t turn me down now.\u201d</p> <p>Brynley lifted her chin. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your species I objected to. It was your personality.\u201d</p><p>He lurched forward with a growl.</p><p>Phineas jumped to his feet and pulled Brynley close. \u201cBack off, furball.\u201d</p><p>Kyle glared at him. \u201cWho the hell are you? You have no right to her. You\u2019re not one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it out, Kyle.\u201d Nate wheeled his chair around the desk. \u201cThese are my guests.\u201d</p><p>Kyle laughed. \u201cYou never figured it out, Nate? Your sweet little friend Brynley is a werewolf.\u201d</p> <p>Nate halted, his eyes wide.</p><p>Brynley turned toward him. \u201cNathan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She glanced at Kyle, then back at Nate. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask to be changed. I was born this way.\u201d</p><p>Nate nodded slowly. \u201cI was shocked when my brother first told me about Lycans, but then I realized I should have figured it out earlier. I always knew there was something strange going on with some of the ranchers. Their followers show a loyalty that goes far beyond what you\u2019d expect of a hired ranch hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re loyal to our Pack Masters,\u201d Kyle boasted as he regarded Brynley with a gleam in his eyes. \u201cAnd this is our princess, daughter of the Supreme Pack Master.\u201d</p><p>Phineas tightened his arm around Brynley when he felt her shudder. It was obvious Kyle would run straight to her father to tell him she was back.</p><p>He aimed a strong surge of vampire mind control at the werewolf. Kyle was caught by surprise and stumbled back a few feet. His face went blank.</p> <p>You will forget you saw Brynley here. You will not speak of her to anyone. Now go!</p><p>Kyle turned and wandered from the room.</p><p>Brynley took a deep breath and squeezed Phineas\u2019s arm. \u201cPlease tell me you erased his memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I did.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t sure if it would last.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Nate studied them warily. \u201cYou erased my brother\u2019s memory? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t harm him. I\u2019m only trying to protect Brynley.\u201d</p><p>She hunched down beside the wheelchair. \u201cPlease, Nate. Don\u2019t tell anyone I was here. My father would capture me and force me into a marriage I don\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith another werewolf?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Caddoc Jones is the Supreme Pack Master?\u201d When Brynley nodded, Nate regarded her sadly. \u201cYou should have told me everything years ago. I thought you trusted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she insisted. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t know Lycans existed, and I was afraid if you knew the truth, you\u2019d . . . no longer be my friend.\u201d</p><p>Nate patted her shoulder. \u201cI would have understood. Your father is so damned powerful, and the way so many people kowtow to him makes me sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose aren\u2019t people,\u201d Phineas muttered. \u201cThey\u2019re werewolves.\u201d</p><p>Nate looked him over. \u201cYou\u2019re not one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you?\u201d Nate asked. \u201cSome kind of psychic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Phineas removed a MacKay business card from his wallet and set it on the desk. \u201cIf you see or hear anything out of the ordinary, please let us know. There could be something . . . evil in this area, and it must be defeated.\u201d</p><p>Nate\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cEvil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd please, Nathan,\u201d Brynley whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t let my father know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word.\u201d He wheeled closer to his desk and wrote on a slip of paper. \u201cThis is my number if you need any help.\u201d He handed it to her with a wry look. \u201cNot that I\u2019m much help to anyone these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you are.\u201d She hugged him, then turned to Phineas.\u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave. Nice to meet you, Nate.\u201d Phineas grabbed Brynley\u2019s arm and escorted her from the room.</p><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d Nate called after them.</p><p>\u201cWe will, thanks!\u201d Brynley yelled back as Phineas led her across the foyer and out the front door.</p><p>She fumbled in her handbag for the car keys. \u201cShall we drive back to the cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll drive.\u201d But not back to the cabin. If his vampire mind control had failed on Kyle, then Brynley\u2019s father would soon know she was in Wyoming. It wouldn\u2019t take a genius to figure out she was probably staying at her brother\u2019s cabin.</p><p>She climbed into the driver\u2019s seat and gave him a surprised look as he teleported into the passenger seat. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA precaution. This location is now embedded in my psychic memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou look worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything will be cool.\u201d He smiled at her, but he was worried. Worried that he\u2019d screwed up and left too many loose ends. He should have erased Nate\u2019s memory. And John Brighton\u2019s, too. \u201cDrive to the nearest town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be Ten Sleep.\u201d She headed down the driveway to the Carson ranch entrance. \u201cWhy are we going there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s close by.\u201d Phineas shrugged when she shot him an annoyed look. He had to protect her. And the best way to do that was to get her the hell out of Dodge.</p><p>He remained quiet until they arrived in Ten Sleep, where he spotted a grocery store with a parking lot. \u201cPull in here. Park over there.\u201d He pointed to a dark spot close to a tree.</p><p>\u201cThe store is closed,\u201d she objected, but did as she was told. She turned off the engine and looked at him. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll overnight the keys to your friend, and she can pick up the car here tomorrow.\u201d Phineas climbed out. \u201cLock up and bring your purse.\u201d He shut the door and strode toward the dark shadow of the tree.</p><p>She scrambled out of the car and swung her handbag onto her shoulder. \u201cTell me the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>With a huff, she strode toward him. \u201cWe\u2019re partners, remember? We should plan together.\u201d</p><p>He scanned the area. No one in sight. \u201cThe plan is to keep you safe.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her and teleported.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>As soon as Brynley materialized, she realized she wasn\u2019t in Wyoming anymore. Her inner wolf tensed, and she pulled away from Phineas. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomatech Industries.\u201d Phineas motioned toward the nearby building.</p><p>\u201cIn New York?\u201d Her gaze swept over the building, the gazebo and well-manicured garden, then shifted to the woods. She winced. \u201cWhat happened to that poor tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Phineas. \u201cWhy did you bring me here? I want to go back to Wyoming.\u201d Her inner wolf snarled, demanding to return home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should be,\u201d she insisted. \u201cDidn\u2019t you erase Kyle\u2019s memory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a hundred percent sure that it worked. When I tapped into his brain, it seemed kinda weird to me.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cAre you saying werewolves have weird brains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare. Not with you glaring at me like that. What I mean is I think the dude was on something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs?\u201d</p><p>Phineas tilted his head as he considered. \u201cI would say steroids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Brynley nodded her head slowly. \u201cHe did seem a lot more muscular than when I last saw him. Becoming a werewolf wouldn\u2019t automatically add all that bulk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he was acting like a prick.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s not a new development. He\u2019s always had a chip on his shoulder. Racked up some bad gambling debts he couldn\u2019t pay off, so Nate offered to buy his half of the ranch for twice what it was worth. Kyle took the money to pay his debts, but he\u2019s always resented his brother for coming to the rescue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s a werewolf now.\u201d Just what the Lycan world needed\u2014another mean, overbearing male like her father. \u201cI still want to go back to Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure the cabin is safe for you now.\u201d Phineas led her toward the side entrance. \u201cIs it unusual for a mortal to become a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Most mortals have no idea we exist. And we don\u2019t go around telling people. Or biting people. We keep to ourselves. Usually if a mortal is changed, it\u2019s because he was bitten by a werewolf who was forced to defend himself.\u201d</p><p>Phineas swiped his ID card, then opened the door for her. \u201cIt sounds like Nate\u2019s new neighbor is a werewolf, and he might be the one who changed Kyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy who bought the Haggerty ranch?\u201d She walked down the hall, trying to remain calm even though her inner wolf was growing increasingly agitated. \u201cCan you take me back tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd risk your father capturing you? I thought you were terrified of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Unfortunately, the wolf didn\u2019t care. It was growling inside her. \u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to be hunting Corky? We can\u2019t do that if we stay here. She might be at the Haggerty ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it alone. I\u2019m not putting you at risk.\u201d</p><p>She came to a stop. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to guard you anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can teleport back here for my death-sleep. I\u2019ll just have to keep track of the sunrise.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed hold of his arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I have to go back. I need to. Especially tomorrow night for the full moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can shift at the school. Or I\u2019ll take you to Howard\u2019s cabin in the Adirondacks. You know, the place where you guarded Marielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She squeezed his arm. \u201cOne night at home. My wolf needs it. It\u2019s growling inside me, Phineas. I feel like it\u2019ll claw its way out my throat if I don\u2019t do what it says!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d He eyed her warily. \u201cSheesh. I didn\u2019t realize it was so demanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to do what it wants. Please.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cI\u2019m just worried about your father finding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, if I roam around the Bighorn National Forest, no one would ever find me. Unless I wanted them to. It\u2019s over a million acres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d He spun toward a door that opened, then relaxed with a smile.</p><p>The guy who came out looked like a skinny, younger version of Phineas.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro. I didn\u2019t expect you back tonight.\u201d He gave Phineas a knuckle pound, then turned to Brynley, his dark brown eyes twinkling. \u201cYou must be the wolfie-girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Brynley.\u201d She shook his hand. \u201cYou must be Freemont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it! I\u2019m Da Freeze, the Ice Man.\u201d He motioned toward the open door. \u201cWelcome to my humble working quarters. It\u2019s a busy night at Vampireville. Lots of people stopping by. I use the term people loosely, you understand.\u201d</p><p>Brynley followed him and Phineas into the office and found three more people\u2014two men and a beautiful redheaded woman. They looked familiar, but she\u2019d never socialized much in the Vamp world and couldn\u2019t recall their names.</p><p>The woman grinned and grabbed her hand. \u201cYou must be Phil\u2019s sister! I\u2019m Lara di Venezia. And this is my husband, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d Jack shook her hand.</p><p>\u201cI am Zoltan Czakvar.\u201d The third man took her hand and bowed over it. He was a striking man with shoulder-length dark hair and almond-shaped amber eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, dudes.\u201d Phineas gave Zoltan and Jack knuckle pounds. \u201cDudette.\u201d He gave Lara a hug. \u201cSo did you guys just arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few hours ago,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been catching up on reports. Angus thinks you\u2019re following a strong lead in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zoltan agreed. \u201cWe were just about to call you to see if we could join you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we all go?\u201d Brynley turned to Phineas with a beseeching look.</p><p>\u201cThe cabin may not be safe for you.\u201d Phineas quickly explained the situation. \u201cI don\u2019t know if my mind control worked on Kyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never know if we don\u2019t go back,\u201d Brynley insisted.</p><p>\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Lara said. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell if her father\u2019s been informed if we stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my father knows, he\u2019ll send some of his goons to Phil\u2019s cabin,\u201d Brynley added.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go and see if anyone comes looking for you,\u201d Jack suggested.</p><p>\u201cI shall go, too,\u201d Zoltan offered.</p><p>\u201cIs there a television there?\u201d Lara asked. \u201cI want to go, but I don\u2019t want to miss Maggie and Darcy\u2019s new show.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat new show?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Lara huffed. \u201cI told you about it a dozen times. It\u2019s the latest celebrity talk show on DVN. Real Housewives of the Vampire World. The debut is tonight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to forget that,\u201d Jack muttered.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Lara gave him an exasperated look, then turned to Brynley. \u201cMaggie asked if we would do the next show at our palazzo in Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Brynley breathed. \u201cYou have a palazzo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Lara\u2019s eyes sparkled with excitement. \u201cIt would look fantastic on television. And I could show off all my favorite places in Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an invasion of privacy,\u201d Jack grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHeather and Jean-Luc did the show for tonight,\u201d Lara said. \u201cIf they can do it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d</p> <p>Jack gritted his teeth. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this later. For now, we need discuss who is going to Phil\u2019s cabin in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, me, and Zoltan,\u201d Lara answered. She glanced at Brynley. \u201cThere\u2019s a television, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Brynley nodded. \u201cIn the basement.\u201d She turned to Phineas. \u201cI want to go, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He held up a hand when she started to argue. \u201cThink it through. If your father\u2019s minions show up at the cabin and find these three guys watching television, they\u2019ll just think they made a mistake and leave. But if you\u2019re there, they\u2019ll attempt to take you, by force if necessary, and it\u2019ll turn into a battle. Do you want to risk any of these guys getting wounded or killed?\u201d</p><p>Brynley swallowed hard. She hardly knew Lara, Jack, and Zoltan. She assumed they\u2019d fought in the battles at Mount Rushmore like she had, but she\u2019d been in wolf form at the time and too involved in the battle to pay them any mind. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt because of me. Even without me there, my father\u2019s men might give you some trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Jack told her.</p> <p>\u201cWe are pleased to be of service,\u201d Zoltan added.</p><p>Lara touched her arm. \u201cWe\u2019re all one big family here. We\u2019re happy to help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not . . . one of . . .\u201d Brynley started.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Phil\u2019s sister,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou are one of us. And we look out for our own.\u201d</p><p>Brynley\u2019s heart squeezed in her chest. A family that truly cared and protected one another? Instead of using one another as pawns? It was a beautiful thought. And it struck a deep need inside her that had long been neglected. This was the way a pack should act. Truly caring for one another. Never banishing boys who showed great potential. Never treating women like bargaining chips.</p><p>\u201cHot damn!\u201d Freemont punched a fist in the air. \u201cWe\u2019re like the Musketeers! All for one, and one for all!\u201d</p><p>Everyone chuckled except Brynley, who blinked to keep tears from crowding her eyes. All this time she\u2019d hated the Vamps, but they were willing to endanger themselves to protect her. They considered her family.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teleport you guys to the cabin so you\u2019ll know the way,\u201d Phineas offered. He patted Brynley on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, her face averted so no one would know she was struggling not to cry.</p><p>Phineas turned off the alarm system, then teleported away with Zoltan. While the rest of them waited, Brynley explained their theory that Corky might be hiding at a ranch once owned by the Haggertys. And that the new owner might be a werewolf.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can find out.\u201d Freemont sat at the desk and started a search on the computer.</p><p>Phineas and Zoltan reappeared in the office, then teleported away, taking Jack and Lara with them.</p><p>Less than a minute later, Phineas materialized and turned the alarm system back on. \u201cEverything\u2019s set. Zoltan took the first watch on the porch, and Jack and Lara are in the basement watching television.\u201d</p><p>Brynley nodded. She still ached to return, but she knew this arrangement was for the best. \u201cI can still go back tomorrow night for the full moon, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe so. Like you said, it\u2019s a big place. We should be able to find someplace safe for you to shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her inner wolf grew calm, and she smiled with a sudden comforting feeling of peace. The wolf was happy, and she was happy to be surrounded by people who were willing to help her. \u201cBy the way, your brother\u2019s investigating the Haggerty ranch on the computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Phineas gave his brother a thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cI got it going on,\u201d Freemont murmured, his eyes focused on the monitor. \u201cThe Ice Man is too cool for school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of ice, would you like some ice cream?\u201d Phineas asked her. \u201cI could take you to the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, it\u2019s never too late for a red-hot date,\u201d Freemont whispered.</p><p>Phineas shot an annoyed look at his brother, then turned to Brynley. \u201cThe cafeteria is closed, but the soft-serve ice cream machine is always working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, a little chocolate swirl for the wolfie-girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Freemont,\u201d Phineas growled.</p><p>Brynley bit her lip to keep from grinning.</p><p>Freemont\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cOoh, look who\u2019s pissed, when he\u2019d rather be kissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Phineas grabbed Brynley and led her out the door.</p><p>\u201cWishing you luck,\u201d Freemont called after him. \u201cSo you\u2019ll have a good\u2014\u201d</p><p>Phineas whirled around to glare at him.</p><p>\u201c\u2014time on your date,\u201d Freemont finished, his eyes twinkling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we will.\u201d Brynley grinned as she looped her arm through Phineas\u2019s. \u201cOur first date, Phin.\u201d</p><p>His dark chocolate eyes gleamed. \u201cLet\u2019s do it, Bryn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook what I found in the kitchen.\u201d Phineas set a chocolate brownie on the table next to Brynley\u2019s bowl of chocolate swirl ice cream and glass of milk.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re spoiling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Anything to keep her mind off going back to Wyoming tonight. He sat beside her and plunked his bottle on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d She pinched off a corner of the brownie and popped it into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMost of the night shift are Vamps, so we don\u2019t use the cafeteria very much.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed when he twisted the top off his bottle. \u201cThat smells like beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bleer, a mixture of beer and synthetic blood.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitched. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be drinking Blardonnay?\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, but I don\u2019t really like Blardonnay very much.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and spooned some ice cream into her mouth. \u201cWell, you do a great job on the commercials. Do you have a lot of fans fawning all over you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cA few.\u201d</p><p>She pointed the spoon at him. \u201cI think it embarrasses you to be a sex symbol.\u201d</p><p>He made a face. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of . . . artificial. I want to be liked for the real me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure understand that.\u201d She took another bite of ice cream. \u201cI hate it when people pretend to like me because I\u2019m Caddoc Jones\u2019s daughter. I want to be liked for the real me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like you just the way you are,\u201d he reminded her, and she looked away, her cheeks growing pink.</p><p>He touched a lock of hair that rested on her shoulder. It was silky smooth against his fingertips. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think we have a lot in common. We can both live for a long time. We have lousy fathers. We lost our mothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both survivors,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWounded souls.\u201d</p><p>That seemed a little dramatic. He swiveled in his chair to face her. \u201cWhat wounded your soul, Brynley?\u201d</p><p>Her face grew pale. \u201cI-it\u2019s just an expression.\u201d She bit off a chunk of the brownie. \u201cThis is so good. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynley. I told you my story. Why won\u2019t you share yours?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and sipped some milk from her glass. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about it. To anyone.\u201d She avoided looking at him, and focused on the flat-screen television mounted on a wall.</p><p>Someone must have hurt her bad. It made him angry just to think about it. \u201cI\u2019m not just anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . . you\u2019re on TV!\u201d She pointed at the flat screen.</p><p>He frowned at the Blardonnay commercial that had just started.</p><p>\u201cQuick!\u201d She shoved at his shoulder. \u201cTurn up the volume!\u201d</p><p>With a frustrated groan, he zipped over to the TV and punched the volume button.</p><p>\u201cHello, ladies,\u201d his voice filled the room.</p><p>Brynley grinned at him. \u201cI love it!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and returned to the table with the remote control. She giggled when he said he had the family jewels in his hand.</p><p>He grunted and took a long swig of Bleer. He\u2019d come so close to getting past her defenses until he\u2019d been interrupted by himself.</p><p>\u201cOh look.\u201d She gestured at the flat screen. \u201cIt\u2019s the show Lara was talking about. Real Housewives of the Vampire World.\u201d</p><p>On the television screen, Maggie was standing with Heather Echarpe, who was introducing her husband and children.</p><p>\u201cOf course, everyone knows that Jean-Luc is a famous fashion designer,\u201d Heather said, glancing at her husband with adoring eyes. \u201cBut he\u2019s so much more. A wonderfully loving husband and father.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Luc shifted his weight, looking uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cAnd these are your children?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Heather drew a pretty girl close to her. \u201cThis is our daughter, Bethany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know her from the academy,\u201d Brynley said. \u201cShe\u2019s a sweetheart. But those twins\u2014my God, they\u2019re a handful.\u201d</p><p>After Heather showed off the toddlers, Jean-Pierre and Jillian, she gave her husband a hug. \u201cDid you know Jean-Luc is a champion swordsman? The best fencer in all of Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing!\u201d Maggie said.</p><p>Jean-Luc smiled, looking much more at ease.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind showing us around your home?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d Heather replied.</p><p>Maggie smiled at the camera. \u201cMy associate will be taking the tour with Heather. Darcy?\u201d</p><p>The screen shifted to a sunny day outdoors and showed Darcy in front of the camera.</p><p>\u201cThis is Darcy Erickson, reporting from Schnitzelberg, Texas. We have a special treat for you. You\u2019ll be the first Vamps to see the Echarpe home in daylight!\u201d She turned, and the camera turned with her to show Jean-Luc\u2019s house behind her.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Brynley sat back. \u201cThat\u2019s their house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Phineas frowned at the screen. \u201cI\u2019ve been there before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s huge. Is it real fancy inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sipped more Bleer. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not rich like the old Vamps around here. I can\u2019t afford a place like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a worried look. \u201cThat\u2019s something we don\u2019t have in common. You grew up rich, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was miserable,\u201d she interrupted him. \u201cI don\u2019t care about wealth, Phineas.\u201d</p><p>He heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cI make a good salary here, and the commercials pay really well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhin.\u201d She touched his arm. \u201cI like you just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>His heart swelled. He grabbed her hand and kissed it. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind anymore that I\u2019m a vampire?\u201d</p><p>She winced and withdrew her hand from his grasp. \u201cI was wrong to hate Vamps. I feel bad about it now. I was just . . . so angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She picked up her spoon and swirled it around in the ice cream. \u201cI was devastated when my mom died. And then right after that, Phil got into a terrible fight with my dad and was kicked out. I thought he would come back. But he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Phineas muted the volume on the television. \u201cIt must have been hard on you.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it. I was abandoned by the two people I loved the most. The only two people whom I could talk to and trust. I\u2014I\u2019ve always felt like my mother didn\u2019t fight the cancer. She just gave up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Brynley sighed. \u201cRemember how you were in denial over your father? I did the same thing. I was about twelve years old before I could admit what was happening. You see, as Supreme Pack Master, my father believes he has the right to take any female in the pack he desires.\u201d</p><p>Phineas gritted his teeth. \u201cHe cheated on your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She endured years of humiliation. Not only was it demeaning to her, but to the other women, too. Some of them were married and didn\u2019t want to be unfaithful. But their husbands didn\u2019t dare say no to the master. Some of the women actually considered it an honor, but the whole thing made my mother so ashamed. She\u2014she didn\u2019t want that kind of life for me.\u201d</p><p>Phineas squeezed her hand. \u201cI think she would be proud of you now.\u201d</p><p>Brynley smiled with tears in her eyes. \u201cThank you. I miss her so much. Her death was hard on my younger brother and sister, too. They were just eleven, so I tried to be a mother to them. When they were fourteen, they shifted for the first time, and then Howell thought he was too old to be babied, so he grew more distant. But my sister, Glynis, she\u2019s always depended on me. I hated leaving her there alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Phineas nodded. \u201cYou feel responsible for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Brynley took a deep breath. \u201cSo after my mother died, Phil had his fight with my father and left. It nearly killed me. I kept leaving notes at Phil\u2019s cabin, hoping he\u2019d see them and come back. I begged him to come back. And then finally, nine years later, he shows up at the cabin with Vanda. A vampire! And I find out he\u2019s been living with vampires all those years when I needed him so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou felt betrayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! And angry. And happy, too. I was delighted to have Phil back in my life, but I was so angry that he\u2019d chosen vampires over me, his twin sister. So I guess I channeled all that rage into a hatred of vampires. Vanda, especially. I\u2019ve been so rude to her.\u201d</p> <p>Phineas rubbed her back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I think Vanda understands.\u201d</p><p>Brynley sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s always been kind to me. I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You deserve kindness as much as anyone.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sad smile and touched his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re such a good man, Phineas.\u201d</p><p>He rested his hand on top of hers. \u201cBrynley, I\u2019m falling in love with you.\u201d</p> <p>With a gasp, she pulled her hand back. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. We can\u2019t . . . there\u2019s no future for us. You know that. You said it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. I used to think we were all wrong for each other, but now I think you\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not perfect for anyone. My father would try to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be!\u201d She jumped to her feet with tears in her eyes. \u201cYou should stay far away from me. My father will track you down and punish you. You don\u2019t know how terrible he can be. He\u2014\u201d She backed away, a tear tumbling down her cheek.</p><p>Phineas\u2019s breath caught in his throat. She\u2019d already admitted that her father had mistreated her mother. And other women in the pack. What had he done to his daughter?</p> <p>\u201cBrynley,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>With a strangled whimper, she pressed her hands to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh shit.\u201d Phineas felt sick to his stomach. He thought back to the expression she\u2019d used earlier when she\u2019d called them survivors. \u201cHe\u2019s the one, isn\u2019t he? He wounded your soul.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Brynley paced across the cafeteria, but the room wasn\u2019t big enough. Her wolf clawed at her insides like a caged animal. Free, it had to get free. Panic swelled in her chest, threatening to explode.</p><p>She pulled open a glass door and dashed outside. Tears blurred her vision, and she stumbled to a stop in the middle of a basketball court.</p><p>Dammit, she should have never fallen for Phineas. Now she\u2019d have to chase him away, and it was going to hurt like hell. Once again she would be left all alone.</p><p>You have me, her inner wolf growled, louder than ever before.</p> <p>It\u2019s not enough! she screamed back. I want more! But she couldn\u2019t have Phineas. Ever. Her chest seized with a pain that nearly doubled her over.</p><p>\u201cBrynley,\u201d Phineas called after her. A door clicked shut behind her.</p><p>Oh God, no. He would want an explanation, and she couldn\u2019t talk about it. The memories hovered over her like a toxic cloud. She couldn\u2019t breathe. She swiped at the tears on her face and sprinted toward the woods.</p><p>\u201cBrynley, wait!\u201d Phineas ran after her.</p><p>She plunged into the woods and weaved through the trees, heedless of the branches that swatted her face and caught at her hair. She couldn\u2019t run fast enough.</p><p>Flashes of memories bombarded her. Memories she\u2019d tried so hard to forget. The night she was chased. Hunted. The fear. Terrible, escalating fear. Terror. Panic.</p><p>Her wolf howled with despair. It was supposed to be the hunter, not the hunted. Run!</p><p>Footsteps pounded behind her. They were coming after her. Hunting her. Getting closer. No escape. Don\u2019t look back! For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t look. She\u2019d made that mistake before.</p><p>\u201cBrynley!\u201d Phineas yelled. \u201cSlow down! You\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>His voice. His beautiful voice that made her melt inside. Her steps faltered.</p><p>\u201cBrynley!\u201d he called to her. Behind her.</p><p>With a start, she whirled around to face him, her hands lifted to defend herself. An animal-like growl escaped from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Phineas raised his hands, palms up. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I would never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to breathe and looked around her. Oh God, what had she done? She\u2019d freaked out again.</p><p>\u201cBreathe slowly.\u201d He stepped toward her.</p><p>She immediately stepped back, then halted. She wasn\u2019t a cornered animal. And this was Phineas. He would never harm her. She ran a trembling hand through her hair, brushing away the leaves that had tangled in the wild strands.</p><p>She took a slow, deep breath. The scent of wood, fern, and spongy earth filled her nostrils and calmed the beast inside her. She\u2019d stopped in a small clearing where the nearly full moon shone brightly.</p><p>Phineas was watching her, his expression alarmed and worried. Great. She wouldn\u2019t have any trouble chasing him off. He probably thought she was crazy and already regretted any feelings he had for her.</p><p>He motioned toward the building. \u201cYou want to go back? We could talk.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou can teleport me back to the school. Those other guys at the cabin can help you. You don\u2019t have to work with me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to help me now?\u201d</p><p>She steeled her nerves. \u201cI . . . don\u2019t want to see you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cAre you trying to dump me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know we can\u2019t . . . be together.\u201d Her heart ached with every word. \u201cWe should just say good-bye and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m not giving up on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. You were all over me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was nothing. Lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Then jump me again, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p><p>With a wince, she stepped back. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me. I\u2014I freak out. I\u2019m damaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re beautiful. But some asshole has hurt you really bad. Tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. She shook her head.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll just figure it out. Nod your head if I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Please, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against a large maple tree and folded his arms across his chest. \u201cLet\u2019s see. You were hurt and abandoned when your mother died and Phil was banished. You were eighteen, right?\u201d</p><p>She remained silent, but a touch of fear fluttered in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cSo I guess you went to college then? You teach English at the academy, so that must have been your major.\u201d</p><p>The flutter skittered up her chest to her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou felt alone, betrayed, and abandoned. So . . . you reached out to someone.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI hope I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t. The flutter made her feel light-headed, so she rested a hand against a tree trunk to steady herself.</p><p>\u201cDid you fall for someone?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Her fingers dug into the bark. Her first lover. His arrogant face flitted across her mind. Why had she ever thought he was handsome? \u201cSeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth.\u201d Phineas said the name as if it left a foul taste in his mouth. \u201cHe listened to you. Made you feel special. Warm and fuzzy. And furry. I bet he was a werewolf, too.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were so damned lonesome,\u201d Phineas grumbled. \u201cAnd hurt.\u201d</p><p>More like pathetic. A tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cHe said he loved me. He asked me to marry him, and I said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought you were in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wiped away the tear. \u201cI wanted to be in love. I wanted to believe love still existed, and someone could love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you got engaged.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI took him home to meet my family. My dad approved of him, and I thought everything would be perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI overheard him talking to my father one night. Dad was congratulating him on a job well done. And Seth asked how many ranches he would get for marrying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Phineas whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d With a groan, she leaned her back against the tree. \u201cMy father set the whole thing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Phineas growled. \u201cAnd that Seth was an idiot if he couldn\u2019t see how lucky he was to have you.\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s typical male werewolf mentality. All they can think about is acquiring territory. Land means power to them. They want power, prestige, big herds of cattle, horses, and sheep. A mate is just the bitch that gives them cubs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sick.\u201d Phineas paced across the small clearing. \u201cWhy do the women put up with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all hoping for the prestige of mating with an Alpha. Only a chosen few can do it. The other women\u2014they\u2019re not any different than the non-Alpha males. They\u2019re all pack members and have to submit to their master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds archaic.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s how the pack works. There can be only one Alpha, and the others must submit. Or be banished. It\u2019s drummed into us from birth that we must be in a pack. We can\u2019t survive otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re brainwashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost werewolves are very happy in the Lycan world. Everyone knows the rules and knows their place. There\u2019s a strong sense of community and security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to the Lost Boys.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cObviously, it didn\u2019t work for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr for you. You\u2019re surviving without the pack. I bet you never wanted to submit.\u201d</p><p>It was true. Even as a child, she\u2019d never wanted to obey. Her father had deemed it Phil\u2019s fault, that he\u2019d influenced his twin sister with his rebellious Alpha tendencies. But it was more than Phil. It was years of watching her mother suffer and seeing how totally oblivious her father was to the pain he caused.</p><p>Deep inside her gut, she\u2019d known it was all wrong. She\u2019d read about love in books, seen it portrayed in movies, and knew it had been twisted into something ugly in the Lycan world. There was no love there. Only manipulation and deceit. Users.</p><p>\u201cI was alone with my mother when she died. She regretted that she\u2019d always submitted. She said I should have a choice, that I could choose freedom if I was strong enough.\u201d</p><p>Brynley sighed. \u201cShe wanted me to be strong, but after she died and Phil left, I became depressed. I felt lonely and weak. So I fell for the first guy to come along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d Phineas muttered. \u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t stay with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I broke off the engagement. His family already had a big ranch in Idaho, but he didn\u2019t want to give up the ranches that were promised to him, so he pestered me until I managed to chase him away.\u201d She tilted her head, remembering. \u201cIn hindsight, it was actually a good thing. It pulled me out of my slump. His betrayal made me angry, and the struggle to get rid of him gave me a purpose. It made me a stronger person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get rid of him?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMale werewolves like to think they\u2019re especially gifted in the sack. It just took a few rumors flying around campus that I\u2019d dumped him because he couldn\u2019t perform. Then of course he had to prove the rumors wrong with as many girls as possible. He got one of them pregnant, the daughter of a local Pack Master, and he was ordered to marry her.\u201d</p><p>Brynley smirked. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve gotten really good at chasing guys away.\u201d</p><p>Phineas gave her a stern look. \u201cIt won\u2019t work on me.\u201d</p><p>She matched his look. \u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201d</p><p>He prowled from one end of the clearing to the other. \u201cSo what happened then? Did your dad keep picking out suitors for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Are we getting to the bad part?\u201d</p><p>She made a face at him.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you join the rodeo?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms. \u201cAfter I graduated. Dad just sent the suitors there. I kept chasing them off. It was really frustrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess your father was pissed off.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>Brynley turned to rest her brow against the tree. This was the part she didn\u2019t want to talk about. She\u2019d never told anyone. Not her sister. Not even Phil. If only her brother had been there. He would have protected her.</p><p>\u201cBrynley.\u201d</p><p>Right behind her. She whirled around. \u201cI told you not to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d He rested a hand against the trunk and leaned toward her. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving till you tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so pushy?\u201d She shoved him away and paced across the clearing.</p><p>Chicken, her inner wolf chided her. Tell him. Are you going to live in fear for the rest of our life? Will you keep on jumping in terror whenever someone comes up behind us?</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t talk about it. It was too painful.</p><p>A surge of power swept through her suddenly, taking her by surprise. It was the wolf, pushing at her restraints, urging her to rebel. Where is your anger? We\u2019re a noble wolf! A fierce hunter! And they turned us into prey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A shudder skittered through her body as if the wolf was shaking her. Tell him! Let the world know what your father did to us!</p><p>She took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Trust the wolf. The wolf knows best. It was right. Why was she hiding the truth?</p><p>She clenched her fists. This wasn\u2019t going to be easy. This was five years of nightmares.</p><p>\u201cBrynley?\u201d Phineas asked softly. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>She squared her shoulders. \u201cMy father requested I come home for the Hunt. All the local Pack Masters hold hunts the first night of the full moon, but my father\u2019s hunt is the most prestigious in three states. It\u2019s invitation only, so it\u2019s a big honor to attend.\u201d</p><p>Her skin chilled and she crossed her arms. \u201cIt started off like every other monthly hunt. We all shifted and took off into the woods. I caught the scent of a pair of elk and gave chase. I heard wolves behind me. They\u2019d caught the scent, too. That was normal. Wolves usually kill in groups. I didn\u2019t think anything of it. Until I realized . . .\u201d</p><p>Tears gathered in her eyes, and bile rose in her throat. She swallowed hard and pressed the back of her hand against her mouth. \u201cThey were hunting me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phineas stepped toward her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. I was so afraid, and I couldn\u2019t understand why I was the prey. I ran and ran. I tried going upstream, swimming in icy cold lakes, anything to lose them. But they kept coming. And then they . . .\u201d</p> <p>She strode to a tree and rested a trembling hand on it. \u201cThey were young males. They surrounded me. Tightened the circle. Snarling and snapping. And then he attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom behind,\u201d Phineas whispered.</p><p>She nodded, and tears ran down her cheeks. \u201cHe bit me in the neck and used his weight to hold me down and . . . take me.\u201d</p><p>There was a tense pause.</p><p>When Phineas finally spoke, his voice sounded choked. \u201cHe raped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cA male wolf always takes his mate that way. It\u2019s an animal thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit. Did you want him to? Did you invite him?\u201d Phineas\u2019s voice grew louder, and when she didn\u2019t reply, he slammed a fist into the tree.</p><p>She jumped back, looking at him for the first time.</p><p>\u201cIt was rape!\u201d He crashed another fist into the tree.</p><p>She stepped back, shocked by the rage on his face.</p><p>\u201cDid you turn the bastard in?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I tried to. I ran back to the house and stormed into my father\u2019s office. I told him what they\u2019d done, and he just looked at me and said I\u2019d defied him for too long, refusing all the men he\u2019d chosen for me. I needed to learn how to submit.\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cHe\u2014?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as more tears rolled down her face. \u201cHe arranged it. He\u2019d chosen a new mate for me, and he\u2019d told him to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo rape you?\u201d Phineas growled.</p><p>\u201cTo take me as his mate. It\u2019s the normal way for a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Then why did you run? Why were you so terrified? Why do you still freak out if a man comes up behind you?\u201d</p><p>She wiped the tears off her face. \u201cI\u2019ve had trouble dealing with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you have! The bastard terrorized you and forced himself on you. And your father, that bastard\u2014\u201d Phineas punched the tree again. \u201cI\u2019ll rip his damned head off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop! Your hands are bleeding.\u201d And the tree wasn\u2019t looking too good, either. Strange, but it looked like the other damaged tree she\u2019d seen earlier.</p><p>\u201cYou had better hope I never meet your father.\u201d Phineas wiped his knuckles on his shirt. \u201cHow long has it been since . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive years.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at her. \u201cAnd how long have you been doing the underground thing, helping out the Lost Boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive years.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed. \u201cGood for you. You fought back.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cOnly in secret. I\u2019ve never stood up to my father. When he pulled this last stunt, arranging a wedding for me, I just ran away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to let him choose a husband for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you plan to choose your own husband?\u201d</p><p>She groaned inwardly and pushed her hair behind her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not choosing anyone right now. If my father doesn\u2019t approve of my mate, he\u2019ll kill him. He\u2019ll never allow me to defy him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to live your entire life in fear of him?\u201d</p><p>She winced. Her inner wolf longed for its native territory, but if she ever returned to the Lycan world, her father would control her. She would be forced into a life of submission. Centuries of submitting to her father and the mate he chose for her.</p><p>A crushing pain seized hold of her heart, and she pressed a hand against her chest. Her inner wolf howled in despair.</p><p>She could never return to the Lycan world. Not as long as her father lived. And that could be centuries.</p><p>She should have known that the moment she\u2019d fled her father\u2019s house. Instead, she\u2019d fooled herself into thinking her exile was only temporary. But she was like Phil now. She could never go home. Never spend time with her younger brother and sister. Not for hundreds of years.</p><p>She\u2019d end up abandoning her sister just as Phil had abandoned her.</p><p>Tears crowded her eyes once again. Why was the cost of freedom so damned high? \u201cI can\u2019t go home.\u201d</p><p>Phineas touched her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She reached for him, and he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cBryn, sweetheart.\u201d He held her tight and smoothed a hand up and down her back. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right. You\u2019re not alone. You have me. And your brother. And all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas.\u201d She drew back and touched his cheek. \u201cI need to go back. One last time. For the full moon tomorrow night. So I can say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Rape. He couldn\u2019t get past it. That a father would actually subject his daughter to something that heinous, that cruel.</p><p>Phineas accompanied Brynley back to Romatech, silent because he couldn\u2019t trust himself not to curse her father. Hell, he\u2019d been afraid just to touch her elbow as he escorted her back. Would she object to being touched after all she\u2019d endured? It was no wonder she was prickly and suspicious, afraid to get close to anyone. She\u2019d been betrayed over and over.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t a werewolf. He didn\u2019t have any ranches or cattle to gain by pursuing her. He simply loved her for herself. Just the thought that she could marry a Lycan someday who would treat her like an inferior broodmare filled him with rage. He wouldn\u2019t allow it. Dammit, she shouldn\u2019t allow it. She needed to be strong like her mother had said and choose freedom.</p><p>She needed to choose him. He\u2019d never mistreat her. A part of him realized that not all werewolf males were bad. Phil certainly wasn\u2019t. If he ever mistreated Vanda, she\u2019d take her whip to him.</p><p>Still, he didn\u2019t want Brynley to end up with a werewolf. He wanted to be the one to give her the love she deserved, and the freedom she needed. As far as he was concerned, he was her best choice, her best chance at happiness. He just had to convince her of that.</p><p>She was quiet, and he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what she was thinking. At least she wasn\u2019t asking to be returned to the academy. She seemed happy to stay by his side.</p><p>The cafeteria door she\u2019d escaped through earlier had automatically locked upon closing, so he led her to the side entrance and used his ID to get them inside.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check with Jack and Zoltan to see if any of your father\u2019s minions have shown up at the cabin,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>He used his ID again to get inside the security office. \u201cHey, Freemont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, bro, Wolfie-Girl.\u201d Freemont glanced up from his computer and grinned. \u201cI saw you guys run into the woods. Playing hide-and-seek?\u201d His smile faded. \u201cIs that blood on your shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Phineas glanced at the wall of monitors. There were no cameras that deep in the forest, so their talk had been private.</p><p>\u201cHe punched a tree,\u201d Brynley said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Freemont asked.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Brynley regarded Phineas suspiciously. \u201cYou have a habit of punching trees?\u201d</p><p>He ignored that and frowned at his brother. \u201cHave you heard from Jack or Zoltan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. About ten minutes ago. No one has shown up, and Lara was very excited because Jack has suddenly agreed to do that TV show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal Housewives of the Vampire World?\u201d Brynley asked. \u201cWhat changed his mind?\u201d</p><p>Freemont chuckled. \u201cWell, apparently Heather claimed her husband was the best fencer in Europe, and Jack thinks he is. So now he wants on television to set the record straight.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang, and Freemont answered. \u201cJust a minute, Mr. Whelan. Let me put you on the speakerphone.\u201d</p><p>Phineas strode toward the desk. \u201cDo you have news, Sean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas, is that you?\u201d Sean Whelan asked. \u201cI thought you were in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. And I\u2019ll be going back. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been staking out the Russian Coven House in Brooklyn, monitoring Dimitri. As far as we know, his tracking device is still operative. And it\u2019s moving. He just jumped to Cleveland, then Omaha. Headed west. Wait. It jumped again. He\u2019s in . . . Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>Phineas exchanged a glance with Brynley. \u201cThen we were right. Corky\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks that way,\u201d Sean agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll get Dimitri\u2019s exact location to you soon. But if he discovered the tracking device, he could be taking us on a wild-goose chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let Angus know. Thanks, Sean.\u201d Phineas hung up, then turned to his brother. \u201cAngus will be in his death-sleep right now, so can you send him an e-mail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Freemont swiveled in his chair to face the computer. \u201cOh, I found out who\u2019s the current owner of the Haggerty ranch. Some dude named Rhett Bleddyn.\u201d</p><p>Brynley gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d The shocked look on her face put Phineas on edge. His hands clenched into fists. If this Rhett was the one who\u2019d raped her, then his days were numbered. \u201cIs he the one who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, her face pale. \u201cThat guy died in a drunken brawl three years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood riddance,\u201d Phineas growled. Though he would have enjoyed beating the crap out of him. \u201cThen who is this Rhett Bleddyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the guy from Alaska I was supposed to marry.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>The next evening, Brynley hurried to the basement of Romatech, a warm bottle of synthetic blood in her hand. Phineas would be waking soon, and no doubt, he would be hungry.</p><p>She\u2019d spent a restful day at Romatech, hanging around the security office, cafeteria, or a bedroom she\u2019d been given in the basement. Phineas was in the bedroom next to her, and she\u2019d checked on him earlier in the day. He lay still in his death-sleep, a sheet pulled up to his waist, his gorgeous chest bare.</p><p>He looked so peaceful, nothing like the angry Vamp who had punched a tree till his hands bled. She touched his hands, running her fingers over his. They were cold, but healed. Tears came to her eyes as she recalled how upset he\u2019d been when he\u2019d heard her story. He\u2019d shared the pain and outrage with her. He did love her. She didn\u2019t doubt it. She just didn\u2019t know how their relationship could work.</p><p>Phil seemed very happy with his vampire spouse, Vanda, but he\u2019d given up so much. He\u2019d been disowned by their father, his inheritance stripped and given to their younger brother, Howell. And worst of all, Phil had given up the chance to have children.</p><p>She\u2019d always hoped that somehow, someday, she\u2019d find a werewolf husband who didn\u2019t care that her father was rich and powerful. He\u2019d love her for herself, and they\u2019d have little werewolf babies. They could make their own little Lycan world somewhere in the country.</p><p>Phineas did love her for herself. And like the other Vamp men, he could probably father children. Half-Vamp, half-werewolf children? Was that even possible? Could the genes coexist? Could she be happy living in the Vamp world? Phil had lived with the Vamps for nine years before marrying Vanda. He\u2019d had plenty of time to adjust and put the Lycan world behind him.</p><p>He\u2019d managed to make a clean break, but Brynley wasn\u2019t sure she could. She\u2019d spent too many years at home with their younger siblings, so she was attached to them in a way that Phil wasn\u2019t. Especially her younger sister. Glynis had been only eleven years old when Mom had died and so distraught that Brynley had sheltered her from the ugly truth about their father\u2019s unfaithfulness and their mother\u2019s hopeless despair. Maybe that had been wrong, but Brynley hadn\u2019t wanted to burden her younger sister with more pain.</p><p>Brynley winced. If she chose to stay with Phineas, her father would probably banish her. She could end up separated from her sister for centuries. Glynis had grown up so trusting and eager to please that it would be akin to leaving an innocent lamb among wolves.</p><p>And what about her inner wolf? It was overjoyed about going back to Wyoming tonight for the full moon, but it would object to being banished. Hell, it would tear her up inside if she could never go back. With a groan, she realized she didn\u2019t know what to do. But she did know one thing for certain.</p><p>She\u2019d fallen in love with Phineas.</p><p>That morning, she\u2019d gathered up the pile of clothes he\u2019d left on the floor and washed them in the basement laundry room along with hers. Lara had loaned her a bathrobe to wear, and after putting the clothes in the dryer, she\u2019d gone to her bedroom for a long nap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After waking up, she\u2019d showered, put on her freshly laundered clothes, and stacked Phineas\u2019s clothes in his bedroom. He was still dead.</p><p>With a sigh, she headed to the cafeteria. Freemont was there, so she joined him for an early supper.</p><p>Now, with the sun due to set in three minutes, she was hurrying to the basement. The full moon was rising, and she could already feel her inner wolf growing impatient to shift.</p> <p>She wondered briefly if Kyle would be shifting at his brother\u2019s ranch and perhaps mutilating more cows. Maybe he drained all the blood to give to Corky. Maybe she was hiding out at the Haggerty ranch with Rhett Bleddyn. Why would her ex-fianc\u00e9 buy a ranch in Wyoming when he had so much land in Alaska? And why would he ally himself with an evil vampire? So many questions, but she knew Phineas and his friends could be counted on to find the answers.</p><p>Meanwhile, she was eager to shift and roam the Bighorn National Forest that backed onto Phil\u2019s land.</p><p>She let herself into Phineas\u2019s bedroom and set the warm bottle of blood on the bedside table. He was still dead, but soon that would change. She paced across the room. Any minute now.</p><p>She halted at the foot of his bed when his body jerked. His chest expanded and lifted off the bed, causing his back to arch. She winced. It looked painful.</p><p>\u201cPhineas.\u201d She rushed to his side. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes opened and immediately focused on her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWelcome back. I brought you a bottle\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed red, and with vampire speed he grabbed her arms and tossed her over him and onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cPhineas!\u201d Her heart thundered in her ears. Good Lord, he\u2019d lifted her like she weighed nothing. Her eyes widened as he leaned over her.</p><p>He touched her cheek, then ran his fingers down her neck. The fingertips pressed against her throbbing artery, and his nostrils flared. \u201cSo hungry.\u201d</p><p>She had a strange urge to let him bite her. A part of her was appalled, but a larger, more insistent part found his desire exciting and the act compelling. Intimate. His fangs would be inside her. Her blood inside him.</p> <p>The wolf inside her stirred, drawn by the thought of blood. It growled softly. Good Lord, if she shifted now, she might lose control and bite Phineas, and that would be disastrous.</p><p>She motioned to the bedside table. \u201cI brought you some blood.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the bottle, then back at her. His eyes still glowed red.</p><p>She gestured at the bottle once again. \u201cIt\u2019s nice and warm. And fresh.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curled up. \u201cNot as fresh as you.\u201d He traced her collarbone. \u201cOr as warm.\u201d</p><p>She winced. This was a hitch in her schedule she hadn\u2019t counted on. \u201cPhineas, don\u2019t vamp out on me. Get a grip. The full moon is rising, and I need to\u2014\u201d She stopped when his finger touched her lips.</p><p>He traced the curve of her upper lip, then the lower one. \u201cDo you know how much I want you?\u201d</p><p>Her body responded with a surge of lust and desire, but she tried to ignore it. \u201cYou\u2019re hungry. I understand that.\u201d She pointed at the bottle. \u201cHurry up and drink.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about food.\u201d He sat up and reached for the bottle.</p><p>She started to sit up.</p><p>With vampire speed, he pushed her back down. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the bottle to his mouth with one hand, his other hand on her shoulder, keeping her pinned to the bed.</p><p>Her inner wolf hissed, annoyed at being restrained and anxious to shift. \u201cPhineas.\u201d She attempted to sit up once again.</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her budge. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201d His hand slid down to cover her breast.</p><p>Her breath caught. Her nipple hardened beneath his palm, and she fought the urge to arch against him. This was not the time to succumb to desire, but my God, she wanted him.</p><p>He lifted the bottle back to his lips and drank. His Adam\u2019s apple moved with each swallow. Such a strong, manly neck. His hand gently squeezed her breast in time with each swallow of blood. And with each squeeze, her desire grew stronger.</p><p>Was he nude beneath that bedsheet? What she could see of him was beautiful. Smooth velvet skin over rock-hard muscle. She ran a hand up the corded muscles of his arm, over the bulge of his biceps, and up to his broad shoulders. When she stroked his chest, a deep groan rumbled in his throat.</p><p>Oh God, she wanted him something fierce. She squeezed her thighs together. If he didn\u2019t rip her clothes off soon, she\u2019d do it herself.</p><p>No! her inner wolf objected. Tonight is my night.</p><p>She groaned with frustration. Phineas finished the bottle, set it down, and leaned over her once again.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are still red,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d He brushed her hair away from her brow. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you turn me down the other night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted a short affair based on lust. I want more than that.\u201d</p><p>She skimmed her fingers over the prickly whiskers along his jaw. \u201cI want more, too. But I don\u2019t see how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we want it bad enough, we\u2019ll make it work.\u201d</p><p>She gazed into his red, glowing eyes and dared to believe that somehow their love would survive.</p><p>His gaze lowered to her mouth. She wrapped her arms around his neck as he inched closer.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed, letting her eyes drift shut.</p><p>His lips touched hers, gently at first, although there was nothing gentle about her reaction. Her fingers dug into his shoulders. Her heart beat wildly.</p><p>Her wolf objected, threatening to shift.</p><p>Phineas deepened the kiss, molding his lips to hers, and she opened her mouth to let him in. She swirled her tongue with his. He tasted of blood, but she\u2019d tasted blood many times as a wolf, and it only made her hungrier for him.</p><p>A surge of wolf power shot through her, and she broke the kiss with a gasp. \u201cPhineas, I have to shift! I can\u2019t wait much longer.\u201d</p><p>He sat back, grimacing. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. We have to hurry!\u201d</p><p>With vampire speed, he zipped out of bed and into the bathroom, so fast she barely had a glimpse of his naked body. But what she saw was enough to make her collapse on the bed with groan of frustration. A few seconds later, he was back and throwing on the clothes she\u2019d washed.</p><p>She scrambled out of bed as he pulled on his cowboy boots, and noticed a surveillance camera close to the ceiling. It was blinking red. \u201cIs that thing on?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at it, his eyes back to their normal dark brown. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He set his cowboy hat on his head and tossed her his jacket. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She strode alongside him. \u201cSo we showed up on a monitor in the security office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He headed down the hall, snapping his plaid shirt together as he went. \u201cI should have thought about it, but I was . . . distracted.\u201d He punched the button for the elevator. \u201cI owe you an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She watched him stuff his shirttails into his jeans and considered offering some help.</p><p>\u201cI manhandled you.\u201d He buttoned the top of his jeans and buckled his belt. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas, I\u2019m okay. I . . . enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cReally?\u201d When she nodded, his mouth curled up and his gaze drifted to her chest. \u201cYou were right about the B-cup.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know the Three-Step rule is still in effect. I was worried after you turned me down the other night.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to enter the elevator, then punched the button for the ground floor. \u201cWhat is this Three-Step rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my experience, men tend to be rather simple.\u201d She paused when he arched a brow at her. \u201cWell, it basically means that at any given moment, a man\u2019s brain is only three steps away from thinking about sex.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, considering, as he took his jacket from her and put it on. \u201cI disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think about sex that often?\u201d She scoffed. \u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wry look. \u201cI don\u2019t need three steps. Hell, I just look at you and want sex.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks warmed with a blush, and she smiled slowly. \u201cYou know, after I\u2019ve been a wolf for a few hours, I could shift back, and we could have a date. I tend to have a lot of excess energy I need to work off.\u201d</p><p>He moved toward her. \u201cI could help you with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness. You are faster than three steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d He planted a hand on the elevator wall, close to her head. \u201cI\u2019ve got a fast mind, but slow hands.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his hat back and leaned in for a kiss.</p><p>A thrill shot through her, and her toes curled inside her cowboy boots. What a sexy kisser. Making love to him was going to knock her boots off for sure. \u201cPhin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He nuzzled her neck.</p><p>\u201cThe elevator door has opened.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>They hurried to the MacKay security office. Zoltan was selecting a sword and pistol from the caged weapons area. Freemont was focusing on a computer screen, but his eyes were twinkling and his mouth twitching.</p><p>Brynley glanced at the wall of monitors and spotted Phineas\u2019s bedroom on the bottom row. Damn was right.</p><p>Phineas put on his shoulder holster and checked his sidearm. \u201cWhere are Jack and Lara? We need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey just left,\u201d Freemont replied. \u201cJack teleported her to the school. The were-panther lady went into labor, and Lara insisted on going there. Jack said he\u2019d catch up with you guys later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaitlyn\u2019s having the babies?\u201d Brynley asked. Damn, but she hated to miss that. She couldn\u2019t help it, though. She had to shift. \u201cOh my gosh, what if Caitlyn has to shift?\u201d</p><p>Freemont shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Some Vamp doctor from Houston is with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobby has been teleporting Carlos back,\u201d Zoltan added. \u201cNow that it\u2019s dark here, they should be arriving soon.\u201d</p><p>Phineas touched her arm. \u201cI can take you to the school if you want.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI have to shift.\u201d The wolf didn\u2019t care about her new friends. It growled inside her. Let\u2019s go now! \u201cI need to go back to the cabin. Now.\u201d Hopefully, after a few hours, she could return to see how Caitlyn was doing.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Phineas slipped knives into his boots, then turned to Zoltan. \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>Zoltan sheathed his sword. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Phineas grabbed Brynley, and within a few seconds, they were materializing at the cabin in Wyoming.</p><p>Zoltan glanced around quickly. \u201cIt looks the same. No one came during the day.\u201d</p><p>For a second, Brynley\u2019s form shimmered as she fought to keep the wolf from breaking free.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Phineas jumped back.</p><p>She regained control. \u201cThat was close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me!\u201d Phineas yanked off his hat and ran a hand over his hair. \u201cFor a second, I thought I was hugging a wolf!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou almost did.\u201d She sat and yanked off her cowboy boots. \u201cI hate shifting with clothes on. It rips them all up.\u201d She pulled off her socks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stripping now?\u201d Phineas shot a warning look at Zoltan.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll check on the horses in the stable.\u201d He strode to the front door, then glanced back at Phineas, his eyes twinkling. \u201cYou\u2019re not joining me?\u201d</p><p>Phineas dropped his hat on the kitchen table. \u201cIn a minute.\u201d</p><p>Zoltan snorted and left, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know how to feed the horses?\u201d Brynley stood to unbuckle her belt and unzip her jeans.</p><p>\u201cSure. He\u2019s used to horses. He\u2019s a medieval dude.\u201d Phineas moved to block the front window. \u201cYou need blinds in this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid a deer might see me?\u201d She dropped her jeans to the floor and kicked them aside. Her hands trembled as she unbuttoned her shirt. \u201cI\u2019m so excited. I can hardly control myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a little excited, too.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks grew warm. \u201cWe always strip before shifting. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d She\u2019d done it in front of others for years, but she suddenly felt self-conscious with Phineas watching her so closely. She removed her shirt and dropped it on the chair. \u201cYou want to come with me? There are a whole bunch of trees out there you could punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. I have some investigating to do, but I\u2019ll come back for you in, what\u2014two hours?\u201d</p><p>She reached behind her back to unhook her bra. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be gone. I won\u2019t be wearing a watch, you know.\u201d She slipped the bra off and dropped it on top of her shirt.</p><p>He sucked in a breath of air.</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>\u201cHello, ladies.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, thankful her shyness was short-lived, and strode toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, big boy.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at his jeans. \u201cIt is that obvious?\u201d</p><p>She grinned as she stepped outside onto the porch. The cool air chilled her skin, but soon she\u2019d be warm in a thick fur coat.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you forget something?\u201d Phineas said from the doorway.</p><p>She wiggled out of her panties, then tossed them back at him over her shoulder. \u201cKeep those for me, will you?\u201d</p><p>He caught them, his eyes gleaming red.</p><p>She ran down the steps and into the grassy meadow. At last! The full moon shone down on her, and she lifted her arms, surrendering to the inner wolf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The surge of power was orgasmic, so strong and overwhelming she didn\u2019t feel the pain of bones shifting or fur sprouting. Within seconds, she was the wolf.</p><p>She was free.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p> <p>\u201cBe safe, sweetheart,\u201d Phineas whispered as he watched Brynley trot into the woods.</p><p>Her father and ex-fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t know she had returned to Wyoming, so she should be safe roaming about for a few hours. The national forest was over a million acres and filled with animals, so finding her would be like finding the proverbial needle in a haystack. Hopefully, Rhett Bleddyn would remain in the vicinity of his ranch. As for her father and his minions, they would be miles away at his ranch in Montana, busy celebrating their big monthly hunt.</p><p>Still, Phineas tensed with worry when Brynley disappeared from view. You have to trust her, he chided himself. She\u2019d been shifting since she was a teenager. She knew how to handle herself in the woods. And it was important for her to have this last night at home.</p><p>He strode into the stable and found Zoltan whispering to Molly as he filled her manger with hay. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Zoltan glanced at him with the hint of a smile. \u201cIt appears you are not the only one here in love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d</p><p>Zoltan tilted his head toward Molly. \u201cThe mare. She is smitten with a wild white stallion.\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou can communicate with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. By the way, she approves of you and Brynley. The gelding does as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a relief. I\u2019d hate to leave them off the invitation list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you plan to marry soon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was joking.\u201d He winced. Not really.</p><p>Zoltan gave him a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Phineas headed back out the stable door. \u201cLet\u2019s get some work done, okay?\u201d The sooner they completed their mission, the sooner he could get back here for Brynley.</p><p>Zoltan accompanied him to the cabin. \u201cYou believe Corky is hiding at the ranch owned by Rhett Bleddyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. We know for sure he\u2019s a werewolf. An Alpha.\u201d And the one Brynley\u2019s father had wanted her to marry. Phineas gritted his teeth. Bleddyn was probably still hoping to marry her. He might have bought a nearby ranch so he\u2019d have a reason to stay in the area and pursue her if she ever returned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be shifting tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Phineas mounted the steps to the front porch. \u201cHe and his pack will be off hunting, so we should be able to sneak into his house. Hopefully, we\u2019ll find Corky there.\u201d</p><p>Zoltan smiled as he followed Phineas inside the cabin. \u201cWhile the wolves are away, the Vamps will play. I like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBleddyn\u2019s ranch is next to Nate Carson\u2019s place,\u201d Phineas continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll teleport to Nate\u2019s house and ask him to call Bleddyn\u2019s ranch. Then we listen in and teleport straight into Bleddyn\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Corky will never know we\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need the element of surprise.\u201d Phineas checked his sidearm. \u201cShe may not be alone. Dimitri could be with her.\u201d</p><p>Zoltan tucked a pistol under his belt, close to his sheathed sword. \u201cWe should knock her unconscious to make sure she doesn\u2019t escape. Then we can teleport her straight to Romatech and put her in the silver room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Phineas checked the knives concealed in his boots. \u201cI teleported on Nate\u2019s driveway before, so that\u2019s probably where we\u2019ll land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d Zoltan looped an arm around Phineas\u2019s shoulders to hitch a ride.</p><p>They arrived and quickly looked about. The full moon gleamed off the smooth white concrete of the circular driveway. It was quiet, except for the howl of a wolf far in the distance. A werewolf most probably. Phineas tensed. He should have stayed by Brynley\u2019s side.</p><p>But it was the perfect night to hunt for Corky. Her werewolf allies would all be busy.</p><p>\u201cNice house,\u201d Zoltan murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Phineas strode to the entrance and rang the doorbell.</p><p>Footsteps ran toward them and the door jerked open.</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d John Brighton shouted. His hopeful expression quickly crumpled into one of confusion and disappointment. \u201cI thought you were the paramedics.\u201d He pushed past them and ran into the driveway. \u201cWhere\u2019s the blasted ambulance? I called ten minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nathan! Dear Lord, if they don\u2019t hurry, he could die!\u201d John dashed back into the house, headed for Nate\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Phineas followed with Zoltan close behind.</p><p>\u201cThat damned brother of his. He brought a monster into the house.\u201d John stopped by the office doorway, where a maid stood, crying into a handkerchief. \u201cBring more towels. Hurry!\u201d</p><p>She scurried away, and John ran into the office.</p><p>Phineas paused at the doorway, surprised by the level of destruction. The floor was littered with papers. Chairs overturned and broken. Holes punched in the walls. Nate\u2019s mangled wheelchair was resting on its side. And Nate lay in a bloody heap on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou have to apply pressure.\u201d John grabbed the bloody towel from Nate\u2019s limp hand and pressed it against the gaping wounds across his chest and abdomen.</p><p>\u201cToo . . . weak,\u201d Nate whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Phineas zoomed toward them at vampire speed and knelt beside Nate.</p><p>John was too focused on Nate to notice. \u201cKyle and Mr. Bleddyn came to see him. I heard them shouting and crashing furniture. I rushed inside and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>John grimaced. \u201cBleddyn had turned into a monster! His head was human and he was shouting, but his arms were like a wolf, and he was clawing at Nathan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an Alpha werewolf,\u201d Phineas explained. \u201cCapable of a partial shift.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWerewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyle is one, too,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cMost probably, Bleddyn is the one who changed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell them about Brynley,\u201d Nate whispered. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>Phineas swallowed hard. \u201cYes.\u201d He hoped that wasn\u2019t a lie. \u201cYour brother remembered seeing her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nate whispered. \u201cBut he knew something was wrong, so he checked the security tape. Saw you both at the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Phineas muttered. He\u2019d forgotten about that damned camera.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Nathan,\u201d John ordered. \u201cSave your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is bleeding out,\u201d Zoltan said quietly. \u201cWe must move quickly.\u201d</p><p>John glanced up at him. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoltan,\u201d he replied. \u201cA friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both are,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cAnd we could have Nate at a clinic in two seconds.\u201d</p><p>John scoffed. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will have to change your mind about what is possible,\u201d Zoltan told him. \u201cA werewolf just attacked your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we can teleport him to the clinic.\u201d Phineas leaned over to gather Nate into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d John scrambled to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking him anywhere without me. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires,\u201d Zoltan replied.</p><p>John stumbled back. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have more towels!\u201d The maid rushed into the room.</p><p>Zoltan whipped around to stare at her, and she halted with a jerk. Her face went blank, then she turned and left the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d John demanded. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind control.\u201d Zoltan gave him a stern look. \u201cDo I need to use it on you, or will you come along quietly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d John gasped when Zoltan latched on to him at vampire speed. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>They vanished.</p><p>Phineas teleported Nate straight into the security office at Romatech. The alarm went off, and Freemont leaped to his feet, grabbing his automatic.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, Phin.\u201d He lowered his gun and turned off the alarm. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking this man to the clinic. Hurry, get the door!\u201d</p><p>Freemont opened the door, and Phineas dashed into the hallway, carrying Nate. Zoltan was coming in the side entrance dragging John.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d John demanded. \u201cThis is kidnapping!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet Roman and Laszlo to the clinic now,\u201d Phineas told his brother.</p><p>Freemont winced. \u201cRoman\u2019s not here. He\u2019s at the school, helping with Caitlyn\u2019s delivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend Laszlo then!\u201d Phineas zoomed toward the clinic at vampire speed.</p><p>He set Nate on a gurney and turned on the overhead lights. Zoltan zoomed in and set John on his feet.</p><p>\u201cGet away from me!\u201d John reeled back. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re some kind of monsters!\u201d</p><p>Zoltan looked annoyed. \u201cHave we harmed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kidnapped me and Nathan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe took you to a clinic to save his life,\u201d Zoltan argued.</p><p>John looked frantically about. \u201cWhere is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomatech Ind\u2014\u201d Phineas stopped when Laszlo rushed in.</p><p>\u201cOh dear.\u201d Laszlo\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of Nate. He zoomed over to the sink and washed his hands with vampire speed. \u201cHe\u2019s fading fast. We\u2019ll need at least four bags of\u201d\u2014he sniffed\u2014\u201cType A positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d Zoltan rushed toward the refrigerator.</p><p>Laszlo snapped on some gloves and zoomed over to the gurney. He inserted a needle into Nate\u2019s arm and motioned with his head toward the tray. \u201cPhineas, take the scissors and cut the shirt off him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Phineas lifted the blood-soaked shirt away from Nate\u2019s torso and began cutting.</p><p>Nate moaned.</p><p>John approached the gurney. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray,\u201d Laszlo answered. He grimaced as Phineas peeled back the shirt. \u201cHe has a lot of internal damage. I\u2019m not a doctor. I can sew up a cut, but this is too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we give him vampire blood?\u201d Zoltan suggested as he stacked bags of blood on the work tray. \u201cWon\u2019t that heal him internally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could transform him,\u201d Phineas said quietly.</p><p>Zoltan and Laszlo stopped and exchanged looks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d John asked. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we turn him into a vampire, it will heal his wounds,\u201d Phineas explained.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d John shook his head. \u201cThen he would be dead. He would be a monster.\u201d</p><p>Laszlo frowned. \u201cDo we look like monsters?\u201d</p><p>John studied the short man with the innocent, round face. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Do you bite people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a chemist.\u201d Laszlo lifted a bag of blood. \u201cAnd this is synthetic blood we manufacture here at Romatech. We make our food, we don\u2019t steal it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate?\u201d Phineas leaned over him. \u201cCan you hear me? We can heal you if we turn you into a vampire. You\u2019ll be dead during the day, but alive at night. And you could live for centuries.\u201d</p><p>Nate blinked at him. \u201cLegs?\u201d</p><p>Phineas glanced at Laszlo. \u201cHe has a spinal cord injury. Will it heal?\u201d</p><p>Laszlo twisted a button on his lab coat as he considered. \u201cPossibly. He has such severe injuries across his abdomen, the transformation might trigger all sorts of healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s possible?\u201d John asked. \u201cHe could walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Laszlo answered. \u201cFor certain, it will save his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Nate whispered.</p><p>Phineas exchanged looks with Laszlo and Zoltan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I know how.\u201d His own transformation had been brutal and violent. He didn\u2019t want to repeat that.</p><p>\u201cI can do it.\u201d Zoltan rested a hand on Nate\u2019s brow. \u201cWhen I give you my blood to drink, you must accept it.\u201d</p><p>Nate licked his cut and swollen lips. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Zoltan peeled the shirt collar away from Nate\u2019s throat.</p><p>Phineas grabbed John\u2019s arm and led him across the room. \u201cDid Kyle attack him, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he in wolf form?\u201d Phineas asked. \u201cDid he bite Nate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was still human.\u201d John\u2019s mouth twisted with disgust. \u201cHe was punching and kicking his own brother.\u201d He glanced back at the gurney where Zoltan had sunk his fangs into Nate. \u201cWhat is he doing? Is he hurting Nathan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s transforming him. John, look at me. Nate will be alive and strong at night, but completely vulnerable during the day. He needs someone who will guard him and protect him from his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d John nodded. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have my son help, too. We won\u2019t let anyone harm Nathan. He\u2014\u201d John\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cMy son was a photojournalist, traveling with Nathan\u2019s unit during the war. When Nathan was injured, he saved my son\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>Phineas rested a hand on John\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s fortunate to have you now.\u201d</p><p>John nodded and glanced back at the gurney. \u201cWill he be all right? Will he still be . . . Nathan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. His personality won\u2019t change. Will you stay here with him till he wakes tomorrow night?\u201d When John nodded, Phineas continued, \u201cI need to go back to Wyoming and make sure Brynley is all right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs she a vampire, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s a werewolf, but a good one. She would never hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>John gave him a curious look. \u201cYou\u2019re a vampire with a werewolf girlfriend? How does that work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood question,\u201d Phineas muttered. He just hoped she was all right and he could find her.</p><p>As he dashed back to the security office, he spotted Jack coming in the side entrance. Great. Jack and Lara could help him look for Brynley. \u201cIs Lara with you?\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head. \u201cShe stayed at the school. Caitlyn\u2019s been shifting back and forth, scaring the shit out of Dr. Lee, so Carlos is the only one allowed in the delivery room with her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo babies yet?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Freemont opened the security office door and peered outside. \u201cDid she have kittens?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Jack replied. \u201cI came back to see if you guys had captured Corky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have another problem now,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cBrynley could be in danger. Rhett Bleddyn knows she\u2019s back, and he\u2019s a vicious bastard. Nearly killed a mortal. Zoltan is in the clinic right now transforming the guy. And Brynley\u2014she\u2019s alone.\u201d</p><p>Freemont winced. \u201cWolfie-Girl\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Phineas zipped through the trees for another half a mile, then paused to listen. Nothing.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t working. He and Jack had teleported back to the cabin and split up to cover more ground. So far, no sign of Brynley. No word from Jack. And they\u2019d been searching for almost an hour.</p> <p>Bleddyn was one nasty character. Attacking a guy in a wheelchair? Sheesh, he\u2019d nearly killed Nate. And Kyle, that creep deserved to die. The thought that those two bastards could have shifted and gone hunting for Brynley, it made his heart clench in his chest.</p><p>She\u2019d been hunted down once before. And raped. He couldn\u2019t let that happen to her again.</p><p>He needed a new strategy. He gazed up a tall pine tree and zeroed in on a strong branch. A second later, he materialized there and grabbed hold of the trunk. This was better. He had a bird\u2019s-eye view. And eyes as good as a bird. He scanned the area and listened carefully.</p><p>A small herd of elk at twelve o\u2019clock. At one o\u2019clock, a small lake glimmered in the moonlight. Farther off to the right, Jack was searching. He turned to the left. Bushes thrashed far ahead at ten o\u2019clock. Something was being chased.</p><p>He focused on a treetop and teleported there. The chase was just ahead of him. He teleported to another tree.</p><p>There. A mule deer darted into a small clearing, and a wolf charged from behind. A large wolf, moving at an incredible speed. It had to be a werewolf.</p><p>He teleported closer and materialized on a tree branch just as the wolf pounced on the deer. Within seconds the deer was down and its neck broken with a mighty wrenching of the wolf\u2019s jaws.</p><p>Damn. If that was Brynley, she was amazing. He whistled softly to see if the wolf would look up.</p> <p>It did. Sky-blue eyes.</p><p>He grinned. He\u2019d found her, and she was fine. More than fine. She was freaking powerful.</p><p>A loud growl emanated from the forest.</p><p>Phineas tensed, his fingers digging into pine bark. Was it Bleddyn?</p><p>Brynley froze, her ears flattening, the fur on her back bristling.</p><p>Out of the woods lumbered a huge black bear. It reared up on its hind legs and roared.</p><p>Brynley stood her ground.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d Phineas whispered. Don\u2019t argue with a bear. Let it have the deer.</p><p>The bear roared again, and moved toward the deer. Brynley bared her teeth and growled back.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d What was she thinking? Phineas took out his automatic and fired a warning shot to scare off the bear.</p><p>The bear shifted into a large, hairy man. He lifted his hands in surrender and looked frantically about. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s mouth fell open. Digger?</p><p>Brynley shifted into human form. \u201cYou\u2019re a were-bear?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>Phineas teleported down, and with vampire speed, he whipped off his jacket and covered Brynley.</p><p>Digger gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re one of them damned aliens!\u201d He shifted back into a bear, and with a growl, he charged.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Phineas teleported Brynley across the clearing.</p><p>Digger roared when his pounce hit nothing but air. He spun about and spotted them.</p><p>\u201cDigger,\u201d Phineas began, but quickly levitated with Brynley when the bear charged again.</p><p>\u201cDigger, stop!\u201d Brynley yelled at him.</p><p>Digger shifted back to human form. \u201cYou need to get away from him, little lady, so I can kill him. He\u2019s an alien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an alien,\u201d Phineas muttered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can kick him in the balls,\u201d Digger told her, then frowned. \u201cBut I ain\u2019t sure them aliens have balls.\u201d</p><p>She gave Phineas a wry look. \u201cShall I verify that you have balls?\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cThis is not how I envisioned our first intimate encounter.\u201d He glanced down at Digger. \u201cCan we come down now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But I\u2019ll have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an alien!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, too! You appeared out of nowhere. You must have beamed down from the mother ship.\u201d</p><p>Phineas groaned. \u201cI was in a tree, watching Brynley. And what the hell were you doing, attacking her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna hurt her,\u201d Digger mumbled. \u201cI just wanted the deer.\u201d</p><p>Jack zoomed into the clearing at vampire speed. His eyes widened at the sight of Phineas and Brynley hovering twelve feet in the air. \u201cI heard a gunshot. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDagnabbit! Another alien!\u201d Digger bellowed.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Jack glanced behind him, then gasped when Digger shifted back into a bear and charged. He levitated, too. \u201cMerda! Now I see why you\u2019re floating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it out, Digger!\u201d Brynley yelled at him. \u201cThese are my friends.\u201d</p><p>Digger changed back to human form. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make friends with aliens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not aliens,\u201d Phineas ground out. \u201cAnd would you please cover yourself? There\u2019s a woman present.\u201d He adjusted his jacket around Brynley. Luckily, it was long enough to hit her at mid-thigh.</p><p>The corner of her mouth curled up. \u201cYou seemed a bit concerned about my virtue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned straight. And what the hell were you doing, growling at a bear?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI know it was crazy. My inner wolf has been acting so weird lately. Like it thinks it can take on the world.\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s attention shifted back to Digger when the old man whistled. His dog, Jake, trotted into the clearing. He still wore the foil-covered football helmet on his head, but now also sported a pack strapped to his back.</p><p>\u201cThe dog plays football?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Digger snorted as he pulled a pair of jeans out of the dog\u2019s backpack. \u201cDogs don\u2019t play football. You aliens ain\u2019t as smart as you think.\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s eyes watered as he caught a whiff of Digger\u2019s clothes. \u201cDid you run into a skunk?\u201d</p><p>Digger chuckled as he pulled on the jeans. \u201cI spray my clothes down with skunk oil. It covers up my scent.\u201d</p><p>That was true. Usually Phineas could always tell a shifter by his scent. Digger had caught them by surprise.</p><p>\u201cBut of course I knew right off that the little lady was a shifter,\u201d Digger continued. \u201cI hoped she was a bear like me, but it ain\u2019t surprising she\u2019s a wolf. Lots of werewolves in these here parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of them good,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a dangerous Alpha in the area named Rhett Bleddyn. He attacked Nate Carson tonight and almost killed him.\u201d</p><p>Brynley gasped. \u201cNate was attacked? Is he all right?\u201d</p><p>Phineas nodded and lowered his voice. \u201cWe took him to Romatech. We had to transform him.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cIs he going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019ll be fine. Zoltan\u2019s taking care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would a werewolf attack Nate Carson?\u201d Digger asked. \u201cNate\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBleddyn is trying to find Brynley,\u201d Phineas explained. \u201cNate was protecting her, and he nearly died for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d She shuddered in his arms. \u201cPoor Nate.\u201d</p><p>Phineas hugged her tight. \u201cBleddyn knows you\u2019re here. That\u2019s why we came looking for you. I was afraid he would be hunting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA werewolf hunting another werewolf?\u201d Digger scratched at his beard. \u201cThat don\u2019t seem right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father tried to force me into marrying him,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI ran away.\u201d</p><p>Digger frowned. \u201c \u2019Cause you\u2019re in love with an alien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an alien!\u201d Phineas growled.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re vampires,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Digger stepped back, his eyes wide. \u201cWhat in tarnation? Vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cWe can teleport and levitate, as you can see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you mutilate those cows and drink their blood?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. We drink synthetic blood from bottles,\u201d Phineas replied.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the good guys,\u201d Brynley insisted. \u201cWhen I ran away from home, they took me in. And they\u2019ve taken in all the Lost Boys that my father kicked out of the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your pa?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cCaddoc Jones.\u201d</p><p>Digger\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWell, ain\u2019t that somethin\u2019? I know Cad from way back. Well over a hundred years ago.\u201d He ran a hand through his shaggy long hair. \u201cHaven\u2019t talked to him in a spell. Seemed to me he got too big for his britches. Started acting like a jackass. No offense, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d she answered wryly.</p><p>\u201cCan we come down now?\u201d Phineas motioned to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI reckon.\u201d Digger eyed him suspiciously. \u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna bite me or my dog, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather starve.\u201d Jack waved the air in front of him, his nose wrinkled against the foul odor.</p><p>\u201cVampires.\u201d Digger shook his head. \u201cI knew there was something strange going on in these hills. You sure you ain\u2019t seen no aliens around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re looking for a bad female vampire.\u201d Phineas lowered himself and Brynley to the ground. \u201cWe think she\u2019s allied with Bleddyn and staying at the old Haggerty ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lady vampire?\u201d Digger asked. \u201cDid she mutilate the cows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Phineas replied. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Digger tugged at his beard. \u201cThis is all very strange. I could have sworn there were aliens around here. Well, I\u2019ll be going now. And taking the deer, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Brynley waved a hand. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>Digger heaved the dead deer over his shoulders and lumbered into the woods. \u201cA werewolf in love with a vampire. Don\u2019t that beat all?\u201d</p><p>Phineas gave Brynley a questioning look as he drew her into his arms. \u201cCould Digger be right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout aliens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He kissed her nose. \u201cAbout a certain werewolf being in love with a vampire.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cDepends on the vampire. Is he in love with a certain werewolf?\u201d</p><p>Phineas\u2019s vision darkened to a dusky pink as his eyes turned red. \u201cI\u2019ve always heard that actions speak louder than words.\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek. \u201cWhat actions do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jack interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little unnecessary at the moment. I\u2019ll teleport back to the cabin to see if Bleddyn has shown up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jack,\u201d Phineas said without looking back.</p><p>He chuckled and teleported away.</p><p>\u201cAlone at last.\u201d Brynley smoothed her hand over Phineas\u2019s jaw. \u201cWe were talking about action?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd words.\u201d He pulled her close. \u201cI do love you, Brynley. I know it won\u2019t be easy. I\u2019m dead half the time. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She placed a finger over his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t come up with reasons not to love me. I want you to love me. Now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned red. \u201cI can do that.\u201d He teleported away with her.</p><p>Brynley landed on cool, soft grass. She quickly looked about and smiled. Phineas had taken her back to the meadow below the Cloud Peak Glacier. One of the most beautiful places she knew.</p><p>\u201cIs it all right?\u201d he asked. \u201cI could take you to Romatech or the cabin in the Adirondacks. We could have a bed there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect.\u201d She breathed deeply of the cool, crisp air. \u201cThis is home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d She pulled off his jacket and tossed it on the ground. \u201cDo I look cold?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flared a hotter red as his gaze sizzled over her naked body, then settled on her hardening nipples. \u201cMaybe a little chilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen make me hot.\u201d She rushed toward him and ripped open the snaps on his shirt. \u201cThe animal in me wants to claw the clothes right off your body.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close and nuzzled her neck. \u201cThe Vamp in me wants to nibble\u201d\u2014he trailed kisses down her neck \u2014\u201cand bite\u201d\u2014he nipped her shoulder\u2014\u201cand suck the life out of you.\u201d He planted his mouth on her nipple. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She arched her back as he suckled hard.</p><p>He picked her up, his hands on her bare rump, and she wrapped her legs around his waist. He tugged at one breast, then started on the other.</p><p>\u201cPhineas.\u201d She ran her hands over his short hair.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He tickled the tip of her nipple with his tongue, then pulled her closer so her core was pressed against his bare stomach.</p> <p>He tugged on her breast in rhythm to rocking her against him. Moisture seeped from her, and tension built higher and higher.</p><p>Oh God, she was going to come before she\u2019d even gotten his clothes off.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d She pulled his head back and wiggled out of his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d She yanked his shirt off his shoulders and kissed his chest, his nipples, his six-pack abs. He was gorgeous, muscular . . . and walking her backward. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p> <p>He shoved her back, and she landed on her rump on his jacket. With a grin, he pounced on top of her.</p><p>He kissed her mouth, then moved down her body, kissing and nibbling past her breasts to her stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still dressed.\u201d She pushed him back, then pulled his legs up to make him fall onto his back on the grass. With a yank, she had one boot off. She tossed it aside and grabbed the other boot. It proved to be more stubborn, and she tugged so hard she lost her balance.</p><p>He took advantage, giving her an extra shove so she tumbled back.</p><p>\u201cUmph.\u201d She landed on her back with the boot in her hands.</p><p>He seized her ankle and nipped at her calf. \u201cNow I have you.\u201d</p> <p>She tossed his boot aside. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d She planted her other foot against his chest and shoved him back. As soon as his butt hit the ground, she leaped forward to pin his shoulders to the ground. \u201cNow I have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolfie-Girl, you are wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better believe it.\u201d She leaned forward and rubbed her breasts against his chest.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head.</p><p>With her heart thundering in her ears, she sat back on his thighs and unbuckled his belt. \u201cAll right, Love Doctor.\u201d She unbuttoned his jeans. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you\u2019ve been hiding.\u201d She struggled, getting the zipper to move over the bulge.</p><p>Finally, it unzipped, and she grasped the waistband of his jeans and underwear and pulled. He sprang free.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>He took advantage of her momentary shock and pushed her back onto his jacket. She struggled to sit up, but he pinned her shoulders down.</p> <p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a dog.\u201d She glanced down his beautiful body to the magnificent erection that pointed at her, wide and blatant, smooth and rock-hard. \u201cWoof,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNow be a good Wolfie-Girl and let me ravish you.\u201d</p><p>Moisture pooled between her legs, and she ached for him to fill her. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience.\u201d He smoothed his hands over her breasts and down her belly. Her skin prickled with gooseflesh, and she shivered.</p><p>He clasped her thighs and pushed her legs apart. \u201cI want to look at you.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered as more moisture seeped out.</p><p>He leaned closer till she could feel his breath against her wetness. \u201cSo pretty. And juicy.\u201d</p><p>She jolted when his tongue licked her slowly.</p><p>\u201cTasty.\u201d He inserted a finger inside her. \u201cTight. And wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, please!\u201d She wiggled against him. \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. I want you inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done with the outside.\u201d He skimmed his juice-slickened fingers up to her clitoris, and she jolted again. \u201cLook what I found.\u201d</p><p>Tension built rapidly as he rubbed against her. Pinched and tugged. She shook her head, moaning. When he lifted her hips to clamp his mouth on her, she screamed and shattered.</p><p>Spasms shot through her. Her toes curled and her vision blurred. He showed no mercy. With two fingers inside her, he coaxed more spasms from her till black stars twinkled before her eyes.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d she wheezed, struggling to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d He smiled smugly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy? Incredible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous!\u201d She shoved him back. \u201cYou still have clothes on.\u201d She yanked his jeans and underwear down his legs.</p><p>\u201cYou recovered quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to work harder than that to wear me out.\u201d She eyed his erection. \u201cOh yeah. This is good.\u201d She traced a vein along the silken hardness.</p><p>He sucked in a hissing breath.</p><p>Joy burst inside her. She loved how strongly he reacted to her. \u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d She circled the crown.</p><p>He gritted his teeth. \u201cI want inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done with the outside.\u201d She leaned over and licked the bead of moisture from his tip.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d He shoved her back and wrapped her legs around him. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout time!\u201d She grabbed on to his shoulders and trembled when his erection nudged into her damp folds.</p><p>He stopped. \u201cBrynley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She gazed into his eyes and forgot her frustration. He was looking at her so tenderly, it made her heart ache.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. \u201cI\u2014ay!\u201d She squealed when he plunged into her. \u201cOh, Phineas.\u201d He was so wonderfully big and hard.</p><p>He kissed her brow and started slow. That didn\u2019t last long. She was soon begging for more. Harder. Faster.</p><p>Her nails dug into his shoulders. Her heels dug into his back.</p><p>She screamed, and the spasms seemed to last forever as he pumped into her. With a long groan, he collapsed beside her. The aftershocks continued, and she gasped for air.</p><p>He lay still beside her.</p><p>\u201cAre you still alive?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUntil sunrise.\u201d He kissed her neck. \u201cDid you need more?\u201d</p><p>She groaned. Was he trying to kill her? \u201cI just want to lie here for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d He rolled onto his back and gazed at the stars. \u201cIt was better than I ever imagined.\u201d He took her hand in his and laced their fingers together.</p><p>Her heart swelled with love. \u201cThis is perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They lay together holding hands until the cold night air made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d He sat up and dug into a pocket of his jeans. \u201cYou might want these back.\u201d He dangled her panties in the air.</p><p>\u201cYou kept them?\u201d She grabbed them and slipped them on.</p><p>\u201cYou can wear my shirt.\u201d He handed it to her, then pulled on his jeans.</p><p>She snapped the shirt together. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>He pulled on his boots. \u201cWe still have to find Corky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean about us.\u201d</p><p>He stood and slipped his jacket onto her. \u201cWe make it work.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and looked away. It had been perfect, but perfection could never last.</p><p>\u201cBryn.\u201d He nudged her chin back so she\u2019d look at him. \u201cWe can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d He pulled her close. \u201cLet\u2019s get the rest of your clothes.\u201d</p><p>She nestled her cheek against his bare chest. Everything went black, and she materialized in the cabin.</p><p>A gun fired, and Phineas stiffened.</p><p>She gasped. There was a dart in his arm.</p><p>He ripped it out.</p><p>Another shot exploded, hitting Phineas again. His body jerked, and she stumbled back, bumping against Jack on the floor. He lay, stiff and motionless, a look of horror in his eyes.</p><p>Phineas yanked the dart from his shoulder and grabbed her. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d a blond woman shouted, firing her pistol again and again. Corky.</p><p>Brynley pulled the darts from him as fast as she could. His body shimmered as he tried to teleport, but then he solidified and collapsed onto the floor.</p><p>It had all happened so fast. Shock quickly morphed into full rage. She threw off Phin\u2019s jacket and shifted, growling and ready to attack Corky.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d a man\u2019s voice said.</p><p>She whipped around and saw three men standing at the back of the room. Kyle and two others.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to introduce myself.\u201d The tallest one stepped forward. Dark hair, dark eyes. But not a friendly brown like Phineas\u2019s. His eyes were cold and hard like flint. \u201cI\u2019m Rhett Bleddyn. This is Dimitri. And I believe you already know Kyle.\u201d</p><p>She shifted back to human form. When Rhett\u2019s cold gaze drifted over her ripped shirt, she put Phineas\u2019s jacket back on. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Rhett smirked. \u201cYou, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen.\u201d She glanced down at Phineas. He seemed to be conscious and watching her.</p><p>\u201cThe vampires are paralyzed.\u201d Rhett motioned to Dimitri. \u201cThanks to a special potion Dimitri brought us. Kyle, would you care to demonstrate?\u201d</p><p>Kyle came forward and kicked Phineas in the ribs. He lay there, helplessly taking the attack.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Brynley shouted.</p><p>\u201cOh, it could get much worse,\u201d Rhett said. \u201cYou see, Kyle has a stake, and he\u2019s ready to plunge it right into the hearts of these vampires.\u201d</p><p>Kyle whipped a wooden stake from his belt and held it over Phineas\u2019s bare chest.</p><p>Brynley\u2019s heart stuttered.</p><p>\u201cSo, Miss Jones,\u201d Rhett continued with a sly grin. \u201cI believe we were going to get married?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Nightshade. Phineas struggled to make his body follow orders, but it lay attached to his active mind like a sack of dead meat. Too ironic. The former drug dealer taken down by a drug. And not just any drug, but the same damned drug that had inspired his death and transformation. The Malcontents had murdered him and made him a vampire so he could get them the ingredients to make Nightshade.</p><p>Karma was a bitch. It had come back to kick him in the butt. Or the ribs. He winced inwardly as Kyle rammed another pointed cowboy boot into his side. The creep had done the same thing earlier to his brother.</p><p>Shit kicker, Phineas wanted to yell at Kyle, but then that made him the shit. And rightly so. He should have called Jack before coming. He should have managed to teleport Brynley away before succumbing to the drug. Now she was in danger. Her eyes met his, and he cringed inwardly at the fear he saw there.</p><p>Be strong. You\u2019re a survivor. As long as you\u2019re alive, you can fight.</p><p>A rebellious spark lit in her eyes, as if she\u2019d heard him.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered me, Miss Jones.\u201d Rhett Bleddyn strode toward her. \u201cHave you agreed to marry me?\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll consider it if you leave these men alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll agree or the vampires will die.\u201d He motioned to Phineas. \u201cThat one first. His scent is all over you.\u201d He stepped closer, his face twisted in a sneer. \u201cYou reek of sex with him. It disgusts me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin and glared back. \u201cFrankly, Rhett, I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d</p><p>He slapped her hard enough to make her eyes water.</p><p>Rage burst inside Phineas, but with nowhere for it to go, it felt like his head would explode. Stay strong, sweetheart. Don\u2019t give up hope.</p><p>\u201cI have heard of your disobedience to your father,\u201d Rhett growled at her. \u201cWith me, you will learn to submit.\u201d</p><p>She avoided looking at him and focused on Phineas, her cheek aflame with a red handprint. \u201cI will marry you a week from today.\u201d</p><p>Hope flared in Phineas\u2019s chest. She was looking at him, making the promise to him.</p><p>\u201cThree days,\u201d Rhett countered. \u201cOn the first night after the three nights of the full moon.\u201d</p><p>It was a strategic maneuver, Phineas realized. Any werewolf could shift on the three-night period of the full moon, but only an Alpha like Rhett could shift the following night. He wanted the ability to defeat any ordinary werewolf that might object to a forced marriage. Brynley\u2019s father was an Alpha, too, but he was obviously for the marriage.</p><p>But this was a mistake on Rhett\u2019s part. It gave Phineas and his friends three nights to gather their troops and rescue Brynley. Unless, of course, Rhett intended to kill him and Jack tonight.</p><p>Brynley inclined her head. \u201cI want the ceremony to be at my father\u2019s ranch in Montana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019ll be going there shortly. I suggest you dress appropriately and wash that vampire\u2019s stench off you.\u201d Rhett motioned to Dimitri. \u201cMake sure that restroom is secure.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri peered inside. \u201cNo windows, no doors. She can\u2019t escape here.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the clothes she\u2019d discarded earlier and with a worried glance at Phineas, she went inside the bathroom and shut the door.</p><p>Rhett sneered down at him. \u201cShe will do everything I ask. Kyle will remain here with his stakes, and if she gives me any trouble, I\u2019ll call him, and he\u2019ll turn you to dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe deserves to die,\u201d Corky hissed as she moved toward them. \u201cHe is the one who betrayed me and tried to capture me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, there, love.\u201d Rhett pulled her close and kissed her brow. \u201cI was happy you came to see me again.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sly smile. \u201cOur plans are going well.\u201d She glanced down at Phineas. \u201cDimitri found the formula and ingredients to make Nightshade hidden in a safe at the Coven House in Brooklyn. He cooked us up a batch and brought it here.\u201d</p><p>She nudged Phineas with her foot. \u201cWe have plenty more. You and your traitorous companions will not be able to stop us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Phineas wondered what Corky and Rhett were up to. They appeared to be lovers, even though Rhett was forcing Brynley to marry him. His motivation for marriage was clearly not love, but most probably wealth and power. Just as Brynley had said, she was more of a pawn than a princess.</p><p>She emerged from the bathroom, dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt. She ignored Rhett as she walked past him, and aimed a look of love at Phineas. He tried to return it. She sat nearby at the kitchen table and pulled on her socks and boots.</p><p>\u201cYour father will be pleased that I\u2019ve returned you to the pack,\u201d Rhett boasted. \u201cAnd he will be impressed by how well you obey me.\u201d</p> <p>She shot him an annoyed look as she tugged on the last boot.</p><p>\u201cYou will obey,\u201d Rhett reminded her. \u201cOr I\u2019ll call Kyle, and he\u2019ll stake the vampires.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shifted to Phineas and Jack, then to Kyle. \u201cIf you hurt them, the entire Vamp world will come after you. Including your brother.\u201d</p><p>Kyle snorted. \u201cNate\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndead.\u201d</p> <p>Kyle turned pale. \u201cWhat?\u201d He gave Rhett a frantic look. \u201cYou said he would die, that the ranch would be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be.\u201d Rhett glowered at his minion. \u201cYou will obey me in all things and be rewarded. You will not question me again.\u201d</p><p>Kyle inclined his head. \u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><p>Rhett shifted his glare to Brynley. \u201cYou\u2019re back in the Lycan world now. Adjust your loyalties.\u201d He motioned to Corky and Dimitri. \u201cTake us to the Jones ranch in Montana.\u201d</p><p>Corky wrapped her arms around Rhett and cuddled up to him, then they vanished.</p><p>Brynley rushed toward Phineas, but before she could reach him, Dimitri zoomed to her and grabbed her. One last look, her eyes filled with a mixture of hope and despair, and then she was gone.</p> <p>Her emotions transferred straight from her eyes to his heart. Despair that she was gone, that he\u2019d lost her, that she would suffer abuse and humiliation at the hands of Rhett Bleddyn and her father. And hope that he would find her, rescue her, and spend the rest of his life giving her the love she deserved.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better hope Rhett doesn\u2019t call.\u201d Kyle tapped him on the chest with the stake. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care if you made Nate a vampire. I\u2019m not afraid of him. I have plenty of these.\u201d He stuffed the stake in his belt.</p><p>\u201cAnything to eat around here?\u201d He glanced toward the kitchen, then back down at Phineas. \u201cDon\u2019t run off.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at his own sorry joke and wandered out of Phineas\u2019s view. If Phineas strained his eyes to the left, he could make out one of Jack\u2019s shoes. No doubt Jack was just as frustrated as he was.</p><p>Noises came from the kitchen. Kyle was raiding the refrigerator, banging cabinet doors shut, and dropping utensils into the stainless steel sink with a clatter.</p><p>Brynley would be at her father\u2019s ranch now. A prisoner. She\u2019d run away before, so she would probably be watched and guarded.</p><p>Footsteps headed to the sofa, then a creak as Kyle settled down, and gulping noises as he wolfed down his food.</p><p>Time crept by. He thought about Brynley, recalled every detail of their lovemaking, and prayed he\u2019d have a chance to love her again. He strained, trying so hard to make his body move that beads of sweat rolled down his temple.</p> <p>Snores came from the couch. Kyle was sound asleep. He was a lousy guard, but then he knew they weren\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>More time passed. Phineas kept trying to budge, but to no avail. A phone buzzed on the kitchen table. One of the sat phones. Freemont, most probably, wanting to know why they hadn\u2019t checked in. Luckily, it was set on vibrate, and Kyle was sleeping right through it.</p><p>Come on, Freemont. If his brother played it smart, he would report their lack of communication. As a mortal, he couldn\u2019t teleport here to check on them, but he could ask Zoltan to drop by.</p><p>The minutes dragged by. Kyle kept snoring, and no one teleported in. No call from Rhett, so Brynley must be cooperating to keep Jack and him safe.</p><p>The sat phone buzzed again. Dammit, Freemont, send someone! Was it already dawn in New York? If the Vamps had all fallen into their death-sleep, there would be no rescue.</p><p>A terrible thought crept into his mind. If he and Jack were still on the floor at dawn, the sun would shine through the cabin windows.</p><p>And they would be toast.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten what an orgy of blood and guts occurred each month at her father\u2019s house. Brynley had avoided the official hunt for five years now, ever since that night she\u2019d become the prey. She\u2019d started going to smaller hunts, hosted by friends she could trust, or she\u2019d hunted with the Lost Boys at Phil\u2019s cabin.</p><p>Dimitri had materialized with her, arriving next to Rhett and Corky in the woods bordering her father\u2019s enormous backyard. It was there, in that grassy clearing, that the werewolves returned from their hunt, naked and bloody from gorging on their kills, many of them dragging dead carcasses behind them.</p><p>Each month, steel rods were erected down the length of the backyard, like rows of clothing rods in a closet, but with hooks instead of hangers. There, the elk and deer would be suspended and dressed. A row of fire pits were ready with spits for roasting.</p><p>Up on the hill, the giant ranch house sprawled. It had been purposely built on a hill, so her father could look down at anyone approaching.</p><p>Her father\u2019s pride and joy was the covered back patio, equipped with an enormous outdoor kitchen and bar. Slabs of meat would be barbecued, bottles of beer guzzled down, and the party would continue for three nights. Gorging and hunting. Food and blood. Booze and sex. The Alphas who attended her father\u2019s parties were allowed to take any women they wanted. Of course, the Supreme Pack Master\u2019s daughters had always been off-limits, until that night five years ago.</p><p>She spotted her father on the patio, dressed in jeans and an unbuttoned shirt, talking to a female werewolf, still nude and smeared with blood across her breasts. Caddoc Jones didn\u2019t look a day over forty-five, although he had to be four times that age. He fisted his hand in the woman\u2019s long hair and pulled her close for a kiss.</p><p>Brynley looked away. She\u2019d always suspected his infidelity and cruelty to Mom had incited the fight between him and Phil, resulting in her brother\u2019s banishment.</p><p>Rhett noticed her discomfort and chuckled. \u201cWait here.\u201d He strode into the clearing.</p><p>His stride and posture, clearly that of an arrogant Alpha wolf, made him stand out. Also the fact that he was neatly dressed while most of the returning hunters were nude and covered with blood, guts, and grime.</p><p>He marched down the center alley, framed on each side with rows of hanging carcasses. Blood dripped, staining the grass. Female Lycans reacted to his prowess, brushing their long hair over their shoulders to show off their breasts.</p><p>Brynley was suddenly immensely grateful that she\u2019d fallen in love with a Vamp.</p><p>\u201cRhett!\u201d Caddoc Jones strode to the edge of the patio and gazed down onto the backyard. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you showed up. You\u2019re late for the Hunt.\u201d</p><p>Rhett stopped in the middle of the yard. \u201cI\u2019ve already been hunting tonight. And I\u2019ve caught the most amazing prey.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc lifted an eyebrow. \u201cIndeed? Where is this prey of yours?\u201d</p><p>Rhett glanced back, motioning to Dimitri. The Malcontent grabbed Brynley and zoomed forward, depositing her next to Rhett. He dashed back to the woods and Corky.</p><p>It seemed odd to Brynley that no one looked surprised that Rhett traveled with a few Malcontents. Apparently, they were accustomed to seeing him with vampires. But they were surprised by her appearance. Murmurs spread among the werewolves till everyone in the yard was staring at her.</p><p>She took a deep breath and looked up at her father.</p><p>He stared at her. At first she thought his face completely expressionless, but then she noticed the clenched jaw and eyes so intense he could probably kill a deer without touching it. He was pissed. Well, she supposed she had caused him some embarrassment by running away from the wedding he\u2019d planned. That had been a rule drummed into her and Phil since infancy. Never, ever contradict or embarrass their father in front of his minions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought her home,\u201d Rhett boasted. \u201cAnd she\u2019s agreed to marry me in three days.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHas she?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t trust her. Well, he was right. She had no intention of marrying Rhett. Ever.</p><p>\u201cBrynley!\u201d a female voice squealed. A pretty young woman in a flowery cocktail dress ran across the patio, or attempted to. With a laugh, she kicked off her high-heeled sandals and sprinted barefoot across the yard.</p><p>Brynley\u2019s heart expanded. \u201cGlynis.\u201d She grinned when her sister threw her arms around her with an exuberant hug.</p><p>They\u2019d always hugged, especially after Mom had died and Phil had left. As the only females in the family, they\u2019d clung to each other for support. They\u2019d always understood there were no hugs to be had from their father or Glynis\u2019s twin brother, Howell.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Rhett! I knew you could do it.\u201d Glynis grinned at him, then at Brynley. \u201cI\u2019ve been begging him to bring you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMission accomplished.\u201d Rhett winked at her.</p><p>She giggled and pulled Brynley toward the patio. \u201cIsn\u2019t he dreamy?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>More like a nightmare. \u201cGlynis, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Glynis frowned at her. \u201cI was so devastated when you ran away. If you had just stayed one more day, you would have met Rhett, and you would have seen how perfect he is for you.\u201d She glanced toward their father and lowered her voice. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t have upset you know who.\u201d</p><p>Brynley stopped about six feet from the patio, where her father was still staring at her.</p><p>Glynis stepped between them, a wide grin plastered on her pretty face. \u201cBrynley\u2019s come home, Dad! Isn\u2019t that wonderful?\u201d</p><p>Bless her, Brynley thought. Glynis had always wanted to believe they were a happy family. This was the only world she knew, so she clung to the notion that it was a good one. Brynley had never had the heart to purposely burst the pretty bubble her sister lived in. She\u2019d protected her over the years in hopes that her sister would escape by marrying a nice werewolf who would treat her well. Whenever a questionable guy had shown interest in her, Brynley had chased him off.</p><p>Caddoc glanced at Glynis, then back at Brynley. \u201cI\u2019m sure you two have a lot of catching up to do. Glynis, she will share your room until the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Glynis clapped her hands together and grinned at Brynley. \u201cWe\u2019ll have so much fun! It\u2019ll be like summer camp.\u201d</p><p>Poor Glynis. She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d just been assigned twenty-four-hour guard duty.</p><p>Caddoc motioned to three of his minions, who were, thankfully, dressed. \u201cSee that my daughters are . . . comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d They bowed their heads.</p><p>Three more bodyguards. Her father was making sure she\u2019d have no chance to escape.</p><p>One of the guards strode toward the house and opened the back door. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>Glynis linked her arm with Brynley\u2019s. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear all about your adventures. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back home. I missed you terribly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too,\u201d Brynley murmured, glancing back to find the other two guards behind them, steering them like cattle into a pen.</p><p>\u201cAnd we have wedding plans to make!\u201d Glynis pulled her inside. \u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d</p><p>Brynley winced as the door slammed shut behind her. She was back home.</p><p>In prison.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Brynley paced around her sister\u2019s large bedroom suite. It was no wonder pack members thought they were princesses. Glynis\u2019s king-sized bed was covered with Egyptian cotton sheets and a pink satin duvet. The large armoire housed a big flat-screen television and library of DVDs.</p><p>The adjoining bathroom sported gold-plated fixtures on the marble sink and giant Jacuzzi tub. The walk-in shower was lined with marble and boasted three spray nozzles. No bathroom window for escape.</p><p>She eyed the white marble floor and thought of Phineas and Jack lying helpless on the bare wooden floor of her brother\u2019s cabin. Were they still paralyzed? If she escaped, would Rhett call Kyle and order him to stake them? Maybe she should give them more time before she made her move.</p><p>She wandered back into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Bryn.\u201d Glynis patted a spot next to her on the bed. \u201cTell me where you\u2019ve been. What have you been doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeaching school.\u201d She peered out her sister\u2019s large upstairs window. It was a big drop to the ground below. But not so bad if she had a rope. Or expensive Egyptian cotton sheets.</p><p>The circular drive in front of the house was jammed with SUVs and pickup trucks from the hundred or so guests attending the Hunt. Maybe she could borrow one. It was common for her father\u2019s guests to leave the keys in the vehicles in case one needed to be moved. No one worried about robbery here. There were always a few guards on duty.</p><p>Besides, anyone who messed with her father or his property would find himself mauled to death by a pack of wolves. Anyone who helped her escape would probably face a similar fate. She was on her own.</p><p>\u201cDo you like teaching?\u201d Glynis asked. \u201cThe kids aren\u2019t mean to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids are grateful they have a home.\u201d She glanced back at her sister. \u201cI\u2019m mostly teaching the Lost Boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Lost Boys?\u201d</p><p>Brynley sighed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve overprotected you.\u201d It had felt necessary when her sister was eleven and mourning the loss of her mother, but unfortunately, it had become a habit that was hard to break. \u201cGlynis, our father banishes young boys from the pack. Just like he did Phil.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She blinked. \u201cPhil chose to leave\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Our father kicked him out. He does it to boys every year. Some of them as young as twelve years old.\u201d</p><p>Glynis shifted uneasily on the bed. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize they were so young. We\u2019re not supposed to talk about them. Once they\u2019re out of the pack, they\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey still exist. Imagine being without your home and family\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Glynis shuddered. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have been banished if they hadn\u2019t misbehaved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? These are young boys with nowhere to go.\u201d</p><p>Glynis gave her an injured look. \u201cI\u2019m not heartless, you know. I\u2019m glad you found a home for them. But you weren\u2019t banished like them. Your home is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d Brynley muttered as she sprawled into an armchair upholstered with pink roses. \u201cYou\u2019re twenty-three years old, Glyn. Don\u2019t you want to do more than play hostess every month for the Hunt?\u201d</p> <p>She looked indignant. \u201cI do plenty of things. I get to travel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith an escort.\u201d</p><p>She waved that aside. \u201cI feel safer with them. And I get to shop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Dad\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>Glynis huffed. \u201cWell, someday I hope to marry, but Dad insists that you get married first.\u201d</p><p>Brynley dropped her head back on the cushion. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re eager to marry me off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrynley!\u201d Glynis tossed a pink satin pillow at her. \u201cDon\u2019t make me sound so selfish. I want you to be happy. And Rhett really wants to marry you. He promised me he would be a good husband to you.\u201d</p><p>Brynley groaned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s handsome and charming.\u201d Glynis ticked off a list on her fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s a powerful Alpha. He\u2019s almost as rich as Dad. He has a dozen ranches in Alaska and one here so you could always spend time here in your old hunting grounds. And they call him the King of Alaska! That would make you a queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already has a queen. A vampire named Corky who\u2019s probably his mistress.\u201d</p><p>Glynis rolled her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s a very virile man, Bryn. You couldn\u2019t expect him to stay celibate while he was waiting for you to return.\u201d</p><p>Brynley gave her sister a worried look. \u201cHave you fallen for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She blushed. \u201cI\u2019m interested in someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Brynley sat forward. \u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>Glynis\u2019s blush deepened. \u201cHe\u2019s a werewolf, but not an Alpha. He\u2019s not interested in power or land. He\u2019s an artist. Dad hired him to paint a mural in the great hall, and when no one was looking, I would bring him water to drink. He\u2019s so sweet. Not at all like . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur father?\u201d</p><p>Glynis winced. \u201cI\u2019m not blind. I can see how Dad and the other Alphas behave.\u201d</p><p>Brynley sighed. \u201cOur father\u2019s not going to allow you to date a guy who\u2019s not an Alpha or doesn\u2019t own land.\u201d</p><p>Glynis hung her head. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you stay here?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened with surprise. \u201cWhere else would I go? I live here. I have most everything I could want here.\u201d She smiled. \u201cEspecially now that you\u2019re back. I want you to be happy, too. And I think Rhett is perfect for you. You were always the strong and fearless one, and he\u2019s that way, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Strong and fearless?\u201d Brynley shook her head. She\u2019d lived most of her life in fear of her father.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Glynis insisted. \u201cYou\u2019ve done all kinds of things I would never have the nerve to do. You went off to college, you joined the rodeo, you\u2019re teaching school.\u201d Her eyes glimmered with tears. \u201cYou\u2019re always leaving me. And I need you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Glynis.\u201d Brynley sat beside her on the bed and hugged her. She couldn\u2019t blame her sister for taking comfort by clinging to the security of the Lycan world. Unfortunately, the world that made Glynis feel safe made her feel trapped.</p><p>\u201cPlease give Rhett a chance,\u201d Glynis begged with tears in her eyes. \u201cHe wants you. And it\u2019s not just for power and prestige. He\u2019s taken a real interest in you. He\u2019s always asking me questions about you. What do you like? What do you dream about? Where do you go when you want to be alone?\u201d</p><p>Brynley winced. \u201cYou told him about Phil\u2019s cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I told him lots of things. I want you to be happy with him.\u201d</p><p>She felt the prison bars closing in.</p><p>\u201cHe plans to court you, you know.\u201d Glynis beamed with excitement. \u201cSo you\u2019ll be happy to marry him. Isn\u2019t that romantic?\u201d</p><p>Brynley started to explain that Rhett\u2019s idea of romance was threatening to kill others so she would submit. But as she studied her sister\u2019s hopeful smile, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to tarnish the gilded cage her sister enjoyed living in.</p><p>\u201cAnd only three days to the wedding!\u201d Glynis clasped her hands together. \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting! And guess what? Dad had a beautiful gown made for you for the last wedding. It\u2019s still hanging in your closet.\u201d</p><p>A seed of panic stirred in Brynley\u2019s chest. She had to get out of here. If only she could teleport like the\u2014 She gasped. That was it! All she had to do was call a Vamp, and he\u2019d teleport in and swoosh! She\u2019d be outta here!</p><p>\u201cYou look shocked.\u201d Glynis grinned. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve seen the gown, and it\u2019s really lovely.\u201d</p><p>Brynley nodded. She needed a phone. Her gaze swept the room. No phone in sight. But close to the door there was a bomb\u00e9 chest with Glynis\u2019s bright red designer handbag sitting on top. There had to be a cell phone inside. What wealthy young lady didn\u2019t own a cell phone?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be your maid of honor, right?\u201d Glynis asked.</p><p>Brynley nodded, still focused on the red handbag. Her portal to freedom.</p><p>\u201cOh, I bought the cutest dress the other day in Billings. It\u2019s teal-green. Is that all right for the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try it on?\u201d Brynley suggested. \u201cI\u2019d love to see it.\u201d</p><p>Glynis jumped to her feet. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea! Then you can help me decide which shoes to wear with it.\u201d She dashed into her giant walk-in closet. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a sec!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time.\u201d Brynley rushed over to the red handbag and dug through its cavernous interior. No phone? She checked inside pockets, outside pockets. Dammit. She opened the drawers of the bomb\u00e9 chest. Scarves, mittens, hats, berets, gloves.</p><p>She ran to the bedside tables and checked the drawers. No phone. There had to be a phone somewhere in this damned house. Her bedroom had a phone. At least it had before she\u2019d run away. It was just down the hall.</p><p>She eased open the door, and a guard quickly appeared.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>He was a new guard, probably from a pack far away in Idaho. The other two guards stood nearby. Strangers to her, but loyal to her father.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI thought I\u2019d go to my bedroom for a second. My wedding dress is there, and I\u2019d like to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll arrange it,\u201d the guard responded. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Could you arrange to jump off a cliff? \u201cI\u2019m a bit hungry.\u201d Actually, after killing that deer and having wild sex with Phineas, she was starving. She needed to keep her strength up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a tray brought up for you.\u201d</p><p>Before she could say anything else, the guard shut the door in her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Glynis bounced from the closet, wearing a beautiful teal-green dress.</p><p>I think I\u2019m screwed. She heaved a big sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, Glynis twirled in a circle. \u201cOnly three days till your wedding!\u201d</p><p>Three days to escape. She wondered again how Phineas was doing. She should have told him she loved him while she had the chance.</p><p>The sat phone buzzed again. Phineas groaned inwardly. Freemont had to know something was wrong. He was going to get chewed out for sure if\u2014</p><p>Four forms materialized nearby. Zoltan with Roman hitching a ride. Vanda giving Gregori a ride. Of course. Freemont\u2019s choices had been limited to those Vamps who had teleported here before. Zoltan and Vanda. The location of the cabin was embedded in their psychic memory. And they\u2019d brought Roman and Gregori, because most of the MacKay employees were still in Russia and Eastern Europe.</p><p>Zoltan and Roman were armed with swords, Gregori with an automatic pistol, and Vanda with a whip.</p><p>Roman sheathed his sword. \u201cJack? Phineas? Are you all right?\u201d He knelt beside Phineas. \u201cCan you talk?\u201d</p><p>Phineas blinked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not alone.\u201d Zoltan pointed his sword toward the couch. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to Romatech now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d Roman picked a dart off the floor and looked curiously at it. \u201cI think they were drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be Nightshade,\u201d Gregori said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they can move.\u201d</p><p>A groan sounded from the couch, then a sleepy \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanda,\u201d Zoltan whispered. \u201cGo. Take Jack with you.\u201d</p><p>She fell to her knees beside Jack, wrapped her arms around him, and vanished.</p><p>\u201cRoman, take Phin\u2014\u201d Zoltan stopped.</p><p>A huge growl sounded behind Phineas, and he knew Kyle must have shifted.</p><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d Zoltan shouted.</p><p>Roman jumped back just as the werewolf leaped, his vicious jaws snapping.</p><p>Gunshots fired, and the wolf jolted in midair, then landed with a thud on top of Phineas. He winced inwardly as the two-hundred-pound weight squirmed in death throes on his torso.</p><p>Zoltan shoved the wolf off him, and it shimmered, returning to human form.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Gregori said softly, the gun still in his hand. \u201cIs he dead?\u201d</p><p>Zoltan felt for a pulse on Kyle\u2019s neck. \u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Gregori grimaced, then muttered another curse.</p><p>\u201cYou had no choice,\u201d Roman told him. \u201cHe was attacking us.\u201d</p><p>Gregori holstered his gun. \u201cI thought he was going to bite you. I just meant to stop him. I didn\u2019t mean to . . . Shit!\u201d He paced away.</p><p>Phineas blinked slowly. Nate Carson would have a lot to deal with when he woke up. His first night as a vampire. And the news that his brother was dead.</p><p>Zoltan straightened and looked around the cabin. \u201cBrynley\u2019s gone. The werewolves must have taken her.\u201d</p><p>Phineas managed to make a sound something like a moan.</p><p>Zoltan leaned over him. \u201cWe\u2019ll get her back.\u201d</p><p>Roman knelt beside him. \u201cThe drug should wear off during your death-sleep. Tomorrow night, you\u2019ll be as good as new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tomorrow night, we\u2019ll have a small army,\u201d Gregori added. \u201cAngus ordered everybody to return to New York. They\u2019ll arrive tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Zoltan picked him up. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her, Phineas. Mark my word.\u201d</p><p>The next night, Phineas awoke in his basement bedroom at Romatech. Alone. It was only last night when he\u2019d kissed Brynley in this bed. Just last night when he\u2019d made love to her by the Cloud Peak Glacier.</p><p>Frustration seethed in him that he had spent the rest of the night drugged and entirely helpless, unable to rescue her. He guzzled down two bottles of blood, threw on some clothes, and zoomed upstairs to the MacKay security office.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro!\u201d Freemont grinned at him from behind the desk. \u201cYou\u2019re looking a lot better. Last night, you looked kinda stiff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long to send someone? We could have fried there on the floor if the sun had risen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, it was only fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Phineas blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Freemont snickered.</p><p>Damn. \u201cIt felt longer than that,\u201d Phineas mumbled. \u201cI was paralyzed, you know. I couldn\u2019t see any clocks.\u201d</p><p>Freemont nodded, his eyes twinkling. \u201cYou have to admit I did pretty good, huh?\u201d</p><p>Phineas shrugged. \u201cYeah.\u201d So there had been several hours of darkness left, hours that he should have spent rescuing Brynley, but he\u2019d been unable to move.</p><p>He turned away, and one of the monitors caught his attention. Nate Carson was sitting up in bed, drinking a bottle of blood. His sire, Zoltan, was standing nearby, talking to him. Nate\u2019s bare chest looked completely healed.</p><p>\u201cWe have a new Vamp,\u201d Phineas murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Freemont walked over to stand next to Phineas. \u201cI heard your wolfie-girl is missing. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His heart squeezed painfully. \u201cIt was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was mine.\u201d Jack walked in, a bottle of blood in his hand. \u201cI should have managed to escape. I felt so damned helpless, lying there on the floor, unable to move and worried that you and Brynley might return at any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we have good news from the school.\u201d Freemont gave them an encouraging grin. \u201cCaitlyn had her twins this morning. A boy and a girl. No fur, but healthy lungs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is good news,\u201d Phineas agreed.</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cI should go pick up Lara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Freemont pointed at a monitor. \u201cAngus and the guys just teleported in.\u201d</p><p>They stepped into the hall as Angus and ten of his employees entered the side entrance. Angus lifted a hand in greeting. \u201cPhineas, Jack, how are you? I heard ye were drugged last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine, sir,\u201d Jack said. \u201cDid you hear the good news? Caitlyn had the twins, both healthy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma clasped her hands together, grinning. \u201cThat\u2019s fabulous! Oh, I\u2019d love to see the babies.\u201d</p><p>Angus chuckled. \u201cGo ahead and go. I\u2019ll take care of things here.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his cheek, then teleported away.</p> <p>Angus motioned toward the conference room. \u201cLet\u2019s get started. I want to hear everything that\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Everyone filed into the room and took a seat around the conference table.</p><p>Phineas was too anxious to sit, so he paced toward Angus at the head of the table. \u201cWe need to rescue Brynley. She\u2019s been taken to her father\u2019s house, and they\u2019ll force her to marry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLad.\u201d Angus stood and rested a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThe sun is still up in Wyoming. We have two hours before we can teleport there.\u201d</p><p>Phineas took a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He should have known that. He wasn\u2019t thinking properly.</p> <p>\u201cDoona fash,\u201d Ian told him. \u201cWe\u2019ll get her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho took her?\u201d Phil demanded.</p><p>\u201cA nasty werewolf named Rhett Bleddyn,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Howard Barr stiffened. A low growl vibrated in his chest.</p><p>Rajiv, who was sitting next to him, gave him a worried look. \u201cYou all right, Pooh Bear? We could go to cafeteria and get you donuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Howard gritted out.</p> <p>Howard not hungry? Phineas turned to look at him and noticed everyone else was staring, too.</p><p>\u201cDo you know Rhett Bleddyn?\u201d Austin asked.</p><p>Howard shimmered for a second, then resumed his usual large human form.</p><p>Rajiv moved back. Phineas could never recall a time when Howard had struggled to control the Kodiak bear within him.</p><p>\u201cIf we go to battle with him,\u201d Howard growled, \u201cthen I will be the one to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>\u201cWould ye care to elaborate, Howard?\u201d Angus asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone exchanged glances. As far as Phineas knew, Howard had grown up in Alaska, and since Bleddyn was also from Alaska, there was obviously something that connected the two shifters. Something bad.</p><p>Phineas took a seat at the table. \u201cBleddyn is allied with Corky. She\u2019s the one who drugged Jack and me.\u201d</p><p>Angus motioned to Jack. \u201cTell us what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at the cabin when an SUV pulled up,\u201d Jack began. \u201cTinted windows. I could only see the front seat. Bleddyn and Kyle got out and asked to see Brynley. I said she wasn\u2019t there and they should leave. That\u2019s when I heard shots. I whirled around and spotted Corky and Dimitri just as the darts hit. They must have been in the back of the SUV, and they teleported behind me to attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey shot you with Nightshade?\u201d Mikhail asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I fell down, and they dragged me into the cabin.\u201d Jack made a face. \u201cI couldn\u2019t warn Phineas to stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we now have proof that Corky is there,\u201d J. L. Wang said.</p><p>\u201cShe claims to have a lot more Nightshade,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to careful capturing her.\u201d</p><p>Angus nodded. \u201cAnd you believe she\u2019s hiding at Bleddyn\u2019s ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Phineas replied. \u201cShe and Dimitri. After she shot me, they teleported Brynley and Bleddyn to her father\u2019s ranch. Bleddyn left Kyle behind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho exactly is Kyle?\u201d Angus asked.</p><p>\u201cMy brother,\u201d a voice said from the doorway.</p><p>Everyone turned. Nate Carson stood there with John, Zoltan, and Gregori.</p><p>Zoltan stepped into the room. \u201cAllow me to introduce the newest members of our community, Nate Carson and his mortal guard, John Brighton.\u201d</p><p>Phineas rose to his feet. \u201cDude, you\u2019re standing.\u201d</p><p>Nate smiled sadly as he walked into the room. \u201cI have my legs back. But I\u2019ve lost my brother.\u201d</p><p>Phineas glanced at Gregori, who remained in the doorway, a pained expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cWelcome.\u201d Angus shook hands with Nate and John. Then everyone walked over to the new guys and introduced themselves.</p><p>Phil shook Nate\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you for always being there for Brynley. She\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>Nate\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThen you\u2019re a werewolf, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Phil nodded. \u201cMy father banished me from the pack years ago. Best thing that ever happened to me, actually. These are good people here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat to see you walking, dude.\u201d Phineas slapped Nate on the shoulder. \u201cHow do you like being Undead?\u201d</p><p>Nate\u2019s mouth quirked. \u201cIt\u2019s strange. A few days ago, I didn\u2019t even know vampires existed, and now I am one.\u201d He glanced around the crowded room. \u201cEveryone seems very supportive. I didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s cool.\u201d Phineas winced. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about your brother. If I had been able to talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt probably wouldn\u2019t have changed anything,\u201d Nate interrupted him. \u201cI\u2019ve known for months that Kyle was hanging around a bad crowd. I tried to warn him, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. He\u2014he helped Bleddyn attack me. I don\u2019t know what hurts the most. That he\u2019s gone, or that he turned on me.\u201d</p><p>Phineas patted his shoulder. \u201cHe was messed up, dude. I think he was on steroids.\u201d</p><p>Nate sighed. \u201cHe was certainly too aggressive. Zoltan told me he was trying to bite you all. You had no choice but to shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was me.\u201d Gregori approached them. \u201cI pulled the trigger. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>A pained look crossed Nate\u2019s face. \u201cI understand. In war, we have to make tough decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd live with them,\u201d Gregori muttered.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to business,\u201d Angus announced, and everyone took a seat. Angus looked at Nate. \u201cMy condolences on your brother. Zoltan just explained the situation to me.\u201d</p><p>Nate nodded.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as the sun sets in Wyoming,\u201d Angus continued, \u201cwe can teleport you and John back home with a supply of synthetic blood. We\u2019ll do whatever we can to help you with your transition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Nate said. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to try one of those Bleers.\u201d</p><p>Everyone smiled. Except Howard. He was frowning with a fierce gleam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAny ideas what this Rhett Bleddyn and Corky are up to?\u201d Angus asked.</p><p>\u201cPower,\u201d Howard said quietly. \u201cBleddyn wants all werewolves in North America to swear allegiance to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorky could be planning to use vampire mind control on mortals,\u201d Ian suggested.</p><p>Angus nodded. \u201cSo together, they could control both mortals and werewolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would make us their enemy,\u201d Phil said. \u201cVamps and shifters they can\u2019t control.\u201d</p><p>Howard fisted his hands. \u201cHe\u2019s a cruel bastard who kills other shifters and any mortal who gets in his way. Even children.\u201d</p><p>Silence permeated the room.</p><p>Phineas sucked in a breath. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Howard gave him an intense look. \u201cI thought I had.\u201d</p><p>Angus sat back. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll go after Bleddyn and Corky\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we rescue Brynley,\u201d Phineas added.</p><p>Phil raised his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d</p><p>A surge of anger shot through Phineas, and he pivoted in his chair to face Phil. \u201cNow you\u2019re worried about her? What about all those years when she left you letters, begging you to come home?\u201d</p><p>Phil gritted his teeth. \u201cI was banished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what she went through?\u201d Phineas yelled. \u201cAbuse. Humiliation.\u201d He stopped himself from saying rape. \u201cShe suffered, and you weren\u2019t there to protect her.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s form shimmered for a second as the inner wolf crashed against his restraints. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t care? I left letters, too, begging her to leave with me. She never responded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, ye two.\u201d Angus regarded them sternly. \u201cWe\u2019ll get her. For now, ye need to calm down and keep yer wits about you.\u201d</p><p>Phineas took a deep breath. \u201cI want to be in charge of her rescue team.\u201d</p><p>Angus studied him, then shook his head. \u201cYe\u2019re too emotionally involved. Zoltan will be in charge. You and Phil will be on his team.\u201d</p><p>Phineas cursed silently.</p><p>\u201cI want a second team at Phil\u2019s cabin,\u201d Angus continued. \u201cJack, ye\u2019ll head that team, since ye know how to teleport there. Any werewolves or Malcontents who show up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t live long,\u201d Jack finished the sentence. \u201cI\u2019ll pick up Lara on the way, and I\u2019ll take J.L. and Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerra well,\u201d Angus agreed. \u201cThen we need a third team, the biggest team, to assault Bleddyn\u2019s ranch house and hopefully eliminate him and Dimitri and take Corky prisoner. Robby and I will be in charge so we can attack from two fronts. Freemont will remain here to coordinate the three teams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Freemont sat up.</p><p>Angus scanned the room. \u201cOn Robby\u2019s team, I want Ian, Stan, Rajiv\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me,\u201d Howard grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go, too,\u201d Nate offered. \u201cI was in the army. I know how to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis no\u2019 yer battle, lad,\u201d Angus said.</p><p>\u201cI think it is,\u201d Nate replied. \u201cBleddyn and his pack turned my brother against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I may suggest?\u201d John lifted a hand. \u201cBleddyn\u2019s land borders on the Carson ranch. You could use Nate\u2019s home as a base to launch your attack.\u201d He gave Nate a sheepish look. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, sir.\u201d</p><p>Nate smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a great idea. I should have thought of it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerra well.\u201d Angus stood. \u201cAs soon as the sun sets in Wyoming, we move out.\u201d</p><p>Brynley answered a knock at the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cThese are for you.\u201d The guard passed her a crystal vase containing a dozen long-stemmed yellow roses.</p><p>The minute she took the vase, he shut the door.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d she muttered. Not that she minded being closed up in the bedroom with her sister. It was much preferable to spending time with Rhett Bleddyn or her father. Thankfully, neither one of them had contacted her during the day.</p><p>Since the Hunt went on all night for three nights, the werewolves tended to sleep most of the day. Only now, almost suppertime, was the house stirring. A big buffet was usually served at seven to energize all the guests for that night\u2019s hunt.</p><p>She glanced at the window where the sun was lowering in the sky. What had happened to Phineas and Jack? Were they still in the cabin? Would they wake at sunset no longer paralyzed? If they did, they could probably overpower Kyle. If he hadn\u2019t already used his stake . . .</p><p>\u201cOh my!\u201d Glynis rushed forward, her eyes sparkling with excitement. \u201cWhat beautiful roses! Are they from Rhett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows,\u201d Brynley mumbled.</p><p>Glynis plucked the card from the clear plastic trident and read out loud. \u201c \u2018All my devotion, all my life.\u2019 And it\u2019s signed, \u2018Your loving Rhett.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that sweet? And they\u2019re your favorite color, too. That\u2019s so romantic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him yellow was my favorite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. But it\u2019s still romantic. The nearest florist is miles away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he had one of his minions drive to it.\u201d Brynley strode into the bathroom and set the vase into the white porcelain trash can.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Glynis pulled the vase out. \u201cIt would be insulting not to accept this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201d</p><p>Glynis huffed, then returned the vase to the bedroom and set it on the bomb\u00e9 chest. \u201cThere, perfect.\u201d She smoothed down the long skirt of her rose-colored silk gown and wrinkled her nose at Brynley\u2019s jeans and T-shirt. \u201cYou know, you really should dress for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Brynley rolled her eyes. \u201cI never did understand that. Why does everyone dress so fancy for dinner when they\u2019re just going to strip it all off when it\u2019s time for the Hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tradition,\u201d Glynis insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s been done this way for centuries. Besides, I like dressing up. It\u2019s fun. You can borrow one of my dresses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>Glynis set her hands on her hips. \u201cDad will expect you to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell him I\u2019m ill.\u201d</p><p>Glynis\u2019s face turned pale. \u201cYou want me to lie for you?\u201d</p><p>Brynley saw the fear in her sister\u2019s eyes. Damn but her father had picked her guard well. He knew she\u2019d never do anything that would endanger her sister. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I-I\u2019ll eat dinner. I won\u2019t get you in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Glynis smiled with relief. \u201cThank you. Maybe, if you\u2019re lucky, Rhett will ask you to hunt with him tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. \u2019Cause nothing says romance like slaughtering a defenseless animal together.\u201d</p><p>Glynis tilted her head with a confused look. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to hunt?\u201d</p><p>And risk being the prey? \u201cNot tonight.\u201d Not here. What she loved most about hunting was not the kill, but the rush of the wind as she ran through the woods, the power and freedom she felt as a wolf. But here, she could never feel powerful or free. Here she was helpless and trapped. Her inner wolf growled with frustration. \u201cI\u2019ll stick close to the house.\u201d</p><p>With a smile, Glynis hugged her. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you company then. Would you like to try on one of my dresses now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thirty minutes later, Brynley was dressed in a midnight-blue gown, and her sister had pulled her thick hair back into a loose French braid. The guards escorted them down the staircase.</p><p>A few dozen guests were lingering in the great hall, sipping wine and chatting. They looked so posh and elegant. No one would ever suspect that in a few hours, they would be furry and ripping into dead animals to feast on bloody entrails.</p><p>\u201cDo you see the mural?\u201d Glynis whispered. \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d</p> <p>Brynley spotted the artwork through the crowd. It showed a pack of wolves moving through a forest. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Glynis grinned, then stiffened. \u201cHe\u2019s coming for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Brynley groaned as Rhett moved to the base of the stairs, where he waited for them. He was dressed in a black tuxedo, his shoulder-length dark hair slicked back, his dark eyes watching her intently.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, ladies.\u201d</p><p>His voice did nothing for her. God, how she missed Phineas.</p> <p>When she remained silent, Glynis quickly spoke up. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see you again, Rhett. Thank you for the roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He lifted a hand to Brynley. \u201cWould you take a walk with me outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, Brynley, you should.\u201d Glynis begged her with her eyes. \u201cThe garden is lovely this time of year.\u201d</p><p>The guards crowded around her, so she had nowhere to flee. The guests stopped their chatting to watch. Rhett grabbed her hand and tucked it into his elbow.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d He led her to the front door.</p><p>One of the guards opened it.</p> <p>\u201cI wish to be alone with her,\u201d Rhett murmured to the guard, then escorted her onto the porch.</p><p>\u201cYou must at least pretend to like me.\u201d He squeezed her hand tightly till it hurt. \u201cI will not be embarrassed in front of others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should marry someone who is willing.\u201d</p><p>He led her down the steps to the flagstone path that would take them to the garden on the side of the house. \u201cYou are my choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe you\u2019re worthy of me?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be cooperative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d He squeezed her hand painfully again. \u201cI\u2019ll enjoy forcing you to submit.\u201d</p> <p>Pig. Alpha pig. She pulled her hand from his grip. Her inner wolf growled.</p><p>A door slammed in the driveway, and a young male werewolf ran toward them. \u201cMaster! I need a word with you.\u201d He glanced at Brynley. \u201cIn private.\u201d</p><p>Rhett frowned at him. \u201cIt had better be important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back inside,\u201d Brynley offered, and hurried back up the steps and into the house before Rhett could object.</p><p>She weaved through the guests in the great hall and eased into the parlor. More people mingled there, but she ignored them and rushed across the room, peering out the windows till she could see Rhett and his minion where they\u2019d moved farther down the flagstone path. She raised the window an inch and squatted next to it. Even with her extra-sharp hearing, she had trouble hearing their conversation over the voices in the parlor until Rhett suddenly shouted.</p><p>\u201cKyle is dead?\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Three shots to his chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone, sir. The cabin was empty.\u201d</p><p>Brynley\u2019s breath caught. Yes! Phineas and Jack were all right! They\u2019d escaped. And they would come looking for her.</p><p>The minion kept talking. \u201cWe took Kyle\u2019s body back to your ranch. What do you want us to do with it?\u201d</p><p>Rhett scoffed. \u201cDump it back at his brother\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>The window suddenly clicked shut. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Her father\u2019s clipped voice sounded annoyed.</p><p>Brynley straightened. \u201cEnjoying some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d Caddoc Jones glanced out the window. \u201cCome. The buffet has started.\u201d He took her elbow and steered her toward the dining room. \u201cYou defied me when you ran away. Have you ever known me not to punish a member of my pack for disobedience?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard.</p><p>His grip tightened on her arm. \u201cI will forgo punishment this time under one condition. You will go through with the wedding and marry Rhett Bleddyn.\u201d</p><p>The prison walls were closing in. \u201cMay I join the Hunt tonight?\u201d If she shifted, she could run like hell. The thought of her father\u2019s wolves chasing her down was terrifying, but she was getting desperate enough to take the chance.</p><p>\u201cYou will remain indoors.\u201d He handed her a plate. \u201cEnjoy your evening.\u201d He turned on his heel and left.</p><p>She set the plate back in the stack. She couldn\u2019t eat when she was suffocating. She pivoted, feeling entirely hemmed in by her father\u2019s well-dressed, happy minions.</p><p>She spotted one who looked uncomfortable. He was standing in the corner, quietly eating. Thomas, Trudy\u2019s husband. She\u2019d mentioned he would be here.</p><p>She eased over in his direction. \u201cHey, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cMiss Jones. I didn\u2019t know you had returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was . . . unplanned.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cCorey\u2019s doing great at school.\u201d</p><p>Thomas exhaled with relief, and a brief smile flitted over his face before his guarded expression returned. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say his name here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a cell phone on you?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wary look.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to find a single phone in this entire house. Crazy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Jones, I suggest you do whatever your father tells you to. Excuse me.\u201d He strode from the dining room.</p><p>With a groan, she leaned against the wall. What was she doing? Thomas and Trudy were good people. She shouldn\u2019t get them into trouble. She was just so damned frustrated!</p><p>\u201cOh, there you are!\u201d Glynis rushed toward her, grinning. \u201cGuess what? Dad made special plans for us. He ordered all the latest movie releases. We get to have an all-night marathon in the media room!\u201d</p><p>With a dozen guards outside the door, no doubt. Phineas, please hurry.</p><p>The wedding was in two nights.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>\u201cThis is where you and Brynley grew up?\u201d Phineas asked as he scanned the enormous house. He was with Zoltan and Phil, hidden in the woods behind Caddoc Jones\u2019s ranch house.</p><p>They\u2019d arrived ten minutes earlier, a half hour after sunset. Phil had recalled the number for an old phone in the stable. The elderly werewolf who had answered it had been stunned when they teleported in, but Phineas had quickly erased his memory while Zoltan had communicated with the horses to keep them calm.</p><p>\u201cThis is the main residence,\u201d Phil answered quietly. \u201cThere are two more, one in Idaho and one in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do they start shifting?\u201d Zoltan asked.</p><p>Phil glanced up at the full moon. \u201cSoon.\u201d He motioned for them to follow. \u201cThey\u2019ll shift in the backyard and head straight into these woods. We need to move.\u201d</p><p>They kept to the forest, circling around the north side of the house.</p><p>So far, Phineas had seen only one guard, and he was relaxing in a lawn chair on the back porch. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem too concerned about security.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorted. \u201cWho in their right mind would attack a house full of a hundred werewolves? Most of the guards are inside, making sure the guests don\u2019t attack each other. And they\u2019re probably watching Brynley\u2019s every move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you spot her, even in wolf form, let me know,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cI\u2019ll teleport straight to her and get her out of here.\u201d</p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cI doubt my father will allow her to participate in the Hunt. She\u2019d probably try to run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr she might get hunted down and assaulted,\u201d Phineas muttered.</p><p>Phil stopped with a jerk. \u201cWhat are you saying? Did that happen to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know, would you? You weren\u2019t here for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never answered my letters,\u201d Phil insisted. \u201cNever agreed to escape with me. I thought she must be happy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought wrong!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Zoltan growled. \u201cKeep your voices down or the guards will hear us.\u201d</p><p>Phineas took a deep breath. He was having a hard time dealing with the abuse Brynley had suffered. It was wrong of him, but he was taking it out on her brother.</p><p>\u201cLook at it,\u201d Phil whispered, pointing at the huge mansion. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be willing to leave that behind. I left here with nothing but the clothes on my back. I nearly starved before I ended up a poor college student, living in the basement of Roman\u2019s townhouse and working during the day as a security guard. I asked Brynley to come away with me, but I didn\u2019t push it. I didn\u2019t think I had much to offer.\u201d</p><p>Phineas swallowed hard. He knew that feeling. It was hard to believe Brynley would choose him, a poor Undead guy from the Bronx with an outstanding warrant for his arrest, when she could have luxury and security.</p><p>He followed Phil and Zoltan toward the front of the house. They came to the edge of an asphalt road that led to the circular driveway.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll teleport across.\u201d Zoltan pointed to a wooded area. \u201cLand over there.\u201d He grabbed hold of Phil and vanished.</p><p>Phineas joined them. They were a far distance in front of the house now, but with their superior vision they could still see. However, much of their view was blocked by the SUVs, pickups, and campers parked in the driveway.</p><p>Phineas pointed up. \u201cLet\u2019s get a better view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Phil walked over to a thick pine with sturdy branches. \u201cI used to climb this as a kid.\u201d He leaped and caught hold of the lowest branch. With a grunt, he swung a leg over the branch and straddled it. Holding on to the trunk, he stood, then reached for the next branch.</p><p>Phineas levitated and hovered close by. \u201cGoing up?\u201d</p><p>Phil gave him a wry look. \u201cShow-off.\u201d</p><p>Phineas offered him a hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d When Phil looped an arm around his shoulders, he continued levitating to the top branches of the tree.</p><p>\u201cSlowpokes,\u201d Zoltan murmured from the top of a neighboring tree. He must have teleported.</p><p>Phineas landed on a sturdy branch and surveyed the house and grounds. One guard stood by the front door. The house sprawled along the top of long hill. On the south side, a garden had been planted where the land sloped down to a flat meadow. Beyond that, there were some pens and then the stable.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Phil whispered from a nearby branch. \u201cI should have come here to make sure she was all right. I should have known she couldn\u2019t bear it here any more than I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault,\u201d Phineas mumbled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Phil leaned against the trunk, gazing at the house. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain what the Lycan world is like to an outsider. On the surface, it all seems perfect. Big ranches, beautiful country, strong families, a really close and supportive community. If one of the men in the pack dies, his widow and children are automatically taken care of. If someone\u2019s house or barn burns down, the pack gathers to rebuild it. There\u2019s a strong sense of pride and security\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no freedom,\u201d Phineas muttered.</p><p>Phil sighed. \u201cFor me, the cost of staying was too high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too high for Brynley, too. They\u2019ll force her to marry Bleddyn.\u201d Phineas\u2019s fingers dug into the pine bark. \u201cI saw him slap her in the cabin, and I just lay there, unable to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Phil snarled. \u201cI should kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a swing at him, too, but it looks like Howard wants the honor.\u201d Phineas paused a moment, wondering what the story was there.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your intentions toward my sister?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>That took him by surprise. \u201cI guess it\u2019s obvious I have feelings for her.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI want to be with her if she\u2019ll have me. I\u2019d like to spend my life with her.\u201d</p><p>Phil turned to him with wry look. \u201cYou sure you can handle her?\u201d</p><p>Phineas smiled. \u201cIt would be one hell of a thrill ride finding that out.\u201d He motioned toward the house. \u201cDo you know which window is her bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about teleporting in?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I can find her, I\u2019ll teleport her straight to Romatech, and you two guys can follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably being guarded,\u201d Phil warned him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Zoltan told him. \u201cIf you find her, teleport out. I shall return here for Phil.\u201d</p><p>Phil pointed. \u201cSecond window from the right, upstairs. The curtains are shut.\u201d</p><p>A second later, Phineas materialized in a large, dark bedroom. He pivoted, scanning the room. No one there.</p><p>Zoltan appeared beside him. After a quick look around, he opened a door. \u201cBathroom,\u201d he whispered, and went inside.</p><p>Phineas zipped over to another door and peered inside. A walk-in closet. Mostly empty, except for a row of pretty dresses and some high-heeled shoes. Brynley had obviously taken her casual clothes with her when she\u2019d run away. Something long and white caught his eye, and he ventured closer. Shit. It was a wedding dress in a clear plastic bag. Lots of lace and beads and crap. A lot more expensive than he could ever afford.</p><p>He closed the closet door and surveyed the room. The wrought-iron bed was neatly made up with a blue and green quilt. It didn\u2019t look like it had been slept in. A white box underneath the bed drew his attention. What would she hide beneath her bed? Old photos of her mom or Phil? Memorabilia from happier days? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He dashed over and pulled out the box. Red letters on top read \u201cBig Boy 1000 EXTREME!\u201d He opened it and winced.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Nestled in red velvet was a flesh-colored rubber phallus. He plucked it out.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d It was a big boy. He felt himself shrinking, just looking at the damned thing.</p> <p>\u201cNothing in the bathroom.\u201d Zoltan exited, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Phineas whipped the Big Boy behind his back, but the movement must have hit a button because it suddenly came alive, vibrating and wiggling against his lower back. He arched and shifted his weight, trying to look nonchalant.</p><p>Zoltan peered around the room. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a bee.\u201d He gave Phineas a speculative look. \u201cAre your clothes buzzing?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cBrynley\u2019s not here, so we might as well leave.\u201d</p><p>Zoltan looked him over again, then glanced at the bed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou first. I\u2019ll bring up the\u201d\u2014he winced as the damned thing wiggled against his rear\u2014\u201cuh, rear.\u201d</p><p>Zoltan\u2019s mouth twitched, then he teleported away.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Phineas turned the Big Boy off, then noticed he\u2019d left the box on the bed. Damn, had Zoltan seen it? He stuffed the phallus back into the box, but must have jammed too hard, for it started wiggling again.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d He punched a button, but it merely increased its speed, the tip spiraling in wild circles.</p> <p>Damn! He watched in horror. It was like a whirlybird on steroids! How could a man compete with that? He ripped the balls off it and emptied out the batteries. \u201cDie, you freakin\u2019 dildo, die!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I hear something in there,\u201d a voice said in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cThen check it out,\u201d another voice demanded.</p><p>Phineas tossed the box back under the bed and teleported away.</p><p>He landed back in the tree. \u201cWhew. Safe again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that,\u201d Zoltan muttered from his tree and pointed to the ground.</p><p>\u201cIt arrived right after you guys left,\u201d Phil added.</p><p>Phineas glanced down at the big black bear. It reared up on its hind legs and clawed at the tree, shaking it. Phineas held on tight to the trunk.</p> <p>\u201cI could shift and try to chase it away,\u201d Phil offered. \u201cBut it\u2019s a long way down for me to jump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could try communicating with it mentally,\u201d Zoltan suggested.</p><p>\u201cOr I could just talk to him,\u201d Phineas added dryly. He levitated down a bit. \u201cDigger, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>The bear shifted into a large, naked man. \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d</p><p>Phineas gestured to the yellow dog sitting under a nearby tree with the foil-covered football helmet. \u201cYour sidekick is one of a kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Digger said proudly. \u201cMy Jake is purty special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dog could be in danger once the Hunt begins,\u201d Phil called down.</p><p>Digger narrowed his eyes as he gazed up the tree. \u201cYou a shifter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolf. Philupus Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaddoc\u2019s son? I heard you were dead.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorted. \u201cIs that what they\u2019re saying? I was banished twelve years ago.\u201d</p><p>Digger motioned to Zoltan. \u201cWhat about that one? He has funny eyes. Could be an alien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Zoltan, a vampire like me,\u201d Phineas explained.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Zoltan sounds like an alien planet.\u201d</p><p>Zoltan chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here, Digger?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>\u201cMy truck. I left it about a mile down the road.\u201d</p><p>Phineas tried again. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been thinking about what you said about that bad werewolf, Rhett, that\u2019s trying to force the little lady to marry him, and then I thought maybe I should have a word with Cad about it, see if he could stop that bad fella from pestering his daughter. We used to be friends, Cad and me, about a hundred years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid my father knows about Rhett,\u201d Phil said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s trying to force the wedding, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDagnabbit!\u201d Digger slapped his thigh. \u201cThat ain\u2019t right. I\u2019m telling you, there\u2019s some bad things going on around here. I saw two of them aliens beaming down in the backyard about five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw aliens?\u201d Zoltan asked.</p><p>\u201cA male and a female. They headed over to the stable. Really fast. They ain\u2019t human, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri and Corky? Phineas glanced up at Zoltan. \u201cCan you see them?\u201d</p><p>From the top of his tree, Zoltan surveyed the area. \u201cThey must already be inside. A group of people are gathering in the backyard, starting to strip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting ready for the Hunt,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cDo you see him?\u201d Zoltan pointed. \u201cA man in a tuxedo. He\u2019s headed toward the stable in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>Phineas levitated up to where he could see. \u201cThat\u2019s Rhett Bleddyn. And that looks like Dimitri at the stable door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go hear what they have to say,\u201d Zoltan suggested.</p><p>\u201cAn alien powwow. I\u2019ll meet you over there.\u201d Digger and Jake trotted through the woods toward the stable.</p><p>Phineas, Phil, and Zoltan materialized at the back of the stable, then teleported into the hayloft.</p><p>Two voices were speaking below: Corky and Rhett. Corky was screaming so loud the horses were growing agitated.</p><p>Zoltan closed his eyes and mouthed some words.</p><p>Phineas gave him a questioning look, but when the horses settled down, he realized what Zoltan had been doing. He eased forward on his stomach to peek over the edge.</p><p>\u201cIt was terrible!\u201d Corky shouted. \u201cDimitri and I barely escaped!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d Rhett told her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was those wretched MacKay men! They attacked us! The vampires had swords and guns, and there was a huge bear and a tiger!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had shifters with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! And they were ripping your werewolves into dog food. Dimitri and I barely made it out in time.\u201d</p><p>Rhett stiffened. \u201cYou\u2019re saying my men lost?\u201d</p><p>Corky waved a dismissive hand. \u201cThey were falling like flies. I\u2019ve never seen such a bunch of useless\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy men lost?\u201d Rhett shouted.</p><p>\u201cYes! Have you been listening?\u201d Corky screeched. \u201cThose bloody MacKay bastards took over your ranch. Now where on earth am I supposed to do my death-sleep?\u201d</p><p>Rhett dragged a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019ll find a place for you here.\u201d</p><p>Corky huffed. \u201cLet\u2019s just go back to Alaska. You have plenty of land there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need more!\u201d Rhett\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cI need more wolves. I need more power. And I\u2019m so damned close. I\u2019ll get more men down here quick. The wedding is in two nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to marry that bitch!\u201d Corky screamed. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a grip, Corky,\u201d he hissed. \u201cIt\u2019s just a damned formality so the land can transfer to me legally. Once I\u2019m married to the Jones girl, we\u2019ll kill her and the entire family. Then I\u2019ll inherit it all.\u201d</p><p>Phineas flinched and exchanged a look with Phil.</p><p>\u201cJust two more days.\u201d Rhett pulled Corky into his arms. \u201cWe\u2019ll have it all. I\u2019ll have thousands of pack members in four states following my every command.\u201d</p><p>Corky wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have the governors under my control.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri yelped and ran toward them. \u201cThere\u2019s a bear charging toward us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuick!\u201d Rhett ordered. \u201cTake me to the house.\u201d</p><p>They vanished just as Digger loped into the stable, followed by Jake. The horses went crazy, rearing up and kicking at their stalls.</p><p>\u201cCalm yourselves,\u201d Zoltan told them. \u201cIt will not harm you.\u201d</p><p>The bear shifted, and the horses returned to normal.</p><p>Phineas jumped down to the ground. \u201cDammit, Digger!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He scratched at his beard. \u201cAm I too late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scared them off,\u201d Phineas muttered. \u201cWe missed a chance to capture them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr kill them,\u201d Phil added.</p><p>\u201cAt least now we know exactly what they\u2019re planning,\u201d Zoltan said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they planning?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>\u201cA wedding,\u201d Phineas muttered. \u201cFollowed by mass murder.\u201d</p><p>The bastards were planning to kill his Brynley.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>\u201cAny sign of Brynley?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Digger was sitting on the roof of the stable, hidden behind a turret capped with a large weathervane. Wrapped in a dark horse blanket, he surveyed the surrounding area. His dog, Jake, was safe inside with the horses.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t seen hide nor hair of her.\u201d Digger chuckled. \u201cYou get it? She could have skin or fur.\u201d</p><p>Phineas groaned inwardly. \u201cI\u2019ll check back with you later. Thanks.\u201d He teleported to the front of the house, where Phil was stationed in a tree.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen her,\u201d Phil muttered.</p><p>Phineas sighed. They\u2019d been watching the house for five hours. \u201cYou\u2019d think she\u2019d at least look out a damned window.\u201d</p><p>There was plenty to look at. Werewolves were shifting back and forth, dragging back carcasses, cutting them up, and roasting them. Some of the guests had opted to remain human tonight so they could party at the house. They were drinking beer on the patio, making out in the garden. He\u2019d spotted a few making love in the woods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check on you later,\u201d he told Phil, then teleported to his station at the back of the house. He sat on a branch high up in a tree and scanned all the people once again, searching for Brynley.</p><p>Zoltan had teleported to the Carson ranch to report on what they\u2019d heard in the stable. Meanwhile, Phineas, Phil, and Digger kept watch. No sign of Corky or Dimitri. They were either inside the house, or they\u2019d teleported elsewhere. Rhett had taken off with a group of his minions in an SUV.</p><p>No sign of Brynley. What the hell was she doing in there? She didn\u2019t seem to be using her bedroom. Did her father have her locked up in a prison cell? Was she miserable? Or did she have her Big Boy 1000 EXTREME to keep her company?</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>She probably never used it. After all, she\u2019d left it behind when she ran away from home. And why should he worry if she did use it? It was better than jumping any of these werewolves who strutted around naked, covered with blood and grime.</p><p>He shifted on the branch. The sun would rise in less than an hour. He\u2019d have to leave to do his death-sleep. His cell phone vibrated, not nearly as good as the Big Boy 1000 EXTREME, and he checked his text message. Zoltan was back, and he\u2019d landed by the stable.</p><p>Phineas teleported over to Phil, picked him up, then materialized by the stable. They all sat out of view of the house, on the back side of the roof, close to Digger.</p><p>\u201cThe cabin has been quiet,\u201d Zoltan told them. \u201cNo action there. Angus and his team defeated all the werewolves at Bleddyn\u2019s ranch. Robby\u2019s got a team there, keeping it secure. I told Angus that we saw Corky and Dimitri here, along with Bleddyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Angus want us to do?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll send us more men tomorrow night,\u201d Zoltan said, \u201cbut he doesn\u2019t want us to attack. We would end up killing Caddoc Jones\u2019s pack members, and we don\u2019t want to weaken his forces in case Bleddyn attacks him and his family.\u201d</p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cThis could escalate into a werewolf war, pack against pack. I need to get my brother and sisters out of here.\u201d</p><p>How? Phineas wondered. He was tempted to walk up to the house, ring the front doorbell, and tell Caddoc Jones that he and his family were about to be slaughtered.</p><p>\u201cIf we see Corky or Dimitri, we\u2019re supposed to grab them and teleport them straight to the Carson ranch. Angus has some silver chains and handcuffs there.\u201d Zoltan took a deep breath. \u201cAnd of course, if you see Brynley, you can grab her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we see her,\u201d Phineas grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWe have thirty minutes left here,\u201d Zoltan continued. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go to the Carson ranch for our death-sleep.\u201d</p><p>Phineas groaned. He\u2019d have to wait another night to rescue Brynley.</p><p>The next evening, Brynley forced herself to eat some of the buffet. It tasted like dry chalk in her mouth, but she needed to keep her strength up. She\u2019d been awake for only two hours, but she was already stressed out.</p><p>First, her guards had escorted her to her bedroom so she could try on the wedding dress. After all, the wedding was tomorrow. She nearly choked on the deer meat she was chewing and drank half a glass of wine to fortify her nerves.</p><p>A female werewolf/seamstress had marked a few areas she wanted to alter, then Brynley had been escorted to a small office being used by her wedding planner. She hadn\u2019t even known she had a wedding planner. But it wasn\u2019t that surprising, really. Her father was not the sort to fool with mundane details. He commanded others to do it.</p><p>Since the wedding was happening so quickly, the invitations were merely passed out among the guests who were already there. Tonight was the third night of the full moon, and normally the last night of the monthly party, but the guests would simply stay one more night to witness the wedding.</p><p>She swallowed another bite of deer meat. It was all a farce, really. The wedding planner had acted like she wanted Brynley\u2019s approval of the dinner menu and flower arrangements, but it was all going to happen whether she liked it or not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Much to her sister\u2019s dismay, she\u2019d managed one small act of rebellion. She\u2019d gone downstairs to eat dinner in her jeans, plaid shirt, and cowboy boots.</p><p>She glanced at the window. The sun was going down. The guards made sure now that she didn\u2019t get close to a window. Her father\u2019s orders, no doubt, after he\u2019d caught her eavesdropping on Rhett.</p><p>She scanned the dining room and counted three guards. There was no escaping them. At least she hadn\u2019t been forced to endure Rhett\u2019s company today.</p> <p>She groaned. Speak of the devil. He strode into the room, dressed in his tuxedo, wearing a white silk scarf around his shoulders and an obnoxious smirk on his face.</p><p>He stopped in front of her. \u201cI have a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou have dog mange?\u201d</p><p>Nearby guests chuckled, and his smirk twisted with anger.</p><p>He seized her arm. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p> <p>As he dragged her from the dining room, she glanced back and saw the guards following. Would they defend her if she was attacked, or stand by and applaud?</p><p>Rhett pushed her out the back door, making her stumble forward onto the empty patio. He grabbed her once again and pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cYou will show me respect in public,\u201d he growled softly.</p><p>\u201cThen I can be rude in private?\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened painfully on her arms, and she winced. There would be bruises tomorrow. How fortunate her wedding dress had long sleeves.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know what we\u2019ll do in private,\u201d he hissed. He whipped the white silk scarf off his shoulders and spun her around.</p> <p>She lunged forward to escape, but the three guards blocked her. Suddenly, the silk scarf covered her eyes. She gasped and felt a tug at the back of her head. The scarf had been knotted.</p><p>She reached up to pull the scarf down but her hands were grabbed by a pair of tight fists.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d Rhett pulled her forward.</p><p>Her heart raced. She heard the guards following behind, but she doubted they would help her. \u201cWhat are you doing? If you harm me, my father will kill you.\u201d</p><p>Rhett chuckled. \u201cHarm you? I plan to marry you, you nitwit. Now two steps down.\u201d He held on to her hands and guided her into the backyard.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI told you. I have a surprise for you.\u201d Rhett wrapped an arm around her shoulder and steered her to the left. \u201cIt took all night and all day for me and my men to pull off this feat. You\u2019ll be very impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you all managed to castrate yourselves,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cI like the way you resist. It will make your final submission so much sweeter.\u201d</p><p>The air was chilly against her cheeks. The temperature was dropping, a sure sign that the sun had set. Would Phineas come looking for her?</p><p>She strained her ears and could hear the soft thud of footsteps behind her. The guards were still following. Up ahead, she heard voices. Something about ropes? Tying something down? She swallowed hard.</p><p>Images of her last assault flitted through her mind, and her heart thundered in her ears. No! She pushed the memories aside. She wouldn\u2019t panic. She would be brave.</p><p>Rhett stopped her and placed her hands on a horizontal wooden beam. It was the horse pen. She dug her fingers into the wood.</p><p>Rhett whispered, his mouth close to the white silk covering her ear. \u201cYour sister told me what you admired the most in the world. I\u2019m giving it to you as a sign of my devotion.\u201d</p><p>He whipped the scarf off her head, and she gasped.</p><p>Her heart lurched, and tears instantly sprang to her eyes.</p><p>The wild white stallion was imprisoned inside the pen. It pawed the ground furiously. Its eyes rolled about in fear and rage. Three ropes had been tied around its neck and secured to the fenced enclosure. The horse strained to move, its neck already red with welts as the ropes cut into its white coat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting him,\u201d she whispered. You\u2019re killing him. You\u2019re killing me. She could almost feel the ropes around her own neck, squeezing tighter and tighter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to contain him,\u201d Rhett said. \u201cDamned horse put up quite a fight.\u201d</p><p>She noted the dried blood on the horse\u2019s flank. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>Rhett scoffed. \u201cAre you kidding? Do you know how much trouble we\u2014\u201d He looked at her. \u201cAre you crying?\u201d</p><p>She wiped the tears off her face, and jutted out her chin. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>He leaned on the fence, studying her. \u201cI\u2019ll let him go if you\u2019ll be my willing bride.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat as it plummeted into her stomach. A feeling of doom sucked her down. Submission, the way of the Lycan world.</p><p>She gazed at the wild white stallion, and more tears stung her eyes. If she agreed, at least one of them would be free.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Phineas nearly fell out of the tree when he teleported there. Was that Brynley? Blindfolded? Rhett Bleddyn was leading her across the backyard. Three guards followed close behind. They appeared to be headed toward the stable.</p><p>Maybe he could teleport to her and grab her before Rhett or the three guards reacted. Might be difficult since Rhett had an arm around her. He needed backup.</p><p>After waking in Nate Carson\u2019s basement, he\u2019d been so anxious to return here and watch for Brynley that he\u2019d guzzled down a bottle and teleported straight here with Phil. He\u2019d left the werewolf in his favorite tree in the front. Zoltan and Jack were supposed to follow.</p><p>He texted a message to Zoltan. Go to stable roof now!</p><p>He pocketed the cell phone and glanced at Brynley. Rhett had taken her to the horse pen.</p><p>His breath caught. Gleaming white under the full moon, the wild white stallion strained at its ropes.</p><p>Shock quickly gave way to anger. The bastards. They\u2019d found the perfect way to hurt Brynley. This was no slap on the face. It was a wound inflicted upon her soul.</p><p>He teleported to Phil, and before Phil could ask a question, he\u2019d landed the two of them on the stable roof.</p><p>Zoltan materialized with Jack.</p><p>Phineas pointed toward the horse pen and whispered, \u201cBrynley.\u201d As he stretched out on his stomach to peer over the ridge of the roof, the others did the same.</p><p>Phil hissed in a breath. \u201cBastards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo get her.\u201d Zoltan nudged Phineas with his elbow. \u201cJack and I will keep the guards busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cI want you and Jack to teleport into the pen. You\u2019ll use your mojo to calm down the stallion while Jack cuts the ropes. Then you teleport the horse out. While you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe horse is too heavy,\u201d Zoltan interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it together.\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head. \u201cWe could end up ripping it in two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen connect your minds so you\u2019ll land together at the cabin. You can do it. And while they\u2019re freaking out over the horse, I\u2019ll swoop in and grab Brynley. We\u2019ll all meet at the cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept me,\u201d Phil muttered. \u201cBut you guys go ahead. Have all the fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, dude,\u201d Phineas said.</p><p>Phil snorted. \u201cI was kidding. I want you to get Bryn out. I\u2019ll stay here. I\u2019m worried about the rest of my family, too.\u201d</p><p>Phineas removed the knife from his boot and handed it to Jack. \u201cCan you do it?\u201d</p><p>He accepted the knife. \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy idea, but I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Zoltan asked. \u201cOn the count of three. One, two, three.\u201d</p><p>Jack and Zoltan teleported. Jack zoomed around the horse at vampire speed, cutting the three ropes, while Zoltan faced the horse. The stallion grew still.</p><p>Rhett\u2019s men hollered and jumped into the pen. Rhett let go of Brynley and shouted orders to his men, and her guards moved aside to watch.</p><p>Phineas teleported beside her and grabbed her. She gasped, looking at him in shock. He had a glimpse of Zoltan and Jack vanishing with the horse, then he teleported, taking Brynley with him.</p><p>They landed inside the cabin.</p><p>\u201cPhineas!\u201d She threw her arms around him and laughed.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI got you. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back, beaming at him, then her expression morphed into panic. \u201cThe wild white stallion! We have to rescue him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re torturing him!\u201d Her eyes glinted with tears. \u201cWe have to save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You can\u2019t bear to be free if he\u2019s not free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d He led her onto the front porch.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>The stallion reared up on its hind legs. Jack and Zoltan jumped back.</p><p>\u201cYou saved him,\u201d she whispered. She pressed a hand against her chest, then turned to Phineas. A tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cYou saved him.\u201d</p><p>With a smile, he brushed the tear away. \u201cI know how you feel about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Zoltan murmured to the horse. \u201cCalm down. Let us get the ropes off you.\u201d</p><p>The stallion pawed at the ground, then went still.</p><p>Jack approached slowly, then slid his knife under the ropes and cut through.</p><p>The ropes fell to the ground, and the stallion tossed its head.</p><p>Brynley\u2019s gaze shifted back to Phineas, and more tears glimmered in her eyes. \u201cYou saved me. You saved the stallion. You beautiful, beautiful man.\u201d</p><p>Zoltan exchanged a look with Jack. \u201cI thought we did all the work.\u201d</p><p>Phineas kissed her brow. \u201cAs long as I live, I\u2019ll fight anyone who tries to capture the wild horse. And I\u2019ll never let anyone destroy your beautiful wild spirit.\u201d</p><p>With a choked sob, she threw her arms around him. \u201cI love you. I was so afraid I\u2019d never get the chance to tell you.\u201d She placed her hands on his cheeks. \u201cI really do love you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and swung her around in a circle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to feel a bit unnecessary again,\u201d Jack muttered.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Casanova.\u201d Zoltan motioned for him to follow. \u201cWe have another job to do.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the stable.</p><p>\u201cAlone at last.\u201d Phineas kissed Brynley, and she laughed against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNot entirely.\u201d She motioned with her head toward the wild white stallion. It was regarding them curiously.</p><p>\u201cPeeping Tom.\u201d Phineas pulled Brynley close. \u201cGet your own girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can be arranged.\u201d Zoltan led Molly from the stable. \u201cGo on, girl. Get your man.\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cNothing like amore.\u201d</p><p>Molly shook her head and snorted. The wild stallion reared up, then trotted toward her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re necking,\u201d Brynley whispered.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Phineas nuzzled her neck.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d She kissed his cheek and rubbed a hand over his chest. \u201cI want to kiss you all over. Now.\u201d</p><p>His vision turned pink.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Zoltan?\u201d Jack said in a loud voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice evening. Shall we stand guard for a little while? About five minutes?\u201d</p><p>Zoltan snorted. \u201cTen at least. He is the Love Doctor, after all.\u201d</p><p>Phineas teleported Brynley down into the basement.</p><p>Brynley ripped his shirt open. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>It felt as if all the frustration and anger and fear she\u2019d endured over the last few days had been poured into a hot cauldron, and it was now bubbling over to make her frantic. She attacked his belt with trembling fingers.</p><p>\u201cI was so worried about you.\u201d He unbuttoned her shirt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it.\u201d She unzipped his jeans and pulled them down. She\u2019d come so close to being forced into a marriage with a man she despised, forced into a life of submission that would have killed her slowly and painfully, choking her, humiliating her, diminishing her until there was nothing left of her.</p><p>She had to live. She had to be free. Inside, her wolf howled with joy.</p><p>She shoved Phineas back onto the bed and yanked his boots off.</p><p>He sat up. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She pulled off his jeans and underwear.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThey didn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to talk about how desperate and helpless she\u2019d felt. She wanted to feel strong. In control. Empowered. She shoved him back and straddled him. \u201cLet me do this. I need to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever the hell I feel like.\u201d Her heart swelled when his eyes turned red. No wonder she loved him. He loved her when she was strong.</p><p>She leaned forward to kiss him, to explore him with her tongue. His hands slipped inside her open shirt, and he kneaded her breasts, then unclasped her bra.</p><p>She sat up, flung her shirt and bra aside, then leaned down again to rub herself against him.</p><p>He tossed her onto her back and with vampire speed, he removed her boots, jeans, and underwear. When he climbed on top of her, she laughed and pushed him onto his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in charge,\u201d she told him, and smoothed a hand down his chest.</p><p>He attempted to sit up. \u201cYou think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d She pushed him back down.</p><p>His mouth twitched. \u201cYou think I\u2019m a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re mine.\u201d She curled a hand around his erection. \u201cAll mine.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glowed a rich bloodred.</p><p>She leaned over to tease him with her tongue. Yes. She was in charge. Full of power. Bursting with freedom. She took him into her mouth and delighted at the moans she wrenched from him. Moisture pooled between her legs.</p><p>She glanced up at him and smiled. \u201cShall I take you now? Ride you like a cowboy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled back. \u201cWill you be gentle with me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, she straddled him and eased him inside her. His thick shaft slid into her wetness. Sweet. She started off slow, reveling in the slow, sweet slide when she lifted up, the grounding of their bodies when she slipped down.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d He caressed her breasts and tweaked her hardened nipples.</p><p>With a moan, she increased her speed. His hands smoothed down to grasp her hips, and soon he was pulling her harder. She rode him faster and faster.</p><p>With a shout, he arched and pumped into her. Stars shattered before her eyes. With a keening cry, she climaxed, then fell forward onto his chest, her body shuddering with spasms.</p><p>He held her tight. \u201cBrynley, I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. \u201cI was so afraid I\u2019d never see you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was scared, too.\u201d He rubbed her back. \u201cI sat outside for hours last night, hoping to catch a glimpse of you so I could rescue you. Your brother Phil was there, too. And Digger and Zoltan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDigger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He doesn\u2019t want you forced into a marriage against your will.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cIt was awful. Tonight I had to try on my wedding dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw that wedding dress,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI was tempted to rip it to shreds.\u201d</p><p>She sat up. \u201cYou saw it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Phil pointed out which window was your bedroom, and Zoltan and I teleported in, hoping to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was sweet of you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wry look. \u201cI have my uses.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she caressed his chest. \u201cI love your uses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can go all night long.\u201d</p><p>Her hand slipped down to his penis and tugged gently. \u201cCan you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t even need batteries.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cBatteries?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. For a night of extreme sex.\u201d</p><p>She let go of him. \u201cYou were in my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnooping under my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the box might contain photos of your dear mother or maybe a dried corsage from your high school prom, but no. It was the Big Boy 1000 EXTREME.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cIt was a gag gift from college. When I broke up with Seth, my girlfriends claimed they had found a new boyfriend for me. It was just a silly joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, ten years later, it\u2019s still close to your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I never used it. I\u2019ve always been wary of getting involved when the guys are more interested in gaining my father\u2019s favor than mine.\u201d She gave him a wry look. \u201cWhy does it bother you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the end of my dick doesn\u2019t whirl around at warp speed.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and kissed his cheek. \u201cYou have nothing to worry about. You\u2019re the Big Man 10,000 Mega-Extreme.\u201d She kissed his brow. \u201cYou\u2019re the Love Doctor, the Blardonnay Guy, and the love of my life.\u201d</p><p>He patted her rump. \u201cThat\u2019s right, woman. Don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She nipped at his ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna rewrite your vows. You\u2019ll have to promise to be faithful, forsaking all others, including the Big Boy 1000 EXTREME.\u201d</p><p>She sat back with a gasp.</p><p>He winced. \u201cYou like it that much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just ask me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cYou . . . don\u2019t want to? I realize I\u2019m not much of a catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. It just seems kind of fast. I mean, we could live together for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s fast, but I don\u2019t think your father is going to give up on trying to marry you off. If we make it legal, then it should give you some protection.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cIs that why you want to marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s just me trying to convince you. What I really want is to spend the rest of my life giving you the love you deserve.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and touched his cheek.</p><p>There was a knock on the trapdoor.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt,\u201d Jack called down. \u201cBut Angus wants everyone at the Carson ranch for a meeting. I\u2019m going to collect Phil and take him there. Meeting starts in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later. We\u2019d better get cleaned up.\u201d He nudged her toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cNate! Look at you.\u201d Brynley left Phineas at the door and ran into the foyer to give Nate Carson a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re walking! And you\u2019re . . .\u201d She stopped herself from saying dead. \u201cYou\u2019re a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I was changed the same night you were kidnapped.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnd Kyle died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>He patted her on the back. \u201cAt least we have you back safe and sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, dude.\u201d Phineas gave Nate a knuckle pound. \u201cHeard you were kicking ass over at the Bleddyn ranch.\u201d</p><p>Nate smiled. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d fight alongside a bear and a tiger.\u201d</p><p>Brynley looked around the foyer of Nate\u2019s home. Swords were stacked against one wall, and a table was loaded down with ammunition. MacKay employees teleported in with cases of synthetic blood. Jack\u2019s wife, Lara, was checking things off a clipboard. Apparently, she\u2019d been given the job of supply manager for their new base of operations. \u201cWow, your place has become Vampire Central.\u201d</p><p>Nate nodded. \u201cMy life has gotten a whole lot more interesting.\u201d</p><p>Jack teleported in with Phil.</p><p>\u201cBryn!\u201d Phil jogged over and gave her a hug. \u201cThank God you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThey rescued the wild white stallion, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He pulled her aside. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He looked around the foyer, then dragged a hand through his shaggy hair. \u201cWell, the thing is, I . . . owe you an apology. I should have come back to the house years ago to see if you were all right. I just assumed you weren\u2019t interested in leaving when you didn\u2019t answer my letters and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her heart froze for a second. \u201cLetters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I saw the letters you left at the cabin, so I wrote some back, telling you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wrote me?\u201d Her blood chilled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, several times. I asked if you wanted to come\u2014\u201d He stopped when a strangled noise escaped her mouth. \u201cOh, shit. You never got them, did you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Tears came to her eyes. \u201cI\u2014I thought you\u2019d abandoned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, no, Brynley.\u201d He pulled her into his arms. \u201cShit! No wonder you were so mad at me.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cYou wrote to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back. \u201cFather must have been watching the cabin. He took your letters away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt he did it personally. He probably had one of his minions doing it.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cHe must have been afraid I would run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did, eventually.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cOh my God, if he was having the cabin watched, he must have known about the Lost Boys.\u201d</p><p>Phil winced. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. Nothing much happens in his territory that he doesn\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t stop me.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that seem odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d Phineas joined them. \u201cThe meeting is starting.\u201d</p><p>They filed into Nate\u2019s large parlor that had been filled with extra chairs from the dining room. Everyone sat as Angus took a position in front of the stone fireplace.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing well,\u201d Angus began. \u201cLast night, we defeated a pack of werewolves and took over the Bleddyn ranch. And tonight, we have successfully rescued Brynley Jones.\u201d</p><p>Everyone gave her a cheer, and she grinned at Phineas.</p><p>Angus clasped his hands behind his back. \u201cWe still have some unfinished business. Corky and Dimitri remain free. We believe they are hiding at the Jones ranch. Rhett Bleddyn is there, too. Even though it appears his wedding tomorrow will be canceled, he is still a potential threat since he had planned to murder Brynley and her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brynley squealed.</p><p>Phineas patted her knee. \u201cI was going to tell you about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was going to kill us?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Phineas nodded. \u201cYeah. So he could inherit all your father\u2019s land and wealth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd take over the wolf packs,\u201d Phil added.</p><p>\u201cWe canna assume he\u2019ll give up on the plan,\u201d Angus said. \u201cAs long as he\u2019s anywhere near yer father\u2019s house, I believe yer family is in danger.\u201d</p><p>Brynley jumped to her feet. \u201cHe might force Glynis to marry him. We have to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Phil stood. \u201cI\u2019ll tell my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could get ugly,\u201d Angus warned him. \u201cWe\u2019ll go with you. Do ye want to leave now?\u201d</p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cWe should wait till tomorrow. This is the third night of the full moon. All the werewolves will be capable of shifting. If we go tomorrow night, they can\u2019t shift to attack us. They\u2019ll lose their advantage.\u201d</p><p>Angus nodded. \u201cTomorrow night, then.\u201d</p><p>Brynley took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m going, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Phineas jumped to his feet. \u201cWe just got you out of there. You\u2019re not going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine as long as everyone else is there.\u201d She turned to him and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019ve helped me see how strong I can be. I can do this.\u201d She squared her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not running away from my father anymore. It\u2019s time I stood up to him.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d Phil asked her the following night.</p><p>Brynley was in the kitchen at Nate\u2019s house, enjoying a bowl of ice cream with her brother before the night\u2019s big event.</p><p>She swallowed her last bite. \u201cI\u2019ve always run away. To college, to the rodeo, to the academy. I can\u2019t do it anymore. My inner wolf is rebelling and insists I stand up for myself. I\u2019ll never be completely free until I get over my fear of our father.\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you. But be careful. Stick close to me or Phineas.\u201d He put their empty bowls in the sink. \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s hitch a ride to the ranch.\u201d</p><p>She accompanied her brother into the foyer, where Angus and his men were arming themselves with swords and pistols.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want a weapon?\u201d Phineas asked.</p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cIt would just be confiscated. The guards won\u2019t let us near our father if we\u2019re armed.\u201d</p><p>Phineas gave Brynley a worried look. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I want to stand up to him, not kill him.\u201d</p><p>Phineas pulled her close. \u201cI hate to let you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Remember how strong I am?\u201d She smiled as she wrapped her arms around his neck. Nate had assigned her a bedroom upstairs, and she\u2019d managed to pin Phineas down on the mattress a few times. Their wrestling match had gone on until the rising sun had forced him to go to the basement with the other Vamps for their death-sleep.</p><p>After a long day\u2019s sleep, she was ready to face the dragon tonight. Caddoc Jones. Angus and his employees were hoping to capture Corky and Dimitri. And if Rhett Bleddyn died in battle, no one was going to mourn his passing.</p><p>Jack teleported first to position himself in the woods behind the house. Then he called, and Lara put him on the speakerphone. She waved and wished everyone good luck as they vanished.</p><p>As soon as they materialized, Angus led the small group to the edge of the backyard. The guard, who\u2019d been relaxing in a patio chair, jumped to his feet and pounded on the back door, shouting.</p><p>Within seconds, more guards appeared. Then a group of young male werewolves. Brynley spotted her brother Howell. Then Caddoc Jones strode to the edge of the patio and regarded them with a haughty glare.</p><p>\u201cA motley group of bloodsuckers and shifters,\u201d he muttered, then raised his voice. \u201cIs there a reason for this invasion of my property? Or shall I consider this a declaration of war?\u201d</p><p>Angus stepped forward. \u201cYou can consider us a peacekeeping force.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc snorted. \u201cDo you see a war around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it some time,\u201d Angus answered dryly. \u201cYour son and daughter have come to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc\u2019s mouth thinned. \u201cI have but one son, and he\u2019s here.\u201d He motioned to Howell, and whispered something to him.</p><p>Howell nodded, then stepped off the patio and walked toward them with two guards.</p><p>\u201cCan you do your talk here in the yard?\u201d Phineas asked. \u201cWhere I can keep an eye on you?\u201d</p><p>Brynley shook her head. \u201cIf our father talks to us, it will have to be in private. He can\u2019t be seen in public talking to Phil. He banished him, so he can\u2019t acknowledge his existence.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s why he sent our brother out to talk to us.\u201d He took hold of her elbow. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Phineas whispered.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She squeezed his hand, then walked with Phil across the yard. They stopped halfway to the patio.</p><p>Howell halted about ten feet away, the guards behind him. He ignored Phil and focused on Brynley. \u201cI see you\u2019ve returned in time for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCall Rhett and tell him his bride is here!\u201d Howell yelled back at the guards on the patio.</p><p>Brynley gritted her teeth. \u201cI am not marrying him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d Howell glared at her. \u201cThe Supreme Pack Master commands it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Phil said calmly.</p><p>Howell glanced at him. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the crap. I\u2019m here to talk to our father.\u201d</p><p>Howell snorted. \u201cThe prodigal son returns. Don\u2019t think you can weasel your way back into the inheritance. It\u2019s mine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Howie. Does that mean you\u2019ve gone Alpha?\u201d Phil flicked some dust off his shoulder, and his hand flashed into a wolf\u2019s paw, then back to human.</p> <p>Murmurs of amazement rushed over the crowd standing on the patio. Phil had performed a difficult partial shift with incredible ease. Only an extremely powerful Alpha could manage such a feat.</p><p>Howell stepped back, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI will speak to my daughter,\u201d Caddoc Jones announced. \u201cShe may bring her escort.\u201d He turned on his heel and walked back into the house.</p><p>Phil gave Brynley an amused look. \u201cThat got his attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she agreed, \u201cbut you still don\u2019t have a name.\u201d</p><p>Howell jutted his chin forward, his mouth thin with anger. \u201cThis way.\u201d He strode back to the patio with the guards.</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Phil said dryly. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten where the back door is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehave,\u201d Brynley warned him as they walked. \u201cWe\u2019re going into the lion\u2019s den.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr wolf\u2019s den,\u201d he murmured back. \u201cI hear they sometimes eat their young.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an annoyed look. \u201cThat\u2019s not boosting my confidence.\u201d</p><p>Howell led them into the house and straight into her father\u2019s office.</p><p>Caddoc Jones was waiting for them, leaning against his desk. He waved a dismissive hand. \u201cYou may go, Howell.\u201d</p><p>Howell\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d He stopped when his father glared at him.</p><p>\u201cBetter learn to submit,\u201d Phil whispered to him. \u201cIt\u2019s the price of the inheritance.\u201d</p> <p>Howell\u2019s eyes flashed with anger, then he strode from the room and slammed the door behind him.</p><p>Caddoc glanced at Brynley, expressionless, then focused on Phil. \u201cThen it\u2019s true. You achieved Alpha status on your own without instruction from the Council of Elders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I was on my own. You banished me.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc snorted. \u201cYou fool. You were supposed to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my tail between my legs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have taken you back. You\u2019re worth ten of your brother.\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cYour loss then.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc lunged forward, his hand fisted. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t so damned impressive, I would kill you.\u201d</p><p>Brynley winced. So much for the welcome home. She glanced at her brother. He was standing stiffly, his chin lifted, his face calm, but she knew he had to be hurting inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you two?\u201d Caddoc paced across the floor. \u201cNo creature on this earth is more gloriously alive than a werewolf. But you insist on betraying your own kind to hang out with a bunch of bloodsuckers. They\u2019re fucking dead half the time. It\u2019s an abomination to consort with them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d He pointed at Phil. \u201cYou married one. And you\u201d\u2014he sneered at Brynley \u2014\u201cyou\u2019re screwing one of them. Oh, don\u2019t look surprised. I know everything you do. I just hope you got it out of your system. We\u2019ll do your wedding as soon as Rhett arrives. He\u2019s staying in one of the guesthouses down the road.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. This was it. Time to stand up for herself. Her inner wolf bristled. \u201cI refuse to marry Rhett.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYou have to call the wedding off,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve come back here to give me orders?\u201d Caddoc asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cRhett intends to kill Brynley and the entire family as soon as the wedding is over,\u201d Phil explained. \u201cHe wants all your land, wealth, and pack members.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc gave him a bland look, then shook his head. \u201cYou have never truly appreciated me. It\u2019s so annoying.\u201d He walked over to the desk and perched on the corner.</p><p>Brynley exchanged a questioning look with her brother.</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHe knows.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc shrugged. \u201cOf course I know. But two can play at this game. Once the wedding is over, we kill Rhett. He has no heirs, so all his land and wolf packs in Alaska go to his new bride. Well, me, actually, since only an Alpha can be the master of a pack.\u201d</p><p>A queasy feeling stirred in Brynley\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou were using me. I\u2019ve never been more than a pawn to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try that indignant crap on me,\u201d her father snarled. \u201cYou would come out ahead. You\u2019d have a dozen houses in Alaska and more money than you could ever spend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would only have to kill someone to get it. Gee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to do the killing.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cOh, I feel so much better now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you smart-mouthing me?\u201d Her father stepped toward her, his fists clenched.</p><p>She lifted her chin. Phil moved closer.</p><p>A knock sounded on the door.</p><p>Caddoc took a deep breath and flexed his hands. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Howell cracked the door and gave them a nervous look. \u201cRhett has arrived for the wedding. He\u2019s waiting in the backyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Caddoc grabbed Brynley\u2019s arm and dragged her forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not marrying him.\u201d She pulled her arm away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have any choice,\u201d Howell said. \u201cHe\u2019s brought fifty men with him. And they\u2019re all armed.\u201d</p><p>Phil whistled. \u201cLooks like Angus was right about that war.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>\u201cHere they come.\u201d Phineas watched as Rhett Bleddyn and his small army approached the south side of the backyard.</p><p>\u201cLooks like he brought in more men from Alaska,\u201d Jack observed.</p><p>Phineas scanned the group of fifty young males, noting their weapon of choice\u2014hunting knives. Apparently, werewolves liked their battles bloody. Corky and Dimitri were keeping close to Rhett, and the three were heavily surrounded. No room to teleport in and snatch the vampires. Although if things got out of hand, Rhett was probably keeping them close by as an easy escape route.</p><p>On the north side of the backyard, Caddoc Jones\u2019s pack members were gathering. The nearly full moon glinted off their knife blades.</p><p>A low growl in the woods behind them made Phineas whip around. It was Howard, hidden behind a tree, glaring at Rhett. Angus had asked the shifters, Howard and Rajiv, to patrol the woods in case the werewolves attempted an attack from behind. Carlos Panterra had been given paternity leave, so he was still at the academy with his wife and their newborn twins.</p><p>Howard\u2019s nostrils flared, and he walked away, pulling a knife from his sheath.</p><p>When the scent of skunk wafted toward him, Phineas knew what had alarmed Howard. He hurried into the woods and found Howard pointing his knife at Digger.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there, pardner.\u201d Digger lifted his hands. \u201cI just came to meet you. Caught a whiff of your scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Howard growled.</p><p>\u201cThis is Digger,\u201d Phineas introduced him. \u201cAnd his dog, Jake, should be around somewhere.\u201d He spotted Jake half hidden behind some bushes.</p><p>Digger nodded at Phineas. \u201cSome bad stuff going down around here. How\u2019s your little lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good.\u201d He hoped. She was still inside the house with her father.</p><p>Digger looked at Howard. \u201cYou can put away your knife, son. I\u2019m a were-bear, too. Where do you hail from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlaska.\u201d Howard sheathed his knife. \u201cKodiak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWee doggies.\u201d Digger\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re a big one. Me, I\u2019m a black bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDigger, if you want to help, just stay back here in the woods and make sure no one sneaks up on us from behind,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a were-tiger back here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d Rajiv waved from behind a tree. \u201cI came to check out bad smell.\u201d</p><p>Digger scratched his beard. \u201cYou\u2019re a tiger? Well, don\u2019t that beat all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you guys later.\u201d Phineas hurried back to the Vamps.</p><p>The big yard reminded him of a football field with two teams gathered on each side. He and the Vamps were in one end zone. The Jones\u2019s ranch house was at the other end.</p><p>Caddoc Jones emerged from the back door, followed by his two sons and Brynley. He paused at the edge of the patio and glared at Rhett. \u201cYou come to your wedding armed with knives?\u201d</p><p>Rhett stepped forward. \u201cWe want to make sure the wedding happens.\u201d His eyes narrowed on Brynley. \u201cThe bride has a nasty habit of running away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here now.\u201d Caddoc seized her arm and dragged her into the yard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not marrying him!\u201d Brynley pulled loose and put some distance between herself and her father. Phil ran over to stand next to her.</p><p>Howell took a position next to Caddoc, who was glowering at his daughter.</p><p>\u201cYou will do as you are told,\u201d Caddoc growled. \u201cOr you will be banished from this world forever. You will be dead to us.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cYou can\u2019t fire me, I quit. I\u2019m going to marry a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Phineas sucked in a deep breath. Yes! He ran onto the field.</p><p>Caddoc lifted an eyebrow. \u201cThis is your choice?\u201d</p><p>Rhett cursed. \u201cYou foul yourself with that damned bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>Phineas stopped next to Brynley. \u201cYou called?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and took his hand.</p><p>He turned to her father. \u201cI\u2019m requesting your daughter\u2019s hand in marriage.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc scoffed. \u201cWho the hell are you to think you deserve my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot to offer in terms of wealth, but I can give her all my love\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d Caddoc motioned to the house behind him. \u201cYou think she would give all this up for love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a second,\u201d Brynley said. \u201cYou can have all the land and riches in the world, but if you don\u2019t have love, you have nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will love pay the bills? Will it put food on the table?\u201d Caddoc sneered at Phineas. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know, would you? You don\u2019t even eat food. But if you dare to feed off my daughter, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never harm her!\u201d Phineas interrupted. \u201cI want her happiness more than anything.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc studied him a moment, then arched a brow. \u201cYou would do anything for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not give her up.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc stepped toward him. \u201cProve it. Make yourself worthy of her.\u201d</p><p>Phineas narrowed his eyes. What did the old man want? A duel?</p><p>Caddoc glanced at Brynley. \u201cI will only accept a werewolf as your husband.\u201d He motioned to Phineas. \u201cSo if you want him, you\u2019ll have to bite him.\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>Phineas sucked in a breath of air. Damn. He hadn\u2019t expected this. He didn\u2019t even know if it was possible for a vampire to become a werewolf. That might be what her father was counting on, that the transformation would kill him.</p><p>Caddoc\u2019s eyes glinted with humor as he regarded his daughter. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who thinks love is so powerful. Do you love this man enough to make him acceptable?\u201d</p><p>Brynley gave Phineas a worried look.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d Rhett stepped forward. \u201cShe\u2019s marrying me! I\u2019m the best choice.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s her choice. If she wants the bloodsucker badly enough, she\u2019ll agree. Of course, she can\u2019t shift tonight since she\u2019s not an Alpha, but I can do the biting.\u201d He gave Phineas a wolfish grin. \u201cHow much do you really want her?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. Somehow he\u2019d always feared it would come down to this. He wouldn\u2019t be good enough for Brynley as he was. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. Bring it on, old man.\u201d</p><p>Brynley gasped. \u201cNo. Phineas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glimmered with tears. \u201cPhineas, you are worthy just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>His breath caught. Worthy the way he was. His heart swelled in his chest.</p><p>She turned to her father and lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019m marrying Phineas, and I don\u2019t care if you ever approve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have defied me for the last time!\u201d With a growl, Caddoc lunged toward her, his head shifting into a snarling wolf.</p><p>Brynley lifted her arms to defend herself, and they shimmered. \u201cI\u2019m not taking it anymore!\u201d she screamed, and her arms and head shifted.</p><p>Caddoc jumped back.</p><p>A shock wave rolled over the entire yard. Jaws dropped. Gasps echoed in the stunned silence.</p><p>\u201cMy God!\u201d Caddoc was back in human form, his face frozen in disbelief.</p><p>Brynley shifted back. \u201cWhat\u2014what have I done?\u201d She stumbled, and Phineas caught her.</p><p>Phil grabbed her other arm. \u201cYou went Alpha, Bryn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only males\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d Phil\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou\u2019re the first female Alpha!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn, girl.\u201d Phineas grinned at her. \u201cYou released the Kraken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off her!\u201d Rhett stalked toward them and drew his knife. \u201cShe\u2019s the most valuable female werewolf in the world. She has to be mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brynley snorted. \u201cBuzz off, Rhett. Why would I marry you when everyone knows you plan to kill me after the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cEverything\u2019s changed now. You\u2019re too valuable to kill. With you, I could rule the entire Lycan world. I would have the strongest children\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Corky screamed and zoomed over to him. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep her! You\u2019re supposed to stay with me! We\u2019re going to rule the world! We\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForget it!\u201d Rhett sneered at her. \u201cWhy would I want you when I can have the one and only Alpha female\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dumping me?\u201d Corky screeched. \u201cYou\u2014you stupid animal. I was mistress to kings before you were ever born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve outlived your usefulness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Corky pulled a knife and pointed it at Rhett. \u201cI could slit your throat so fast you\u2019d never see it coming.\u201d She glanced at Brynley. \u201cOr I could take out your bitch.\u201d She vanished, then reappeared behind Brynley.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Rhett dashed toward them.</p> <p>With vampire speed, Phineas pulled Brynley away from Corky\u2019s slashing knife.</p><p>Phil grabbed Corky\u2019s arm and strained against her vampire strength.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Corky hissed, aiming her knife at Phil\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ll kill all of you stinking wolves.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s arm shimmered and shifted, and then with the power of his wolf, he shoved Corky back.</p><p>She stumbled into Rhett\u2019s arms and reached for his face. \u201cDarling, let me take you away from here. We\u2019ll rule the\u2014\u201d She gasped as Rhett\u2019s knife plunged into her stomach. \u201cWhat? You can\u2019t\u2014no!\u201d</p><p>Rhett rammed his knife into her heart.</p> <p>Her scream died as her body disintegrated into a pile of dust.</p><p>Silence fell over the field. Phineas glanced at Angus and the others. They didn\u2019t seem too upset over the failure to capture Corky. He suspected that even though she would have been found guilty at Coven Court, Roman would have had a hard time determining her punishment.</p><p>He looked back at Rhett, who was calmly brushing some Corky dust off his sleeve. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just kill your escape route?\u201d</p><p>He returned to the side of the yard where his small army was gathered. \u201cI have no need to escape. I\u2019m not leaving until Brynley and I are married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Phil said. \u201cMy father and his men plan to kill you after the wedding. You should leave while you have the chance.\u201d</p><p>Rhett stiffened and glanced at Caddoc. \u201cYou think you can kill me?\u201d</p><p>Caddoc shrugged. \u201cYou think you can kill me?\u201d</p><p>Both sides drew their weapons and started hurling insults at each other.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the shit hits the fan,\u201d Phineas muttered, then held up his hands and shouted, \u201cAre you guys really going to kill each other over Brynley when she doesn\u2019t want either of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right!\u201d Brynley yelled. \u201cI\u2019m leaving with Phineas.\u201d She glared at Rhett. \u201cGo back to Alaska and leave my family alone.\u201d She switched her glare to her father. \u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, but he said nothing.</p><p>A muffled sob came from the patio.</p><p>Brynley winced. \u201cGlynis, I\u2019ll stay in touch with you. I promise.\u201d She turned her back and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Phineas took her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always leaving her behind.\u201d Brynley gazed at him with tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a way for you to see her.\u201d Phineas led her toward the Vamps.</p><p>Phil walked with them, holding Brynley\u2019s other hand.</p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d Brynley whispered. \u201cDid we stop a battle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Phil murmured. \u201cJust keep walking.\u201d</p><p>They were halfway to the Vamps when Angus shouted a warning.</p><p>Phineas spun around. Rhett was running toward them, his knife raised. He gave a war cry, and his men charged after him.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Phineas shoved Brynley toward the Vamps.</p><p>Caddoc responded with his own war cry, and his men ran onto the field, their knives raised. They clashed with Rhett\u2019s men, knives stabbing.</p><p>Rhett lunged toward Phineas, but with vampire speed, he wrenched the knife from the werewolf\u2019s hand and punched him hard enough he heard the jaw crack. Rhett hit the ground, then jumped up, instantly shifting and repairing his broken jaw. He pounced on Phineas, who grabbed the wolf by the neck as it attempted to rip his throat out. He threw the wolf to the side, but Rhett twisted and snapped his jaw onto Phineas\u2019s arm.</p><p>He gasped. Hot, searing pain shot up his arm. He tried to stand up, but tumbled back onto his rear.</p><p>Phil lunged onto Rhett, both in wolf form, and they rolled, clawing and snapping. Phil pinned him down and bared his teeth, growling.</p><p>Howard sprinted toward them, his knife raised. \u201cLet me fight him!\u201d</p><p>Phil moved aside with a snarl aimed at Rhett.</p><p>Rhett rolled to his feet and shifted to human form, his clothes in tatters, his face shocked as Howard ran toward him. \u201cYou.\u201d He turned and hollered. \u201cDimitri!\u201d</p><p>The Malcontent teleported beside him.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Howard lunged at Rhett, his knife plunging just as the werewolf vanished with Dimitri. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas!\u201d Brynley ran toward him and fell to her knees beside him.</p><p>He looked at her and stars danced around her head.</p><p>She ripped her shirt off and wrapped it around his arm. \u201cHe bit you.\u201d</p><p>Phil knelt beside them, back in human form. \u201cHow do you feel, bro?\u201d</p><p>Phineas blinked at him. \u201cDo you have two heads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen?\u201d Brynley asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Phil shook his head. Or both his heads. Phineas wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cHi, guys.\u201d Phineas waved faintly at the Vamps who were crowding around him with worried faces. He looked over at the field. \u201cThey\u2019re running away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Angus agreed. \u201cAfter Rhett disappeared, his army took off running.\u201d</p><p>Phineas watched Howell and his cohorts giving chase. \u201cThey might chase them all the way back to Alaska.\u201d He blinked as their forms wavered.</p><p>Brynley touched his forehead. \u201cHe\u2019s burning up. He has a fever.\u201d</p><p>Phineas smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m hot for you, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was bitten?\u201d a voice asked.</p><p>Phineas squinted up at Brynley\u2019s father. \u201cYou again. I thought we said good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Caddoc looked at his daughter. \u201cKeep me informed. I want to know what happens to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou care all of a sudden?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious.\u201d He paused, then added. \u201cIf he survives the transformation, I might accept him as your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t care what\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lifted a hand to interrupt her. \u201cIf he survives, he may have powers no other werewolf has. That alone makes him of interest to me. You will be welcomed in my house.\u201d He glanced at Phil. \u201cAll of you.\u201d He turned and strode away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you just love family reunions?\u201d Phineas asked, then slumped over as everything went black.</p><p>Fire. He was on fire.</p><p>Phineas moaned and kicked off the sheets.</p><p>Sheets? Was he in bed? He squinted, but couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>Everything was glowing red. On fire.</p><p>\u201cWhy are his eyes red?\u201d a woman asked. Brynley.</p><p>He tried to say her name, opening his mouth, but nothing came out.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s hungry,\u201d Brynley said.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d a male voice said. Roman? What was he doing here? \u201cLet\u2019s give him a cold bottle. It might help with the fever.\u201d</p><p>Someone lifted his shoulders.</p><p>Careful, Phineas thought. I\u2019m on fire.</p><p>\u201cDamn, he\u2019s hot,\u201d the person said.</p><p>Told you so. A cold bottle was pressed to his mouth, and blood trickled down his throat. It was cool. It helped with the fire. He drank it all down.</p><p>His stomach clenched in pain. He groaned, pushing away the hands that reached out to help him.</p><p>He rolled halfway off the bed and threw up.</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Brynley cried.</p><p>Hands pushed him back onto the bed. Everything went black.</p><p>He woke again. Still on fire. And so damned hungry.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awake!\u201d Brynley exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if he can eat,\u201d Roman said.</p><p>Someone lifted his shoulders. He squinted, peering around the room. It looked like the basement at Phil\u2019s cabin. Why hadn\u2019t they taken him back to Romatech?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not as hot tonight,\u201d said the guy holding his shoulders. Phil?</p><p>A bottle was placed against his lips. He drank and drank. So good.</p><p>It hit his stomach and instantly curdled. He rolled over and vomited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what to think,\u201d Roman said. \u201cHe\u2019s had two days of death-sleep. I thought that would heal whatever Lycan virus is in his system. But if he\u2019s rejecting blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s becoming a werewolf,\u201d Phil said. \u201cWe should try giving him real food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring him something,\u201d Brynley said, then climbed up the ladder.</p><p>A werewolf? Phineas lay back, trying to wrap his fuddled mind around it. That was why he was at Phil\u2019s cabin. In case he shifted into an animal.</p><p>A while later, Brynley was back and spooning something hot down his throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s soup,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought we should start with something simple.\u201d</p><p>He ate it. Then threw it up.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Brynley cried. \u201cHe\u2019s rejecting both vampire and human food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two parts are fighting each other,\u201d Roman said. \u201cI\u2019ll put an IV in him. We have to keep him alive until the battle inside him gets sorted out.\u201d</p><p>A battle? No wonder he was on fire. Everything went black.</p><p>He woke again. The fire was out. He felt good, as if his body was at peace. Good God, was he dead? The spurt of panic quickly faded away as he smoothed his hands over his bare chest. His body was solid. His heart was beating. His vision clear. He was alive.</p><p>Power surged through him, and he took a deep breath. Damn. He felt more than good. His vision cut through the dark room, sharper than ever. His muscles flexed with increased strength.</p><p>He sat up. Phil was on the floor, sound asleep on a sleeping bag. A bottle of blood sat on the bedside table. He picked it up and drank it down.</p><p>No reaction. Apparently, the battle was over, and the Vamp side had won. He looked around, but couldn\u2019t spot Brynley. She must be upstairs.</p><p>He pulled the IV from his arm and stood. No dizziness. He smiled to himself. He actually felt stronger than ever. He teleported to the floor above to give Brynley a surprise.</p><p>The surprise was on him. He materialized in the bathroom with one foot in the toilet.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He lifted his bare foot out and shook it off. This wasn\u2019t where he\u2019d intended to go.</p><p>He opened the bathroom door and froze.</p><p>Daylight.</p><p>His heart lurched, and he shut the door. What the hell? He couldn\u2019t be awake in daylight.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Brynley demanded.</p><p>He cracked open the door and peered out.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>He opened the door wider. The room was full of sunshine. He sank back into the shadow, afraid he would burst into flames if the sunlight touched him.</p><p>Go into the light, a voice inside him urged. It can\u2019t hurt us. Trust the wolf.</p><p>Wolf? He stiffened. There was a wolf inside him?</p><p>The wolf knows best. The light cannot harm us.</p><p>\u201cPhineas?\u201d Brynley approached him, watching him carefully.</p><p>He slowly reached out a hand, then extended his index finger so the tip barely touched the light.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>He opened his hand, turning it palm up in the sunlight. A gentle warmth caressed his skin.</p><p>Enjoy the light, the wolf whispered to him. It is my gift to you.</p><p>\u201cPhineas.\u201d Brynley took his hands and led him slowly into the sun-filled cabin.</p><p>Our mate. He smiled at her, then looked out the window. Blue sky. \u201cI see blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be a werewolf now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBut I drank blood and teleported.\u201d He glanced down at his wet foot. \u201cNot very well though. Maybe I\u2019m a little of both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be . . . interesting.\u201d</p><p>He winced at a sudden thought. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m lousy at both?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou won\u2019t be. Look at you. You\u2019re awake during the day. Do you know any other Vamp who can manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen to me.\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek. \u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Snout-Face.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI may be calling you that on the next full moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Snout-Face.\u201d He pulled her into his arms. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Three months later . . .</p><p>\u201cGood evening, dear viewers! This is Maggie O\u2019Brian O\u2019Callahan reporting for Real Housewives of the Vampire World. Tonight we have a very special guest, the newest wife of a Vamp, Brynley McKinney!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Brynley smiled at the camera. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s quite an honor,\u201d Maggie assured her. \u201cI understand you\u2019re the only female Alpha werewolf in the world?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWe believe so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your husband is that famous celebrity that all the women swoon over, the Blardonnay Guy!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brynley laughed. \u201cI love his commercials, too. And I love his voice.\u201d She motioned for Phineas to join her. \u201cCome on, say it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He nodded at the camera. \u201cHello, ladies.\u201d</p><p>Brynley squeezed his arm. \u201cI love it!\u201d</p> <p>He winked at her.</p><p>Maggie grinned at them. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious you two are newlyweds. I\u2019ve never seen a couple so in love. Now tell me, are the rumors true? Has our beloved Dr. Phang become part werewolf?\u201d</p><p>Brynley nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s been shifting every month on the full moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing!\u201d Maggie looked at Phineas. \u201cAnd yet you\u2019re still a vampire, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little of both,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe\u2019re still figuring it all out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how do you like being a werewolf?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI like chasing my wife through the woods.\u201d</p><p>Brynley shook her head, blushing.</p><p>\u201cEven more, I like catching her.\u201d</p><p>She swatted at his shoulder. \u201cHush.\u201d</p><p>He assumed an injured look. \u201cBut of course, she\u2019s the Alpha, so she thinks she can boss me around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do not.\u201d Brynley nudged him with her elbow.</p><p>Maggie laughed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re living here in Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go back and forth from here to New York,\u201d Phineas said. \u201cI still work for MacKay S and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s learning how to be a rancher,\u201d Brynley added.</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d Maggie pointed behind them. \u201cThat must be one of your horses?\u201d</p><p>Brynley glanced back and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s the wild white stallion. He doesn\u2019t belong to anyone. But he comes by to see us often.\u201d</p><p>Phineas strolled over to the horse and patted it. The horse nudged him in the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look very wild to me,\u201d Maggie observed.</p> <p>\u201cHe likes Phineas,\u201d Brynley said, still smiling.</p><p>Phineas swung onto the horse\u2019s bare back. \u201cHello, ladies. Now I\u2019m on a horse.\u201d</p><p>Brynley snorted.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is your home?\u201d Maggie gestured to the side, and the camera shifted.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brynley answered. \u201cIt was the old Haggerty ranch. My father bought it for us as a wedding present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That was very generous of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Brynley nodded. At first, she hadn\u2019t been sure they should accept her father\u2019s gift. She suspected he was keeping them close, hoping he could use them someday. After all, she was the only female Alpha, and Phineas was also unique, possessing powers that no other werewolf had.</p><p>She smiled for the camera. \u201cI love being here. This area is home to me, and my sister is close by, so I can see her often. And we have a really good friend just down the road, Nate Carson. He\u2019s great guy and a vampire. And single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did you hear that, viewers?\u201d Maggie looked at the camera. \u201cNow, what can you tell me about your house?\u201d</p><p>Brynley grinned when Phineas rode by the house on the wild white stallion. \u201cWell, frankly, it was a bit of a mess when we moved in. But we\u2019ve been working hard to make it our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a fixer-upper?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. But once we moved all the dead werewolves out, and cleaned up the bloodstains, we slapped on few coats of paint, and it was as good as new.\u201d</p><p>Maggie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re remodeling the bathrooms and kitchen,\u201d Brynley added. \u201cPutting in our own furniture.\u201d</p><p>Maggie smiled. \u201cI hear you\u2019ve been working on one room in particular?\u201d</p><p>Brynley blushed. \u201cYes. It appears the Lycan virus reactivated parts of my vampire husband. It caught us by surprise, but we\u2019re very excited about it. I\u2019m expecting twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re delighted for you!\u201d Maggie hugged her, then turned to the camera. \u201cBe sure to keep watching Real Housewives of the Vampire World. We\u2019ll keep you updated on the McKinney family and all the Vamps you love to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a wrap!\u201d Darcy lowered her video camera and turned it off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done?\u201d Phineas walked toward them.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, you two.\u201d Darcy hugged them both.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at DVN tomorrow night to shoot another Blardonnay commercial,\u201d Maggie told Phineas.</p><p>She teleported away with Darcy.</p><p>\u201cAnother Blardonnay commercial?\u201d Brynley asked.</p><p>Phineas smiled and gathered her in his arms. \u201cWe gotta pay for all this remodeling.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a wry look. \u201cSo many names. The Blardonnay Guy, Dr. Phang, the Love Doctor. But do you know my favorite name for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnout-Face?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo. Husband.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her nose. \u201cThat\u2019s my favorite, too. For now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019m going to really like being Daddy.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him tight. \u201cI\u2019m going to like that, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
