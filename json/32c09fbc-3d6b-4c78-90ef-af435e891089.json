He had connections beyond anyone\u2019s imagining. He\u2019d lived his life on the fringe, steeped in shadows, so immersed in gray that he doubted he had any semblance of a soul remaining.</p><p>He had power, wealth and information at his disposal. And none of it meant a damn thing because his daughter was dying and he was powerless to prevent it.</p><p>She\u2019d been seen by the top physicians in the world, had the best treatment money could buy, and he\u2019d been told the same thing by every one of them.</p> <p>There was nothing further to be done. His daughter couldn\u2019t be saved. The best he could do was make her comfortable for the remainder of her time.</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>;s He wouldn\u2019t accept that there was nothing he could do. He\u2019d prevented wars and instigated them. He wielded influence with dozens of world leaders. He could make or ruin an entire country on a whim. And he couldn\u2019t save his daughter?</p><p>He paced the confines of the dark library where he often brooded with a glass of Macallen whiskey he\u2019d paid over one hundred thousand dollars for. The fire in the hearth had died, leaving only a few glowing embers.</p><p>His phone rang and he yanked it to his ear, barking the order before the other party had a chance to say anything.</p> <p>\u201cIs she legitimate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed it appears she is.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth\u2019s shoulders sagged and he sank onto the couch, perched on the edge, his impatience snarling and nipping at him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been able to heal all manner of illnesses and injuries, but it\u2019s at great cost to herself. She\u2019s been pushed beyond her limits but she\u2019s been successful in all cases that have been presented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what it does to her,\u201d Farnsworth growled. \u201cGet her here. I\u2019m running out of time.\u201d</p><p>There was a lengthy pause and Farnsworth didn\u2019t like pauses. They never meant good news.</p> <p>\u201cI anticipated your order, sir. When I was told the results of her testing, I knew you\u2019d want her there with all due haste. I gave the order to go in, remove all evidence of her existence, silence those who had any knowledge of her and, of course, to retrieve Grace Peterson and have her taken to you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like where this was going. His gut knotted and his lips tightened in rage.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened then? Where is she? When can I expect her? Elizabeth doesn\u2019t have much time!\u201d</p><p>There was a deep breath. \u201cShe escaped, sir.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth exploded to his feet, spit rimming his lips as he puffed out his fury. \u201cEscaped? She escaped? What of this terrible toll? What of her being weak and fragile after so much healing? How does one small woman escape highly trained operatives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a miscommunication, sir. Our intel was wrong. The room we thought she was being held in was empty. One of the explosions leveled the quarters she had been moved to, and she escaped in the confusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour intel was wrong. Miscommunication. Confusion. What the fuck am I paying for? A bunch of goddamn amateurs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re tracking her now. We won\u2019t fail you, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGoddamn right you won\u2019t fail,\u201d Farnsworth raged. \u201cI swear to you that if my daughter dies, you and everyone you hold dear will suffer. I\u2019ll extinguish your entire family, and you\u2019ll watch while it happens. And then you\u2019ll die a long painful death. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-Yes sir.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth cut the connection and held the phone for a long moment, tempted to hurl it through the window. Only the knowledge that he had to act fast for his daughter\u2019s sake gave him the impetus to place his next call.</p><p>He waited as he went through a series of numbers and security codes until finally the connection was established. He didn\u2019t wait, didn\u2019t exchange pleasantries. Grace Peterson had to be found, and she had to be found now.</p><p>\u201cI need Titan,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI don\u2019t give a goddamn how much it costs. You get me Titan.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>GRACE Peterson drew the blanket tighter around her and huddled in the dark. She stared blankly at the star-filled sky. The mountain air was cold. Not just chilly, as it had been as dusk had descended, wiping away the comfortable remnants of a sunny afternoon. It was frigid.</p><p>A low moan escaped as her muscles tightened and protested not only the cold, but the weakness inflicted upon them by so much death and sickness. Pain had long since lost any meaning to her. What she felt couldn\u2019t really be considered pain. It was worse. She couldn\u2019t feel anything but the desolation of hopelessness and despair. The knowledge that she would probably die from the horrors inflicted upon her. And perhaps she deserved it, for she hadn\u2019t been able to help all who had been thrust upon her.</p><p>Her escape had been a fluke. An explosion had decimated the cell where she\u2019d been held. She\u2019d managed to get out before the men charged with her care had been able to respond. Or maybe they had perished. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to feel any regret. They\u2019d shown her no regard. She\u2019d been treated like an inanimate object. Some magic wand they waved at a wound or an illness and expected her to make it all disappear.</p><p>She hated them for that. Hated them for their callousness. For using others as they\u2019d used her. Pawns. Objects to provide them with information. They weren\u2019t even people. Just numbers.</p><p>Another shiver rattled her teeth and settled deep into her bones. She simply couldn\u2019t imagine ever being warm again. She curled her feet farther into the blanket and tucked the ends securely under her chin.</p><p>She was severely weakened by all she\u2019d been forced to endure. For all she\u2019d been made to heal. Even now she didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d found the strength or the will to make her escape when the opportunity had presented itself.</p><p>But now she\u2019d run out of strength. She had nothing else left. No reserves. And her resolve was faltering just as everything else had done.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she tried to find some solace. Some measure of peace.</p><p>She missed her sister, Shea. Ached for the comfort of her touch. The brush of her mind and the image of her smile. She hadn\u2019t ever really understood and hadn\u2019t ever taken Shea\u2019s decision for them to separate seriously. Until the day she\u2019d been captured, and she realized that if they\u2019d been together, they would have both been taken.</p><p>Shea had always been determined to keep Grace safe, but now, Grace was equally determined to keep Shea as far away from her as possible. Grace was hunted. She knew her pursuers were probably in these mountains already. They could be a short distance away.</p><p>And so she\u2019d slammed the door shut on her sister, and the void hurt every bit as much as the bombardment of sickness and pain she\u2019d absorbed. Not having Shea there was the worst sort of loneliness. She\u2019d severed the telepathic link between her and her sister, and her worst fear was that it was permanent. She\u2019d never get it back.</p><p>In a way, she supposed it would be a blessing. If she lost her abilities, she could have a normal life. But so would she lose the ability to make a difference in someone else\u2019s life.</p><p>She closed her eyes, exhausted by the weight of responsibility, sorrow and regret. She hated that she wasn\u2019t stronger, that she\u2019d crumbled under so much stress. But the ailments had been thrown at her, one after another. Broken bones, horrible bloody wounds, tumors, diseases, and the list went on and on. The most horrific experiment she\u2019d undergone was when it had been demanded of her to reach inside the mind of a woman with a mental illness and heal her.</p><p>For three long d</p><p>She was hungry, but the thought of food made her stomach twist into knots. She drank water from nearby streams frequently, because she knew she had to do something to keep her strength up. And no matter that she bore the knowledge that she would likely die, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to simply give up. Not yet.</p><p>Quietly, she turned over, rearranging the blanket in the fruitless hope she\u2019d somehow find greater warmth. Eventually she\u2019d have to reach out to her sister, but if she did so now, Shea would see the horrific shape Grace was in. Shea would come. She\u2019d put herself in grave danger. Grace would never be able to live with herself if Shea was sacrificed because in a moment of weakness Grace gave in and tried to reestablish the link with her sister.</p><p>Silent tears slid down Grace\u2019s cheeks, briefly warming her skin until the chilly air turned them to ice. She angrily scrubbed them away and hunched lower, furious with herself for allowing despair to control her.</p><p>She was stronger than this, and she\u2019d be strong again. She just needed time to recover from her ordeal. Maybe she\u2019d never be the same as she had been, but she wasn\u2019t going to give in. If she died, she\u2019d die running. She\u2019d die standing up and fighting. She refused to die in some laboratory where rats were treated with less disdain.</p><p>A distant sound froze her to the bone. She went so still that even her breath sounded like a roar in the night. She pushed the blanket over her mouth, trying to quell the noise, and she stared into the trees, trying desperately to see through the thick curtain of night.</p><p>Someone was coming.</p><p>THEY crawled through the mountains under the cover of dark. Rio knew they were close. They\u2019d been closing in on Grace for days now, but somehow she\u2019d managed to elude them just when he was sure they\u2019d come upon her.</p><p>He adjusted his pack, slipped on the infrared goggles and scanned the area ahead, looking for anything giving off a heat signal.</p><p>There were several smaller forms. Animals. Even a larger shape that must have been an elk or a deer. Nothing that resembled a human, though.</p><p>He\u2019d given orders for strict radio silence. They weren\u2019t the only ones who sought Grace. But he was determined to get to her first. His gut told him they needed to catch up to her before dawn. The hairs on his nape rose and apprehension slipped down his spine. It wasn\u2019t that he feared confrontation. In truth, he\u2019d savor killing the bastards who\u2019d made Grace and Shea\u2019s life hell over the last year.</p><p>It was the knowledge that she was in danger and that he and his men needed to end this game of cat and mouse.</p><p>Beside him, Terrence, his right hand, melted into the dark just a few feet away. Rio continued a path farther up the mountain. There were any number of nooks and crannies a small woman could hide in, and so he carefully scanned the area, looking for any heat source.</p><p>Where are you, Grace? I know you\u2019re here. I can feel you.</p><p>And it was true. There was a distinct prickle, the same awareness he\u2019d experienced the first time he\u2019d seen her on the surveillance footage. The last time anyone had seen her before she\u2019d disappeared.</p><p>Het G=\"1em\"&gt;2019;d known beyond a shadow of a doubt that he would be the one to go after her and bring her back to her sister. Safe and alive.</p><p>Since that time, he\u2019d tracked her movements with uncanny accuracy. He and his men hadn\u2019t left a stone unturned in their search for her. They\u2019d gone back to the house where she\u2019d last been seen and had broadened their search from there.</p><p>It had taken weeks, but now they were following a lead into the mountains of Colorado, and Rio was sure they were close. His gut was screaming, and he never ignored his gut. It had kept him alive more times than he could count.</p><p>He paused when he heard a noise in the distance. He turned, scanning the area, and then he saw the infrared images of men he knew weren\u2019t his moving stealthily through the trees.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>He curled his hand into a fist. Where the hell was Grace? He didn\u2019t have time to play hide and seek with the men who were after her. He needed to grab her and get the hell out.</p><p>He pulled his rifle from over his shoulder and silently moved in the direction of the heat signature. Ideally he didn\u2019t want to shoot up the whole damn mountain and leave bodies lying everywhere. He\u2019d rather find Grace and make a stealthy exit, but the savage part of him relished spilling a little blood.</p><p>A cry in the night froze him momentarily. He lifted his head to capture the faint echo as it died in the distance. It was a feminine cry, one that sent chills chasing down his spine. There was a hell of a lot of anguish, pain and fear in that one small sound.</p><p>Grace.</p><p>He began to run, closing in on the source of the noise. He ripped the goggles from his head, needing to see his surroundings better. A hundred yards ahead, Terrence fell in beside him and they charged the remaining distance, guns up and ready.</p><p>They slowed when they reached the edge of a drop-off that overlooked a small valley below. The moon shone down, reflecting off the smooth rock floor, and Rio\u2019s gut clenched as he saw Grace Peterson backed to a steep edge that plummeted hundreds of feet into a riverbed.</p><p>He sensed the grim determination in her that she wouldn\u2019t be captured again. He knew without doubt that she\u2019d jump before ever going back. Her fear and desolation were like a tangible scent in the air. It tightened every one of his muscles, gripped his heart and squeezed relentlessly.</p><p>He had to get to her before the idiots forced her over with their stupidity.</p><p>Dropping down onto his belly, he pulled his gun up and put the crosshairs on the man closest to Grace. The stupid fuck had his hand held out in a placating manner, but in his other hand was a gun and it was pointed directly at Grace. His entire posture screamed menace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rio squeezed a shot off. The man dropped like a stone, and suddenly his comrades hit the ground and turned in the direction of the gunfire.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Terrence muttered as he got into position. \u201cThought we weren\u2019t engaging?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCover me. I\u2019m going in,\u201d Rio bit out.</p><p>Before Terrence could protest, Rio scrambled over the edge and rapidly worked his way down until he reached bottom. Above him, Terrence squeezed off round after round, the sounds echoing harshly in the night.</p> <p>They had a limited amount of time before someone came to investigate all the gunfire. He turned and immediately searched for Grace again. To his horror, he found her just as the edge gave way under her feet and she plummeted over the side.</p><p>He lunged forward as more gunfire erupted. This time, Terrence wasn\u2019t trying to scare them. They dropped like flies as Terrence put them down one by one while Rio flew to po Rio fl the edge.</p><p>Trusting his man to protect his back, Rio focused only on trying to see how far down Grace had fallen or if the worst had occurred and she\u2019d gone the entire distance to the riverbed.</p><p>He dug a flashlight out of his pack and dropped to his belly. He pointed the light down and made a slow sweep. As he pulled it closer to the side of the cliff, the light bounced over a tattered sneaker. He yanked the light up to see Grace lying limply on an outcropping. Her feet dangled over the side and her slim form barely fit the ledge. But she hadn\u2019t fallen more than twenty feet.</p><p>Breaking radio silence, he called for immediate assistance. His men would have to lower him over by rope, and he\u2019d have to haul Grace up over his shoulder. Provided she was still alive. He wouldn\u2019t consider any alternative, though. She hadn\u2019t made it this far to go quietly.</p> <p>As he was pushing to his knees, Terrence dropped down beside him, flashing his own light over the side.</p><p>\u201cDiego and Browning have our sixes. Decker and Alton are scrambling to get here,\u201d Terrence said. \u201cI\u2019ll lower you over with rope so you can get Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll dead,\u201d Terrence confirmed.</p><p>Rio couldn\u2019t waste time lamenting the mess they\u2019d made. Grace was the priority and then they had to get the hell out of here before everything went to shit.</p><p>Terrence yanked out a coil of rope with a rappel hook on the end and quickly fastened it around his waist. He took several steps back, dug his heels into the soil and then wrapped the extra length around the base of an aspen and set the hook into the bark. He tossed the other end to Rio.</p> <p>Rio secured the flashlight to his leg, pointing downward so his descent would be illuminated. Then he secured the end of the rope around his waist, yanked to make sure it was securely knotted and then edged backward until his heels hung over the side.</p><p>Just before he started downward, Decker and Alton hit the scene. They rushed past Diego and Browning, who were standing watch, and each grabbed one of Rio\u2019s hands to help him over the side.</p><p>They leaned down as he made his descent, holding on to his wrist until he had sure footing and he was certain that Terrence could support his weight.</p><p>The light bounced crazily as he continued downward. He glanced over his shoulder to see Grace still lying on the small ledge. He just hoped to hell it held both their weights.</p><p>He pushed off the side of the cliff when he reached her and lowered himself enough that he straddled the outcropping. Immediately he pressed his fingers to her neck, feeling for her pulse, and was reassured by the steady thud.</p><p>\u201cGrace. Wake up. I\u2019ve come to get you out of here but I need your help.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t receive a response, his lips tightened in frustration. At the top, Decker and Alton shone their lights down. He dug his feet into the side, finding purchase, and then he carefully let go of the rope to slide his arms underneath her limp body.</p><p>Mentally counting to three, he hoisted her up and then arranged her over one shoulder so he could hold the rope with a free hand. He held her tightly, his arm a steel band over the backs of her legs.</p> <p>\u201cPull us up,\u201d he called up to his teammates.</p><p>Toe over toe, he dug into the side as the rope inched higher. His muscles bulged with the strain of bearing both their weights. The rope cut into his skin and his fingers were numb from his grip.</p><p>Let me die. Please.</p><p>At first he thought she\u2019d said it aloud. It startled him into stillness. His toes dragged as they hoistse,s they ed him higher and he had to scramble to regain his footing and assist them as they pulled him and Grace the remaining way.</p><p>He was suddenly swamped with desolation so acute that he couldn\u2019t breathe. Pain. Fear. Regret. Hopelessness. And weariness that went soul deep.</p><p>He knew then that he\u2019d heard Grace\u2019s innermost thoughts. He was feeling what she felt. And her sorrow was so great that it staggered him.</p><p>Her tears were locked inside her, but he felt each one. Memories of all she\u2019d endured flashed through his mind until he had to close his eyes to control his reeling senses.</p><p>I won\u2019t go back.</p><p>Her voice whispered through his mind, so broken that he wanted to bellow in rage. He wanted to crawl up over the side of this damn cliff and rip apart the savages who\u2019d pursued her so relentlessly and kill them all over again. The men who\u2019d broken her spirit and made her even now want to die rather than endure more.</p><p>He knew that Nathan Kelly had been able to communicate with Grace\u2019s sister, Shea, telepathically, but he hadn\u2019t considered how or that he and Grace might be able to communicate the same way. It hadn\u2019t been important at the time. He\u2019d been gripped by the urgency to find her and keep her safe. Nothing else had mattered at that moment.</p><p>Tentatively, he reached out with his mind and spoke gently and reassuringly to her.</p><p>You\u2019ll never go back to those bastards, Grace. You\u2019re safe now. I\u2019m here to help you. Don\u2019t give up. You\u2019ll get through this.</p><p>There was nothing but silence, and he clenched his jaw in frustration. How the hell did you communicate with your mind? How did he even know if he was able to talk to her the same way she\u2019d just spoken to him? He didn\u2019t even know if she was cognizant of the fact that he\u2019d picked up on those desperate thoughts.</p><p>His teammates\u2019 faces came into view as he neared the edge. Their expressions were tense as they hauled him the remaining distance. Diego pushed forward while Decker and Browning held tight to the rope and he took Grace from Rio\u2019s grasp.</p><p>Free of her weight, Rio hoisted himself over the side and he rolled to his feet. Terrence let out a light huff, his only indication of the toll the rescue had taken on him. Rio quickly untied the rope and issued orders for his men to dispose of the bodies and then to be prepared to bug out.</p><p>They were in the middle of nowhere, no backup, no helo, their vehicles at least two miles away.</p><p>He strode to where Diego had laid Grace carefully on the ground and he dropped to his knees beside her.</p><p>He pushed the hair out of her face with gentle fingers and frowned at the deep shadows under her eyes, the paleness of her features and the deep lines of fatigue etched into her forehead. Her expression was grim even in unconsciousness.</p><p>Not knowing what possessed him, he found himself leaning down to press his lips to her forehead.</p><p>You don\u2019t give up, Grace. You\u2019re safe now. I won\u2019t hurt you and I won\u2019t allow anyone else to do so eit</p><p>her. I\u2019m going to take you home.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>SUNLIGHT warmed her face, though she was in the grip of a pervasive chill that was bone deep. It hurt to shiver and yet she couldn\u2019t do anything else.</p><p>It was as if there were weights pressing over her eyelids, preventing them from opening. Or perhaps she simply lacked the strength to do the simplest tasks anymore.</p><p>Pain crept over her, through her, puzzling her with its intensity. It was new. Fresh. And laiothen she remembered falling over the side, sure that death had finally come to claim her.</p><p>A soft moan escaped before she could call it back, and she chastised herself for that momentary loss of control. Such a lapse could get her killed.</p><p>Grace. Grace.</p><p>It took her a moment to realize that the person calling her name wasn\u2019t saying it aloud but in her mind. She recoiled, wanting nothing to do with the distant voice. And then she was surrounded by strength. Warmth. It flooded into her veins, so comforting that it shook her to her core.</p><p>\u201cGrace.\u201d</p><p>This time it was said aloud. A deep, rough, slightly accented voice. Just a hint of another world, one she couldn\u2019t place.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Grace. Let me see those gorgeous baby blues.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled and she tried to process her surroundings. She was afraid to open her eyes. Afraid that she\u2019d be right back in the hands of monsters, forced to do their bidding. The mere thought made her want to weep. She wasn\u2019t strong enough to endure more.</p><p>A gentle hand stroked over her cheek and carefully pushed away her hair, tucking it over her ear. Such warmth and tenderness. It was like rain to a sun-parched desert. She soaked it up, desperate for any comfort.</p><p>It took everything she had to conquer her fear and open her eyes. Sunlight stabbed through her vision, momentarily blinding her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d the man said in a low voice. \u201cCome back to me, Grace. I need you to wake up so we can figure out how badly you\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>At the mere mention of injuries, pain screamed through her body. Her eyes flew open and her lips parted. Her breath rushed out, her chest jerking violently with the effort.</p><p>Fear nearly paralyzed her when her gaze met with the dark eyes of a man staring intently at her. She let out a cry and tried to bolt, not even realizing that he was still holding her.</p><p>She tumbled to the ground, landing with a thud that knocked the breath from her and sent agony tearing through her body again.</p><p>The man above her cursed vehemently and he immediately knelt beside her, running those big hands over her fragile body.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Grace, I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go back.\u201d</p><p>She barely managed to stammer out the defiant vow. It hurt to talk. It hurt to breathe. She felt broken. Something was broken. Her ribs, an arm...She couldn\u2019t even decipher what was wrong with her. There was simply too much to process.</p><p>She stared up at him in panic, knowing she didn\u2019t possess the strength to escape. Tears gathered at the corners of her eyes. She could do nothing to prevent him from taking her back.</p><p>A deep shudder rolled through her body, and the tears that had threatened slowly slid down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cGrace, I want you to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>His voice was calm and oddly soothing. The tone mesmerized her as did those dark eyes that refused to look away from her.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Rio. I\u2019ve come to take you home. To Shea.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse leapt and her throat tightened. \u201cShea?\u201d she croaked. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>What if it was a trap? What if he was using information about her sister to lull her into a false sense of security?</p><p>He touched her cheek, his fingers infinitely gentle on her skin. He didn\u2019t look like a man who had an ounce of gentleness in him. He was big and menacing. A warrior.</p><p>Dark skinned, like he\u2019d spent many hours in the sun, uncaring of the conso b of theequences. His hair was pulled back into a ponytail at his nape and his eyes were as dark as night.</p><p>\u201cI spoke to her myself,\u201d he soothed. \u201cI promised her I\u2019d find you and protect you. We\u2019re the good guys, Grace. I realize you may have a hard time believing that or trusting me, but we\u2019re here to help you. Shea is safe and she wants very much to see you again. We\u2019ve all been worried about you.\u201d</p><p>More tears slid down her cheeks and a quiet sob hiccupped from her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to see me like this.\u201d</p><p>Something like understanding flashed in his eyes. He touched her face again, wiping at the moisture on her cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cI need you to tell me where you\u2019re hurt. We have to move you. We can\u2019t stay in this location, but I need to know what we risk by moving you more than we already have.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around, slowly taking in her surroundings for the first time. Her breath caught when she saw the others. Warriors. Like this man called Rio. Stern and forbidding. How was she to know she could trust them? What choice did she have?</p><p>They were away from where she\u2019d fallen the night before. How had they managed to find her and how had she survived the fall? Her memory of the event was hazy. She could only remember that moment when she knew she would likely die.</p><p>She\u2019d thought that a lot lately. Pondered her mortality as calmly as she might consider what shoes to wear. And yet she was here and alive. Broken but not defeated.</p><p>The men were facing away from where she and Rio were positioned. Watchful and wary. Guns up, their stances rigid as if they sensed danger in the very air.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d Rio prompted. \u201cTalk to me. I need to know how bad it is.\u201d</p><p>She briefly closed her eyes and then reopened them, focusing once more on his face. She licked her lips. \u201cI hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThe fall. I think I broke something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She centered her attention on her body, paying attention to where she hurt and how it differed from the residual pain of the endless torture she\u2019d endured. Her breaths were strained. Shallow and painful.</p><p>\u201cRibs,\u201d she managed to gasp out. \u201cThink I have broken ribs. And my arm. It hurts but it\u2019s growing numb. I can\u2019t feel my fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can see,\u201d Rio said as he carefully picked up her hand.</p><p>He turned his head and nodded at one of the men. She tensed when the big burly man closest to Rio hovered over her. He was a mountain. Arms bulging with muscles. He barely had a neck as thick as he was. Legs like tree trunks.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s lost feeling in her fingers,\u201d Rio said as if discussing something as mundane as the weather. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to set the break.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse exploded and she tried to sit up, but Rio put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cBe still, Grace.\u201d</p><p>The command in his voice froze her in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cCan you heal yourself?\u201d</p><p>The idle curiosity in his voice baffled her. He was so calm. Unruffled. He spoke of her abilities like they were the most natural things in the world. She glanced nervously between the two men, wondering if this was some kind of trap, though she couldn\u2019t imagine what it could be.</p> <p>The people who\u2019d kept her captive knew well her abilities. They wouldn\u2019t have to ask questions. Was this yet another faction who wanted to use her?</p><p>Panic was rising swiftly when Rio simply put his hand on her cheekon her and softly caressed. \u201cTake deep breaths, okay? We\u2019re going to help you. This is Terrence. He\u2019s my second in command. That\u2019s Diego right behind him. Diego acts as our medic when Donovan Kelly isn\u2019t around to patch us up, but Terrence is going to set the break for you.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled in confusion. She had no idea who any of these people were, but Rio continued a steady stream of conversation, ignoring her befuddlement.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to hurt like a son of a bitch. I won\u2019t lie to you. But I need you to be strong. If you scream, you\u2019ll draw attention and that\u2019s the last thing we need. I\u2019m going to knot one of my shirts, and I want you to bite down on it as hard as you like. But don\u2019t let out a sound. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>If he only knew how much she\u2019d silently endured, he\u2019d never ask that question. But she simply nodded, knowing that whatever they did wouldn\u2019t touch what she\u2019d already gone through.</p><p>He took out a T-shirt from his pack and began folding and knotting it into a long rope. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question. Can you heal yourself as you do others?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI mean it\u2019s different, but I do heal faster. But there\u2019s been so much...\u201d She closed her eyes, holding back more tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>Rio spoke in low, soothing tones. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Grace. I\u2019m going to make sure you get out of this.\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice settled her. Maybe it was the calm promise or the absolute conviction. Some of the fear faded and she relaxed, letting out her breath in a whispery rush.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d Rio murmured.</p><p>He carefully placed the shirt between her teeth, feathered his hand over her jaw and then eased her mouth shut over the material.</p><p>\u201cBe strong.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and nodded, not wanting to see what was coming.</p><p>Strong hands gripped her arm in a surprisingly gentle manner. She could instantly tell the difference, knew that it was Terrence who held her hand.</p> <p>And then he simply pulled and twisted, all at the same time. His strength took her completely by surprise. Her eyes flew open and her teeth bit savagely into the shirt. Her body bowed with the instant flash of pain. As she lay panting, her nostrils flaring with the ragged breaths she tried to suck in, a sense of relief settled over her.</p><p>Her arm ached from the manipulation, but the constant red-hot pain had subsided. Diego stepped in and quickly bound her arm, using two sturdy saplings one of the other men had fetched. He wound strips of cloth tightly around the sticks so it was impossible for her to move her arm.</p><p>Rio pulled the knotted shirt from her mouth. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, still not trusting herself to speak.</p><p>\u201cOkay, this is what\u2019s going to happen. We have to move and I can\u2019t spare the manpower necessary to keep you immobile. We don\u2019t have a stretcher, which means I\u2019m going to carry you out while my men surround us and provide cover. With a broken arm and ribs plus God only knows what else you\u2019ve got going on, there\u2019s no easy way to do this. It\u2019s going to suck.\u201d</p><p>She tried to smile at the blunt way he put it, but her lips trembled and she gave up with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need at least one hand free so I can hold a gun and protect us both. Terrence will secure you to my back. We once carried a teammate\u2019s wife out of the jungle just like I\u2019m going to carry you, so it\u2019ll work. I don\u2019t wanthe x2019;t you to worry. If you don\u2019t trust in anything else, you trust in the fact that we\u2019re going to get you out of these mountains.\u201d</p><p>The unwavering conviction in his voice gave her the first hope she\u2019d experienced in many weeks.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you give up,\u201d Rio continued. \u201cI know you hurt. I can only imagine what those bastards did to you. But you aren\u2019t giving up, Grace. You\u2019re a fighter. Your sister\u2019s a fighter.\u201d</p><p>Tears shimmered in her vision again, making Rio grow hazy. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to her. I\u2019m not sure I can talk to anyone...like before I mean.\u201d</p><p>Rio leaned over, his face close to hers. \u201cYou\u2019ll get it back. I heard you last night. It\u2019s there. You just have to heal both in body and spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she whispered around the knot in her throat.</p><p>He smiled then, white teeth flashing against dark skin. \u201cI\u2019m the man who\u2019s going to get you the hell out of here, and then I\u2019m going to hunt down those sons of bitches who hurt you and gut every last one of them.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the menace in his voice but was oddly comforted by the savage vow.</p><p>\u201cWe need to roll, Rio,\u201d Terrence said, startling her. She\u2019d forgotten his presence. Had forgotten all of the men standing in close proximity.</p><p>Rio nodded and then stood, towering over her. She suddenly felt very small and insignificant and extremely vulnerable as she lay huddled on the ground, surrounded by the warriors with death in their eyes.</p><p>This time Terrence knelt by her side, his voice quiet and she suspected purposely gentle so as not to scare the bejesus out of her. It was a little late for that...</p><p>\u201cAll right, Miss Grace. This is what\u2019s going to happen. The men are going to fashion a sling of sorts that will secure you to Rio\u2019s back. I\u2019m going to lift you very carefully. I\u2019ll try not to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her understanding.</p><p>He smiled at her, and she decided he was an extremely handsome man despite his fierce appearance. Moreover, she believed him when he said he\u2019d try not to hurt her.</p><p>He slid his arms underneath her body. \u201cDeep breath.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in, closed her eyes, and he lifted upward. She was amazed at the ease with which he picked her up. She opened her eyes and watched him. There was no evident strain. Just calm focus.</p><p>Diego appeared on her other side.</p><p>\u201cDiego\u2019s going to hook his arm underneath your leg,\u201d Terrence explained. \u201cI\u2019m going to take the other.\u201d</p><p>She appreciated the patience he demonstrated and how he explained every step so she wouldn\u2019t be frightened. At this point, she was ready to be done with it all. The sooner they left this place where she was hunted, the better she\u2019d feel. Maybe then she could begin healing.</p><p>She nodded her acceptance, and as soon as she did, Diego stepped forward and slid his arm underneath her legs. He hooked his other arm behind her, and he and Terrence held her up to Rio\u2019s back.</p><p>The other two men quickly wound the long strips of cloth they\u2019d secured together underneath her bottom and underneath her legs. They did a series of figure eights, coiling rope and material up and over Rio\u2019s shoulders then under and around her legs and behind until she was solidly supported and attached to his back.</p><p>Diego positioned her splinted arm at Rio\u2019s side just underneath his armpit and then secured it to Rio\u2019s body as well.</p><p>She had no idea how on ead hea how rth Rio was going to be able to move with her plastered to his body the way she was, much less carry a gun, but he didn\u2019t seem at all bothered by the prospect.</p><p>\u201cHow are the ribs?\u201d Rio asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll hurt when he starts walking,\u201d Diego warned. \u201cTry to press against him to minimize your movements as much as possible. The more you jostle, the more it\u2019s going to cause you pain.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again and pressed in as close to Rio as she could get. Already she was exhausted and they hadn\u2019t even begun the journey out. She didn\u2019t even know how far they had to travel and she didn\u2019t want to ask because she wasn\u2019t sure she could handle the answer.</p><p>Instead she was going to put herself in their hands because she had no other choice. She had no idea who these men were\u2014only that they knew her sister and they professed to want to help her.</p><p>She\u2019d been prepared to die. It shamed her that she\u2019d been so ready to give in. At her absolute lowest point, these men had appeared, refusing to let her give up. Rio had promised to take her home, though she had no inkling of what home meant. She\u2019d spent too much time on the run, separated from her only family.</p><p>The idea that she was finally safe and could see her sister after so long was more than she could comprehend.</p><p>\u201cReady, Grace?\u201d Rio called over his shoulder.</p><p>She took a deep breath, realizing that she was venturing into the unknown once again. Only this time she wasn\u2019t alone, and that bolstered</p><p>her flagging resolve like nothing else could.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>RIO\u2019S admiration for Grace grew with every passing hour. He knew she had to be in excruciating pain and yet she bore it stoically, never uttering a sound as he carried her over the uneven terrain.</p><p>His team had set a grueling pace that would have most people reduced to begging. But she hadn\u2019t uttered a sound. But he felt her. She wasn\u2019t a strong presence in his mind. He thought she was probably tightly protecting herself. But he could still sense the remains of the mental pathway that had been briefly forged between them, and he knew she was suffering.</p><p>\u201cBad news,\u201d Terrence said grimly.</p><p>Rio looked up to get the report from the man he\u2019d sent ahead to scout the area where they\u2019d left the vehicles. Terrence\u2019s lips were set into a fine line, and he kept looking to where Grace\u2019s head rested on Rio\u2019s shoulder as if he hated having to say what he was about to.</p><p>Diego pulled up, standing to the side of Terrence and Rio. He too glanced at Grace, but his gaze was seeking, trying to discern her condition.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Rio said impatiently.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be concerned with Grace hearing bad news. Hell, how much worse could it get anyway? She\u2019d already been to hell and back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got company. Hard to tell from the distance I was doing recon, but our hiding spot has been made and they\u2019ve set up an ambush.\u201d</p><p>Rio bit out a string of swear words that had Grace stirring against him. He went still, not wanting to cause her greater discomfort.</p><p>\u201cRio?\u201d</p><p>Hearing his name on her lips did odd things to him. His heart turned over at the way she tried to mask her fear. She obviously had no idea how much she was broadcasting. Her fear was a tangible, living thing. He could smell it. He could feel it. He could damn near taste it as it vibrated t/p&gt;ihrough the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat will we do?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Terrence and Diego both put a hand out to her, each seeking to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Miss Grace,\u201d Terrence said gruffly. \u201cWe\u2019ve faced a lot worse. We aren\u2019t going down to a bunch of good ole boys with peashooters.\u201d</p><p>Rio felt her lift her head and he grimaced at the effort it took her. She trembled against him and his gut clenched. She wasn\u2019t doing well at all. He knew it like he knew nothing else. They had to get her somewhere she could have medical attention or she wasn\u2019t going to make it.</p><p>\u201cWhere will we go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Her head rested on his shoulder again as if she no longer had the strength to hold it up. He could feel her breaths huff out in tiny little bursts against his neck.</p><p>It was then he felt the desolation and...the acceptance. Her acceptance. She\u2019d resigned herself to death. Embraced it even. Sorrow surrounded him, pulled at him. She knew she was dying but she didn\u2019t want to die out here in the cold. In the unknown. Afraid. She didn\u2019t want to die afraid.</p><p>Rage blew through him. Helpless rage. He wanted to hit something but he remained still, not wanting to add to her pain. He met the gazes of Diego and Terrence.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cWe need a backup plan yesterday.\u201d He stared hard at his teammates, his lips curled up in a snarl. \u201cShe\u2019s not dying on my watch. Split up. Find us a place we can hunker down and give her some time to heal. We\u2019ll figure out a plan after she\u2019s taken care of.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe need to find a place for you to stay with Grace while we scout,\u201d Diego said. \u201cThat\u2019s our first priority.\u201d</p><p>Terrence nodded his agreement.</p><p>Rio glanced over his shoulder but he sensed that Grace had slipped under again, no longer aware or maybe no longer caring of her surroundings. He knew he had to move fast. He didn\u2019t have much time because she was fading more rapidly by the minute.</p><p>\u201cYou hang in there, Grace,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare give up.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t even stir. Rio\u2019s men gathered in a tight perimeter and they struck out again, this time heading back up in elevation and away from where the SUVs were parked.</p><p>Terrence fell in beside Rio and murmured in a low voice, \u201cI can radio Sam. Tell him what\u2019s up. Ask for backup. He could send a helo in. Might take the better part of a day but we\u2019d be out of here.\u201d</p><p>Rio knew the best thing, the right thing, was to report back to his boss. If he had such a thing. True, he worked for KGI. His men technically worked for KGI. But Rio was his own man and his men were loyal to him. They went where he went. Followed his orders.</p><p>His gut told him he didn\u2019t entirely trust the situation at the KGI compound. Resnick was involved. Their CIA contact was up to his ears in the mess with Grace and her sister, Shea, only Rio didn\u2019t know to what extent.</p><p>But he had a bad feeling, a very bad feeling, and it was why he hadn\u2019t yet reported in to Sam about their progress or that they\u2019d been close to recovering Grace. Part of his reasoning was that he hadn\u2019t wanted to get Shea Peterson\u2019s hopes up. She was desperate to locate her sister, and Rio had made her a promise. Her. Not Sam. Not KGI. He\u2019d promised Shea that he\u2019d keep her sister safe.</p> <p>He blew out his breath. If he called in KGI, they\u2019d most assuredly come. But he couldn\u2019t rid himself of the feeling thatelyfeeling it wasn\u2019t what was best for Grace. Each time he started to agree and tell Terrence to check in with Sam, get the ball rolling, his stomach coiled into a knot and his instincts screamed at him to stand down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make the call,\u201d Rio finally said. He had to talk to Sam himself. Had to know what was going on and why he was so reluctant to relinquish Grace into someone else\u2019s care.</p><p>Right now he only wanted a place he could make Grace more comfortable and hopefully start the healing process. She wasn\u2019t going to give in. He\u2019d bully her mercilessly if that\u2019s what it took, but over his dead body was he going to lose her now that he\u2019d finally taken her from the people who\u2019d done so much damage to her body and mind.</p><p>For the next hour, they climbed higher. The sun was starting its slow descent and the air grew cooler the higher they went.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Diego called, holding his hand up to halt the others.</p><p>Diego pointed to a series of large boulders jutting upward from the ground. Resting against the side of a steep cliff, the boulders provided a natural shelter. The cliff wall provided cover from behind with no possible access. The only way in or out was the front and Rio could easily pick off anyone coming hundreds of yards away.</p> <p>\u201cHelp me get her down,\u201d Rio said, crisp urgency in his voice.</p><p>Browning and Alton hurried to unwind the bonds securing Grace to his back. Decker and Terrence lifted her weight and eased her away. Rio stretched his aching shoulders and then hurried into the natural enclosure.</p><p>Diego tossed him his pack holding medical supplies and two canteens of water. Terrence pulled the sat phone from his pack and laid it on the ground beside the sleeping bag Browning tossed down.</p><p>Rio quickly arranged the bedroll, and Decker and Terrence eased Grace down on it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do recon and find a place we can squat for as long as we need it,\u201d Terrence said. \u201cBe back soon.\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded and his men melted back into the trees, leaving him and Grace alone.</p><p>His first order of business was to make sure she was protected. Then he\u2019d see to her comfort. Dead was pretty uncomfortable by his standards.</p><p>He took his rifle and made a slow sweep of his surroundings through the scope. He took his time, noting the locations of markers and memorizing the landscape.</p> <p>After positioning himself so he had a prime view down the incline, he propped his rifle so it would be in easy reach, and then he took out several grenades and lined them meticulously against the base of one of the boulders.</p><p>Both the knives he carried came out and were placed beside the grenades, and his handgun came last and he put it on his opposite side. Satisfied that everything was close enough for him to grasp in an instant, he turned his attention back to Grace.</p><p>She shivered and chill bumps were predominant on her skin. Her lips were set into a fine line, even in her unconscious state. He wondered if she dreamed, if she was reliving her treatment at the hands of her captors.</p><p>Her muscles twitched and she moaned softly. Her fingers flexed spasmodically and she tried to curl into a fetal position, drawing her knees up toward her chest.</p><p>Knowing she\u2019d only hurt herself further, he straightened her and pulled the top of the sleeping bag over her body. He zipped it up, securing her firmly inside. For now he wanted her immobile and warm.</p><p>He slid his hand over her cheek, trying to offer what comfort her could. It seemed to work because she quieted and went still. He left his hand there a long moment before finally pulling it regretfully away.</p><p>He glanced at the sat phone and blew out his breath. It was time to check in with Sam.</p><p>When he received no answer, Rio methodically went down his list of contacts by command. It wasn\u2019t unusual not to be able to contact one or more of the Kellys but all of them?</p><p>With a grimace, he punched in Steele\u2019s number. Steele was the team leader for the other KGI team, and while they all worked well enough together, Rio would rather eat nails than have to rely on Steele for anything. The other team leader was an ice-cold bastard, more of a machine than a man, and he had an uncanny instinct for nosing out trouble, which meant no one ever got the upper hand on him.</p><p>Yeah, well, Rio was waiting for the day that changed. No one was blessed for long. Sooner or later, he\u2019d fall on his face, and Rio would try not to laugh too hard when it happened.</p><p>When he couldn\u2019t reach Steele, his gut started screaming again. Rio had left the Kelly compound just as Grace\u2019s sister, Shea, had been rescued and brought in for safety. But Rio hadn\u2019t hung around to get details other than what he needed to track Grace.</p><p>Something was wrong, which meant Rio and his men were on their own and it was up to him to make sure Grace got the care she needed. Which was fine with him. He\u2019d much rather rely on himself and his team. KGI always had his back, but he had theirs just as many times, and when it came to something important to him, he\u2019d rather have sole control.</p><p>He left a message with the resident tech guru, Donovan, but was purposely vague. An idea\u2014his idea\u2014had already started forming in his head.</p><p>He\u2019d been called stubborn. Rebellious even. He\u2019d had a career in breaking all the rules. No one had ever been able to contain him, and his respect and position at KGI had been the closest he\u2019d ever come to being a subordinate in any matter.</p><p>Sam trusted him, though, and just as often was content to let Rio go his own way. He didn\u2019t push his team leader. If he had, perhaps Rio would even now be solo. But for now he was comfortable within the confines of KGI, because it suited him.</p><p>After so long living and breathing those shades of gray, it was a nice change to be on the Captain America side. He\u2019d lived outside the lines. He\u2019d been the very thing he now loathed. People who\u2019d stolen young women like Shea and Grace Peterson. Used them. Discarded them. All for the greater good. As if there was such a thing. In this world, the struggle was never about good or evil. It was about money and power.</p><p>Grace would bring money and power to the men who managed to capture her and bend her to their will. If Rio had anything at all to say about it, they\u2019d never get their hands on her again.</p><p>His resolve to protect this resilient woman had nothing to do with penance or guilt. He was pragmatic enough to know that he\u2019d done what was necessary in his life. He had few regrets, but it didn\u2019t mean he wanted to remain a ghost. Nobody. Not real. Not existing. Having no life except to serve the next great ambition.</p><p>He was his own master, his own God now. He had only himself to answer to. As long as he could wake up every morning and look at himself in the mirror, he was content. As content as someone could be who\u2019d lurked in the shadows for so long that he dared not step too fully into the sun.</p><p>He glanced at Grace\u2019s still form and was compelled to touch the soft side of her neck. Her pulse pattered softly against his fingers and some of the tension eased in his chest.</p><p>It was difficult to explain, even to himself, his compulsion when it came to Grace. The first time he\u2019d laid eyes on Shea Peterson, something inside him had twisted. He\u2019d seen the torment n Athe torin her eyes. Knew that she\u2019d experienced more than most warriors had faced in their lifetime.</p><p>And then he\u2019d been confronted by the video footage of Grace standing in the living room of her parents\u2019 house. Frightened. Skittish and prepared to bolt like a spooked deer.</p><p>It had taken him back to years before. The image of Rosalina, his precious younger sister, had burned bright in his memory. Her belly softly rounded. The fear in her eyes. The knowledge of her own mortality. The knowledge that she wasn\u2019t long for this world.</p><p>It was the same look and the same feeling that he got from Grace. It spurred his determination not to let her slip away. Not like Rosalina had. She\u2019d died in his arms, never once condemning the asshole who\u2019d done so much harm to her.</p><p>It had taken Rio an entire year to track the bastard down and another twenty-four hours before Rosalina\u2019s former lover had died an excruciating death, begging for mercy the entire last two hours.</p><p>Killing was something Rio was no stranger to, but he\u2019d never before taken pleasure in it. Neither did he regret the task. He\u2019d learned early on to have no emotions. It made him a better soldier and assassin. But he\u2019d taken savage satisfaction in making his sister\u2019s murderer suffer. And when death was imminent, Rio had stared into his eyes and whispered Rosalina\u2019s name so that the bastard would take the knowledge to hell with him that Rosalina had been avenged.</p><p>Grace stirred and moaned softly, her forehead wrinkling as if she were in pain. He moved closer, laying his hand against her cheek so she would know he was nearby.</p><p>Dusk had blanketed the mountains and the chill had deepened. His men would need to return soon so they could move Grace to a safer, less exposed area. She needed time to rest and to heal before he took her thousands of mile</p><p>s away. To his world. His turf. The one place where he answered only to himself and he could be assured of keeping her safe.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>THE ghosts invaded her mind. Her very soul. They murmured. Shared their sorrows, their pain, their insanity. The remnants of so much death and illness weighted her down, mixing with her own pain.</p><p>Grace wondered if her own sanity had been sacrificed, if she\u2019d done too much, been broken by the repeated healings. Exhaustion and despair were every bit as prevalent as the pain, and she had no idea how to compartmentalize any of it.</p><p>She was an open book, broadcasting to the universe. No barriers. No shields. She was as vulnerable as she\u2019d ever been in her life.</p><p>It was cold again, and she shivered but even so slight a movement sent more pain through her body.</p><p>There was a man nearby, speaking in low tones. Fear was her first instinct, but there was something familiar and soothing about his voice.</p><p>She searched her fractured consciousness for clues, something to tell her he wasn\u2019t a danger to her. Then she remembered bits and pieces, it all coming back like some jigsaw puzzle that had been tossed into the air.</p><p>Rio. He\u2019d said his name was Rio and he knew Shea.</p><p>He\u2019d carried her a great distance, with her slipping in and out of consciousness the entire way. His men had disappeared, and Rio had placed her into a sleeping bag in an effort to keep her warm and motionless.</p><p>He had no worries on that count. She hadn\u2019t the strength or desire to move.</p><p>She blinked some of the fuzz from her vision and stared up at the star-filled sky. Fairy dust against black velvet. Carelessly tossed across the sky like someone throwing jacks.</p><p>How many times had . Smshe stared up at the stars, silently wishing she was normal, that she and Shea could live a normal life. That they could have their parents back.</p><p>She closed her eyes again. No, they weren\u2019t even her parents. She wasn\u2019t sure who they were. She hadn\u2019t had time to fully read Andrea Peterson\u2019s diary. All she knew was that she and Shea were some lab experiments and that Andrea and Brandon Peterson were scientists who\u2019d stolen Grace and Shea as very young children and raised them as their own.</p><p>\u201cGrace, are you awake?\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s voice was quiet in the dark, barely a discernible whisper.</p><p>She nodded and then thought how ridiculous it was because he wouldn\u2019t see the small movement.</p><p>She inhaled through her nose and then whispered back, \u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He moved closer, and when he did, she could see he held an automatic rifle, and though he shifted so he was against her, his gaze was still trained on the distance, watching, observing, never once looking down at her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ve been cut off from my men. I don\u2019t want to engage. It\u2019s too dangerous. You could be hurt or killed. I\u2019ve told my men to stay put where they are. You and I will find an alternate route to where they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut off how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are men looking for you and they\u2019re in between our position and where my men found cover for us. I sent them ahead to find a place where you could rest and hopefully heal enough that we could make it out.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the haze surrounding her lifted and she fought through the ghosts battling for control. She turned, searching out his profile in the darkness. Maybe he felt her gaze or it could be a coincidence that he looked down at the same moment.</p><p>\u201cI can make it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not in a good way, Grace. I won\u2019t risk you.\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself up to her elbow, ignoring the pain the movement caused. \u201cI want out of here. You say you\u2019re not one of them. Okay, I believe you. So I want as far away from here as possible. Nothing you can do to me can be worse than what\u2019s already been done. I can make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t carry you,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t just you and me, I could take you like I did before. But I have to have my hands free to protect you, which means you have to walk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can do it.\u201d</p><p>There was a fierce edge to her voice that reflected strength she didn\u2019t have. It didn\u2019t matter. She would find the strength. The will. If her choices were staying here and risking capture or crawling off the damn mountain, she\u2019d do it on her hands and knees the entire way.</p><p>\u201cThen we leave now and go through the night. It\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and put her hand on his arm. He tensed beneath her touch and the muscles went rigid, giving her just a sample of the raw strength he possessed.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t die here and I won\u2019t let them take me back.\u201d</p><p>Rio put his hand over hers and curled her small fingers around his before squeezing. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to die at all.\u201d</p> <p>A tiny beacon of hope warmed her insides. There was such conviction in his voice. It sounded like more of a vow than a statement, and she grabbed hold of that promise.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel any change yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She glanced down at her arm, which was still splinted. She flexed her fingersy, her fi, waiting for the pain to shoot up to her elbow. Her fingers were stiff, but the pain had subsided to a dull ache. She wouldn\u2019t know about her ribs until she attempted to get up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better,\u201d she said, not caring if it was a lie. It was her turn to give him a little hope.</p><p>\u201cOkay then, this is how it\u2019s going to go down. We\u2019re going to move out together. You stay on my six no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy back. You stay behind me. I want you to put your finger through the belt loop of my fatigues, and when I move, you move. I won\u2019t go too fast and I\u2019ll be careful. If I tell you to get down, you drop. No hesitation. If I tell you to run, you haul ass. Whatever I tell you to do, you are to do without question and without hesitation. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll rendezvous with my men but it\u2019s going to take us longer than it will them because we\u2019ll be moving so much slower. They\u2019re going to have to cover more ground than us and do it double time so they can provide cover for us as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>She had a thousand questions but she knew the only thing that mattered was that they get as far away from here as possible. So she bit her lip and began preparing herself mentally for the ordeal ahead.</p><p>First she took stock of her most recent injuries. Breathing was easier even if still painful. Her arm was bruised, tender and still swollen, but it felt stronger, as if the break was already mending.</p><p>She knew it would take longer because she was so weakened, but she was gratified that even the few hours of rest had begun the healing process. If only her mind worked like her body.</p><p>She forced the weariness from her clouded mind and carefully pushed herself upward. Rio didn\u2019t help her, and perhaps he wanted to see how she would do on her own. Or perhaps he just wanted to prepare her for how difficult the upcoming task was going to be.</p><p>While he eradicated all signs of their presence from the campsite, she pulled herself to her feet and sucked in deep breaths of the crisp air.</p><p>Her legs trembled and the weakness in her pissed her off. She curled her unbound hand into a tight fist and planted her feet firmly, refusing to allow her knees to buckle.</p><p>She could do this. She would do this.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>His voice was low and husky next to her ear. She turned to see that he\u2019d secured his pack to his back and stood a foot away from her, studying her as if judging her ability to make it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand and pressed the stock of a pistol into her palm. \u201cIt\u2019s loaded. Here\u2019s the safety. If worse comes to worst, just point, fire and keep on firing.\u201d</p><p>Her hand shook as she pulled the gun back. She looked down, not having any clue where to put it. Rio gently took it from her, turned around and slipped it into a leather holster attached to his pants a mere inch from where he\u2019d instructed her to slide her finger through his belt loop. Then he moved in front of her.</p><p>She slid two fingers through the loop and took a step forward, wanting to be as close as possible without hindering his forward progress. There were no words for how much she didn\u2019t want to be doing this.</p><p>Her body screamed at her for mercy. She needed rest. She was at her limit\u2014beyond her limit. She had been for some time. But she couldn\u2019t stop now. She had no choice. It was do or die, and she didn\u2019t want to die no matter that she\u2019d come so close to giving in.</p><p>\u201c th1em\"&gt;I can do this, Rio,\u201d she said in a</p><p>low voice.</p><p>He surprised her by reaching back, closing his hand briefly over hers in a gesture of support. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>RIO\u2019S goal was to get them to the plateau. His men would do their jobs and have transport there waiting. Rio\u2019s job was to avoid engaging the enemy and get Grace safely under their radar.</p><p>It was a painstaking journey, one that Rio himself could make in a tenth of the time it was taking him to traverse the terrain with Grace slowly at his back. But she didn\u2019t offer complaint and she hadn\u2019t gone down even once. For that alone, she earned his respect.</p><p>He halted in his tracks when Grace yanked on his belt loop to stop him. She pressed in close to his back, her body flush against his as she strained upward so her mouth was close to his ear.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone out there,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know you probably think I\u2019m crazy, but I can hear him. Just ahead. He\u2019s cold and angry and he\u2019s thinking that he\u2019d just like to kill the little bitch and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>Rio stiffened. He didn\u2019t think she was crazy. He wasn\u2019t sure what her abilities were. From what he\u2019d gathered, Shea\u2019s were random and not controlled by her at all. Her telepathy wasn\u2019t something she could aim or even use at will. But was Grace more stable? How the hell was she picking up on someone in the distance?</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he asked. It wasn\u2019t that he doubted her, but he needed all the information at his disposal.</p><p>She leaned her forehead tiredly against his back. \u201cI can\u2019t pick up on everyone, but this particular guy is broadcasting loudly. He\u2019s an open book. No shields. No natural barriers. He\u2019s pissed off, and the angrier he becomes, the more I pick up on his brain waves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else? I need to know how many are with him. If he\u2019s armed. I need to know exactly what you see.\u201d</p><p>She went quiet, resting against him. One hand curled against his shoulder and she seemed to be concentrating hard.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on post,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s pissed because it\u2019s just him and one other guy who he thinks is inferior. They were told to take position. Their goal is to form a triangle and pin us in. I don\u2019t know how many, but there must be enough to stagger men over a wide area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Rio said approvingly. He reached behind him to squeeze the hand that had dropped down his back. \u201cThat\u2019s information we can use. I can take two out before they ever know what hit them. We punch a hole in their line and slip through.\u201d</p><p>He felt her sudden surge of excitement. She straightened against him, her hand squeezing his. It was as if his matter-of-fact way of laying out his plan had infused her with confidence and renewed hope.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>The quiet tone was far different from the defeat he\u2019d heard earlier in her voice. This time there was fierce determination.</p><p>\u201cHow far, do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. Not far, though. He\u2019s very loud in my mind.\u201d</p><p>He turned and eased her into a sitting position against a large aspen. \u201cStay here. Don\u2019t move.\u201d He took the pistol from his holster and handed it to her. \u201cUse this if you have to. I\u2019m going ahead to take care of the two men. I\u2019ll be back, ten minutes tops.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and a9;ssccepted the gun. Her hands no longer shook and she gripped it like she was well acquainted with how to use the weapon.</p><p>He turned then, not wasting another moment. He melted into the darkness, heading in the direction that Grace had pointed him. Stealthily, he moved through the trees, able to move faster and more quietly now that he didn\u2019t have Grace behind him.</p><p>Slinging his rifle over his shoulder, Rio quickly shimmied up an aspen that was sturdy enough to bear his weight. More than midway up, he paused, locked his legs around the trunk and pulled his rifle over his shoulder to do a quick scan of the area.</p><p>He was quickly rewarded when he found the first target in his sites. Before disposing of him, he found the second, made sure there were no others in the immediate area and then squeezed off the first shot.</p><p>It was easily a three-hundred-yard shot, but he was deadly accurate. The first victim dropped like a stone. Within two seconds, Rio had the second man in the crosshairs and dispatched him just as swiftly.</p><p>He slid down the tree and hurried back to where he\u2019d left Grace. She looked up when he approached and he was pleased that she leveled the pistol in his direction.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d he called softly.</p><p>She lowered the gun and shot to her feet. \u201cAre they dead?\u201d</p><p>There was no regret, no anxiety in her voice. Nothing but hope that he\u2019d accomplished what he\u2019d set out to do.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead. Let\u2019s get moving. We\u2019ll only have a short time to get beyond them before they\u2019re discovered.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he turned, she grasped his belt loop and all but pushed him forward. He picked up his pace, trusting that she\u2019d keep up. She didn\u2019t disappoint him. They hurried through the trees, descending the mountain once more.</p><p>He took her directly by the downed men, not to horrify her or cause her distress, but because he dared not take a wider circumference. He didn\u2019t want to engage with Grace at his back.</p><p>She didn\u2019t flinch. She didn\u2019t react. She didn\u2019t even slow her pace. He began to wonder just how much she\u2019d endured. He knew it was bad, but he was beginning to think he had no grasp at all of the horrors she\u2019d suffered.</p><p>They didn\u2019t slow, and in fact, once past the dead men, Rio put on more speed, pushing Grace relentlessly. She stumbled more frequently and he knew she was tiring, but he pressed on. He\u2019d push her to her limits and then he\u2019d carry her the rest of the way if he had to.</p><p>He slowed to check his GPS when suddenly Grace shoved him hard. A shot sounded as they both went down, and the handheld unit went flying. Before he could react, another shot sounded in his ear and he realized Grace had yanked the pistol from his holster and had fired.</p><p>Instantly, he rolled, taking her underneath him even as he positioned his rifle to pick off any threat. Only silence greeted him and then the soft groan in the distance.</p><p>Holy fuck. She\u2019d shot someone.</p><p>He scrambled up, keeping his rifle trained as he crept forward. He barked a command for Grace to stay down as he headed away from her.</p><p>Fifty yards away, a man lay sprawled on the ground, his rifle just inches from his fingers. Rio bent and did a quick assessment in the dark, but the man was no longer breathing. Grace had nailed him right in the neck.</p><p>He glanced back in Grace\u2019s direction, stunned that she\u2019d just saved his life. He hadn\u2019t heard the man, and with Grace holding on to him, his reflexes wouldn\u2019t have been as quick. He would have likely gotten shot before he\u2019d have had time to react.</p><p>Instead, Grace had shoved him down and taken out the target with a single pistol shot.</p><p>He hurried back to Grace, kneeling to help her up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cFine. You?\u201d Her voice sounded strained and he knew it had to have hurt her when he shoved her to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great, thanks to you. How the hell did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI just reacted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you saved both our asses,\u201d Rio said grimly. \u201cLet\u2019s get moving. They\u2019ll have our location pegged now.\u201d</p><p>He very nearly grasped her splinted arm. It was easy to forget just how injured she was when she was keeping up his grueling pace and saving his ass in the process.</p><p>\u201cHow much farther?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Her tone suggested just how much she hated asking, and he also sensed just how close she was to her limit.</p><p>He retrieved the GPS that he\u2019d been consulting and studied the path they were taking. His lips pressed into a thin line and he stared into the night.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to keep moving. We\u2019re making better time than I counted on, which is good. If we can keep this pace, we should meet up with my team at dawn. If we slow or you can\u2019t make it, we\u2019ll have to bed down, wait for daylight and hope to hell we don\u2019t have to engage.\u201d</p><p>He could feel the quiet despair emanating from her. It was like watching a balloon deflate. But then she squared her shoulders, her chin came up a</p><p>nd she chambered another bullet before setting the safety on the pistol once more.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said in a quiet, firm voice.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>ONE foot in front of the other. Block the pain. Focus.</p> <p>Over and over, Grace repeated the same instructions to herself. She\u2019d long since lost count of the many times she\u2019d stumbled and righted herself, determined not to slow Rio. By now she was performing by rote, and only sheer grit was keeping her upright and moving forward.</p><p>She played this ridiculous game with herself. Each time they topped a rise, she told herself she only had to get over the next one. Finally she stopped pretending at all and she clenched her jaw and blanked her mind to everything but taking that next step.</p><p>She retreated deep inside herself, where there was no pain, no exhaustion and no fear. Only the knowledge that if she stopped, she died. They died. And this man was risking everything because of a promise he\u2019d made to her sister. She wouldn\u2019t let him die because she was too weak to keep moving.</p><p>Finally Rio stopped, pulled out another handheld device and studied it a moment before raising his head to stare into the distance. Her knees locked. Cramps rippled through her calves. Rio started forward and her finger slid from the belt loop that she\u2019d clung to for the last few hours.</p><p>He pulled up and turned, coming back to her instantly. He put his hands on her shoulders and tilted her face to look into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d</p><p>She made a grab for his arms just as her knees buckled. She would have fallen hard if he hadn\u2019t held her up. She bit her lip to keep from crying out as cramps knotted viciously, spreading into her feet and toes. Both legs were one gigantic cramp.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered brokenly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t. Go on without me. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Rio demanded.</p><p>\u201cCramps. Oh God, they\u2019re everywhere.\u201d</p><p>He eased her down onto the ground and then took both her legs, bending them at the knees and putting both her feet against his legs. He pushed forward, stretching her calves. Warm hands massaged and rubbed, easing the tense muscles.</p><p>At his side, he fumbled for a canteen and handed it down to her. \u201cDrink,\u201d he ordered. \u201cYou\u2019re not hydrated enough. I should have had you drinking all along. Stupid of me not to have seen this coming.\u201d</p><p>She drank thirstily, but the longer he stood there, open, exposed and vulnerable as he massaged the cramps from her legs, the more she panicked.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay here like this,\u201d she said desperately. \u201cGo, Rio. You can\u2019t be far. Go find your team. Leave me here and come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d he said tersely. \u201cYou go where I go. I\u2019m not leaving you so shut up.\u201d</p><p>Even the words so rudely said slid over her like the best kind of comfort. His tone told her that she was safe with him and that he\u2019d die before leaving her. Even as she knew it was what he should do, she was relieved that he had no intention of doing so.</p><p>He retrieved the canteen and then bent down to grip her free hand. \u201cOn your feet, Grace. Get off your ass and let\u2019s get moving. You can do this. Put the pain behind you, just like you\u2019ve been doing. We have an hour at most until dawn. Don\u2019t quit on me now.\u201d</p><p>His words should have infuriated her. She should have dissolved into tears and refused. She should have rolled over and given up. She did none of those things. The harsh resolve in his tone didn\u2019t fool her for a moment. There was worry and respect in his eyes, and she knew in that instant that if she didn\u2019t get up, he would simply pick her up and carry her the rest of the way.</p><p>She wrapped her hand around his and allowed him to haul her to her feet. Her legs screamed. More cramps rippled down her calves, paralyzing her feet. The strips binding the splint on her broken arm had unraveled and one of the sticks slipped out. The sudden mobility sent pain streaking through her wrist and into her fingers, but she ignored it, ripped away the rest of the splint and tossed it aside.</p><p>Later, she\u2019d never know how she made it that last hour. She didn\u2019t remember trekking through the aspen forest or forging a cold stream that went as high as her thighs at one point. She only remembered when she realized that the sky had lightened in the east and that dawn was imminent.</p><p>Dawn had become her talisman. The end goal.</p><p>The sky was a soft lavender and the morning star shone like a ten-carat diamond against velvet. The trees took shape around her and she could make out the terrain.</p><p>She\u2019d survived the night.</p><p>She staggered along, tripping and then righting herself before Rio could reach back. It had become important to her not to distract him. He slowed and it irritated her because she knew it was for her he had decreased his pace.</p><p>Not now. Not when they were so close. She could taste it. Could feel the sweetness of freedom and safety. Rio had promised to take her away. He\u2019d promised he\u2019d keep her safe. For that, she could fly.</p><p>She pushed at him, trying to force him to walk faster, but he halted and slowly turned, his hands framing her arms. His eyes were gentle, his touch even more so.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay now, Grace,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it. My men are here.\u201d</p><p>She stared dumbly at him for a long moment, not comprehending what he\u2019d said. Then she saw movement over his shoulder, Khis as saw Terrence step from behind an aspen. And then the others. The one named Diego and she couldn\u2019t bring to mind the names of the others.</p><p>As they neared, it was as if the last of her mental defenses crumbled. Pain screamed through her body, making her gasp as the full shock of it hit her with ferocity</p><p>she was unprepared for.</p><p>She heard Rio bite out a curse as her knees buckled. She went down hard, blackness wrapping itself around her like a warm, welcoming blanket.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>\u201cSHE\u2019S a mess,\u201d Diego said grimly. \u201cI\u2019ve reset her arm. Her respirations are shallow and her breath sounds aren\u2019t good over her right lung. She\u2019s dehydrated, run down, and there\u2019s no way in hell she\u2019s going to make it off this mountain unless we carry her. She\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she made it this far,\u201d Terrence muttered.</p><p>The two men hunched over Grace as she lay on the ground. Diego had given her a thorough examination and his face said it all. She was in a bad way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how the hell she\u2019s survived,\u201d Diego said as he rose. \u201cShe\u2019s a walking corpse.\u201d</p><p>Rio scowled fiercely at his medic and third in command. He didn\u2019t want to hear anything derogatory about Grace. She had more resilience and fight in her than most of the men he\u2019d served with in his years in black ops. His money would be on her any damn day of the week.</p><p>\u201cWhat are our transport options?\u201d Rio demanded.</p><p>\u201cI commandeered an old Chevy work truck,\u201d Terrence said.</p><p>Rio blew out his breath. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>Diego shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they had. Only they hadn\u2019t been carrying a woman who was more dead than alive. A woman who needed gentleness and caring, not a bumpy-ass ride down switchbacks in the bed of a farm truck.</p><p>\u201cI can make a bed in the back,\u201d Browning offered. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the Ritz, but it\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck would you know anything about the Ritz?\u201d Alton grumbled. \u201cFucking pretty boy.\u201d</p><p>Browning snorted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me mixed up with Diego here. He\u2019s Mr. Suave and shit.\u201d</p><p>Rio held up his hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve left bodies all over this goddamn mountain. We\u2019ve got to pony up and get the hell out of here. I\u2019m going to try and raise Sam again.\u201d</p><p>Terrence slapped his hand to his pocket as if remembering something. \u201cYou have a message from Steele. Must be important. It came in code.\u201d</p><p>Rio frowned and reached for the handheld unit Terrence pulled from his pocket. He punched in his access code and scanned the tersely worded message.</p><p>Resnick involved. Watch your six. Don\u2019t know extent. Don\u2019t trust him. Unsure of KGI status with him. Took Shea. Has history with both Peterson sisters.</p><p>Jesus H. Christ. If this didn\u2019t complicate matters. Steele was a cryptic bastard on his best day. What the hell was Rio supposed to do with this?</p><p>Rio wasn\u2019t one to give his trust to anyone. He respected Sam and the other Kellys. He wouldn\u2019t work for them unless there was a level of trust there. But he never went so far as to make himself vulnerable to anyone. KGI included.</p><p>Now, if Steele\u2019s message was interpreted correctly, Steele was effectively giving the other Nhis snyoteam leader a heads-up that all may not be well within the KGI ranks and that Resnick was a snake in the grass.</p><p>It didn\u2019t change that Rio still had to contact Sam, but it made him a whole lot more leery of handing over information on a woman helpless to defend herself.</p><p>He\u2019d already decided his course of action anyway, and it didn\u2019t include hauling Grace back to Tennessee. Especially now that Steele had warned him. His gut had already given him a heads-up, and now he knew it was legit.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s roll,\u201d Rio said in a grim voice. \u201cWhere\u2019s this chariot you arranged for us, T?\u201d</p><p>Terrence\u2019s teeth flashed and he tossed his head to the west. \u201cQuarter mile. Stashed in an aspen grove.\u201d</p><p>Rio knelt beside Grace and put his hand on her cheek. She didn\u2019t even stir. His gaze moved down her body, taking in her tattered clothing, the mix of blood and bruises, the makeshift splint on her bruised and swollen arm.</p><p>\u201cOne more time, Grace,\u201d Rio whispered. \u201cOne more trip. We\u2019ll get you out of here. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to remain as flat as possible,\u201d Diego said. \u201cI\u2019m worried she\u2019s already punctured a lung. I don\u2019t like her color and I don\u2019t like her respirations. They\u2019re becoming more labored all the time. If we aren\u2019t careful, we could end up doing her more harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t move her, she\u2019s going to be dead,\u201d Rio said bluntly.</p><p>Diego nodded his acknowledgment.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have time to secure her as they\u2019d done before to Rio\u2019s back. They didn\u2019t have time to do anything more than hoist her up and hope for the best.</p><p>Rio waved off his men. He was taking responsibility for Grace. It was he who\u2019d promised her he\u2019d get her out of this alive. It was he who\u2019d pushed her, bullied her and demanded that she give what she couldn\u2019t spare. He alone would carry her.</p><p>As gently as possible, he slid his arms underneath her body and lifted, rising to his full height, bearing her weight with him. He cradled her against his chest and then fixed his gaze on Terrence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m depending on you to get us out of here.\u201d</p><p>Terrence nodded and then motioned for the men to take position around Rio and Grace. Guns up and ready, they moved as one, taking a fast clip in the direction of the waiting truck.</p><p>The sun had just peeked over the horizon, a burnt orange glow lighting a pink sky, when they reached the grove of aspens where the truck was parked.</p><p>Rio grimaced. Terrence hadn\u2019t lied when he said it was a work truck. But as long as it got them the hell down the road, it would do.</p><p>As they neared the vehicle, movement caught Rio\u2019s attention. He dropped like a rock, instinctively positioning himself over Grace. His men reacted, forming a barrier between Rio and the potential danger.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shoot. I have business with Rio.\u201d</p><p>The words reached Rio\u2019s ears, and every hair on his nape prickled with apprehension. He eased Grace onto the ground and then jerked a thumb at Diego. Diego dropped to hover over Grace while Rio rose, his gun up, pointed at the man in the distance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here, Hancock?\u201d</p><p>This w</p><p>as bad. Worse than bad. Hancock being here in these mountains could only mean one thing. Titan was after Grace or at the very least had been sent to recover her.</p><p>Fuck.</p> <p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>EVEN though Hancock didn\u2019t so much as twitch, Rio kept his gun up as he circled warily to get a full view of the other man. Hancock watched coolly, his arms loose at his sides as if sending Rio a clear message that he wasn\u2019t a threat.</p><p>Which was pretty damn funny because anyone who ever thought someone from Titan wasn\u2019t a threat was deluding themselves. Rio should know. He\u2019d been one of them for ten years.</p><p>He\u2019d lived and breathed those shadows. He knew what Titan was, what they were capable of. What their purpose was. They weren\u2019t black or white. They were so gray that it was easy to get lost in the different world they lived in. A world where there were no rules and the law didn\u2019t apply.</p><p>He and Hancock had served together. Rio had saved Hancock\u2019s life in what would be Rio\u2019s last mission with Titan. Rio had walked away, never looked back. He hadn\u2019t wanted to look back. Only now his past was staring him right in the face, and he had the sinking feeling that past and present were on one hell of a collision course.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Hancock?\u201d</p><p>But he knew. He knew exactly why Hancock was here, but he wanted to hear it from the man himself. And then he was going to let Hancock know that it would be a cold day in hell before he ever touched Grace.</p><p>\u201cPut down the gun, Rio. I\u2019m armed but you\u2019d have me before I could ever draw. I\u2019m packaged up. See?\u201d He held up his arms so Rio could see the strap of the rifle and the pistol that was holstered just below his armpit.</p><p>\u201cI like my gun just where I have it. Now talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m repaying a debt. You get a free pass. This time. My job is to bring Grace Peterson in regardless of how. My team is at least two miles away. They\u2019ll stay there until you\u2019ve had time to move out.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head a notch so he stared Rio in the eye.</p> <p>\u201cNext time? All bets are off. I\u2019ll bring her in even if I have to go through you.\u201d</p><p>A growl rose from Rio\u2019s throat, and it took everything he had not to lunge at the man he\u2019d once called friend.</p><p>Then he turned sideways to look at where Grace lay on the ground, broken and so very fragile. Then he stared back at Hancock. \u201cTake a good look, Hancock. See what you\u2019ve done. Is this what it\u2019s come to now? Preying on innocent women?\u201d</p><p>Hancock didn\u2019t so much as flinch. \u201cIt\u2019s a job. Just like all the other jobs. You know the drill, Rio. Don\u2019t act like a fucking choir boy. You may have joined up with Captain America and crew, but it doesn\u2019t change a goddamn thing about who you were and where you came from. Your hands are just as stained as mine, and you\u2019ll never wipe them clean. I owe you. You saved my life. That\u2019s the only reason why you\u2019re walking out of these mountains. Don\u2019t make the mistake of underestimating me or of ever thinking I\u2019ll look the other way again.\u201d</p><p>Rio took a step forward. Then another. Until he was nose to nose with Hancock and could feel the other man\u2019s breath on his chin. His voice was cold, so chilled that it made the air around them seem warm. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to underestimate me. You stay the hell away from Grace Peterson. I\u2019ll take you out, Hancock, and I won\u2019t have a single regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we know where we stand. I\u2019m coming after you, Rio. This\u2019ll be your only warning.\u201d</p><p>Hancock took a step back, turned and then melted into the trees, gone before Rio could say or do anything further. As questionable as Titan ma [e a a sy be, they had a code and they lived by it. It would have been easy for Hancock to take a stand. Make a grab for Grace. He could have pinned Rio and his men in the mountains. With an injured Grace, it would have been next to impossible for Rio and his men to escape, at least not without getting themselves or her killed.</p><p>But Hancock was a hard-ass bastard who had a code of honor even if it was a twisted sense of justice. Rio had saved his life once and now the debt was paid. Not only had Hancock looked the other way, but he\u2019d tipped his hand and let Rio know who was after Grace.</p> <p>He only wished to God the information made him feel better.</p><p>He turned back and hurried to Grace, his jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was all that about?\u201d Terrence demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot now, T,\u201d Rio said in a clipped voice. \u201cWe need to get the fuck out of here before Hancock decides he\u2019s been charitable enough for the day.\u201d</p><p>Alton and Browning quickly set to work padding the bed of the truck with a bedroll. They even took their shirts off and laid them across the sleeping bag in an effort to give Grace as much padding as possible.</p><p>Terrence and Diego lifted Grace from the ground, and Rio hopped into the back of the truck, leaning against the cracked window. Next, Grace was carefully laid on the bedroll and Rio covered as much of her as possible. Her hair was an issue. Long, black as night but dirty and tangled from her ordeal. He tucked as much of it as he could behind her neck and arranged one of the shirts over her head so she wasn\u2019t visible. Not that it mattered, really. Hancock and Titan knew where she was and they sure as hell knew what she looked like. There was little need in concealing her. They just needed to get the hell out.</p><p>Diego climbed into the back with him while Browning and Alton piled into the front with Terrence. Diego positioned himself against the back window just as Rio had so that Grace was between them. With their legs stretched out, they provided stability, or as much as they could, so Grace didn\u2019t move from side to side.</p><p>Rio slid his hand underneath the T-shirt covering Grace\u2019s face and rubbed his thumb gently over her cheek.</p><p>Stay with me, Grace. Hang in there. You\u2019re not a quitter, so don\u2019t fucking quit on me now. Not when I\u2019m getting you the hell out of here. You\u2019ll like it where I\u2019m taking you. You\u2019ll do nothing but rest, eat good food and get better.</p><p>There was no response. No stirring in his mind. He hadn\u2019t expected one. Grace was beyond her endurance. He wasn\u2019t convinced she\u2019d survive this no matter how much he willed it to happen. And now that he knew Titan was involved, he knew they would be relentless. There would be no stopping them. It was a kill-or-be-killed situation.</p><p>No longer were they taking on some nameless, faceless, shadowy organization. Titan was government. Buried so deep that only a few even knew of their existence. Highly trained. The best of the best. Funding. Backing. They were invincible.</p><p>And they\u2019d been given orders to bring Grace in.</p><p>\u201cWho is he, Rio?\u201d Diego asked. \u201cYou haven\u2019t said a word. We need to know the sitch and you\u2019re sitting like a stone. I get that it\u2019s bad, but we need to know how bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs bad as it gets,\u201d Rio said grimly. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>He wiped a hand through his hair. Some of the strands had pulled free of the thong that secured it into a ponytail at his nape. He shoved a piece behind his ear and stared down at the slight bump in the bedroll.</p><p>Grace Peterson wasn\u2019t just another mission. She wasn\u2019t just another victim. [othim. [oth He had a very personal stake in this and he couldn\u2019t even explain why. He\u2019d volunteered for this job. Sam had been ready to send Steele and his team after Shea\u2019s sister, but after seeing the footage of Grace on the video surveillance just before she disappeared, he\u2019d demanded the assignment. Hell, he hadn\u2019t given Sam a choice. He\u2019d told Sam he and his team were going after Grace and bugged out shortly after.</p><p>There was no way in hell he was going to let Titan get their hands on Grace. Not that they\u2019d hurt her. In fact, he was certain they had strict instructions not to damage her in any way. But once charged with an assignment, they were relentless. Failure wasn\u2019t an option, and in all the years Rio had worked with them, they hadn\u2019t ever botched a job.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t their job to judge. Hell, they didn\u2019t have a conscience. It wasn\u2019t for them to decide right or wrong. They just followed orders. A conscience was for the weak. They operated as an emotionless machine, and that was what made them so fucking dangerous.</p><p>Rio rubbed a hand tiredly over his face. He knew Hancock would come after him with both barrels. It only made him gladder that he\u2019d covered his tracks so well when he\u2019d finally left. Rio had lived his entire life in the shadows. He didn\u2019t know any other way. He had a damn fortress in Belize, and until recently, no one but he knew of its existence.</p><p>Now KGI knew of it. The wildcard was Resnick. Steele\u2019s warning ran through his mind all over again. What was Resnick\u2019s involvement and could he be trusted?</p><p>He had to get in touch with Sam and warn him. If Titan was after Grace, they\u2019d sure as hell have pegged Shea too. Rio needed information and he needed it yesterday.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so it\u2019s bad. Give me more to work with, boss man. Will I need lube for this ass fucking?\u201d</p><p>Rio grimaced at Diego\u2019s dry humor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long damn story and I\u2019m not telling it more than once. When we get th</p><p>e fuck out of here, I\u2019ll give you all a full report. End result is we\u2019re going to have to watch our asses, and if Grace survives to see tomorrow, we\u2019re going to have to work damn hard to keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>AS soon as they reached a town large enough, they ditched the truck and Diego hot-wired an SUV. Driving a stolen vehicle was the very last thing Rio wanted\u2014having Titan breathing down their necks was bad enough. They didn\u2019t need local police interference.</p><p>When they reached Texas, Rio would have connections. He had people he could count on. Until then, they had to hope like hell they could get there in one piece.</p><p>The first call he made after making sure Grace was as comfortable as he could make her was to his buddy Lazaro to let him know he was coming in hot and he needed a plane to Belize.</p><p>Then he placed the call to Sam.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Rio,\u201d Sam said by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cNo, I need you to fucking talk to me,\u201d Rio said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Resnick and how is he involved in all of this?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause and Rio could picture well the deep frown on Sam\u2019s face. He wouldn\u2019t have liked the two team leaders communicating behind his back but oh well. Steele may not be Rio\u2019s favorite person in the world, but the man had his back and he had Steele\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDo you have Grace yet?\u201d Sam asked tersely.</p><p>\u201cI need you to tell me what the fuck is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is some ^his aas bad equestion as to Resnick\u2019s involvement,\u201d Sam finally said. \u201cInvolved, definitely. He nabbed Shea from the KGI compound because the stupid bastard was trying to protect her and Grace. What he did was get her abducted by the assholes who want to use her and Grace as their experimental projects. It\u2019s a long, involved story, but Resnick has a connection to the lab where Grace and Shea were born. Or rather they were created by pairing egg and sperm from donors with special gifts or abilities. Resnick was one such failed experiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear with me here. Grace and Shea were taken from the lab by the Petersons. They ran and kept running for most of the girls\u2019 lives. Resnick later funded them, but then the Petersons were killed and Grace and Shea went on the run. So not only was Resnick hunting them down, but so were the assholes who wanted to harness their powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what side does Resnick line up on then?\u201d Rio demanded.</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cWho the hell knows? He says he wants to protect them. He went to bat when we rescued Shea from a compound in New Mexico. He swears he\u2019ll go public before he allows any harm to come to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust him?\u201d</p><p>Sam snorted. \u201cDo I trust anyone who works for Uncle Sam?\u201d</p><p>Relief lightened some of Rio\u2019s edginess. He didn\u2019t want to question any of the Kelly brothers\u2019 motives, but he wasn\u2019t a fool either. They may sign his paychecks, and he gave them a lot of loyalty, but nobody got blind faith from him.</p><p>\u201cNow you give me some info,\u201d Sam said in an impatient tone.</p><p>\u201cI have Grace,\u201d Rio said in a low voice. \u201cShe\u2019s not good. Not good at all.\u201d</p><p>Sam swore softly. \u201cThis is going to kill Shea and she\u2019s still struggling with her own recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Sam. We\u2019re dealing with some heavy-duty shit. There are things you don\u2019t know. About me. My past.\u201d</p><p>There was heavy silence. \u201cI know you did a lot off the record,\u201d Sam said quietly.</p><p>\u201cTitan. Ask your man Resnick about it. He probably knows what it is. I don\u2019t have the time to explain. But Titan is involved. Black ops. Off the books. These guys are legit. They don\u2019t fuck around. They damn sure aren\u2019t amateurs. They\u2019re some of the most highly trained operatives you\u2019ll ever encounter. And they\u2019ve been called up to bring Grace in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, fuck.

Let Shea know...Hell, lie to her for now. Just tell her Grace is safe and is with me. Tell her whatever you have to. Between you and me, I don\u2019t know how much Grace has left, but Shea doesn\u2019t need to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Sam muttered. \u201cSteele and his team are on a mission.

If you need backup, you got it. Steele will be available in forty-eight hours or so.

Just don\u2019t get yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just protect your family,\u201d Rio said in a quiet voice. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll protect what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>GRACE opened her eyes and blinked at the stab of sunlight that shone through a dirty window. Her brow furrowed and she squinted, trying to bring her surroundings into focus. The last thing she remembered was reaching Rio\u2019s teammates and having the last of her strength flee.</p><p>Where was she now?</p><p>She lifted her head, shocked at the effort it took. She was in the backseat of an SUV. Looking forward, Rio and his team were crammed into the middle row and the front two seats. She struggled to sit up, and Rio turned in his seat, his gaze freezing her in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She eased back down, her breath leaving her in a hard whoosh. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Let me get back to you on that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, warmth flooding those dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cWe rolled into New Mexico a couple of hours ago. Making good time. If we keep pace, we\u2019ll get into El Paso by sundown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in El Paso?\u201d</p><p>She shifted and tried to sit up again, but Rio reached over the seat and put his hand on her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t. Just take it easy. Lie there and be as still as possible so you\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>She turned slightly so that she was more on her side then sighed when she was comfortable again.</p><p>\u201cAs for what\u2019s in El Paso, I have a friend there who\u2019s getting us on a plane to Belize.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes went wide and she stared up at him, mouth drooping open. \u201cBelize? Why Belize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy home is there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s safe. For now. We can at least have a place where you can recover until we figure out our next move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any ID. I mean no passport. No driver\u2019s license. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>Terrence turned, a wide grin on his face. \u201cThe kind of transportation we\u2019re taking isn\u2019t exactly American Airlines, if you know what I mean. They won\u2019t be asking you for a ticket to board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Rio slid his fingers over her arm. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry. All I want you to focus on is healing. Let us do the rest.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, realizing she had no other choice. She was at these men\u2019s mercy. She\u2019d already made her choice to trust them. She certainly knew what the other alternative was, and it wasn\u2019t an option. At least Rio hadn\u2019t locked her up in some cold, sterile room and forced her to heal like a trained puppet. At least not yet.</p><p>She lowered her head to the seat and closed her eyes. Belize. It s c Be a frcared her to death to think of going outside the United States. It seemed so permanent, like the final nail in a coffin. She had no recourse in a foreign country. No passport. No proof of citizenship. What could she possibly do if these men did turn out to be her enemies?</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t dwell on that because her panic was rising with every minute that passed. These were the good guys. She had to believe that. Because if they turned out to be of the same caliber as those who\u2019d kept her prisoner for so many days, it was over for her.</p><p>Rio shook her awake sometime later. She rubbed her hand over her eyes, not having realized that she\u2019d fallen back under. The vehicle was cloaked in darkness. It was also slowing to a stop.</p><p>\u201cJust stay down, Grace,\u201d Rio murmured. \u201cStay low until I tell you to get up, okay? I just want to check things out here first.\u201d</p><p>Rio got out of the back of the SUV then motioned for Terrence and Diego to keep watch over Grace while Alton and Browning took up posts on either side of the truck.</p><p>Then he walked toward the rickety storage shed that doubled as the \u201coffice\u201d for Lazaro\u2019s transport business. As soon as he neared, he heard the betraying click of a gun being put off safety.</p><p>He drew his own weapon and then called out, \u201cIt\u2019s me, you stupid paranoid bastard. Put your damn gun up before you get yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence followed by a scuffling sound. Then the door creaked open and a tall, lanky man stuck a shotgun through the crack.</p><p>\u201cRio? That you?\u201d</p><p>Rio sighed. \u201cWho the fuck else would it be? I called you an hour ago and told you we were close.\u201d</p><p>Lazaro slipped out, still clutching the shotgun, but he pointed it upward instead of at Rio, a fact Rio was grateful for. Lazaro was as jumpy as a frog. It wouldn\u2019t take much for him to accidentally discharge his weapon.</p><p>\u201cThe plane ready?\u201d Rio asked.</p><p>Lazaro nodded and jerked a thumb over his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s around back. Pilot will be here in five minutes. You\u2019ll make an unscheduled, off-the-books stopover in Belize and then the plane will continue on to Peru on a delivery route. I\u2019ve already done the paperwork and made it all official like. As long as you don\u2019t make a splash when you get to Belize, no one should ever know. Buddy of mine there is willing to keep it all hush-hush. No record of any plane landing there,</p><p>if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Rio clapped Lazaro on the back. \u201cGood man. I knew I could count on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet loaded,\u201d Lazaro returned. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a whole lot of time.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>\u201cWHAT the fuck do you mean, they escaped the mountains?\u201d Gordon Farnsworth bellowed. \u201cI called you in because you\u2019re the best. This isn\u2019t acceptable. Not on any level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your underwear on,\u201d Hancock said in a cool voice Farnsworth didn\u2019t like. It was too collected. It was too \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck what you think or say.\u201d On some level, Farnsworth knew he needed to tread lightly. Titan wasn\u2019t a force to be fucked around with. But desperation made a man do and say stupid things.</p><p>\u201cThe idiots who were hired to bring her in the first time made a clusterfuck of the entire situation. The mountains are littered with their dumbasses. We\u2019re stuck cleaning up their damn messes. Grace Peterson escaped because she\u2019s not acting alone. She has help. Good help.\u201d</p><p>Far fe Kel#x2nsworth swore. \u201cWho? Tell me who. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter who,\u201d Hancock said calmly. \u201cI\u2019ll find Grace Peterson and I\u2019ll bring her in. You\u2019d be best served to stay out of it and let us handle the situation.\u201d</p><p>It was the closest that anyone had ever come to telling Gordon Farnsworth what to do. No one else dared. But there was something in this man\u2019s voice that gave him pause. Farnsworth tasted fear for the first time in his life and he didn\u2019t like it a bit.</p><p>\u201cSee that you do,\u201d he clipped out. \u201cI don\u2019t have any time to waste. I don\u2019t have weeks or days. I may only have hours, and each hour that rolls by and she\u2019s not here is one hour I can\u2019t afford to lose.\u201d</p><p>There was silence in his ear and he was stunned to realize that he\u2019d been hung up on. Swearing viciously, he shoved the phone into his pocket and strode down the hall to his daughter\u2019s room.</p><p>At her door, he paused, breathing in heavily, ridding himself of the rage and the awful taste of fear in his mouth. Elizabeth needed him to be strong.</p><p>He pushed inside and saw the nurse he\u2019d hired to remain by Elizabeth\u2019s bedside day and night checking Elizabeth\u2019s vital signs.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d he whispered, afraid of the answer.</p><p>The nurse shook her head. \u201cNo change. She\u2019s resting easily. Breathing is good for now. No temperature.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth waved her away and then settled into the chair beside his daughter\u2019s bed. He collected her tiny, frail hand in his and bowed his head, staring down at his feet. He closed his eyes as cold fury laced with paralyzing fear gripped him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t lose her. She was the only good thing in his life.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He yanked up his head, surprised to see her awake and staring at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He put his other hand to her cheek and rubbed his thumb up and down, the knot growing in his throat. \u201cJust checking on you and saying good night. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>It was her standard answer no matter how she really felt. It enraged him that she sought to protect him. She never wanted him to know when she was tired or hurting. It should be him protecting her. Him finding a way to make her well again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said, moving his hand to her forehead to stroke away the golden hair. \u201cI need you to hang in there. I have someone coming who can help you.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth cast him a doubtful look. It was what he\u2019d said a hundred times before when he\u2019d brought in a new doctor. And always the result had been the same. Nothing could be done.</p><p>\u201cThis time will be different,\u201d he promised. He leaned forward to kiss her forehead. \u201cThis person is going to make you all better, and then think of all the wonderful, fun things we can do together. I want you to make a list. We\u2019ll do every single thing on it.\u201d</p><p>And he would. He\u2019d spend any amount of money in the world to make her happy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it tomorrow, Daddy. I\u2019m tired tonight.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand. \u201cOf course you will. We\u2019ll make a list together. How\u2019s that sound? Maybe we can order pizza and have a party right here.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth closed her eyes. \u201cThat</p><p>would be awesome. Maybe I\u2019ll feel better by then.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned Farnsworth\u2019s eyelids k019at w and he furiously blinked them away. \u201cGo to sleep, baby. Daddy\u2019s right here. I won\u2019t leave until you\u2019re asleep.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>THEY landed in Belize in the dead of night. Rio helped Grace from the plane after wrapping her in a dark, hooded coat. The warm, humid air was a welcome change to the chill of the Rocky Mountains. She embraced it, breathed it in to alleviate some of the cold that had settled into her bones.</p><p>Some of her shock had worn off and her mind wasn\u2019t as fuzzy as it had been for so long. But with the new awareness came consequences. Fear that she\u2019d trusted the wrong men. Memories of the horrors she\u2019d endured. Phantom pain mixed with the very real pain of her current injuries. It all mixed and swirled in her mind and body, overwhelming her.</p><p>Lucidity sucked.</p><p>Rio ushered her into a pitch-black battered van and instructed her to lie down in the cargo area. Truth be told, she\u2019d done nothing by lie flat on her back for the last umpteen hours. She crawled inside but sat up with her back resting on the side of the van.</p><p>Her rib cage was still sore as hell, but her breathing felt normal to her. Perhaps not quite as strong or as deep. She could tell her respirations were shallower than usual. But she was at least in the early stages of healing and already she could tell the difference.</p><p>She glanced down at her arm and slid her fingers over the area where the break had occurred. She flexed the affected fingers, satisfied that there was no lingering numbness. Terrence setting the break had helped enormously even if it had hurt like hell. If he hadn\u2019t done it, she might have lost the hand before her body began the healing process.</p><p>There was still some swelling, and definite tenderness and bruising, but there was no crepitus to denote weakness in the fracture.</p><p>In a day\u2019s time, provided she had ample time to rest, she should demonstrate marked improvement.</p><p>Rio hopped into the back a moment later, and the doors shut behind him. When one of the front doors opened, the overhead light came on and Rio\u2019s eyes narrowed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought I told you to lie down. I don\u2019t want you to make your injuries worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow is your breathing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she huffed out. She was still a little short of breath, but nothing that was going to kill her. She\u2019d already survived unimaginable events.</p> <p>The light went off as all the doors closed and the van pulled away. She and Rio rocked and swayed as they went over a series of bumps.</p><p>\u201cIs your house far?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUp the river,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cIt\u2019s a short drive to where we\u2019ll put in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe river?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll take a boat the rest of the way.\u201d</p> <p>She was gripped by a sudden chill and she wrapped her arms around her waist, ignoring the slight protest offered by the arm she\u2019d broken.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t shake her unease. So far Rio had proven to her that he was a man of his word. But the farther he took her from civilization and all she knew, the more her panic increased.</p><p>She\u2019d learned the hard way that she could trust no one. Her entire life had been spent on the run, moving from town to town, house to house, always shrouded in secrecy. And then when her parents had been murdered, she and Shea had split up and running had become their reality.</p><p>Had she traded one hell for an n Tellereother? How did she know Rio wasn\u2019t working for people who wanted to cash in on her gift just as the others had? Was he even now taking her to some isolated laboratory, hidden so deeply that she\u2019d never be found?</p><p>She began to shake, and she hunched forward, pulling her knees to her chest and ignoring the pain the movement caused.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d</p> <p>She ignored the question in his voice and laid her forehead on the tops of her knees, sucking in breaths.</p><p>His hand slid through her hair, gentle and comforting. \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on? You\u2019re shaking like a leaf.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and stared through the darkness. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>He scooted closer until his leg touched her feet and she could feel his warmth wrapping around her. \u201cOf?\u201d</p><p>She took another breath and opened herself to him, hoping that she\u2019d get something from him, some hint of his true intentions or at least if he was genuine or not. He\u2019d claimed that he\u2019d heard her, mentally, and she remembered his voice in her head but she couldn\u2019t be sure she hadn\u2019t imagined it.</p><p>\u201cOf you. Them. All of this. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ve traded one kind of hell for another. Same prison. Same horror. Just different jailors.\u201d</p><p>At first she thought she\u2019d angered him. Then she assumed he\u2019d rush to reassure her. But he did nothing. For a long moment he was silent.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smart to be wary,\u201d he finally said. His statement took her by surprise. She hadn\u2019t expected this. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot. There\u2019s nothing I can say that\u2019s going to make you think any differently. You\u2019re just going to have to see for yourself and make up your own mind whether you trust me.\u201d</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t saying anything she didn\u2019t already know, but it seemed different coming from him. And she supposed it didn\u2019t matter to him one way or another whether she trusted him or not. She assumed he was getting paid to do this and not acting out of the goodness of his heart. For that matter, she wasn\u2019t entirely certain what he was, who he was or what his connection to her sister was.</p><p>She opened her mouth, intending to get clarification on just that, when the van ground to a halt.</p><p>Seconds later, the back opened and Diego stood there motioning for them to get down. Rio went first and she crawled after him. When she reached the edge, he and Diego both reached to lift her down.</p><p>She landed softly on her feet.</p><p>\u201cCan you make it?\u201d Rio asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She stared at her surroundings and saw the inky black water of a river that snaked through the landscape. The moon was high overhead but covered by a thin layer of clouds, moving rapidly through the sky.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Rio murmured, taking her arm.</p><p>He led her to the water\u2019s edge and into an aluminum boat with an outboard motor operated by a hand-held lever. She stepped down and wobbled when the boat swayed. Terrence, who was already in the boat, quickly steadied her and held on to her hand while she made her way toward the front.</p><p>Diego motioned for her to take the bench directly in the middle. Rio came to sit beside her. Diego and Terrence took the front while Alton and Browning settled in the back. Alton took position to pilot the boat and a moment later they eased away from the bank and slipped downriver.</p><p>It was eerie traveling through the dark waters. The only light was from the sliver of moon visible through the hazy cloud cover. Unease gripped her and she warily stared swarout of t from side to side but she couldn\u2019t even see the shoreline. Only the dim shape of passing trees and what looked to be thick, junglelike terrain.</p><p>Fear knotted in her throat. Heavy silence was thick like fog. Only the gentle purr of the motor as they pushed farther down the river echoed through the still night.</p><p>Her heart thudded and adrenaline surged through her veins when she saw a burst of light to her right. She whipped around to see a flaming torch make two circles in the dark before quickly being extinguished. Rio uttered what sounded like an animal call, though she sure as hell didn\u2019t know what kind of animal made such a sound and she wasn\u2019t in any hurry to find out.</p><p>There was an answering call from the shore and then the sound faded as they continued on their way.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Rio said. \u201cNot now. Remain quiet.\u201d</p><p>Chastened, she hunkered down and stared straight ahead. This whole scene was something straight out of a horror movie or some terrible remake of Anaconda or something. She half expected something to explode out of the water and rip their boat to shreds then swallow them all whole.</p><p>She hated the dark. Hated being scared shitless and hated the thought of what was in the water below them.</p><p>She only hoped that wherever the hell they were going, they\u2019d get there soon.</p><p>Moments later, her prayers were answered when the boat turned and glided into a dark inlet off the main stretch of the river. Alton beached the boat, and Diego and Terrence quickly hopped out to pull it farther onto the shore.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Rio said shortly.</p><p>He urged her forward and Diego was waiting to lift her out of the front. Rio came next, followed by Alton and Browning.</p><p>She paused a moment to gather her bearings and stop the endless shaking of her knees and legs. Rio bumped into her then put his hand on her shoulder to steady her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not far,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cJust a hike through the jungle about a quarter mile. I didn\u2019t want to hit the inlet closest to the house. We\u2019ll circle around back and go in through one of the escape routes.\u201d</p><p>She arched an eyebrow. \u201cSounds like you\u2019ve got a place like my parents did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that. I don\u2019t much believe in paranoia. In my line of work, expecting the worst saves your ass.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>He urged her forward once more, but he kept his hand at her elbow, while Terrence and Diego led the way. Every once in a while they\u2019d stop and hold back a tangle of vines and branches so Grace could pass and then they resumed their journey through the dark. It was so dark, she could barely make out Terrence\u2019s hulking figure in front of her.</p><p>A few minutes later, they stopped and Terrence and Diego bent, pulled aside what appeared to be camouflage netting and then pulled open a wooden door from the ground. It reminded Grace of a storm cellar, only this was flush to the ground and not readily visible.</p><p>Diego dropped down and Terrence stood guard at the entrance, motioning for the others to precede him. Rio held on to Grace\u2019s hand until she found her footing and Diego was waiting, his hands around her legs as she descended.</p><p>The smell of dirt and mud was heavy. The ceiling was low and she had to duck, even at her height, so she didn\u2019t bump her head. This was no high-tech escape tunnel like her father had constructed. It was a tunnel carved into the earth, with no lighting, no support.</p><p>She ran her hand along the side of the tunnel and felt snned i dirt and a tangle of roots.</p><p>Then Rio flipped on a flashlight, blinding her momentarily. He handed it ahead to Diego, who shined it down the tunnel to light their way. Rio then moved in front of Grace to follow Diego, but he reached back to take her hand.</p><p>She found comfort in the gesture as he pulled her along behind him. He held her hand tightly, his fingers laced with hers as they plunged ahead.</p><p>They came to a halt a few minutes later and Rio pushed in front of Diego and entered a code into the electronic keypad. The barricade that looked like a solid wall of steel suddenly parted.</p><p>Once again, Rio reached back for Grace\u2019s hand and pulled her inside the door. They were in what looked like an ordinary mudroom.</p><p>\u201cShoes off,\u201d Rio said, a slight quirk at the corner of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m kind of picky about getting my floors dirty.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t entirely certain he was serious until the others started shucking their boots. She toed off her worn sneakers and then he unlocked yet another door.</p><p>This time, when they entered, it was into a spacious room that looked precisely like a normal residence. It was a living room, with couches, a coffee table, and a huge fireplace, although she noticed it wasn\u2019t a traditional wood-burning hearth. It looked like a gas log.</p><p>There was a multitude of comfortable-looking leather chairs and a huge big-screen TV mounted above the fireplace. It looked like a veritable man cave. The perfect bachelor\u2019</p><p>Rio flipped a series of switches, and more lights came on until Grace was blinking rapidly to adjust.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to my home,\u201d he said in a somber tone. He extended his arm with a slight flourish. \u201cMi casa es su casa.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>SAM Kelly stood on the deck overlooking an expanse of Kentucky Lake, gripping the railing as he leaned forward. He was waiting for Resnick to call him back, and he found he had little patience to play a waiting game.</p><p>When it came to his family and the members of his KGI teams, he was fiercely protective. With Rio\u2019s cryptic call, he now knew that both were in danger and they all had to be careful of every step.</p><p>Already he\u2019d sent Nathan and Shea away. Shea was still vulnerable and fragile, though she was improving with each day. Sam worried, though, that this would set her progress back. Hers and Nathan\u2019s both.</p><p>He sighed wearily. Sometimes the weight of so much worry wore him down. It was a burden shared by his brothers, but it didn\u2019t make it any easier for Sam to bear.</p><p>The door leading out to the deck slid open. Light footsteps and then a warm, soothing hand slid over his back. Sophie. His wife. The mother of his child. How could it be possible that she meant more to him with each passing day?</p><p>He turned, seeking the comfort of the hug he knew was coming. And sure enough, her slim arms wrapped around his waist and she went into his arms, burying her face in his chest.</p><p>He tucked her head underneath his chin and savored the sweet scent of her hair. Of her. Nothing ever felt as right as Sophie did in his arms.</p><p>She pulled away and tilted her chin up so she stared into his eyes. \u201cWhat are you out here fretting over?\u201d</p><p>His mouth formed a grim line. \u201cI hate this, Soph. I hate it all. I wonder sometimes if this family will ever find true peace. When does it end?\u201d</p><p>She reached up to touch his jaw, tracing a line with her fingers before stopping at his chin. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried about Nathan and Shea and now R vcaped Wiio and not knowing where he is. But Nathan will be fine. Joe and Swanny are with him.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand and kissed the soft skin of her palm. \u201cI love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI do know. I hate to see you like this. Always taking on the burden of responsibility by yourself. You have so many others willing to share it with you. Garrett. Donovan. Even Ethan. Your parents. We\u2019re a team, you know? We\u2019re family. And family supports family.\u201d</p><p>He trapped her in his arms and hung his arms loosely around her waist. Then he leaned in to kiss her. \u201cHow did you get so damn smart, Mrs. Kelly?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparkled mischievously. \u201cI\u2019ve been told ever since I came back into your life what family is for and what it\u2019s all about. Maybe it\u2019s time I started dishing back what I\u2019ve been served.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head until their foreheads touched. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty special woman, Sophie. My woman. My wife. My love. I don\u2019t want you to ever forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re mine, Sam Kelly. You damn well better never forget that fact, mister.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and then kissed her again. He was about to suggest they go inside and find some extracurricular activities to indulge in when the sat phone beeped an incoming transmission.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cI have to take this. I\u2019ve been expecting a call from Resnick. I need to tell him what all Rio had to say.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophie retreated a few steps but held on to his hand for a bit longer. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting inside.\u201d</p><p>He watched her walk away, his heart in his throat. It happened every time he watched her. Love was an ever-changing emotion. Strengthening every day.</p><p>Halfheartedly, he reached for the phone. He\u2019d rather be inside making love to his wife than on the phone with a man he was no longer certain he could trust. Resnick had been solid in the past. He\u2019d brought many of KGI\u2019s missions to them. He was largely responsible for the success of Sam\u2019s brainchild. Uncle Sam had certainly pushed enough money KGI\u2019s way over the years.</p><p>But they\u2019d damn sure earned every penny.</p> <p>\u201cI need information,\u201d Sam said bluntly as he put the phone to his ear. He was in no mood for pleasantries, not that there would be any.</p><p>Resnick had been responsible for Shea falling into the hands of the bastards pursuing her, and as a result, she\u2019d been all but tortured, hooked to a machine that monitored brain activity so that every time she tried to reach out to Nathan with her mind, she\u2019d received an electrical charge.</p><p>While KGI may have helped Resnick in the days following Shea\u2019s rescue, they damn sure hadn\u2019t forgiven him. Nor could they be certain how well intentioned he\u2019d claimed to be.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you need?\u201d Resnick asked.</p><p>Sam could perfectly picture the nervous, agitated bastard lighting a cigarette and sucking on it like a whore giving a blow job.</p> <p>\u201cTitan,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>There was a long silence. Too long. Resnick\u2019s breathing filtered over the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d Resnick finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI need to know everything you know about them and I need it all yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on, Sam? Level with me here. Titan is or rather was some heavy-duty shit. Deep. Like as deep as it goes. But they aren\u2019t anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean anymore?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me why first,\u201d Resnick p {1D;cessersisted.</p><p>Sam\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cListen to me, you little prick. You owe me. You owe KGI. More than you could possibly ever repay. If it weren\u2019t for me pulling Nathan off you, he would have killed your sorry ass. Hell, he\u2019d be there kicking your teeth in now if I\u2019d let him. I\u2019m not playing games with you here. I need to know who and what Titan is and why they\u2019d be after Grace and possibly Shea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Resnick breathed. His voice came out all shaky. Sam could hear the forceful exhale as he puffed on his cigarette. \u201cLook, Sam, back in the day, Titan was the badass. They were who you called in when no one else could get the job done. They cleaned up messes. They created them. They did whatever the hell the military or government needed done. No questions asked. Their fingerprints are all over some of the world\u2019s biggest shake-ups. But they never existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know how that goes,\u201d Sam said dryly.</p><p>\u201cThey never officially existed, but here\u2019s the thing, Sam. As of two years ago they no longer unofficially existed either. They were disbanded, retired, whatever the fuck you want to call it. A few politicians out to make names for themselves got a little too close for comfort so they shut Titan down.\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned. \u201cI got a call from Rio who says differently. He told me that Titan was after Grace and that Shea could be a target too. He told me to make sure Shea was safe and that he would take care of Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Resnick said eagerly. \u201cHe has Grace? He found her? Is she okay? When is he bringing her in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRio isn\u2019t taking any chances with her safety. He thinks, and I agree, that it would be stupid to put the girls together right now. He warned me about Titan. Said a lot of the same things you told me, which tells me he has firsthand knowledge of this group. If he says they\u2019re after her, then I believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Sam. Fuck, fuck, fuck. This isn\u2019t good. If he\u2019s right, then it means that Titan has gone rogue or for hire. Which means we have no idea who they work for or what their goal is. They could be working for anyone in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. My first priority is the safety of my family and my teams. I\u2019ve taken steps to ensure their well-being. Rio has Grace. I believe he\u2019d die before allowing anything to happen to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re willing to bet that on her life,\u201d Resnick said. \u201cBecause your man, Rio? Was Titan\u2019s front man from its inception until he walked away several years ago. Maybe you should think about that and whether you should trust him with the woman that he claims Titan is after.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>WHAT was she supposed to do now? Flop onto the couch? Catch some television? She stood stiffly as the others came in behind her, shedding backpacks, setting rifles aside and conversing among themselves.</p><p>She knew what she wanted, but somehow it seemed...rude. She nearly laughed at the notion that after all she\u2019d been through, she was concerned with not being Miss Manners.</p><p>She wanted a bed. Any bed. Hell, even the floor. She just wanted to be able to relax, let go of some of the awful tension and fear. She wanted to sleep where she felt safe and protected.</p><p>Rio took a step toward her and put a gentle hand on her shoulder. \u201cDiego is going to take a look at you. I thought you might like a shower first. I have a shower and a tub. Wi ~C;Fronted a bell you be okay on your own or do you need help?\u201d</p><p>Heat singed her cheeks and for a moment her lips went numb. What the hell was she supposed to say to that? Even if she couldn\u2019t bloody well get herself into and out of the shower, she sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to ask him to come in with her.</p><p>\u201cI can manage,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll show you to the bedroom where you\u2019ll sleep. After you get out of the shower, Diego will check you over and by then I\u2019ll have you something to eat. You have to be starving.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in confusion. It had been so long since she\u2019d eaten a normal meal that she\u2019d forgotten what it was like. She\u2019d lost weight and she could feel her ribs protruding against her skin. She probably looked like a damn gaunt scarecrow.</p><p>She rubbed over her slim abdomen as she stared down, almost as if expecting some sign of life from her belly. Truthfully the idea of food didn\u2019t appeal to her at all, but she knew she should at least make the effort.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Rio said gently.</p><p>She let him guide her through the living room and down the hall past a series of rooms. At the end, he opened a door, flipped on the light and gestured her inside.</p><p>It was a large room. Huge, in fact. And it looked masculine. It was then she realized that this must be his room. She shook her head and took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take your room. Surely there\u2019s another one I can have.\u201d</p><p>Rio smiled and shook his head. \u201cNope. Taken by the other guys unless you want to bunk with one of them.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead crinkled and he laughed, making her realize her expression had reflected her horror over that idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the couch. I just need a blanket. Not even that really. The couch will feel like heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d he said, lightly touching his finger to her lips. \u201cShut up. You\u2019re staying here with me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and her legs started to tremble.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so afraid. I\u2019m going to be camping on the floor next to the bed. The others will be just down the hall. I want you to feel safe and you will be. We\u2019re going to do all we can to make sure you\u2019re protected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sleep on the floor,\u201d she fretted. She pulled up her hands to wring them. Somehow the image of him lying on the floor while she slept in such wonderful comfort made her feel guilty. He was already doing so much for her.</p><p>Rio smiled again. \u201cHoney, the floor of my house is far superior to a lot of the places I\u2019ve slept in the past. I have some pretty damn fine linens. A down comforter and a few down pillows and I\u2019ll think I\u2019m staying at a five-star hotel. Now stop arguing with me and get into the shower. I\u2019m sending Diego in after half an hour, so if you don\u2019t want him seeing what he shouldn\u2019t, you need to hurry it up. I\u2019ll be in right behind him with food.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes watered suspiciously and she swiped at one with the back of her hand. A hand that was dirty and shaking.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare cry on me either,\u201d he warned. \u201cA woman who\u2019s survived all you\u2019ve survived doesn\u2019t cry. She holds her head up and dares the world around her to fuck with her.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled upward into a smile, but his gentle reproach just made her want to cry all the more.</p><p>To her surprise, he gently gathered her in his arms and hugged her. His big arms surrounded her and his chest was a soliestbed. Td wall of support. He held her there, smoothing a hand up and down her back to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Grace.\u201d</p><p>Such simple words and yet so powerful. Full of promise and encouragement. She hadn\u2019t realized just how badly she needed them. She closed her eyes and rested her head just below his chin. Then she carefully slid her arms around his waist and pressed herself more fully against him, enjoying the comfort of another\u2019s touch.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He ran his fingers through her hair and then gently pulled away, his hand still stroking her hair away from her face. \u201cGo on now. Get cleaned up and feeling human again. I\u2019ll put out something for you to wear.\u201d</p><p>What she wanted to do most was to lean back into his arms and wallow in the warmth and comfort of his embrace. She was starved for touch. Affection. Human contact that wasn\u2019t forced on her.</p><p>She missed her sister, and here, standing in front of this man who\u2019d hugged her, she felt the loss of her sibling more keenly than ever before.</p><p>\u201cYou say you promised Shea,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cSo you know her. You\u2019ve seen her and talked to her. How is she? Is she safe?\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s eyes softened and he once again touched her as if he knew just how much she craved it. \u201cHow about I promise to tell you all about it once you\u2019ve been tended to and had something to eat. Better yet, we\u2019ll talk over dinner.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded and slowly turned toward the bathroom. She fumbled for the light switch and trudged inside. She barely took in the gorgeous bathroom. All she wanted was a shower and bed. She spared a glance at the huge tub but decided it would take too long.</p><p>She leaned into the large shower stall, turned on the water as hot as she could stand it and then stepped back to strip out of her tattered clothing.</p><p>She looked like something out of the zombie apocalypse.</p><p>As she stepped into the shower, she clipped the door with her side. Pain shot through her rib cage, and wincing, she pushed herself under the spray, standing there a long moment, her chest heaving as she sucked in deep breaths.</p><p>Finally the pain subsided and she began the arduous task of soaping her hair and body. By the time she was done, she was exhausted by the effort it had taken her to do something so simple.</p><p>She was careful as she rubbed the towel over her body. There wasn\u2019t a part of her that didn\u2019t hurt in some way or another. Her arm was still weak but she was relieved to note that the swelling had gone down and the bruising was already fading. It only bothered her when she flexed and extended her fingers.</p><p>After wrapping a towel around her hair, she then pulled another of the big, soft towels around her body and went back into the bedroom.</p><p>She saw clothing laid out on the bed and headed toward it. She was halfway there when she abruptly pulled up, realizing she wasn\u2019t alone in the room.</p><p>Clutching the towel tighter around her, she cast a wary glance in Diego\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I frightened you,\u201d he said softly, almost like he was trying to calm a wild animal. \u201cI thought Rio had let you know that I was going to examine you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-He did, but...\u201d She clamped her lips shut to prevent the warbling and then tried again. \u201cI\u2019m not dressed. I mean he said he\u2019d leave clothing out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to check you over before you dress,\u201d he said.</p><p>She took an instinctive step back.</p><p>He put his h\"&gt;Hand she and up. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll get Rio. He should have been here by now with your food. It wasn\u2019t my intention to frighten you. He was supposed to be here when I looked you over. Tell you what. I\u2019ll go see what\u2019s keeping him. There\u2019s a robe in the closet you can put on until we get all this sorted out.\u201d</p><p>He opened the closet door, and a moment later came back with a thick, white robe. He laid it beside her clothing on the bed, flashed her a reassuring smile, and then went for the door.</p><p>Grace\u2019s shoulders sagged. Then she grabbed for the robe and hurried back to the bathroom before anyone else came into the bedroom while she was wearing nothing better than a towel.</p><p>RIO was heading down the hall when he met up with Diego. He stopped and frowned. \u201cI thought you were going to take a look at Grace?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah and I thought you\u2019d have your ass back before she got out of the shower. I scared the piss out of her. She came out of the bathroom in just a towel because you left her clothes on the bed. She wasn\u2019t expecting me to be there, and when I mentioned that I\u2019d need her not to be dressed when I looked her over, she went into meltdown mode.\u201d</p><p>Rio cursed under his breath. The last thing he\u2019d wanted to do was frighten her.</p><p>He turned sideways and slipped past Diego and entered the bedroom, only to find it empty. The clothes were still on the bed.</p><p>\u201cI gave her a robe,\u201d Diego said from behind him. \u201cShe was just wearing that towel, and she looked cold and extremely nervous. I thought the robe would make her feel not quite so vulnerable and it\u2019s possible that we can work it so that she stays mostly covered except for each part I check out in turn.\u201d</p> <p>Rio thrust the tray at Diego. \u201cHere, you take this. I\u2019ll get Grace out of the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Diego took the tray and Rio hurried toward the bathroom door. He knocked softly. \u201cGrace? Honey, you can come out now. I brought you some food. If you\u2019ll let Diego check you over, then I\u2019ll get rid of him so you can relax and eat and then we\u2019ll talk about Shea.\u201d</p><p>Rio turned to see Diego throw him a sour look. \u201cGee thanks,\u201d Diego mouthed.</p><p>The door cracked open and Rio turned back around to see Grace peering out, her eyes wide and wary.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou ready to do this? We just need to make sure you\u2019re okay and don\u2019t need more medical attention than what we can provide you. He\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you here,\u201d she said in barely above a whisper.</p><p>His chest kind of caved in at the vulnerability in her voice. Already, whether she realized it or acknowledged it, there was a thread of trust between them. She felt safe with him. It was a start.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he promised. \u201cCome on out so we can get this over with before your food gets cold. I had gumbo in the freezer and I nuked it. It\u2019ll cure what ails you for sure. The ultimate comfort food.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand, holding it just outside the crack in the door where she could see it. Slowly, she opened the door wider and then slid her hand into his.</p><p>It was soft against the roughness of his. Velvety. An electric sensation shivered up his arm, prickling the hair all the way to his nape. Then she wrapped her slender fingers more firmly around his.</p><p>She was enveloped in his robe. It dragged the floor at her feet and the sleeves fell to her knuckles. She had it wrapped almost double around her and he smiled at the image she presented, all damp and, e fd shiny and wearing his clothing. He liked it and felt rather stupid about that fact.</p> <p>He shook himself out of his stupor and tugged her into the bedroom. Diego had put her tray on the nightstand and stood away as if not wanting to overwhelm Grace more than she already was.</p><p>He led her to the bed and then paused. He put one hand on her shoulder and turned her so she looked directly into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow you tell me how you want to do this, okay? I can leave, I can stay, I can sit beside you and not look. I\u2019ll hold your hand. You\u2019ll know I\u2019m here but I won\u2019t do anything to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stay next to me. I mean unless you aren\u2019t comfortable with it,\u201d she added hastily. Then she closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m being stupid. I\u2019m sorry. I can do this.\u201d</p><p>Rio tucked his fingers underneath her chin and nudged upward. \u201cGrace, you\u2019ve been brutalized by ruthless men over and over. I\u2019d be a little worried if this didn\u2019t freak you out on some level. You\u2019re not stupid.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath and then glanced nervously in Diego\u2019s direction. Then her shoulders sagged and she started to untie the robe. \u201cLet\u2019s just get it over with.\u201d</p><p>Diego stepped forward and put his hand gently on Grace\u2019s hand to stop her. \u201cGo to the side of the bed. Undo your robe. Rio and I will turn our backs while you get on the bed. Once you\u2019re there, cover yourself with the robe. I\u2019ll only uncover what I need as I examine you, okay?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a tremulous smile. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>Rio dutifully turned his back while Grace walked around to the side. A moment later, he heard her move onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou can turn around now,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Rio and Diego turned, though Diego didn\u2019t spend any time staring. He swiftly moved around to the side, brisk and all business. Rio stood for a moment, staring down at the woman with a robe pulled up to her chin. Only her bare feet and a portion of her legs poked out from underneath.</p><p>She looked...She looked scared and nervous and he wanted more than anything to make it all go away. He went around to the opposite side and then climbed onto the bed. He plumped the pillows behind his back so he could prop up beside her and then he reached for her hand and squeezed.</p><p>She smiled and it did funny things to his throat and his chest.</p><p>On her other side, Diego examined her injured arm, holding it up, asking her to flex and extend her fingers and then her wrist and then to bend at the elbow. She did all without complaint, though he saw a slight grimace when she made a fist.</p><p>Diego gently laid her arm back down and then pushed the robe up just enough that he bared a portion of her rib cage. He examined a small area, stopping to ask her if it hurt, then continued over the rest of her abdomen.</p><p>\u201cDid most of this happen when you fell?\u201d Diego asked. \u201cOr were you injured before that as well?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me. Take your time.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at Rio and he squeezed her hand again just to let her know that it was okay. She turned her head so that she stared up at the ceiling and then she took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cBefore the fall, I was sick, injured, ill, whatever you want to call it because I\u2019d healed so many people in a very short period of time. I never got a break. It was one after another, a never-ending litany of pain and madness. I was weak and I was sure I was going to die.</p><p>\u201c\"1e He wentWhen I fell, those injuries were...real time. Not that the others weren\u2019t. They were just different. They happened directly to me, not because I absorbed them from someone else. So to answer your question, the injuries from the fall were just more in a line of injuries, but the others had already started to heal, or as much as they could, given the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Rio and Diego exchanged glances. She gave a very cut-and-dried explanation, but the underlying despair and anguish in her voice came through loud and clear. She\u2019d suffered greatly. And even though the physical wounds would heal, the emotional wounds cut deep and would remain with her forever.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Grace, almost done. But I need you to tell me what all you hurt when you fell. You were a little out of it before. You said ribs and your arm. What about your head? Do you hurt anywhere else?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips and wrinkled her brow in thought. Then she slowly shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd how does it feel to you now? Does it feel like you\u2019re healing? Is it taking longer than usual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s slower. Hurts more. I feel more...fragile. Like I\u2019m still broken somehow,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Rio put his arm around her shoulders and then leaned into her. She immediately tucked her head underneath his chin.</p><p>Hell, she was broken. In spirit and body. How she was still so determined and hanging on was beyond him. He\u2019d sensed her acceptance of her fate and yet it was like she simply didn\u2019t know how to give up. Even as she was thinking of death, she was pushing herself with superhuman strength. Past all endurance. A point when most everyone else would have just given up.</p><p>Diego carefully arranged the robe back over her. \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re doing remarkably well given that you most certainly broke ribs and punctured a lung. Your breath sounds had decreased markedly on one side and yet they sound almost normal now. You have a full range of motion with your arm, and I can\u2019t even tell where it was broken. That\u2019s pretty damn amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I just don\u2019t know how to die,\u201d she said wanly.</p><p>Rio frowned. Diego\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t any better.</p><p>\u201cHow about we don\u2019t talk about dying and instead focus on getting you strong again,\u201d Rio said. \u201cStarting with a good meal. Diego, are you finished?\u201d</p><p>Diego nodded and started for the door.</p><p>\u201cDiego?\u201d Grace called.</p><p>He paused and turned around.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMy pleasure. You\u2019re an amazing woman, Grace. I\u2019ll never know how you made it out of those mountains in the condition you were in, but I\u2019m damn proud of you for doing it.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s cheeks colored under the praise and her lips held a glimmer of a smile as Diego turned and exited the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to turn away and get your tray ready,\u201d Rio said. \u201cWhy d</p><p>on\u2019t you go get into the sweats and T-shirt I put out for you and then come climb into bed. I\u2019ll fix pillows for you to prop up on so you can eat off your tray.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, clutching the robe to her chest. \u201cThen we\u2019ll talk about Shea?\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll tell you all about Shea.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>GRACE hurriedly dressed, nervous that Rio was so close and she was completely naked. Not that she should be worried in the least that he\u2019d be tempted or ove1C;Frshe shortaken by lust. The last year had been hard on her and the last months especially harsh.</p><p>It was when she was yanking the oversized sweatshirt over her head that she realized she was self-conscious about the way she looked...to Rio. Not the others. Just Rio.</p><p>Embarrassment tightened her cheeks. Of all the things she could be thinking or should be contemplating, how she looked to this man shouldn\u2019t be one of them.</p><p>\u201cYou finished yet?\u201d</p><p>She flinched and then realized that she\u2019d been standing there, hands fisted around the hem of her sweatshirt at her sides for God only knew how long.</p><p>She turned and hastily crawled back onto the bed. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Rio turned and she could barely meet his gaze for feeling so stupid. She was a grown woman acting like an irresponsible twit. She was more than embarrassed. She was pissed at herself for deciding to give her girly side even a brief moment of freedom.</p><p>If and when she ever got out of this alive, she\u2019d go book a day in a spa and get her fingers and toes done and indulge in pure girly delight. Then maybe she\u2019d find some hunky replica of Rio and let her imagination run wild.</p><p>Until then, she needed to focus on actually being alive long enough to worry over what color she wanted her toes.</p><p>He helped her sit up against the headboard and positioned several pillows behind her. Then he put one across her lap and reached back for the tray on the nightstand. He set it up across the pillow and the aroma of the gumbo wafted through her nostrils.</p><p>Finally her stomach came to life and it was like it suddenly caved in and began kicking and screaming. Sweat broke out on her forehead and her stomach knotted viciously. Her hands shook as she reached for the spoon.</p><p>Rio\u2019s hand closed over hers, halting her motion. Gently he pried the spoon from her tight grip and then he stirred the gumbo. He lifted a spoonful to his mouth and tested it on his lips.</p><p>Then he put it to her lips.</p><p>She was too surprised to protest, and the warm liquid slid into her mouth. It was heaven in a spoon. Heat traveled down her throat all the way to her stomach.</p><p>When he went to repeat the process, she finally found her tongue. \u201cRio, don\u2019t. I can feed myself. God, I feel ridiculous. This is so embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hands are shaking so bad it\u2019ll be a wonder if you get any of the gumbo in your mouth. It\u2019ll be all over you and the bed. Now shut up and eat,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>To reinforce his point, he put another spoonful to her lips and she sucked it in, savoring the burst of flavor.</p><p>After that one, he shifted position so that he was angled toward her instead of side by side.</p><p>\u201cYou need to drink plenty of water,\u201d he said in a gruff voice. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been hydrated and I don\u2019t want you getting cramps again.\u201d</p><p>Automatically, she reached for one of the opened bottles of water on the tray and took a long series of swallows. Once she started, it was as if she couldn\u2019t stop. She was starved for water. Nothing had ever tasted so good.</p><p>Rio carefully pulled the bottle down until she held it to the side. \u201cCareful. You\u2019ll make yourself sick. I want to get some nourishment in you as well.\u201d</p><p>As he continued to slowly feed her spoonful by spoonful, his other hand crept over her free hand. His thumb rubbed over the tops of her fingers. Just his touch soothed her, made her relax, and some of the terrible tension knotting her neck muscles began to disappear.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWonderful201, and,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything has ever tasted so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me when you start to get full or if you start feeling sick. I don\u2019t want you to overdo it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was already at that point, but she ate a few more bites because it was too damn good not to. Finally she leaned back with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m good. No more.\u201d</p><p>Rio scooted back on the bed, slid off and then reached back for the tray. Wordlessly, he ambled out of the room, leaving Grace alone in the silence. She strained to hear any other sounds in the house. The other men. But it was completely quiet.</p><p>They\u2019d probably all gone to bed. She felt a surge of guilt thinking back on just all they\u2019d sacrificed to get her here safely. Were they for real? She had so many questions to ask, more than her tired mind could even process.</p><p>She glanced back up when Rio reentered the room. He hesitated a moment and then said, \u201cI promised you we\u2019d talk and we will, but I\u2019d like to jump in the shower if that doesn\u2019t bother you. I\u2019ll be out in five. Think you\u2019ll be awake that long?\u201d</p> <p>Again, she felt guilt that he\u2019d put her before everything else, even his comfort. He was still wearing the same clothes he\u2019d been in for as long as she\u2019d been with him.</p><p>\u201cPlease do,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cTake your time. I\u2019ll be awake. It\u2019s important to me to know what\u2019s happened to Shea and how she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded. \u201cOkay, give me five and I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>He went to his chest of drawers, pulled out a change of clothes and then disappeared into the bathroom. She heard the shower come on through the closed door and she sank farther down into the bed, hoping she hadn\u2019t been lying about being able to stay awake.</p><p>WHEN Rio came out of the bathroom, exactly four minutes later, he was still toweling his hair. He hadn\u2019t wanted to stay gone long because Grace had looked like she was about to fall over at any second.</p> <p>He smiled when he glanced toward the bed and saw that she was indeed asleep, her head and body tilted precariously to the side of the mound of pillows propping her up.</p><p>Tossing the towel aside, he walked silently to the side of the bed, eased onto the edge and gently shook her awake.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWake up, honey. Just long enough to get you under the covers and comfortable, okay?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open and her breath ended on a gasp. He could feel her pulse racing against his fingers resting on her wrist.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d</p><p>She righted herself, pushing back against the pillows so she sat farther up. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably a good idea if you get some rest. You\u2019re dead on your feet.\u201d</p><p>Her face fell. \u201cYou said we\u2019d talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said gently. \u201cAnd I will. Just maybe not tonight. You\u2019re exhausted, Grace. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re even conscious right now. Any normal person would be damn near in a coma.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened into a stubborn line. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I want to know about my sister. I\u2019ll go to sleep after we talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I want you to get comfortable first.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand to help her off the bed and then he turned down the covers, arranged her pillows and motioned for her to crawl back in. Once she was setce hetled, he walked around to the other side and sat at the opposite end of the bed on top of the covers so they faced each other catty-corner.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know my sister?\u201d she asked before he could open his mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe helped an American soldier escape captivity several months ago.\u201d</p> <p>Grace nodded. \u201cYes, I know. I was sort of there when things got bad. I was worried that Shea was going to get hurt. Using telepathy for any prolonged period of time weakens her, and then there was the fact that she was absorbing all his pain.\u201d</p><p>Rio cocked his head. \u201cShea swears she\u2019s very different from you. She says she can only temporarily take away a person\u2019s suffering but she can\u2019t truly heal anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Grace said quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re different in some ways. But the same in others. Shea\u2019s abilities are random, a fact that has always frustrated her. She never knows who she\u2019ll connect with. Who she\u2019ll hear. Who will be able to hear her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? You have the ability to focus your telepathy?\u201d</p><p>Grace looked down at her hands, and Rio very much wanted to touch her. To somehow make contact. Pull her into his arms and just hold on to her until she knew she was safe.</p><p>\u201cI could. I\u2019m not sure about now. It\u2019s all a mess really. I\u2019m not sure how what they did to me will affect me in the long run. I severed my link to Shea because I wanted to protect her. But when I tried to reach out to her again, I couldn\u2019t. It feels random to me now. I heard the man in the mountains. He was broadcasting so much anger, I could literally feel him as well as hear him. But everything is silent around me now. I learned to focus my talent better than Shea did. But I don\u2019t have the same control now that I\u2019ve always had. Maybe I never will.\u201d</p><p>Her lips were turned down into an unhappy frown that made his chest ache. There was so much despair and fatigue in her voice.</p><p>\u201cSo this soldier Shea saved...You know him?\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded. \u201cI work with his brothers. They\u2019re all ex-military. They run a special ops group that takes on dangerous jobs no one else can or is willing to do. Sometimes we contract with the government and take military assignments that the government can\u2019t officially get involved in. Other times we do private sector jobs, like hostage retrieval, tracking kidnap victims, protection, basically anything that takes a lot of muscle and stealth.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s eyes widened. Her hands twisted nervously in front of her, and he could tell her unease had just shot through the roof. It didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist or being telepathic to figure out what was going on in her head.</p><p>\u201cGrace, listen to me. The people after you may well be backed by a government group. We may all be on the same team on paper, but there are any number of shadow groups with their own agenda and each serves a different master. We don\u2019t work for the government. We aren\u2019t government owned. We contract with Uncle Sam on certain assignments. We don\u2019t prey on innocent civilians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Shea now?\u201d she asked nervously.</p><p>Rio smiled. \u201cIf I had to guess, she\u2019s with Nathan and he\u2019s keeping very close watch over her. She couldn\u2019t be in safer hands. He loves her. They\u2019ve been through hell together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s all right?\u201d Grace demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s safe with Nathan and the rest of KGI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKGI? Is that the name of your...organization?\u201d</p><p>Again he nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who\u2019s after me and Shea?\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m not convinced that there isn\u2019t more than one faction after you. I saw the video surveillance when you went to your parents\u2019 house. Shea saw it too. She went there looking for you with Nathan. I promised her then that I\u2019d bring you home.\u201d</p><p>Grace closed her eyes and leaned her head onto her upturned palm for support. \u201cHow are we supposed to live when every moment of our lives someone is after us, wants to destroy us for their own purposes.\u201d</p><p>When she reopened her eyes, to Rio\u2019s dismay, they were glossy with tears. Oh hell. If she started crying, he was so fucked.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened after you went to your parents\u2019 house, Grace?\u201d he asked, hoping to distract her. \u201cWere you taken then? Did you manage to escape?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cShea was right. It was probably stupid of me to try to look for answers. I was just so frustrated with our lives. Or lack of one. We\u2019d been running for an entire year. Never seeing each other. Always scared out of our minds that whoever killed our parents would catch up to us. Jumping at my own shadow. Never trusting anyone. Someone smiled at me, I was immediately suspicious and couldn\u2019t get away fast enough. Someone says hello, I freeze up. Someone looks at me too long and I\u2019m convinced that they\u2019re following me. It was no way to live. I missed my sister. I wanted a normal life for both of us. So I went looking for answers. I found my mother\u2019s journal, or rather who I always thought was my mother,\u201d she said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cShe was just a scientist who created me and Shea in a lab and then felt sorry for us and took us away to raise as her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShea told us,\u201d Rio said quietly. \u201cShe found the journal you dropped in the escape tunnel.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s mouth drooped. \u201cSo she knows the truth now.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhat happened when you left? Did you manage to escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, that time. But they were close and I was panicked and stupid. I didn\u2019t cover my trail as well as I should have and they picked me off a few weeks later. I can\u2019t even tell you where I was. I was drugged for most of the time. Until they started bringing in their test subjects for me to heal. Then they wanted me alert and able to do their bidding.\u201d</p><p>Rio felt sick. He could only imagine what she\u2019d been forced to do and experience. The toll it had taken on her was something she may never fully recover from. The stupid bastards didn\u2019t even realize the precious gift they had. They were too busy trying to destroy her without even knowing what they were doing.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou said there could be more than one group after me.\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t know for sure, but it\u2019s possible from what I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day I escaped, the facility I was being held at was bombed. I remember hearing gunshots. It was chaos. The cell I was in collapsed and I was able to crawl out and escape, but many of the researchers were dead and I don\u2019t think it was from the explosions I heard. There was blood everywhere, like they\u2019d been slaughtered.\u201d</p><p>She broke off and put a hand to her head, closing her eyes as she swayed back and forth. Alarmed, he reached forward to touch her arm but she pulled back.</p><p>\u201cJust give me a minute. I had something for a moment. It was a brief memory of that day. I picked up something from a man close by. I remember how cold I felt and how fee afrightened he made me feel. I could sense his determination to find me and to destroy those who had any knowledge of me.\u201d She glanced back up at Rio. \u201cWhat does that mean? Why would he do that?\u201d</p><p>Rio blew out his breath. \u201cTitan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTitan?\u201d</p><p>This was the part he hated the most. He didn\u2019t want to frighten her. He didn\u2019t want to appall her. But he wouldn\u2019t be anything but honest with her because deception would only cause more problems down the road. The very last thing he needed was for her to bolt unexpectedly because it looked like he was trying to deceive her.</p><p>No longer able to sit still, he pushed off the bed and paced back and forth at the end.</p><p>\u201cTitan is a highly classified specialized military black ops group. Doesn\u2019t officially exist. These are the last-resort guys. The guys you call in to clean up messes, the guys you call in because you have no other options.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled in confusion. \u201cThen how do you know so much about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I used to be one of them.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she was completely still, as if she hadn\u2019t really processed what he\u2019d said. Then alarm flared in her eyes and she shrank back against her pillow. But to her credit, she didn\u2019t freak out.</p><p>\u201cYou said used to be,\u201d she said in a steady voice. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you any longer?\u201d</p><p>He stopped his pacing and looked at her. She was asking, not judging. His admiration grew for her by the hour. She was rock solid. Someone who didn\u2019t crack under pressure or fold in a crisis. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever met a woman quite like her and he\u2019d met all the Kelly women. They were certainly remarkable women. Survivors. Fighters. More courageous than most men.</p><p>But there was something about Grace that made him stop and take notice.</p><p>He eased down on the edge of the bed. \u201cI decided that unwavering, unquestioning loyalty wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side. \u201cSome would say those aren\u2019t bad traits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlind faith is never a good thing. Being a unit of automatons trained to do as ordered without conscience, without question...I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I lost a lot of my soul during my time with Titan. I\u2019m hoping I haven\u2019t lost all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>He ran a hand through his still damp hair. \u201cNot all. Depends on what side you\u2019re on. There\u2019s always a good and a bad depending on perspective. Are there things I regret? Yeah. But there are also things I don\u2019t regret. It was time for me to move on or lose myself completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd KGI is better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent,\u201d Rio said. \u201cWe decide what missions to take. We decide what side we line up on. The Kellys...they\u2019re righteous. Upstanding. They have integrity and principles. It\u2019s why I work for them. It\u2019s why my team works for them.\u201d</p><p>She looked relieved by that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShea is in very good hands, Grace. Nathan loves her a hell of a lot. He\u2019ll protect her with his dying breath.\u201d</p><p>She gave a wistful-sounding sigh. \u201cI\u2019m glad she\u2019s found happiness and that she\u2019s safe. It\u2019s what I always wanted for her\u2014for us\u2014just a normal life.\u201d</p><p>Rio reached across the comforter and gathered her hand in his. \u201cYou\u2019ll get there. KGI isn\u2019t walking away from this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank yox20 duringu. I don\u2019t know what I would have done if you hadn\u2019t found me when you did. I...\u201d She closed her eyes and bowed her head. \u201cI was ready to die. I think I even wanted to. I was just so tired. I can\u2019t even explain to you how I felt.\u201d</p> <p>Rio brought his hand up to touch her hair, letting one of the damp strands slide over his fingers. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in admitting you were at your lowest point. We\u2019ve all been there.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and met his gaze. \u201cWhat was your lowest point?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed because the pain of Rosalina\u2019s death still lived inside him. She\u2019d been all he had left. And he\u2019d failed to protect her as he should. In a lot of ways she\u2019d been the impetus for him to walk away from Titan.</p><p>\u201cMy baby sister died,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cShe was pregnant with a child. She was beaten by her lover, the father of her baby. All because she spoke to another man.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s face twisted in sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. What happened? Was he punished?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d Rio said bluntly.</p><p>Grace\u2019s eyes widened. She bit her lip and stared hard at him, almost like she knew and wanted to ask but hesitated.</p><p>He took the decision from her. She should know the kind of man she\u2019d trusted with her safety. She should have all the facts.</p><p>\u201cI tracked him down and killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Grace said fiercely. \u201cI hope it wasn\u2019t quick either.\u201d</p><p>Rio blinked in surprise and then burst out laughing. Her face was drawn into a scowl and her nose was scrunched up making her look...cute.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny man who abuses those who are weaker and defenseless deserves to have his balls cut off.\u201d</p><p>Rio smiled. \u201cIndeed they do. I\u2019ll spare you the details but he was repaid in kind.\u201d</p><p>His heart felt a little lighter. Not as heavy as it always did when he spoke of his sister. Grace looked like she wanted to go track the bastard down and kill him all over again. He found that ferocity very attractive in a woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said. She rubbed her hands up and down her arms as if she\u2019d gotten a chill. \u201cIt\u2019s the most helpless feeling in the world not to be able to fight back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helpless anymore, Grace. You\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand, curling her fingers tightly around his. \u201cThey took something from me, Rio. Something I may never get back. I hate them for it.\u201d</p><p>He scooted even closer, pulling her hand until it rested on the top of his thigh. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>Her face creased in anguish. \u201cMy sister. They took my link to her. I never realized how much I depended on it and her until it was gone. I hate the silence. I feel so...alone.\u201d</p><p>Rio carefully pulled her into his arms and laid her cheek against his chest. \u201cYou\u2019ll get it back. I have some exercises for the mind that may help. You\u2019ve been through hell, Grace. You can\u2019t expect to come out unscathed. You have to heal. Not just physically but mentally as well. Especially mentally. Your body will take care of itself, but your mind has been deeply bruised by all you\u2019ve endured. It\u2019s likely shut down to protect you. It\u2019s in survival mode just as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel hope,\u201d she whispered against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been without hope for so long, butr s with you, I can remember what it feels like to believe and have faith.\u201d</p><p>He held her for a moment longer and then finally pulled away. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked enough for one night, I think. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have more questions when you\u2019re not falling-down tired. You need to rest and completely heal. I\u2019m not going anywhere. We can continue this conversation tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and he tucked her back underneath the covers. Then he went to the closet, pulled out several blankets and some extra pillows. After arranging a comfortable spot on the floor, he turned back to her. \u201cReady for lights out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Already she\u2019d snuggled into the pillows and was lying on her side facing his direction. She looked tired. Worn down. Like she\u2019d been through hell. And yet he\u2019d never seen a woman who looked more beautiful to him. Maybe it was because he\u2019d seen the heart of her. Her spirit and resilience.</p><p>Grace had made a huge impact on his life in the very short time he\u2019d known her, and he knew he\u2019d never forget her.</p><p>He reached for the light switch and doused the room in darkness. Then he crawled beneath the covers he\u2019d arranged and closed his eyes. His muscles screamed their protest, and fatigue beat relentlessly in his head.</p><p>He had almost drifted off when he heard her soft whisper.</p><p>\u201cRio?\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and half turned in her direction so he could hear her.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>It was said so softly he almost didn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You okay?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you...\u201d She trailed off like she was having difficulty asking what it was she wanted. \u201cWould you sleep with me? On the bed, I mean? I feel...safer...when you\u2019re near.\u201d</p><p>His chest did funny things. His heart turned over at the fear and hesitancy in her voice. Hell, he\u2019d move a damn mountain for her.</p><p>He pushed himself upward and then flipped on the lamp. She blinked and then peered anxiously up at him.</p><p>Then he pulled the covers back and crawled into the bed. He reached back to turn off the light. Once again darkness settled over the room, and he turned back so they were facing each other, though he could barely make out her features.</p><p>They lay there silently, so still he couldn\u2019t hear her breathe. She was stiff and completely immobile, but he could tell she hadn\u2019t relaxed or gone to sleep.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>He lifted his arm and she immediately snuggled into his embrace. Her body was a warm shock to his, flush against his chest, her legs touching his.</p><p>He remained still, waiting to see if she\u2019d react or if she seemed uncomfortable with his proximity, but to his surprise, she burrowed farther into his embrace, emitted a sweet-sounding sigh and then settled limply against him.</p><p>\u201cThis better?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded against him, her head bobbing just underneath his chin.</p><p>For several long moments, he lay there, unsure of what to do next. Finally he lowered his arm, curling it around her midsection and anchor</p><p>ing her to him. She didn\u2019t even stir. She\u2019d already fallen asleep.</p><p>He relaxed, letting his head and hers sink farther into the pillows. She felt small and slight next to him, and he was further reminded of just how fragile she was and yet how much inner strength she possessed.</p><p>He turned his mouth nedy immodown until his lips brushed over her hair. \u201cGood night, Grace,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>GRACE awoke with a throbbing headache. Her brow wrinkled at the effort it took to open her eyes. She lay there a moment as she evaluated her body and her injuries. Then she lifted her arm, examining the place where the bone had broken. She flexed and extended her fingers, but other than a little stiffness, all seemed well.</p><p>Her dreams had been fractured, a mixture of reality and a product of her fears. She\u2019d tried repeatedly to reach out to her sister, and at this point she hoped she hadn\u2019t been successful because Shea would have been terrified for Grace, and the very last thing Grace wanted to do was upset her sister. Especially now that Rio had told her she was happy.</p><p>In love.</p><p>Protected.</p><p>Envy bit hard and guilt crowded swiftly in for thinking even for a moment that she was jealous of what her sister had.</p><p>She sat up, realizing that Rio had likely long vacated the bed. Sunlight streamed through the one window at the very top of the wall. She thought it odd that all the windows in the house were positioned that way. There was no view to the outside. Nor were they large enough for a person to fit through. She wondered if Rio had given thought to being able to escape in a fire.</p><p>She shook her head. Somehow she didn\u2019t think such a thing would ever escape Rio\u2019s planning. He seemed too focused and calculating to miss something so simple.</p><p>She moved slowly, though she did feel better and not as broken. She didn\u2019t want to take anything for granted, however. She wanted\u2014needed\u2014to be whole again and not just physically. There was a need that transcended simple desire for the woman she\u2019d been before this whole nightmare began.</p><p>She found a pair of jeans and a T-shirt on top of the dresser. Frowning, she let her fingers run over the worn softness of the material. She was struck by a longing sensation so keen that she yanked her hand away, palming her fingers with the other hand.</p><p>Tears stung her eyelids as she stared down at the clothing. Shea\u2019s clothing. When had she been here? How had Rio gotten these things?</p><p>Her heartbeat thundered against her chest until she was dizzy and swaying. She hated the anxiety that gripped her every time she considered that she\u2019d been too trusting of Rio and his men. What if they were the ones she should fear the most? Here she was in Belize, God knows where on some river way out in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>She closed her eyes and reached for Shea\u2019s clothes again, pulling them to her chest for comfort. For a brief moment it was like holding her sister again.</p><p>She\u2019d spent the night in Rio\u2019s arms because she\u2019d been lonely, afraid, and she\u2019d trusted him. Now she wondered if she hadn\u2019t been incredibly stupid, but then this was an argument she\u2019d waged with herself since they\u2019d been in the mountains.</p><p>More than anything, she was afraid of making the wrong choice and trusting the wrong people. For so long, she\u2019d refused to trust anyone else. Only Shea. And now that link was gone.</p><p>She pulled Shea\u2019s T-shirt over her head and down her body. Normally Shea\u2019s clothing wouldn\u2019t fit her. Shea was smaller, shorter, not as muscled as Grace, but Grace had suffered in the last months. Now Shea\u2019s shirt hung loosely on her.</p><p>Next she put on the pants, and other than being a bit short in the length, they fit her fine. Grace had lost a lot of weight. She was afraid to know how much.</p><p>She closed her eyes and inhaled. She could smellhis b th Shea. Could feel her wrapped around her just like her clothing was. If Rio worked for the organization that was currently protecting Shea, then Grace should be able to talk to her, right?</p><p>Then she could put at least one worry to rest. Whether she should be wary of Rio and his team or whether they were really the good guys here.</p><p>For the time being, if they weren\u2019t the good guys, she was at least being treated far better than she\u2019d been with the last people who\u2019d held her captive. So far...</p><p>She poked around in the bathroom until she found deodorant, a toothbrush and a brush for her hair. It was bedraggled from the night before when she\u2019d washed it and gone straight to bed.</p><p>She settled on the bed and set to work on detangling the mass of hair. Cross-legged on the mattress, she didn\u2019t overlook the normalcy of doing something so mundane as brushing her hair. Any other time she would have overlooked it, been in a hurry, not dwelled on something so everyday. Now, she was grateful for it.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she stroked the brush through the strands and tried to center her scattered emotions. She thought of Shea, focused intensely on the familiar path, but each time she reached for it, blackness swelled in her mind. Her despair heightened with each failed attempt to reconnect to her sister.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry, Shea. This is my fault. I shut you out. But I need you now.</p><p>Her hand slowed in its downward progression through her hair, and tears were hot at the edges of her eyes. She inhaled sharply through her nose and blinked them back. After several steadying breaths, she lifted her head, only to find Rio standing in the doorway, his gaze trained on her.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded slowly and retraced the same path with the brush, enjoying the soothing rhythm against her scalp.</p><p>\u201cYou seem upset.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, put the brush down and flipped her hair back over her shoulder. She let her hands rest on her crossed ankles and threaded her fingers nervously.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to Shea. I can\u2019t connect mentally with her, so I need for you to call her. You said she\u2019s with people you work with, right? I want to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Rio leaned against the doorframe, cocked his head to the side and studied her a long moment. Then he smiled slightly, his eyes gleaming with amusement. That smile made her uncomfortable. Like he had secret knowledge she wasn\u2019t aware of. She fidgeted under his scrutiny but refused to back down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me, do you?\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to hurriedly deny any such thing, but she wasn\u2019t going to lie. Instead she leveled a stare at him. \u201cI haven\u2019t made up my mind yet. The jury\u2019s still out. But being able to speak to my sister would go a long way in allaying my concerns.\u201d</p><p>The crooked grin got bigger. \u201cSome might say you\u2019re in no position to be bargaining.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks grew warm but she wouldn\u2019t allow herself to lose this silent war of wills with the stare-down. She wouldn\u2019t beg. She\u2019d begged until she was hoarse. Had begged for mercy. For freedom. Her pleas had fallen on deaf ears. Never would she do it again.</p> <p>\u201cI need to speak to her,\u201d she said in a controlled voice. \u201cIf I\u2019m not a prisoner, surely I rate this simple consideration.\u201d</p><p>Rio arched a brow. \u201cPrisoner? Honey, I carried you all over the Rocky Mountains on my back. If you were a prisoner, I\u2019d have made you walk it your damn self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did walk!\u201d she said indignantsaist mely. \u201cI made it by myself. Without your help. Maybe not at first, but I made it in the end.\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s face softened but his eyes were still bright with amusement. \u201cThat you did, Grace.\u201d He ambled forward then perched on the corner of the bed, turning so he could look at her. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee that I can get you Shea. I can try. You have to understand that she is in as much danger as you are.\u201d</p><p>Grace frowned as worry slid down her spine. \u201cI have to talk to her, Rio. She won\u2019t understand why I haven\u2019t reached out to her. She\u2019s probably frantic. I need to know she\u2019s okay but I also need to let her know I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p> <p>Rio glanced at her, his expression mild but his eyes sharp. He seemed to be contemplating the matter, and she hadn\u2019t realized how close she was to doing what she\u2019d sworn she wouldn\u2019t. She bit her lips to call back the plea. Damned if she\u2019d beg for anything ever again.</p><p>\u201cI can try,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI\u2019m not at all certain where Shea is. But I can place a call to Sam to see what I can do. There are conditions, however.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat conditions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to have your agreement to my conditions before I\u2019ll consider placing the call.\u201d</p><p>Frustration simmered and it took everything she had not to lash out and instead remain calm and centered as she stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat conditions?\u201d she said from behind clenched teeth.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m holding all the cards here, Grace. I\u2019m not trying to be an asshole, but it\u2019s imperative if I\u2019m going to keep you safe that you agree to my conditions regardless of whether you find them unreasonable or not.\u201d</p><p>She honest to God wanted to hit him. Her fingers curled into a tight fist, and she had to clamp her other hand around it to keep from flying into a rage. She was tired of feeling helpless. Tired of being subjected to the whims and subjugation of others.</p><p>As if he knew exactly what she battled, he reached over and gently picked up her tightly coiled fist. He rubbed his thumb over the white knuckles and gazed into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWould it make you feel better to hit me? You can, you know. Go ahead, Grace. Give it your best shot.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him like he was nuts. He wasn\u2019t angry. In fact, he was extremely calm. She couldn\u2019t wrap her mind around what on earth he was doing. Was he mocking her?</p><p>\u201cHit me,\u201d he said again. \u201cTake back control, Grace. Assert yourself. Did you feel weak and powerless when they had you? Did you wish you had more power? That you could fight back? Or maybe you were too scared to. Did you cower in a corner waiting for someone to save you?\u201d</p><p>Rage was red-hot, blinding. She swung, connecting with his chin. His head popped back and pain flashed through her knuckles. For a moment she was too stunned to comprehend what she\u2019d done.</p><p>He lowered his head, holding his chin. He grinned crookedly as he rubbed at his jaw. \u201cNice shot. We\u2019ll work more on getting more power into your jab but not bad at all.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth popped open. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d</p><p>Rio cocked his head to the side. \u201cI\u2019ve been accused of that a time or two. Depends on your definition of sanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hit you. Aren\u2019t you angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. She wanted to hit him again. He was so damn calm. Did anything ruffle him? She flexed herSheit fingers then glanced at his jaw, where a slight red spot marked his dark skin.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it did.\u201d</p><p>And she did feel marginally better. Some of her intense rage and anger had slid away as soon as she\u2019d exploded into action.</p><p>He smiled then. \u201cMission accomplished.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re nuts.\u201d</p><p>He put her hand down and leaned back. \u201cWe can work on a few self-defense moves. You\u2019ve got a lot of power considering how low your reserves are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to talk to my sister,\u201d she burst out.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you agree to my conditions, I\u2019ll do my best to make it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat conditions?\u201d she asked in exasperation. \u201cI can\u2019t agree to anything until you tell me what they are.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cOn the contrary, until I have your absolute agreement, you don\u2019t talk to Shea.\u201d</p><p>Hurt crowded in. For a moment she couldn\u2019t even muster a response. How could he use her sister as a bargaining tool?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bastard.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been called worse. And I\u2019m the bastard who\u2019s going to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>He was immovable as a mountain. Somehow she didn\u2019t think tears or feminine distress would make a dent in his resolve. Not that she\u2019d reduce herself to that level of manipulation. She had pride. She\u2019d been stripped of everything, her dignity, her will to live. At times she was convinced that her very soul had been forfeit. But she refused to let go of her pride.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I agree,\u201d she said in defeat. \u201cTo whatever it is.\u201d She braced herself for what those conditions would be and hoped she hadn\u2019t just agreed to a deal with the devil.</p><p>Rio nodded but he didn\u2019t appear smug over his victory. His expression became serious. \u201cI know she\u2019s your sister and that your inclination is to share everything with her. However, I do not want our current location compromised.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t they know where you lived? I mean, this is your house, right?\u201d Then remembering the clothes she hadn\u2019t mentioned, she said, \u201cFor that matter, Shea has been here. These are her clothes. How did you get them?\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands. \u201cOne thing at a time. Yes, they\u2019re Shea\u2019s clothes. No, she hasn\u2019t been here. I saw her last when she and Nathan returned from your parents\u2019 house just after you contacted her last. We had video surveillance of you in the house. Shea asked KGI for our help in finding you. I volunteered to go.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up in surprise. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his eyebrow. \u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you volunteer? What could you possibly care about a woman you didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>The corner of Rio\u2019s mouth curled upward. \u201cI get that a lot of your life has been spent dealing with people without honor. But not everyone is an asshole. I wanted to help Shea. I wanted to help you. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p><p>Ashamed, Grace glanced down, only to have Rio nudge her chin upward again.</p><p>\u201cAs for your other questions, yes, KGI knows of this location. They only recently acquired knowledge of it. But knowing I own it doesn\u2019t mean they know where we are. I\u2019d rather keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you trust them? You work for them, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do\"&gt;&amp;rned from n\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cNot when it comes to something as important as your safety. Which is why if you speak to your sister, the extent of your conversation has to be that you\u2019re okay and whatever pleasantries you exchange. She\u2019s going to want you to come home. She\u2019s going to want you right there with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be?\u201d Grace asked quietly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say when you first came to me that you were there to bring me home?\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded. \u201cEventually. When it\u2019s safe. When we know for certain it\u2019s safe. Until then the very last thing you and Shea need is to be together. Makes the enemy\u2019s job that much easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all I have to do is agree not to tell her where I am and you\u2019ll let me talk to her?\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded. \u201cI, of course, will sit in on the conversation. If at any time you venture into forbidden territory, I\u2019ll</p><p>shut it down immediately.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to argue but remembered that this was a take-it-or-leave-it situation. Rio showed no sign whatsoever of being able to be talked into anything.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she finally conceded. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>Rio rose from the bed and stood at the end. \u201cOkay then. Why don\u2019t you come out, get something to eat and then we\u2019ll make the call.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>GRACE walked down the hall shoeless, flexing her toes into the plush carpet. When she reached the living area, polished wood replaced the carpet and was cooler on the soles of her feet.</p><p>She paused just a few steps in, staring at the array of men slouched in chairs and on the couches across the room. They were watching a football game on the big screen and arguing about point spreads and fantasy football picks.</p><p>It all looked so...normal. Like she\u2019d stumbled into some bachelor pad. Not like she was surrounded by mercenaries hired to protect her.</p><p>Terrence looked up and saw her first. He raised a beefy hand\u2014one that was nearly as big as her head\u2014and waved her over.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Miss Grace. You don\u2019t want to miss the big game.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around, automatically looking for Rio. She found him behind the island bar in the kitchen, obviously preparing something to eat.</p><p>He dipped his head in Terrence\u2019s direction. \u201cGo on over. They don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>Wiping her hand down her jeans, she walked hesitantly toward the mass of testosterone. There was a mad scramble as they sat up straight and made room for her on the couch next to Terrence.</p><p>She took the corner, grateful to have a guy on only one side of her, and leaned into the arm.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d Terrence asked.</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cBetter. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Diego cast her a sideways glance, studying her for a long moment until she was ready to fidget right off the couch.</p><p>\u201cYour color is better,\u201d he finally said. \u201cStill a little pale but you\u2019re getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I think,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou care if I ask you something?\u201d Browning called out.</p><p>She blinked and looked in his direction. He was sitting sideways in an armchair with one leg dangling over the arm, beer in one hand, his other propped on the back of the chair.</p><p>\u201cUhm, I don\u2019t guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat healing thing you do. How do you do it?\u201d wane cD;</p><p>She was so used to being highly guarded when it came to any mention of her abilities that she immediately tensed and became wary.</p><p>Terrence frowned in Browning\u2019s direction. \u201cDon\u2019t be an ass.\u201d</p><p>Diego shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s only asking what the rest of us are wondering. We\u2019ve all met Shea. We know what she did for Nathan. According to Shea, Grace here is the one who helped Swanny when he and Nathan were escaping in Afghanistan. I\u2019d say that makes us curious.\u201d</p><p>Grace turned almost in panic, her gaze seeking Rio. He stood in the same spot as before, tending to something on the stove. But he was looking at her, his gaze steady and unreadable. Almost as if he was telling her that she was on her own. Fight her own battles.</p><p>For a moment, it irritated her that he wouldn\u2019t come to her rescue, but then realization was swift that he saw what she didn\u2019t want to. That she needed to toughen up. She needed to regain her confidence and spirit. How could she do any of that if she was always leaning on him?</p><p>She glanced back at Rio\u2019s men and forced herself to relax. Of course they\u2019d be curious. Any normal person would be. And they likely thought she owed them some sort of explanation given they\u2019d risked their lives to save her ass.</p><p>They\u2019d probably be right.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I do it. I just always...have. The first memory I have of healing is when I was very young and I found a bird fluttering on the ground with a broken wing. I picked it up and I can remember wishing with all my heart that I could make it better.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the men tuned in, leaning forward in their seats.</p><p>\u201cDid you? Heal it?\u201d Browning asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cFor a long moment it remained completely still, cupped in my palms. Then it started flapping and struggling, trying to get away, so I opened my hands and it flew off. But the next thing I knew, I felt this awful pain in my arm. I could literally feel my own bone breaking. I was terrified. I went running to my mother, who told me I was never to do such a thing again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShea was with her and she took my pain. I can remember being on my mother\u2019s lap and having Shea put her hands around my arm. Her face was so solemn. I can still remember what she said. \u2018I\u2019ll make it better, Grace.\u2019 And she did. At least temporarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s heavy,\u201d Decker said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what the two of you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I got older, I was able to focus my ability more. Direct it. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, really. I could be a great distance from someone, but if I had a connection to them, I could still heal them. As I did with the man you called Swanny through Shea\u2019s connection to Nathan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no damn wonder there are people so eager to get their hands on you,\u201d Terrence said in a somber voice. \u201cThe possibilities are endless. You\u2019d be of vital interest to the military or any radical group.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn unstoppable fighting force,\u201d Diego interjected. \u201cSomeone goes down, Grace heals them through a psychic link. Boom, up they go again.\u201d</p><p>Grace was shaking her head before he even finished. \u201cI\u2019m not psychic. I mean I can\u2019t predict events, tell the future. I\u2019m not a mind reader in the sense that I can pick out your thoughts. It\u2019s...different. I\u2019m telepathic, which just means I can communicate mentally. I can heal remotely, telepathically I suppose you\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you canSod. ?t read our thoughts?\u201d Browning asked.</p><p>Of everyone, he seemed to have the keenest interest in her abilities. He\u2019d remained thoughtful throughout the conversation, his brow etched in concentration.</p><p>\u201cNot unless I connect to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you connect to just anyone?\u201d Decker asked. \u201cShea said her abilities were random.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could at one time,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can anymore.\u201d</p><p>They all looked inquisitively at her. An uncomfortable silence fell.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get it back.\u201d</p><p>Grace turned to see Rio standing behind the couch just over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWith the proper care and reconditioning, you\u2019ll get it back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d She sighed and her shoulders slumped as she turned back around. She remained sideways just a bit so she could still see Rio while including the others in her sight. \u201cI used to think that I didn\u2019t want my gift. That it would be easier\u2014my life would be easier\u2014if my head was silent. If I couldn\u2019t hear other people. If I couldn\u2019t heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d Diego prompted.</p><p>\u201cI miss my sister,\u201d Grace said, an ache building in her chest as she thought of losing that link to Shea. \u201cThis past year has been difficult. She\u2019s tried to keep communication to a minimum because she always feared knowing too much about me and where I was. She didn\u2019t want to be used against me or to draw me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you lose it?\u201d Decker asked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Grace went numb as memories of all she\u2019d endured came hard and fast. Residual pain echoed through her joints and muscles. The voices in her head screamed. Before she realized what she was doing, she\u2019d lifted her palms to her temples and closed her eyes in an effort to make it all go away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Rio said in a terse voice. \u201cIt\u2019s time to eat, Grace. You need to keep your strength up.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, realizing that Rio had just bailed her out where before he hadn\u2019t and she\u2019d recognized the importance of standing on her own, of not being so damn weak all the time. The past couldn\u2019t hurt her. Memories couldn\u2019t hurt her. Only the present and the future had that ability. She had to stop fearing the ghosts.</p><p>They were all still staring at her. She cleared her throat and pushed away the lingering shadows.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they...\u201d She took another deep breath. Pull it together, Grace. This isn\u2019t a big deal. \u201cWhen they made me heal all those test subjects, it hurt me. Not just physically but mentally. When I heal someone, I take on their injury or illness. It becomes mine. As if I lift it straight from them and absorb it. They go away free, recovered. I have to then recover myself.</p><p>\u201cSome of the subjects were hard. With each one I grew weaker until I was sure I would die. I severed the link to my sister because I didn\u2019t want to become so weak that I called out to her without realizing it. I never wanted her to see me as I was and I didn\u2019t want to endanger her.\u201d</p><p>Terrence scowled fiercely. Diego was frowning as well while Decker and the others still wore puzzled looks.</p><p>\u201cYou just severed it? You can do that?\u201d Decker asked.</p><p>Grace nodded, tears crowding her eyes. \u201cIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life. She was...she was a part of me. Always with me and suddenly andinI was alone and frightened. And slowly dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUngoddamnbelievable,\u201d Diego muttered. \u201cWhat the fuck were they hoping to prove? That they could kill you? How would your death benefit them at all? If they wanted to use your powers, why the hell wouldn\u2019t they take better care with you?\u201d</p><p>Grace wiped at her cheek in an offhand manner, relieved to find no trace of tears there. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understood. How could they? I think they thought I was acting because I didn\u2019t want to perform to their expectations. It wasn\u2019t until...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and clamped her lips shut. She didn\u2019t want to go there. It still shamed her even though she knew it wasn\u2019t her, that she hadn\u2019t had any control.</p><p>Rio cleared his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Come eat now, Grace.\u201d</p><p>She glanced gratefully over, this time allowing him to rescue her. She pushed herself from the couch and slid her shaking hands into the pockets of her jeans to disguise how traumatized she still was by the past weeks.</p><p>To her utter shock, Terrence stood, towering over her briefly before he pulled her into a huge bear hug. She stood there plastered against the big man\u2019s chest, mouth open as he squeezed the breath from her.</p><p>Touched by the show of support, she slowly put her arms around him and returned the hug. He swiped a big hand down her back and then patted her awkwardly on the shoulder as he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a tough nut, Miss Grace,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019t ever let anyone tell you different.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cThank you, Terrence. You\u2019re very kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go eat. Rio cooks some good stuff when he\u2019s home in his kitchen.\u201d</p><p>She allowed Terrence to lead her into the kitchen and up to the large island with barstool seating. She glanced around, having just given everything a cursory once-over last night. It was indeed a dream kitchen. A chef\u2019s kitchen, she believed they were called. Top-of-the-line appliances. A huge, six-burner gas stove. Double oven. Stainless everything.</p><p>It didn\u2019t compute.</p><p>She\u2019d spent time in the mountains under the worst conditions possible with these men. Rio was a badass. A dark, brooding type that looked like no one ever dared cross him. But here? He was relaxed. Obviously a fan of creature comforts, judging by the custom home, the appliances and all the luxury items.</p><p>The bedding alone was simply to die for. She hadn\u2019t stayed in hotels that had better linens.</p><p>Rio was obviously someone who liked to live well when he wasn\u2019t out saving the world and getting shot at. It was hard to reconcile this man standing before her with the man who\u2019d carried her all over a mountain tied to his back.</p><p>Terrence seated her on a stool close to the end and then took the one next to her. There was only one left on the other side of her, which she assumed was for Rio, since the othe</p><p>rs were all claimed by his team members.</p><p>Rio put a plate in front of her and the scent wafted through her nostrils. Her stomach immediately growled and she closed her eyes, savoring just being able to sit down and enjoy a meal in the comfort of a home.</p><p>Rio slid onto the stool beside her after serving the others and glanced over.</p><p>\u201cEat up,\u201d he said gently. \u201cAs soon as you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll try to get Shea on the phone for you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>THE meal was rather simple. Baked chicken, vegetables and rice deep&gt;She\u0201, with hot rolls straight out of the oven. But for Grace it was the closest she\u2019d come to having a normal meal in longer than she could remember.</p><p>She savored the sheer mundaneness of sitting there, cutting into her chicken, the burst of warmth and flavor on her tongue. She purposely took her time, not wanting to hurry the moment. It was probably a sign that she really had lost her mind that she was taking such pleasure in drawing out a meal.</p><p>But for her, it was like Christmas and Thanksgiving all rolled into one. All that it lacked was Shea.</p><p>Remembering what Rio had promised her, she dug into her food more rapidly, not wanting to waste a single bite. She was already full, but she was compelled to eat it all. Going for so long without food made a person not take a meal for granted when they finally got one.</p><p>When the last bite was consumed, she looked up to see that the men had already finished and were staring oddly at her. It made her self-conscious and she pushed the plate away, her cheeks warm under their scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cThat was really good, Rio. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He continued to look at her, his lips set firm. He inclined his head to the side, motioning for the others to leave. When they were gone, he took her plate and the others and stacked them in the sink. Then he glanced up, catching her gaze and holding it for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since you ate?\u201d he asked bluntly. \u201cI mean really ate, Grace. I watched you last night and now today and you never once looked away from your food. It was as if you were afraid it was going to get up and walk off your plate.\u201d</p><p>She bit into her bottom lip and ducked her head to avoid his scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost weight. Even since I saw you in that surveillance footage. You were lean and toned. You had more muscle mass. You look like they damn near starved you.\u201d</p><p>His words stung even though she knew he hadn\u2019t meant them to be demeaning. He was angry. Not at her. She knew what she looked like. Like someone who\u2019d been as close to death as one could be without sliding all the way into the grave. There were times when she swore she felt the cool earth cover her and darkness surround her. It was all in her mind. Her mind had become hell instead of a refuge.</p><p>\u201cThey mostly gave me IV fluids,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what all they gave me, to be honest. Those weeks are\u2014were\u2014a blur. But they certainly didn\u2019t bring me regular meals that I ate on my own if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s expression grew stormier. His eyes darkened until they were nearly black.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you special meals for as long as you\u2019re here. You won\u2019t go hungry again, Grace.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise and then smiled, some of the shadows lifting at the fierce vow. Being plied with yummy food and luxurious surroundings wasn\u2019t exactly a hardship.</p><p>\u201cCan...Will you call Shea for me now?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>His expression grew more serious. \u201cYou need to understand that I may not be able to make this happen.\u201d</p><p>Her lips turned down and she was unable to call back the unhappy frown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can. I know this is important to you.\u201d</p><p>He walked around the island and held out his hand to her. She slid her fingers over his palm, tangling with his fingers, and allowed him to pull her from the stool. He led her beyond the kitchen and into a small enclosed space that resembled a patio except it was cut off from the outside. The windows were dark and seemed thick, and there was and chelmost a distortion of the view.</p><p>But beyond was a lush garden, well attended. A small pond sporting Japanese koi had a cascading waterfall that slid over a series of rocks before splashing into where the fish swam in lazy circles.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked as she stared around at the enclosure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a safe room. A place to enjoy the outdoors without actually being outdoors. There\u2019s an indoor pool just around the corner and behind the same bulletproof glass that currently surrounds us.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cDo you have that many enemies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t quite expected his terse, blunt response, and if she\u2019d thought he\u2019d go into further detail or perhaps elaborate, she was completely wrong. He said nothing more and instead drew out a phone and began punching a series of numbers.</p><p>Rio waited while the call connected, capturing Grace from the corner of his eye. She\u2019d turned away but her body posture was stiff. Agitation rolled from her, almost tangible in the quiet. Then she paced a few steps, turned, and he could see her hands clenched tightly together.</p><p>When the line opened, Rio uttered the password and then Sam was there, immediately brisk and all business.</p><p>\u201cRio, what the fuck is going on? Where are you and is Grace okay?\u201d</p><p>Rio lifted a brow. \u201cIs there any reason she shouldn\u2019t be? She\u2019s with me and recovering well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI got a call from Resnick. It would appear you have a problem that isn\u2019t entirely exclusive to Grace.\u201d</p><p>Rio almost laughed. Like that was anything new?</p><p>\u201cCut the bullshit, Sam. Just tell me what he said. I assume you mentioned Titan to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He said that as of two years ago they no longer unofficially existed. They were disbanded and retired.\u201d</p> <p>Rio snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty damn na\u00efve assessment from someone who should damn well know better. Does he think just because the government no longer had a use for them that they\u2019d just go away quietly, take up normal jobs, buy houses with picket fences and raise a brood of children?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence. \u201cHe said you were one of the original members of Titan.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Rio had figured that would come out. It wasn\u2019t a shock. He\u2019d be damned if he spent even a minute apologizing or explaining his past.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d Rio asked.</p><p>Sam blew out his breath. \u201cThere is no point. Look, I know you\u2019re a secretive bastard, but do you think at any time this would have been a good thing for me to know? If everything you and Resnick say about Titan is true, then you\u2019ve put KGI in a dangerous situation. Groups like that don\u2019t just let people walk away, as Resnick so eloquently put it. Which means they\u2019ve probably been hunting your ass all along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf they wanted me dead, I have no doubt I\u2019d already be six feet under. Or in pieces somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou give them that much credit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the real deal, Sam. They aren\u2019t amateurs or a bunch of boys playing at being G.I. Joe. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve remained on their radar, but the man who took over after I left owed me. I saved his life. That and that alone is the reason I\u2019m still breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as long as I know where your loyalties lie,\u201d Sam said quietly.</p><p>Rio was silent for a moment. He didn\u2019t like being questioned even as he knew why Sahe bettm had to do it. \u201cI\u2019m here, Sam. I\u2019m doing the job. That should be enough loyalty for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should bring Grace in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep her forever, Rio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can damn well make sure I don\u2019t put her in any more danger by exposing her and doing the very thing they expect me to do, which is reunite her with her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll agree to go along. For now,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI want frequent updates. We made a promise to Shea, one I\u2019m not willing to back down on. Not after all she did for Nathan and Swanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace helped them too,\u201d Rio said evenly. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have made it out if not for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not arguing that. I just want to make sure we make it right for both of them,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cFor now she stays with me. Now, Grace wants to talk to Shea.\u201d</p><p>Rio could all but hear the wheels turning in Sam\u2019s head.</p> <p>\u201cShe can\u2019t use her telepathy,\u201d Rio said quietly, hoping Grace couldn\u2019t hear. \u201cShe\u2019s too damaged. But she\u2019s desperate to talk to Shea and I promised her I\u2019d try to make it happen.\u201d</p><p>Sam swore. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t do it?\u201d Rio snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to. I sent Nathan and Shea away. At your suggestion, I might add. They haven\u2019t checked in with me yet. They\u2019re still traveling. As soon as I hear from them, I\u2019ll make the call happen. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>Rio cursed under his breath and stole another glance in Grace\u2019s direction. She was staring at him with hope in her eyes. Hope he had to now crush.</p><p>\u201cI need this fast,\u201d Rio said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get it. Just give me time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I can do, man. I\u2019ll let Shea know what\u2019s going on the minute I hear and then I\u2019ll arrange the call.\u201d</p><p>Rio muttered his agreement then ended the call. Even before he turned fully to Grace, he could feel her disappointment.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Grace demanded, her voice quivering. \u201cIs she all right? Why can\u2019t I talk to her?\u201d</p><p>Rio framed her shoulders in his hands and squeezed. \u201cNathan has taken her somewhere safe. Sam\u2019s going to let her know you want to talk to her as soon as they check in. I know you want to talk to her, Grace, but your safety\u2014the safety of both of you\u2014is the priority here.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed back bravely but he could see the grief and devastation in her eyes. Then she turned away and went to stand by the glass looking out to the garden. She leaned her forehead against it, closed her eyes, and then he could see the</p><p>strain ripple across her forehead.</p><p>An uneasy sensation prickled his nape. His gaze narrowed as he watched Grace. Her hands pressed against the glass and then curled into balls.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, and her entire body tensed and bowed inward. She let out a small cry and then she went limp. Tears slipped down her cheeks in silver trails. She turned and slid down the glass until she sat on the floor, her legs tugged up to her chest, and she buried her face against her knees as quiet sobs shook her shoulders.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>PAIN echoed through Grace\u2019s head, pain she was responsible for because she\u2019d kept pushing, refusing to believe that she couldn\u2019t carve out that path to her sister again.</p><p>\u201cGrace.\u201d</p><p>Her name came softly. So gentle and quiet that she almost didn\u2019t hear it. But she felt it. Like a warm brush, soothing away some of the darkness in her mind. Calming the wild, chaotic buzzing in her head.</p><p>She barely managed to lift her head and saw Rio crouched on the floor in front of her, concern creasing his brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She lowered her forehead to her knees once more and took in long, steadying breaths. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I tried so hard but it\u2019s just not there. Oh God, Rio, what will I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not there?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cThe link,\u201d she said in frustration. She raised her head and stared fully into his eyes, despair overwhelming her. \u201cThe link I destroyed to my sister. It\u2019s gone. All of it\u2019s gone. I can\u2019t focus. I can\u2019t reach out to anyone. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this yawning black hole in my mind and it\u2019s consuming me.\u201d</p><p>Instead of saying anything further, Rio rose and then reached down to pry her hand away from her legs. He tugged upward until she gave in and let him pull her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou need shoes,\u201d he said as he pulled her back toward the main living area.</p><p>She stared after him, utterly baffled. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>He remained silent as he walked through the kitchen and then to a closet off the living room. He let go of her hand to rummage around a moment and then came out with a pair of shoes that looked like they\u2019d fit her.</p><p>He dropped them on the floor beside her feet. \u201cPut them on.\u201d</p><p>She stood there a long moment wondering what she\u2019d missed, but seeing his determined look, she sighed and did as he said. When she was done, he went to the gun rack just inside the back entrance and pulled a pistol off the shelf. He shoved in a clip, pocketed two others and then reached for yet another gun. After giving it equal treatment, he donned a shoulder holster and tucked away both pistols.</p><p>He glanced her way and then crossed the room, took her hand and started toward another section of the house.</p><p>She shook her head to rid herself of the cobwebs that seemed to cling to her brain. She couldn\u2019t imagine what on earth had spawned this reaction. \u201cRio, where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>They took a short flight of stairs down into what appeared to be the basement. To her surprise, he stopped and pushed a button and elevator doors opened. Her mouth gaped as Rio ushered her inside. He hit another button and the elevator started down.</p><p>She tried not to think of down, because down was below the ground. Like way below. She had the sudden hysterical thought that he was taking her somewhere to execute her.</p><p>When they stepped off, they were surrounded by complete darkness. As her eyes adjusted, she could make out dim lighting ahead. Rio tucked her hand in his and guided her toward the distant glow.</p><p>It took a moment for her to figure out that the light was coming down from a long tubelike opening in the ceiling of a tunnel.</p><p>It was cool and kind of damp, like a cave, and she supposed that was indeed what they were in. Man-made but a cave nonetheless. She shivered, though she wasn\u2019t at all cold, and Rio automatically pulled her in close to his side as if to share his warmth with her.</p><p>Men who did those kinds of things for a woman didn\u2019t turn around and shoot them, right? What would he care if she was cold? If she were dead, she\u2019d be plenty cold. She coughed to cover the hysterical laughter that threatened to bubble out. She\u2019d well and truly lost her mind.</p><p>Rio wasn\u2019t going to kill her. He\u2019d had ample opportunity. Moreover, it was uncharitable of her to think it, given how good he\u2019d been to her. Hell, he\u2019d risked his life. His team had risked their lives. And here she was being a complete wuss because he was taking her down some dark tunnel God knows how many feet underground.</p><p>They continued a ways down until she was certain they were away from the house. She also honed in on the fact that they were gradually working up in elevation.</p><p>In the distance a faint noise made her brow wrinkle in concentration. She couldn\u2019t quite make out what it was. It was a dull roar that got a little louder with every step they took.</p><p>Then she saw a small sliver of light from behind a boulder. There was a marked difference in the air. Mist. The sound was water. A lot of water.</p><p>Rio pulled her toward the light, and she realized it was an opening in the rock, well hidden from view. As she looked out, she saw that they were coming out behind a waterfall.</p><p>Transfixed, she followed Rio, her stare riveted to the beautiful water cascading from the rock above and plummeting to the pool below. They were standing in a large hollow behind the falls, and there was a small footpath leading around the edge and away from the falling water.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Rio smiled and then directed her toward the path. She put her back to the rock and inched her way out so she didn\u2019t get soaked by the spray. Once outside, she gazed around at the tranquil paradise that surrounded them.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s my own private getaway. I come here often when I need to pull myself back together.\u201d</p><p>Pull himself together? This was a man who looked permanently cemented together. He wasn\u2019t someone who had so much as a crack, certainly not any she\u2019d seen. He was solid. Dependable. Calculating and...confident. That was the word escaping her. He was confident but not in an arrogant asshole kind of way. He clearly knew he was competent\u2014no, not competent. That made him seem merely adequate. He was certainly beyond simple competency and adequacy. He was...</p><p>Her gaze stroked over him, taking in every detail. His demeanor, his silent strength and his composure. There was something magnetizing about him and she couldn\u2019t even put her finger on what made it so.</p><p>Her gaze fell to the guns at his sides and then she frowned as she turned in a circle, surveying the jungle canopy that seemed a barrier to the rest of the world. A world that suddenly didn\u2019t seem so idyllic. Not when she knew that evil was out there. Stalking her.</p><p>\u201cAre we safe here?\u201d</p><p>Rio tugged her farther down the path, spiraling down to the ground level, where the pool rippled and then led out to a small river cutting through the terrain.</p><p>\u201cI like to be prepared. The tunnel leads to the back of the waterfall. I\u2019m not saying that the falls and the pool aren\u2019t accessible, but it would be damn hard and I\u2019d certainly know if anyone was near. The jungle is thick here, never touched. It\u2019s overgrown and surrounds the rock face where the water comes over the edge. It\u2019s not even visible from the air because the canopy is so thick in this area. So are we one hundred percent safe? I\u2019m never that na\u00efve. But I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty c19;conflose to ninety-nine.\u201d</p><p>She cut a glance at him to see the corner of his mouth twitching. His eyes twinkled and then his smile broadened. She was transfixed by the transformation from the serious, hard-as-nails guy surveying the terrain to the sudden teasing, lighthearted exchange.</p><p>He gestured for her. \u201cCome on. I have the perfect place to sit and enjoy the falls.\u201d</p><p>She followed him down to the water\u2019s edge and saw that he had a bench fashioned from a tree trunk. It utterly charmed her. She sank down onto the smooth wood and inhaled deeply, soaking in the beauty and peace around her.</p><p>He took the seat beside her, their legs nearly touching. For a long moment he stared, as did she, at the spellbinding sight of the water pouring down into the pool.</p><p>\u201cI want you to do something for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She glanced over to see him looking at her with those intense, dark eyes, almost like he was peeling back every layer of her soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClose your eyes and focus inwardly. Picture where you\u2019re at. Take a good look but then close your eyes and reach out with your senses. Smell the air. Listen to not only the water but the other sounds around you. Feel the mist on your skin and the warmth of the air.</p><p>\u201cPush the pain and the fear and the anxiety out of your mind. Focus on your sister and on that path that you\u2019ve used for so many years. It\u2019s still there, Grace. You just have to find it again.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes became gritty and hot. She was tempted to rub them but didn\u2019t want to express more emotion than she already had.</p><p>Rio touched her face as if he understood. \u201cI don\u2019t claim to know much about telepathy. Hell, I didn\u2019t even know it existed outside of movies until I met Shea. But I do understand mind over matter. I understand that to be strong, your mind has to be strong and focused. It has to heal just like your body had to heal. The mind is a very peculiar thing. Your brain has a way of protecting itself and you from complete devastation. You were at your limit, so it shut down as a protective measure. Now you just have to give it time to heal and for those pathways to your sister to reopen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you really think it will work?\u201d she whispered, afraid to hope, but already feeling the stirring deep in her heart. That little burst of excitement that she couldn\u2019t control.</p><p>Hope was such a gift and a curse all rolled into one.</p><p>\u201cThere are many who would sneer at things like meditation. But the strongest warrior knows that his body is only as strong as his mind. A physically weaker person can defeat a much stronger opponent if he\u2019s stronger mentally.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to tentatively touch his cheek as he\u2019d done with her. \u201cHow do you know so much? It makes so much sense when you explain it. I don\u2019t feel so...crazy.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou aren\u2019t crazy, Grace. You\u2019re just damaged. But you\u2019re a survivor and you\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p> <p>She turned to face the falls again, feeling more...confident. A little lighter and, yes, optimistic. When was the last time she\u2019d felt hope?</p><p>She gazed around, memorizing every detail of the little slice of heaven, and then she did as Rio had told her and she closed her eyes, channeling all of her focus inward.</p><p>\u201cControl your breathing,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIn, out, deep. Hold it. Relax and let it out. Focus on each part of your body relaxing and then make it happen.\u201d</p><p>His voice dimmed and became distant. She held on to the image of her beautiful surroundings and then she inhaled, sucking in the scentg ik? of the water, the plants, even the dirt and then a faint sweet smell, like an exotic flower.</p><p>Gradually she was able to separate the roar of the water from the other sounds and she concentrated on those. Birds. Insects. Even what sounded like a monkey in the distance. Lots of birds. She began to differentiate the calls, picking out at least half a dozen different bird sounds.</p><p>She turned her face upward, feeling the light mist blow over her skin, cooling and refreshing her.</p> <p>And finally she reached inside her mind, tentatively pushing out, searching for that pathway to her sister. The blackness was intimidating, but she didn\u2019t give up.</p><p>For several long minutes she forced herself to remain calm. She floated in that darkness that enveloped her mind and tried to make peace with it.</p><p>The longer she sat there, the less overpowering the darkness and silence became. Instead of feeling powerless and terrified, peace settled over her like the sun on a warm summer afternoon.</p><p>She grabbed on to it. Held tight. Refused to let go and reimmerse herself in the horrors of the last months.</p><p>To be free even for a moment of the choking fear, despair and frustration was to spend a few seconds in heaven.</p><p>She had no knowledge of how long she sat there. It could have been hours or just a few minutes. When she reopened her eyes, she found Rio still sitting where he\u2019d been, staring into the distance. Patient. Waiting for her.</p><p>As if feeling her gaze, he turned his head and then lifted one eyebrow in question. \u201cFeel a little better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Rio. You would have made a terrific therapist or maybe a yoga instructor or someone specializing in meditation. Or something. Heck, I don\u2019t even know myself. I\u2019m having the hardest time reconciling this man here with me now with the warrior who rescued me from hell. I can\u2019t fit the two together in my mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re human too,\u201d he said, though there was no censure in his voice. \u201cAll of my men. They\u2019re the best of the best. No better anywhere. I\u2019d stake my life and yours on that. But they also have a very human side, one that has nothing to do with blood and death and fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply otherwise,\u201d she said regretfully.</p><p>\u201cHow is your head now? Still hurt? Are you tense?\u201d</p><p>She took a moment to evaluate and then slowly shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Truly. I feel...sorta empty. It\u2019s nice. Like nothing weighing down on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. The next step is to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she yanked her gaze back up to him. \u201cTalk about it? You really are starting to sound like some armchair psychologist.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the defensive reaction and tilted his head to the side, staring until she fidgeted on the makeshift bench.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to say earlier? When the guys were asking you about everything that happened. You implied that they didn\u2019t really take care with you until...Until what, Grace? What happened to make them realize they were slowly killing you?\u201d</p><p>She dropped her head, shame immediately crowding into her mind. She closed her eyes tight as if she could push away the memories. But they clung tenaciously, a cruel reminder of the person she\u2019d become for that short time.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey can\u2019t hurt you now. You survived. They didn\u2019t break you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they did!\u201d she burst out.</p><p>Tears burned until she no longer had the strength th brto fight them. They were like trails of acid down her cheeks, and she choked back the urge to scream. God, she wanted to just yell.</p><p>Rio took her hand, softly turned it over until her palm was up, and she instantly tried to yank it back. He held firm, his grip not painful, but neither was it relenting.</p><p>He traced a path across the thin, fading line over her wrist. It had taken a long time to heal, so savage the wound had been. She curled her fingers into a tight fist, her wrist flexing in his grasp. She closed her eyes as if she would simply will him to drop the subject.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here, Grace?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cYou have a nearly identical mark on the other wrist. Given your ability to heal, these must have been terrible wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey broke me,\u201d she said again, her voice defeated and small. \u201cOh God, Rio, it was so terrible. I tried to kill myself. I\u2019m so shamed by what I did. They nearly didn\u2019t save me. If they\u2019d been a few minutes later getting to me, I would have lost too much blood, and what shames me the most is when I was myself again, my first thought was that I was sorry that I hadn\u2019t succeeded. But oh God, it wasn\u2019t me. I swear to you it wasn\u2019t me, but I still couldn\u2019t keep from wishing that I\u2019d been successful.\u201d</p><p>He curled his entire hand around hers and rubbed his thumb over the still healing scar.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a test,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cI\u2019d already gone through so much. I was exhausted mentally and physically. I was in constant pain. I was sick from a dozen different ailments. It hurt to even breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of test?\u201d he gently prompted.</p><p>\u201cThey brought in a woman who\u2019d been institutionalized because of the danger she was to herself. She was mentally ill and suicidal. She\u2019d already tried to kill herself multiple times, and she was under constant supervision and heavily medicated. They brought her to me and forced me to heal her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Grace.\u201d</p><p>His tone was heavy with sorrow. He continued to stroke her wrist, and she found she didn\u2019t mind quite as much as she had a moment ago.</p><p>\u201cIt was hell,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt such despair. It was overwhelming, coming at me wave after wave. The voices all telling me I was worthless, that I was nothing and that I\u2019d be doing the world a favor by killing myself. I wasn\u2019t worthy to be alive.</p><p>\u201cI fought it at first. I knew that it was her who\u2019d taken over. I knew it wasn\u2019t me. But after a while I could no longer distinguish between where I began and she ended. All I heard was that I needed to die, that I had to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rio said, his voice husky with emotion. \u201cOh, honey, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI managed to pry off one of the parts of the bed frame. It had a point on it, and I plunged it into my wrists and started tearing at the skin. It was a compulsion I was no longer able to ignore. I couldn\u2019t fight it. It took over until I was a puppet being jerked by the ghosts in my head.</p><p>\u201cWhen they found me, I was nearly unconscious and I begged them, I begged them to just let me die.\u201d</p><p>Rio reached for her, carefully pulling her into his arms. He smoothed her hair through his fingers and simply held her as she recounted the horrors she\u2019d endured.</p><p>\u201cWhat shames me is that even though I knew it wasn\u2019t me, I still wanted to die. I gave up. I just gave up and tried to take the coward\u2019sowa#x2019;d way out.\u201d</p><p>She turned her face into his shoulder and then wrapped her arms around him, holding him tight. He adjusted his position so that he could anchor her more firmly against his chest.</p><p>After a moment, he pulled her away, moved his hands up to frame her face and then leaned in, his mouth closing in on hers. She blinked and then held her breath, shocked by what was about to happen. Shocked that she wanted it so much.</p><p>His lips touched hers. Warm, sensual. Electric. A full body shiver overtook her as he pressed farther, melding their mouths as he exerted gentle pressure.</p><p>His hands were like a brand on her skin, holding her for the loving assault on her senses.</p><p>Then he deepened the kiss, his tongue running over the seam of her mouth. Once, twice, the hot brush coaxing and seeking entrance to her mouth.</p><p>With a breathy sigh, she surrendered, leaning into him.</p><p>It was the closest bond she\u2019d established with anyone outside of a telepathic connection to her sister. She craved this. Simple intimacy. A gesture of caring. Knowing that for at least a moment she mattered.</p><p>Their breaths were sporadic. Staccato, uneven and jerky.</p><p>No longer was she content with sitting there still, an inactive participant. She wanted to touch him. She wanted to taste him. She wanted to absorb him into her senses until he was all she could see, smell or feel.</p><p>When he finally pulled away, she was dazed. Unbalanced. Like she\u2019d been knocked over by a wave and hadn\u2019t yet regained her footing.</p><p>He gently stroked her hair, smoothing both hands down the sides of her head as he stared tenderly into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an exceptional woman, Grace. You didn\u2019t just survive. You overcame. You\u2019ve been through unimaginable hell and yet you\u2019ve fought your way back.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into him, closing her eyes at the pleasure of his touch.</p><p>He pressed his lips against her forehead in the gentlest of kisses. \u201cI\u2019m going to make love to you, Grace. Not right this minute. I\u2019m not going to pressure you or rush this. But from the moment I saw you on that video surveillance tape, you were mine. I have no explanation for it. I don\u2019t even entirely understand the connection. But it\u2019s there, and I think you feel it too. I\u2019m willing to wait until the moment is right, but you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Her brain sizzled and nearly short-circuited. She stared back at him openmouthed as the shock of his words fully hit her.</p><p>She was utterly bewildered by his bold statement. It hadn\u2019t been a question or even a hint of wishful thinking. He\u2019d stated it as matter-of-factly as he gave orders to his men.</p><p>And the way he was staring at her...If she had any doubt as to the truth in his statement, the look in his eyes convinced her that he meant every single word.</p><p>An ache began deep in her heart. Deeper, to her very soul. Longing rose swift and piercing. How long had she dreamed of having such closeness with a man? Someone whom she didn\u2019t have to worry about knowing her secrets.</p><p>Rio already knew. He accepted.</p><p>He\u2019d said she was his.</p><p>She\u2019d never truly belonged to anyone. Not even to the people who\u2019d claimed they were her parents and had raised her most of her life. She\u2019d only ever had Shea. No one else had ever gotten close to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she finally managed to get out.</p><p>Rio\u2019s smile was gentle but assured. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing at all to say, Grace. You\u2019re mine. You\u2019ve been mine from the beginning. You never ng.ilestood a chance once I decided that I was going to be the man who brought you home.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>GRACE was light-headed, unsteady on her feet, and gone was any lingering pain or sorrow over her failed connection to her sister. Her mind buzzed with Rio\u2019s bold statement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What did it mean?</p><p>What exactly did it mean?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even begin to grasp the ramifications or the reasons why. Before the last year, she would have said she was an attractive enough woman. Did any woman truly consider herself beautiful? But Grace hadn\u2019t had any serious esteem issues. She was just shy and awkward when it came to any sort of personal relationship.</p><p>Growing up as she and Shea had done, there\u2019d never been any opportunity for Grace to have friendships or an eventual boyfriend, much less an involved relationship.</p> <p>But in the last year, she\u2019d lost a lot of her strength. Her tone. The fitness regimen she\u2019d always adhered to had no doubt saved her because had she not been as strong as she was going in, she wouldn\u2019t have been strong enough to survive the unimaginable.</p><p>She was thinner now. Worn. Fear and fatigue seemed to surround her. Men weren\u2019t attracted to timid little mice, were they? They at least wanted someone who was stable and not a complete head case who\u2019d tried to kill herself and was sorry she hadn\u2019t been able to.</p><p>Besides all that, how could she or he even entertain the thought of any sort of...well, anything!</p><p>Rio caressed the sides of her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t say all that to frighten you, Grace. Subtle and tactful are two things I\u2019ve never been accused of. I\u2019m blunt and I don\u2019t like or play games. This is the only way I know how to be, so I\u2019m sorry if that makes you uneasy.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even have a response for that. What could she possibly say anyway?</p> <p>He feathered another kiss over her lips and then solved the issue of what the hell she was supposed to say back to him by turning her toward the path leading to the falls.</p><p>\u201cWe should get back. While it\u2019s safe here, I still don\u2019t want to leave you exposed for long periods of time. I want you to work on the things we talked about, though. Try meditation and the mental exercises I gave you. Keep working at reestablishing the path between you and your sister. It\u2019ll come in time.\u201d</p><p>She tugged on his hand to make him stop his progress around the back of the falls. When he turned with an inquisitive look on his face, she leaned up on tiptoe and initiated her own kiss.</p><p>It was shy, awkward and not nearly as toe curling as Rio\u2019s had been. In fact, she couldn\u2019t back up fast enough once she\u2019d brushed her lips across his.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t seem to mind her obvious inexperience at all. His expression went from surprise to utter satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said in a grave tone.</p> <p>He lifted a brow in question.</p><p>\u201cFor everything.\u201d She swept her arm out toward the falls and the surrounding area. \u201cFor this. For understanding. For risking so much to save me. For wanting to help me and not believing the worst or judging me for the things I\u2019ve done. I don\u2019t even know how to express the gratitude I feel, but it\u2019s more than that and I don\u2019t have the words to explain to you what all I feel. I just want\u2014need\u2014you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I need you to know?\u201d Rio asked solemnly.</p><p>She wrinkled up her browy trill don and cocked her head to the side. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He touched her nose with the tip of his finger. \u201cI need you to know how special you are, Grace Peterson. I think you haven\u2019t believed that in a long time. Maybe you never believed it. But I see it, and now I want you to see it too.\u201d</p><p>It was simply too much. How he could reach inside her and see what it was she needed the most? Someone to believe in her. Someone who wasn\u2019t trying to use her. Someone who thought she was special, not because of her powers, but because...because she was simply Grace Peterson.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you again,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes darkened and he went still. He reached for her hand, twining his fingers with hers. \u201cBy all means, I\u2019m at your mercy.\u201d</p> <p>Tentatively, she leaned into him until her breasts brushed against his chest as she rose up on tiptoe. But then his hands closed around her waist, slipped down over the curve of her behind, and he leaned down to meet her.</p><p>She kissed him once, but was unsatisfied with the brief contact. She wanted more. She wanted to explore this time. Before, he\u2019d done it all and she\u2019d stood there, stunned and overwhelmed by the intensity.</p><p>This time she wanted it slow, lingering. She wanted to taste him. Take her time and enjoy the intimacy of being so close, his hands on her body.</p><p>She kissed him again, this time leaving her lips pressed to his. Nervously she ran the tip of her tongue over the seam of his mouth. His lips immediately parted, coaxing her inward.</p><p>He kept still, seemingly content to allow her to take the lead. He held her steady, his hands still resting possessively on her bottom, but he didn\u2019t move. Not even a muscle as she continued her gentle exploration of his mouth.</p><p>Gaining confidence and feeling a little bolder, she reached up, wanting to run her fingers through his hair. It was loose today and not tied back in a ponytail at his nape.</p><p>It was long and silky, just brushing the tops of his shoulders. There was a slight wave to it, only enough to make it unruly, but it was far from being actually curly.</p><p>She let the strands slide through her fingers and then she finally got the courage to let her hands drop to his chest. The skin rippled beneath her fingers as his muscles flexed and rolled. His broad shoulders seemed to quiver, and his breathing changed from the even calm to a more sporadic, rapid staccato.</p><p>Slowly, she pulled away but he didn\u2019t relinquish his hold on her. He kept his hands molded to her behind, and he reclaimed the step she\u2019d taken back.</p><p>\u201cI like when you take advantage of me,\u201d he said with a slight grin. \u201cFeel free to do it again anytime you get the urge.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks went instantly hot and she ducked her head.</p><p>He chuckled and released his hold, his fingers gliding over her hips before finally dropping to his sides. Then he lifted one hand again, tipping a finger under her chin and gently forcing her head upward again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he repeated again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get there, Grace. Where \u2018there\u2019 is, I\u2019m not altogether sure yet, but we\u2019re going to get there together.\u201d</p><p>Gathering every ounce of the courage she\u2019d thought was long gone, she slowly nodded, feeling like she\u2019d just taken on the world.</p><p>His eyes glowed with a savage light. They gleamed in triumph, and his smile was one of complete satisfaction. It was the look of the victor in a hard-fough</p><p>t battle. Only she hadn\u2019t been a difficult conquest.</p><p>Whatever this was between them. Whatever the dangers e dor they faced. Whatever happened tomorrow. Today, they were bound by a nearly silent agreement. A bond that perhaps had formed even before they\u2019d met and most assuredly had been cemented when he\u2019d pulled her back from the brink of death.</p><p>What mattered was that right now she wasn\u2019t alone. She was no longer running blindly and scared out of her mind. It was time to take a stand, and this man would be there beside her.</p><p>How could she lose?</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>\u201cWHAT do we do, Rio?\u201d Grace asked from her perch on the couch.</p><p>She was settled in the corner, sitting cross-legged and surrounded by plump pillows. It was her nest, one she\u2019d burrowed into and had no desire to leave anytime soon.</p><p>The others filtered through periodically. Diego had gone for a swim and Grace had gotten quite a view of the man in swim trunks. From the looks of him, he maintained a tight fitness regimen. Not that the other men could ever be considered lacking in the physique department, but Diego was...He was beautiful to look at.</p><p>Terrence had ambled through after Diego, wearing a muscle shirt and gym shorts. Her eyes had bugged at the huge tree trunks he had for arms. Hell, his muscles had muscles. He didn\u2019t walk so much as he swaggered and not from innate cockiness. No, the man was simply so big that he just sort of swayed when he moved.</p><p>Decker, Alton and Browning were on patrol, or so Diego had thrown out when he\u2019d passed through the kitchen.</p><p>Rio looked up from where he stood in the kitchen chopping vegetables on a cutting board. It was amazing how this badass warrior looked so comfortable doing such domestic things like puttering around the kitchen. And one thing she\u2019d quickly noticed was that he was meticulous in his care of all of his things. Whether it was a towel hanging correctly in the bathroom or fingerprints being wiped from the refrigerator.</p><p>He never let anything just sit out. Furthermore, it was as if he had his men trained according to his expectations because they carried their weight. The team reminded her of a well-oiled machine. Smooth. Seamless. Almost as if they read one another\u2019s minds.</p><p>The thought made her smile. Maybe they were the ones with telepathy. Wouldn\u2019t that be a kick?</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and refocused on Rio, who was staring expectantly at her. It was obviously not the first time he\u2019d said her name, judging by the look on his face. While she\u2019d been analyzing him and his men, he\u2019d been trying to get her attention.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d he said when she found his gaze.</p><p>She flushed. \u201cSorry. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in amusement. \u201cYou asked me what we were going to do. I merely asked what you were referring to.\u201d</p><p>She frowned a moment, not really remembering what her point had been. But then as she reflected on all she\u2019d observed with his men and the fact that everything seemed so ordinary and everyday, she realized that was the point.</p><p>She waved a hand, gesturing around the room as if somehow that would signify her thoughts. \u201cI was asking what we do. Now, I mean. We left the U.S. We came here. What now? When do I see Shea? You mentioned safe, but will I ever be safe? As much as I appreciate what you and your team have done\u2014I\u2019ll never forget\u2014you can\u2019t keep me here forever in some bubble. You have a life. I don\u2019t have much of one, but one day I\u2019d like to.\u201d</p><p>Rio walked around the counter. She thought he was going to come over to where she saunimame, judgt, but he simply leaned his back against the bar, thumbs tucked into his jeans pockets as he studied her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m not entirely certain yet.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. That hadn\u2019t been what she thought he would say. But then he hadn\u2019t lied to her. Not once. He hadn\u2019t shielded her from the truth no matter how harsh it may be. He didn\u2019t offer false hope and he didn\u2019t talk around issues.</p><p>She hugged one of the pillows to her chest and leaned forward until her chin rested atop the harder edge of the cushion. \u201cAre we leaving again?\u201d</p><p>Somehow the thought of leaving this place made her anxiety level rise sharply. Which was stupid considering she\u2019d been there less than twenty-four hours. But she felt safe here. And safe hadn\u2019t been a word she could use to describe her feelings in a long damn time. She\u2019d forgotten what it felt like to be able to relax her guard for five minutes.</p><p>Rio shook his head. \u201cNo. At least not yet. I have some feelers out. I\u2019m calling in a few favors. Right now what I know is that Titan is after you. I warned Sam so he could make sure that Shea is safe and they\u2019re prepared for anything.\u201d</p><p>Her brows came together in a scrunch. \u201cSam. He\u2019s your boss, right? The one who kind of runs KGI? Isn\u2019t he Nathan\u2019s older brother?\u201d And then a completely unrelated thought occurred to her. It blindsided her and momentarily paralyzed her.</p><p>She glanced up at Rio, her fingers knotted into tight balls. \u201cIs Shea married already? You said she and Nathan were together. That he loved her.\u201d</p><p>The idea of having missed her sister\u2019s wedding was more than she could bear. It took everything she had not to break down into a torrent of tears. The only thing holding her back was the knowledge that if she started, there would be no stopping. It would be the last straw. Further proof that she and Shea led completely separate lives now.</p><p>This time Rio did move to the couch where Grace sat. He eased down, brushing her knees with his thigh. He took one of her hands and gently uncurled her fingers. Then he reached over, slid his hand up her cheek and brushed his thumb across the corner of her eye as if checking for tears. The movement forced her to look up again and meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t get married without you,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cYou\u2019re all she\u2019s thought about. She went back to that damn house you had no business going back to because she knew you\u2019d been there, knew you were in trouble, and she would have done anything to save you.</p><p>\u201cShe felt guilty because she was in a safe place, surrounded by people who cared about her, and she had no idea where you were. If you were scared and alone. Hurting or in danger. She reached for you constantly. When I volunteered to lead my team to find you, she begged me to keep you safe. All she wants is you home. With her.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned but she smiled through the anguish, knowing too well how fierce Shea was when it came to people she loved. Shea had been so protective, though Grace was the older by a year. But in a lot of ways Shea was more...Grace wasn\u2019t sure what word she was searching for. The events of the last year had changed Shea dramatically. She was no longer the sweet, na\u00efve, soft woman who wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. She was harder and more cynical, and Grace had worried endlessly over those changes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me about Nathan and his family,\u201d she said, the ache still in her voice. In her very soul. \u201cAre they good to her? Is she happy? I just want the best for her. She deserves so much. I said some unforgivable things to her when our parr wy sents were killed. But if it hadn\u2019t been for her, I doubt we would have made it out of that house alive. I just want her to be happy. And loved.\u201d</p><p>Rio extended his arm over the back of the couch, wrapped it around her shoulders and pulled her toward him until she was settled underneath his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNathan adores her. I don\u2019t know a whole lot. I left soon after he returned with her to Tennessee. Her first concern and priority was you. She didn\u2019t want to leave Oregon because she was so sure you were somewhere close. But Nathan got her the hell out of there, as he should have, and took her to a place where he could keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cNathan, and by extension, Sam, made her a promise. A promise fulfilled by KGI, that we would do whatever necessary to bring you home. That we wouldn\u2019t quit until you were safe. I asked for the assignment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBecause when I looked at the surveillance footage, I saw a vulnerable woman with fear in her eyes. But I also saw a strong woman who was a fighter. I saw someone I wanted to know better. I saw someone I considered mine from the first moment I laid eyes on her.\u201d</p><p>Grace held her breath until she was dizzy and then let it out in a long whoosh that weakened her to her knees.</p><p>\u201cAs for Nathan, he\u2019s had a rough time. A time that Shea got him through. She saved him. He was held captive in Afghanistan for two months and was finally able to escape with her help. KGI was able to get to him because Shea helped get us information. But he\u2019s solid. He and Shea both have a lot of healing to do, but they\u2019ll do it together. I don\u2019t think you could pry them apart with a crowbar. The concept of soul mates is kind of cheesy when said aloud, but there\u2019s no other word for the bond that exists between them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound cheesy,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt sounds wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s in good hands, Grace. I swear it. Nathan will never let anything happen to her. He\u2019d die for her. He has five older brothers who are more than willing to go to the wall for him, and then there is Steele\u2019s team and my team. I\u2019m pretty damn picky about who I trust and who I call family, but if I ever call anyone family, it would be the Kellys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sound so awesome,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love them and they\u2019ll love you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned a moment because they didn\u2019t seem real. Just a topic of conversation, but one day...One day she\u2019d see her sister again and they would be by extension her own family of sorts if Shea married Nathan. The idea of having this huge, protective family wasn\u2019t something she could wrap her head around.</p><p>But it sounded so nice, it made her chest ache.</p><p>They weren\u2019t hers, though. They were Shea\u2019s. Shea had Nathan. Grace was savagely happy for her sister. And relieved. But she was also envious because she wanted so badly to have those things Shea now enjoyed.</p> <p>Love. Comfort. Stability. A normal life. Laughter. Children. A big family. Being able to breathe. Smile. Life without fear.</p><p>She closed her eyes, reaching out again, her longing for her sister a tangible, breathing entity.</p><p>Shea. Please be there.</p><p>For a brief moment, she swore she heard an echo in her mind. Just a faint call. So much like Shea. As if Shea was saying her name. And just as quickly it was gone.</p><p>But the sensation lingered, and Grace could feel the comfort as it seeped into her mind, soothing some of the sadness away.</p><p>She opened her ee oearyes to see Rio staring at her, his gaze so soft and understanding.</p><p>\u201cShe was there,\u201d Grace said, her voice cracking. \u201cFor just a moment, I swear I heard her. Maybe I imagined it but I swear I felt her.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her hands up her arms and then wrapped her arms around herself as if by hugging tightly she could prevent the lingering aura of her sister from fading.</p> <p>Rio pulled her farther into his embrace, holding her firmly against his chest. She rested her cheek on the faded T-shirt, soaking up the warmth and comfort he offered. He laid his cheek against the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get there, Grace. You\u2019re already making such improvement. You bear no resemblance to the defeated, broken woman who begged me to let her die just a few days ago. You walked out of those damn mountains under your own power with a broken arm, broken ribs and unimaginable mental and physical strain. I\u2019ve served with men who couldn\u2019t have done what you did, so cut yourself some slack.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, absorbing the gruff reprimand as though it were a gentle stroke to her back. She liked Rio when he got growly and bossy.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do for now?\u201d she asked, taking the conversation full circle.</p><p>Rio stroked his hand through her hair, toying with the strands. \u201cWe wait.\u201d</p><p>She pushed up so she could meet his gaze. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>He eyed her seriously, his words as blunt as always.</p><p>\u201cWe wait until it\u2019s safe to leave or they show their hand. We\u2019ll either bring the fight to them or we\u2019ll let them bring it to us. One way or another, the battle is coming. It\u2019s just a matter of when and where.\u201d</p><p>Grace sucked in her breath and tried not to shake but she knew she failed miserably.</p><p>\u201cTitan is that dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTitan doesn\u2019t play by the rules,\u201d Rio said matter-of-factly. \u201cIn their world the only rules are the ones they make. Failure isn\u2019t an option. They only know how to achieve their objective. In this case their objective is you.\u201d</p><p>Helplessness gripped her, squeezing the very breath from her lungs. \u201cThen what is there to do? How can we fight them if they\u2019re so damn undefeatable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say they weren\u2019t able to be defeated. I\u2019m just telling you that they\u2019re a serious threat. I want you to understand it. Know it. Live it. Breathe it. Never let your guard down even for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we can beat them?\u201d</p><p>She tried to keep the hope out of her voice because she didn\u2019t want to sound desperate\u2014even if that\u2019s what she was feeling.</p><p>\u201cWe have no other choice,\u201d Rio said in a grave tone. \u201cKGI has the resources but we\u2019re divided. We can\u2019t leave Shea, and I\u2019m damn sure not leaving you. Which means that half of us will be pitted against all of Titan. But the other thing you need to know is that KGI doesn\u2019t lose. There\u2019s not another group of men who have more heart, determination and courage. Anywhere. We fight because we believe in what we do. Titan fights because it\u2019s what they\u2019re paid to do.\u201d</p><p>The tension that had coiled and pitted in her belly loosened and gradually slid away. She reached up to touch the hard lines of his face.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re pretty damn special yourself.\u201d</p><p>He looked discomfited, as if he had no idea how tono</p><p>Somehow with him, she was bolder. More confident. She believed all the things he said about her. He made her believe them. He made her feel...worthy.</p><p>Nowhere in her life had she really given thought to being with a man beyond simple girlish fantasies and giggly conversations with Shea, who\u2019d been a little more daring in her forays into sex.</p><p>Grace had been too timid. Too afraid to get close, only to be yanked up by her parents when it was time to move again. She longed for roots and a relationship but was deathly afraid to try to have one for fear it would be taken away.</p><p>Now probably wasn\u2019t the time either, but when had she ever felt as safe as she did now? Rio didn\u2019t just make her feel physically safe and secure. It was more than physical protection. Somehow he made her feel whole. Alive. Vibrant.</p><p>He made her feel...cherished.</p><p>She inched upward, pressing her mouth more fully over his. It was exhilarating to be the one making the moves. It was freeing after being captive for so long. She was making the decisions. She had control of her destiny. And right now, what she wanted, more than anything in the world, was to be loved by this man.</p><p>She wanted to get lost in his arms for a few hours. Hide from the world. Explore his body and let those wonderful rough hands glide over hers.</p><p>The fantasy was so vivid that she nearly moaned at the sheer pleasure coursing through her veins.</p><p>Rio pulled away, abruptly dimming some of her euphoria. His eyes blazed and his fingers were tight\u2014painfully so\u2014around her chin as he held her in place so their gazes were locked.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cThis has to stop. Unless...Unless you don\u2019t want it to. But I need you to know where this is headed. Because unless you tell me right here and now that a kiss is all you wanted, I\u2019m taking you into my bedroom and I\u2019m going to make love to you until neither of us can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want more,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The minute she said it, she was swamped by varying emotions. Fear. Terror. Nervousness. But also the satisfaction that she was speaking up, being courageous. Taking that chance and risking rejection.</p><p>Her whole life had been one of uncertainty and holding back. Never taking chances. Not wanting to step, for just a moment, into the sun and reach for what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cHow much more, Grace?\u201d Rio asked, his gaze so intense that it blistered over her skin like a blowtorch.</p><p>\u201cEverything. Anything. Whatever you can give me. Please, Rio. Don\u2019t make me beg. This is hard enough as it is.\u201d</p><p>He uttered what sounded like a curse under his breath and then he crushed his mouth to hers in a kiss so intense that she was consumed. His mouth took hers. It was no gentle inquiry. It was a stamp of possession. It was a promise of what was to come.</p><p>He dragged his mouth away, his chest heaving for breath. His eyes g</p><p>littered and his hand shook against her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never beg. Not me. Not anyone. I\u2019ll give you what you want, Grace. I just want to make damn sure you know what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled and her knees wobbled precariously. Her skin was flush with heat. Achy and alive.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want,\u201d he said in a near growl. \u201cI want to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>It was quite possibly the boldest, hardest thing she\u2019d ever done, but the words came with no hesitation. \u201cI want you to make loveu tnto the su to me, Rio.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>IT took every bit of restraint not to haul her over his shoulder and run toward the bedroom. The very last thing he wanted to do was scare the shit out of her.</p><p>Beg? She honestly thought she\u2019d have to beg him to make love to her?</p><p>Hell, he hadn\u2019t been far from being on his knees begging her to just let him touch her. Let him show her tenderness she\u2019d long been denied.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even know where to start, so overwhelmed was he over this beautiful, brave woman who stood before him looking as though she was afraid he was going to tell her no.</p><p>He kissed her again, just because he couldn\u2019t resist. She was sweet and warm and so very soft. He loved the way her lips went pliant against his, like she was soaking up every bit of the moment.</p><p>He lowered his hands down her body until his fingers tangled with hers. Then he took a step back, tugging her along with him. He dropped one hand but kept firm hold on the other as he turned and headed toward the bedroom.</p><p>She hesitated a moment and he nearly cursed. Damn it, he\u2019d lost her. She\u2019d changed her mind, and it was nothing more than an impulsive declaration made in the heat of the moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d</p><p>Relief was instant. She wasn\u2019t backing out.</p><p>\u201cThey know better than to disturb me. They\u2019ll do their own thing until such time as I tell them differently.\u201d</p><p>He touched her face, softly stroking the line of her cheekbone. \u201cTrust me, Grace.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes warmed and the blue became darker.</p><p>\u201cI do trust you.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand and then continued the rest of the way to the bedroom.</p><p>The awkwardness once they were behind the closed door was unfamiliar. Most of his liaisons, if you could call them that, were fast. Night out, ending in a hotel room. He usually bugged out the next day on assignment.</p><p>He liked to blow off steam as well as the next guy but he\u2019d never let sex or a woman interfere with his job. What the hell was he supposed to do when the woman was the job?</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t just any woman. She wasn\u2019t someone he wanted to fuck to quick orgasm and then roll out of bed and into his combat boots.</p><p>He wanted to take his time, lavish her with the attention she deserved. He wanted to touch and taste every single inch of her beautiful body. But more than that, he wanted to slide into her mind and fill it with beautiful things to replace all the evil she\u2019d been exposed to.</p><p>She tugged her hand from his and looked away, her bottom lip tucked between her teeth. She looked hesitant and adorably shy, and it made him want to pull her into his arms and promise her the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrace.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up, her chin wobbling just a bit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to undress you, but you need to tell me if that\u2019s okay. If you want me out of my clothes first so you don\u2019t feel at a disadvantage, I can do that. You tell me what you need and I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed and she looked genuinely perplexed. It was then he realized that the thing he could do most for her was to simply take control so she felt secure at all times.</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, he moved in and slid his hands underneath the hem of her shirt. His palms skimmed over her lean belly and upward, dragging the shirt with him.</p><p>\u201cLift your arms.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she raisle isdo ed her arms and he pulled the shirt over her head. His gaze was riveted to the soft swells of her breasts. So plump and delectable. Perfectly feminine. She was thin from weight loss, which made her breasts seem even plumper on her small frame. They were a perfect size, just enough to fill his hand.</p><p>And her nipples were a delicious pink. Soft around the nipple and then hard and erect, puckered and just begging for his mouth.</p><p>She started to cover herself self-consciously, but he put out a hand to stop her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. You\u2019re beautiful, Grace. So very beautiful. You have nothing to hide. Certainly not from me.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was wavering but her eyes lit up. She stared at him like he was the only man in the world. Like he was somebody damn special.</p><p>He fumbled with her pants and pushed downward until they bunched at her ankles.</p><p>\u201cSit down on the edge of the bed,\u201d he directed.</p><p>He held on to her hand so she didn\u2019t trip as she took the few steps back. Once she was perched on the edge, he pulled the pants off.</p><p>She was only in a simple pair of white cotton panties, but she rocked them like they were Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s sexiest lingerie.</p><p>\u201cLie back,\u201d he said in a husky voice.</p><p>Slowly she reclined until she was on her back, her hair splayed out around her. Her legs still dangled from the bed, her toes just grazing the floor.</p><p>He slid his hands up her legs, starting at her knees and working up to her hips. Then when his thumbs slipped under the band of her underwear, he leaned down and kissed the shallow indention of her navel.</p><p>She shivered and chill bumps dusted a fine layer over her skin.</p><p>Slowly, he eased the panties over her hips, uncovering the dark curls at the apex of her thighs. He continued sliding them down until they were free and he dropped them onto the floor.</p><p>He found her gaze again, read the stark vulnerability shining back at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to love you, Grace. I\u2019m going to taste you and touch you and I\u2019m going to make you feel so very good. But you have to tell me if I ever do anything that makes you uncomfortable. Promise me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>He kissed one knee and then the other. Then he slid his hand between them and nudged them apart. He enjoyed the silky expanse of skin on the insides of her thighs. So satiny. His palms glided toward the juncture, spreading her wider as he went until her soft woman\u2019s flesh lay open and glistening before him.</p><p>Reverently, he lowered his mouth, dying to have his lips on her. Just wanting her taste on his tongue.</p><p>Gently, he opened her farther, using the pads of his thumbs. She shivered uncontrollably, her legs tightening. He stroked her a moment, content to explore the soft folds.</p><p>He touched her clitoris, just a simple touch, and then followed it with a firmer caress. This time, her hips lifted and her hands balled into fists at her sides.</p><p>After he teased the flesh into a taut bud, he swept his tongue over it. She cried out but he didn\u2019t lift his head to check her reaction. He could tell by the instant tension that rolled through her body that she\u2019d found pleasure.</p><p>He sucked tenderly, flicking the tip of his tongue repeatedly over the bundle of nerves, stroking and teasing.</p><p>\u201cRio!\u201d</p><p>It came out more as a breathy sigh. It was the kind of sound that boosted a man\u2019s ego. It told him he was pleasing his woman. That there wasn\u2019t another man she was thinking of at this moment.</p><p>He worked downward, savoring hed, u ar taste and the way she arched into him. He licked over her opening then reached down to slide one finger inside.</p><p>He nearly groaned. She was so damn tight and all he had was his finger inside her. How much more glorious would she feel all snug around his cock?</p><p>Even though his body screamed at him to get his damn pants down and thrust inside her warmth, he knew he couldn\u2019t blow this. Grace deserved better than a quick lay. He wanted to give her more. He wanted this to be...Well, hell. He wanted it to be special.</p><p>Nothing like performance anxiety at the two-minute warning. Right now his dick was warning him that if he didn\u2019t get inside the end zone soon, it was going to be all over.</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath, inhaled her scent and nearly came in his pants right there. He needed out of his damn clothes. He was about to crawl right out of his skin.</p><p>He kissed her again, withdrew his finger and glanced up to see her staring down at him, her expression dazed and eyes burning with desire.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move a muscle,\u201d he managed to grind out.</p><p>He hastily stripped, or he started to. He\u2019d ripped his shirt upward when her husky voice reached his ears.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t hurry. Please. I want to watch.\u201d</p><p>He had to close his eyes and collect himself. Everything she did and said just did it for him. He couldn\u2019t ever remember a woman being so curious and eager to see and enjoy him. His body. They were usually in as every bit of a hurry as he was. It was sex. Hot, sweaty, quick sex.</p><p>If he had his way, he was going to stretch this out the entire damn night.</p><p>He slowed down and eased the shirt up his chest, baring himself inch by inch to her avid gaze. And she was staring hard at him. He lost her a moment when he finally pulled it over his head, but when his gaze settled back on her, she was caressing him with her eyes.</p><p>Her enjoyment of him was there for the world to see. Shining in her eyes. Clear, unapologetic appreciation. It made him want to bow up and flex or do some other equally immature male posturing.</p><p>\u201cNow your pants,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>As she made the request, she rose up to one elbow then pushed back with her other hand so she could fully see him. Just to make sure she was completely satisfied, he backed up a step so she could see all of him.</p><p>When his hands went to his fly, he heard her breath do a little fast hiccup. Getting into the spirit of the striptease, he took his time undoing the fly and easing the zipper down. He locked on to her gaze, enjoying watching her every reaction. He wondered if she even realized how expressive she was, how every thought seemed to be reflected in her eyes.</p><p>With the fly open, he slid his thumbs around the waistband, paused a moment and then began to ease his pants down. As soon as his dick popped free, her eyes widened. Her gaze went up to his, then back down, then back up again.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help himself. He let out what might be the cockiest grin ever.</p><p>\u201cLike what you see?\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cSomehow I didn\u2019t see you as going commando.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say? You little tease.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and then blushed. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you can\u2019t read my mind.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he advanced, his cock surging upward even more. It was so damn tight and swollen that even moving was painful. He felt like he was going to split apart at the seams. He\u2019d never been so goddamn hard in his life.</p><p>He placed his hands down on the bed on either side of her hisidit ps and leaned i</p><p>n until their mouths were close and he could feel her breath on his lips.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you were thinking, Grace.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened again and she blushed even harder.</p><p>\u201cTell me. I want to hear every little dirty thought that went through that mind of yours.\u201d</p><p>Her pupils widened, darkening her eyes to midnight blue.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering how we\u2019d ever fit,\u201d she whispered as if imparting a secret.</p><p>He smiled and then kissed her. Hard. When he pulled away, he was still smiling. \u201cWe\u2019ll fit, Grace. I\u2019ll make damn sure of that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>GRACE\u2019S eyes widened once more and she glanced down as if seeking confirmation herself. He curled his hand around his length and stroked up and down, allowing her to see for herself his size.</p><p>\u201cSee? Not so bad,\u201d he said in amusement.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t look convinced, but he figured if she was still worrying about the size of his cock when he got inside her, then he was doing it all wrong anyway.</p><p>After a gentle squeeze to the head and a moment to ward off impending orgasm, he put his hands on her shoulders and once more guided her down. This time he wanted to feast on those perfect breasts.</p><p>He wanted to lick down one side of her body and back up the other. And although he loved breasts as well as the next man, he was dying to fondle her ass and spend time exploring every curve and swell of that delectable backside. A curvy behind did it for him every time, and while Grace may be slender from her ordeal, she still had an ass to die for. He\u2019d done his share of fantasizing about cupping it as he plunged into her.</p><p>Or of palming it as he took her from behind.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d even imagined taking her anally, which caused him to call himself all sorts of foul names. She was so damn sweet and gentle and beautiful and he was playing out scenes in his head from some skanky porn movie.</p><p>He positioned himself between her legs and lowered his body down so he could finally have his mouth on her taut nipples. His cock brushed over her pussy and lay sandwiched between their bodies, the tip touching the soft skin of her belly.</p><p>He angled himself so he could reach her breasts without having to move. He loved the feel of her surrounding his cock. She twisted restlessly beneath him, and he knew she was growing impatient. That made two of them.</p><p>He licked over one hard point, licked again and then sucked gently. Her fingers dove into his hair, surprising him with the ferocity of her grip. Her fingers were clenched tight around the long strands, her hand balled into a fist at his scalp.</p><p>Hell, she\u2019d probably pull him bald, and he didn\u2019t really give a damn. She could pull it all out as long as she was screaming his name while she did it.</p><p>\u201cI like that,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He smiled against her breast then lifted his head to meet her gaze. \u201cI like it too. You have beautiful breasts, Grace. The entire package is beautiful inside and out.\u201d</p><p>Moisture gleamed in her eyes and he leaned up to kiss her full on the mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t say it to make you cry. It\u2019s the God-given truth.\u201d</p><p>She caressed his cheek, rubbing soft fingers over the roughness of his jaw. \u201cThank you for that. For giving me back some of what I\u2019ve lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have my way, you\u2019ll get it all back.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lips once more and then angled himself toward her other breast. He cupped ier hi her t in his palm, plumping it upward so the nipple protruded even farther. He grazed his teeth over it ever so carefully, giving it a gentle nip before sucking it fully into his mouth.</p><p>She gripped his hair again, directing his movements. He quickly discovered she liked the light touches followed by hard sucking motions.</p><p>He rubbed his cock up and down the seam of her pussy and then onto her belly, mimicking movements their bodies would be doing soon. Each time he suckled at her breast, she grew wetter and slicker around his dick. He\u2019d definitely found her sweet spot. She responded more avidly to having her breasts touched and kissed than she had when his tongue was inside her pussy, though she hadn\u2019t exactly not liked that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy,\u201d she said as she pulled him back down to her breast.</p><p>He chuckled, wincing as she gripped his hair tighter. She may be timid and shy about the whole lovemaking experience, but when it came to what she liked, she wasn\u2019t hesitant whatsoever.</p><p>He kept his mouth on her breasts, but he slipped one hand down between them. He slid his fingers through her wetness to her opening, testing her readiness.</p><p>She was hot and wet, and as soon as he breached her entrance with just the tip of his finger, she arched up and moaned.</p><p>Oh hell yeah, she was ready.</p><p>He kissed her one more time for good measure and then pulled her down the bed so that her behind was perched just on the edge and was at just the right height and angle for him to take her.</p><p>\u201cHook your legs around me,\u201d he directed. He didn\u2019t want her uncomfortable, and being so close to the edge of the bed, if he didn\u2019t support her legs, it was going to be a hell of an uncomfortable ride for her.</p><p>She readily looped her legs around his waist and he slipped his hands underneath her behind, loving the feel of those lush cheeks in his palms.</p><p>He withdrew one hand, slid a finger inside to better prepare her and then he grasped his cock and fit it to her opening.</p><p>He pushed forward the barest of inches and her heat immediately enveloped him. Her swollen tissues hugged him tightly, making it difficult for him to gain entrance.</p><p>It was the single fucking most incredible sensation he\u2019d ever experienced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she looked uncertain, and she was tense, her eyes wide.</p><p>He withdrew, though he\u2019d barely gotten the head inside her opening. He reached down and stroked over her flesh, teasing, wanting to make her relax. She was slick against his fingers and she began to arch upward, responding to the gentle caress.</p><p>Once more, he found her opening and pressed forward, and she immediately went tense again. Her brow furrowed and creased in consternation and it was then realization struck him. He pulled away from her instantly, making no attempt to hide the shock he was feeling.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d</p> <p>She stared up at him, her blue eyes glossy with a sheen of tears. He felt sick. He\u2019d hurt her. He\u2019d hurt her and it was the very last thing he\u2019d ever intended to do.</p><p>She was a virgin and he hadn\u2019t known. He\u2019d almost taken things too far, had almost pushed inside her with one thrust because he\u2019d been so eager to be balls deep in her sweet heat. He would have torn her in his haste.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he asked hoarsely. \u201cThis is definitely a conversation we should have had before now.\u201d</p><p>She flushed and started to look away as shame crowded into her eyes. But he leaned over her, his body pressed to hers as he framed her face, forcing her to look at him.</p><p>\u201cD1emme on\u2019t misunderstand me,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about disgust or the fact that I don\u2019t want you. It\u2019s about me making this the best possible experience for you. You\u2019ve had nothing but pain and abuse heaped upon you. This isn\u2019t just your first time, Grace. It\u2019s my first time too. It\u2019s my first time with you, and I don\u2019t want us both to remember this experience as anything but something beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are making it beautiful,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou make me feel beautiful. Wanted. Nobody has ever made me feel the way you do, Rio. Please don\u2019t stop. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you. I should have trusted you enough to have been honest from the start. I just wanted you so much and I didn\u2019t want my virginity to cause any weirdness between us. And maybe...maybe I thought you wouldn\u2019t want me quite so much if you knew I didn\u2019t have any experience,\u201d she added with a grimace.</p><p>Not want her? Hell, right now the primitive caveman inside him was roaring in triumph and beating his chest like a damn Neanderthal. It was a stupid fact that he was damn glad she hadn\u2019t had another lover. That she hadn\u2019t ever wanted someone enough to give herself to another.</p><p>\u201cIt was a stupid thought,\u201d he said with a scowl.</p><p>Her lips quirked upward in a grin and her eyes sparkled. She raised her hands to his face, framing it as he\u2019d done hers, and then she lifted her mouth to his. \u201cThen make love to me,\u201d she murmured against his mouth. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He slid his body down hers, pausing to tongue her nipples. \u201cJust as soon as I make you crazy with lust again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready there,\u201d she gasped.</p> <p>But he patiently wooed her, with his mouth, with sweet words, with gentle caresses. He kissed a line down her belly and then knelt at the end of the bed so that his mouth hovered just between her thighs. One kiss. Just a simple kiss that he pressed to her quivering flesh, and it was like being hit by lightning. She arched upward, gasping as his tongue circled her clit and teased it mercilessly.</p><p>Her knees shook. Her entire body trembled as he continued to make love to her with his mouth. He kissed the mouth of her opening. Sweet, gentle kisses of apology as if to say he was sorry for hurting her. Then he pulled away and slid his finger into her opening, testing the resistance. He stretched experimentally, watching her face the entire time. When she grimaced, he withdrew immediately and then lowered his mouth to soothe away the hurt.</p><p>\u201cRio, please!\u201d</p><p>He rose up and over her, his eyes serious. \u201cI told you that you\u2019d never have to beg me, Grace. Not for anything.\u201d</p><p>He slid his palms over her belly and up to her breasts, cupping them both. Then he stared down into her beautiful eyes as he reached down to position himself between her thighs once more.</p><p>He slid his thumb over her clit and then began to push inside her with steady pressure. He didn\u2019t want to just rip into her, but neither did he want to delay the inevitable and cause her more pain by drawing it out. She gave way underneath the relentless pressure and he heard her soft gasp.</p><p>She went tense all around him. Her eyes widened and her lips parted in a silent cry but then she bit down hard, as if to stifle any outburst. He swallowed and clenched his jaw as he sought valiantly to get himself under control.</p><p>He was about to crawl right out of his skin. She was hot and swollen around him, gripping him so tight that he was nearly senseless with pleasure. He\u2019d never felt anything so damn good in his entire life.</p> <p>But wth=rchhen he looked into her eyes and saw the tears she was valiantly trying to hold back, the ache in his chest grew until it was painful to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He kissed her forehead, her cheeks, her nose and then each eyelid. He kissed the corner of her eye, where a single tear had escaped, and he licked it away.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you anymore, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>She turned her chin up, hungrily finding his mouth. \u201cPlease, just don\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t...leave. You didn\u2019t hurt me. It was just a shock and then it was so overwhelming. I just got emotional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, honey,\u201d he soothed. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d He thumbed a tendril of hair from her cheek and then kissed her again, lingering, so tender it made him ache.</p><p>As if he would leave her. He wasn\u2019t going anywhere until she was more than satisfied. Over his dead body would he leave things as they were right now.</p><p>There were so many questions running through his mind that he was dizzy with them. Uppermost was how in the hell did this woman ever get to here and now without having had a man make love to her? Were they all brainless idiots or had she purposely kept her distance? And if she had, why him and why now?</p><p>It was stupid and pointless to try to read too much into the fact that she\u2019d given her virginity to him. Not to anyone else. Him. It was a precious gift that he felt savage satisfaction over receiving. No one would ever have what she\u2019d given him. It was his alone.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said. When she complied, he kissed her once more and remained completely still. He was afraid of moving too soon, too fast, of hurting her more than he already had. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take this nice and slow and easy.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and he saw relief flash in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rise up just enough that I can get my mouth on those gorgeous breasts of yours again. I want you to try to relax as much as possible. I want you to enjoy this. You liked it when I touched your breasts and your nipples.\u201d</p><p>She blushed hard but nodded her agreement.</p><p>\u201cWhen I did it before, you got wet. So we\u2019re going to do that again and then I\u2019m going to take it really slow and be extra gentle until we get the hang of this, okay?\u201d</p><p>She teared up again, nearly ripping his heart out of his damn chest. Then she reached up with both hands and framed his face. She pulled him down into a ferocious kiss that left him breathless. It also had the unfortunate result of making him even harder inside her.</p><p>She twitched and fidgeted underneath him as if trying to find just the right spot while she adjusted to his size and just having a man where no one had ever been.</p><p>\u201cThank you for making this so perfect,\u201d she said in a choked voice.</p><p>Her statement robbed him of speech. His mouth opened but just stayed there. Perfect? He stared down at her like she\u2019d lost her mind, but she just smiled and then kissed him again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone else being so sweet and gentle. You\u2019re an enigma, Rio. So hard on the outside, but you know what? I think you\u2019re a giant fluffball inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFluffball?\u201d</p><p>He was horrified. Fluffball? Hell, if his men ever heard that, he\u2019d be fucking toast. They would never, ever in a million years let him live it down.</p><p>And then if the other team, Steele\u2019s team, got wind of it...It didn\u2019t even bear thinking about. Steele would ride his ass hard for the next ten years.</p><p>Her smile grew bigger. \u201cYes, a fluffball. A sweet, wonderful fluffball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh hell.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and he supposed he could take her laughing at him over the tears she\u2019d shown just moments ago.</p><p>\u201cNow as I recall, you said something about my breasts,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cOh yes, ma\u2019am. I like it when you get kind of bossy on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss them,\u201d she begged softly. \u201cI love your tongue and your mouth and when you suck on them. I can\u2019t even explain how good it feels.\u201d</p><p>Her words hummed like sweet music over his ears and down his body, eliciting a bone-deep shiver. His cock surged forward and he was about to apologize but she moaned softly, closed her eyes and tilted her breasts upward in silent invitation.</p><p>Relieved that the worst seemed to be over, he was more than happy to oblige her. He licked over one nipple then went for the other, giving it equal treatment.</p><p>He nibbled, sucked and licked, going back and forth until she was writhing beneath him. He doubted she even realized that she was doing all the work around his cock and he let her do it at her own pace even though it was killing him not to go at her and go hard.</p><p>She was arching her hips up, taking him deeper, her ankles crossed at the small of his back. She was wrapped so tight around him that he swore he\u2019d wear the indentions from her heels in his ass for days to come.</p><p>\u201cRio, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d she wailed. \u201cI need...\u201d She closed her eyes and arched her hips again. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She was wet around him. Slick and hot and she wasn\u2019t quite as snug before. She was close to her orgasm and he wanted to make it pretty damn awesome for her.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me, honey, okay? And trust me to take you where you want to go.\u201d</p><p>Her hands instantly went to his shoulders. Her nails dug into his flesh and her gaze locked with his. Trust was shining, a light on the darkest night. It hit him in the gut. It humbled him that she was giving him so much.</p><p>He gathered her tightly in his arms and began a slow, measured thrusting pattern. She sighed and then she moaned. She let out little gasps and whimpers. She was noisy and fidgety and he loved every damn minute of it.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He grinned, kissed that luscious mouth of hers and then began driving into her, deep, hard, showing her that she was his.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she breathed out. \u201cOh, I like this too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I, honey, so do I.\u201d</p><p>His muscles flexed and bulged. He gritted his teeth together, determined that she would be satisfied first. Her eyes widened, her body tightened, and her pussy fluttered around his cock, driving him to further insanity.</p><p>\u201cLet go, honey. Go with it. Don\u2019t fight it. Just let it happen.\u201d</p><p>She went slick, like liquid silk, surrounding him, bathing him in her sweetness. And then he felt her spasm around him.</p><p>\u201cOh hell. I\u2019m coming too. Don\u2019t let me hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She roared at him not to stop. He roared her name as he came in wave after wave. He was still coming several long moments later when she went limp beneath him. He pounded into her over and over as he poured himself into her.</p><p>He leaned down, his hips still jerking as he settled over her. God, she felt good. He didn\u2019t ever want to pull out. His cock was still twitching and leaking semen, eakh=\"but he was deep inside her and he\u2019d never felt so goddamn content in his life.</p><p>He pulled her close until he wasn\u2019t certain she could breathe, but she was against him, around him, skin to skin, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>After a moment, he rolled them to the side, ignoring her sleepy protest. The movement caused him to slide out of her warmth, and they both moaned, though he suspected for different reasons.</p><p>She had to be tender after that epic lovemaking session. He\u2019d never spent so much time inside a woman for one sexual encounter in his life. And she\u2019d been a virgin.</p><p>He glanced down as he came free, frowning at the smear of blood on his cock. He didn\u2019t like to think of hurting her at all. She\u2019d had enough hurt in her life.</p><p>\u201cStay on your side,\u201d he murmured next to her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll go get a cloth so we can clean up and then you can sleep if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>Smiling, he got out of the bed and went into the bathroom to clean himself off with a damp washcloth. Then he ran the water until it got hot, wet another cloth and wrung it out.</p><p>When he returned, her eyes were closed, but as soon as he slid onto the bed, her gaze found him.</p><p>\u201cOpen your legs for me,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Shyly, she parted her legs, lifting one upward and then bending her knee so she could prop her foot against her other leg.</p><p>She sighed when he pressed the warm cloth to her skin. There was something decidedly intimate about him wiping away the proof of his possession. The rag came away sticky with her blood and his semen. He stared at it for a long moment, realizing the significance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d been a virgin and he\u2019d been her first. He also hadn\u2019t thought to use a condom. Perhaps more irresponsible than not using a condom was the fact that he didn\u2019t give a shit that he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>In his mind, she was his. Whatever happened as a result of th</p><p>eir lovemaking, they\u2019d face together. Just like they\u2019d meet head-on the dangers that pursued them.</p><p>He tossed aside the washcloth and then pulled back the covers so he could get her underneath. After she was settled, he climbed in beside her and pulled her flush against his body, tucking her head beneath his chin.</p> <p>There was a lot to think about. A lot to decide. But some decisions had already been made. Such as the first time he\u2019d ever seen Grace Peterson and decided that she was his.</p><p>He\u2019d tracked her down. He\u2019d sworn to protect her. She was here in his arms, in his personal sanctuary.</p><p>For him, that was akin to a freaking marriage proposal.</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>GRACE dozed lightly, snuggled tightly in Rio\u2019s arms. She never slept fully but instead existed in a dreamlike state. She was limp, drained of energy, but in an oh my God good way.</p> <p>He felt good against her. Strong. Hard as a brick. Warm. And so comforting. She felt cherished and that was her weakness.</p><p>She wanted someone to demonstrate the kind of caring that went beyond an impersonal relationship.</p><p>She rubbed her cheek over his chest and sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the sigh for?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head to see that he was very much awake and staring inquisitively down at her. She propped her head up in her palm and nudged her elbow up under her pillow so she could see him while still remaining as close to him as possible.</p><p>\u201cJust seemed like the thing to do,\u201d she said simply.</p> <p>f Pen puHe touched her cheek and then her hair, stroking lightly as he continued to study her. Then he cocked his head to the side. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>Warmth seeped into her cheeks. She didn\u2019t deliberately try to misunderstand his question. She wasn\u2019t entirely certain just how honest she should be with him. How she answered could change a lot between them. Or change nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cYou have to know what my life\u2019s been like,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cAlways moving. Never having friends. Never trusting anyone. It was so ingrained in me and Shea that after a while being loners was just natural.</p><p>\u201cShea...Shea was a little better at it than I was. I mean she tried more. She wanted a normal life and I think in the beginning she was more na\u00efve in thinking she could actually have that normalcy. We both were in denial of our circumstances, but she more than I ignored the reality of who and what we were. I think Shea thought if she didn\u2019t acknowledge it, then it didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cFor me, it was an everyday battle. Always seeing people hurting. In need. Knowing of sick children. I lived with the knowledge that I could help them. That I could make a difference and yet I could tell no one, and if I reached out to one of them, it would mean discovery not only for me but for my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a lot of responsibility to take on your shoulders,\u201d Rio muttered.</p><p>\u201cI hated myself.\u201d</p><p>Rio slid his hand over her face, cupping her cheek as his eyes bored into hers. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t hate yourself.\u201d He kissed her, leaving his lips pressed against hers as he stroked her hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t be responsible for the world. You can\u2019t help everyone. You know what it does to you. How does it help anyone if you die?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt frustrates me, you know? I feel like I\u2019ve been given this really awesome gift but, oh wait, I can\u2019t use it because it may be too much and I may die. What kind of deal is that? What\u2019s the point? Not using it seems so irresponsible and selfish. And yet if I use it, it endangers me and my sister. No matter what I do, the outcome sucks.\u201d</p><p>She was near tears again, and instead of showing her utter weakness once more, she turned her face into the pillow and then burrowed closer to him so that her head was wedged between his chin and the pillow.</p><p>Rio continued to run his hand over her hair, pulling through the strands with his fingers. For a long moment, he was silent. Only the sounds of his breathing filled the room.</p><p>When he spoke, it was a low rumble, serious and yet calm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the answer to that, Grace. Maybe your purpose hasn\u2019t yet been revealed. Maybe what you\u2019re supposed to do is survive until the day when you know why you\u2019ve been given this gift.\u201d</p><p>His words sank in and she went still. Slowly she raised her head and stared into his eyes. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>Rio shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in everything having a purpose. To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as he quoted a passage from the Bible.</p><p>He gave her a mocking look. \u201cWhat? Don\u2019t think I\u2019m the religious type?\u201d</p><p>She had no idea what to say to that so she remained silent.</p><p>\u201cMy point is that even in olden times, the wisest of men believed that everyone had a purpose and that there is a time for everything under the sun. This is your time to heal. To grow stronger. And then one day the time will come when your purpose will be revealed. It may naleble, serioot be today or tomorrow or even next year. But I don\u2019t believe in accidents of nature. You were given this gift. Your sister was given her ability. For a reason.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth turned down. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t born. We weren\u2019t God\u2019s creation at all. We were conceived in some petri dish in some cold, sterile lab where they wanted to replicate instances of special abilities occurring in the human populace. They hoped by mixing the right genes together that they\u2019d create something extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and touched his finger to her lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t think He had any hand in it whatsoever? Just because you weren\u2019t conceived the old-fashioned way doesn\u2019t mean your purpose isn\u2019t any greater. What if He decided to take something bad and make it good? Look at what Shea did for Nathan. And for Swanny. They\u2019re alive because of her. Never underestimate your value, Grace. Or your purpose. You were put on this earth for a reason. You\u2019re here with me now for a reason.\u201d</p><p>He curled a thick strand of her hair around his finger and tugged slightly. \u201cHas it ever occurred to you that you\u2019re here for me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows went up. What could she say to that? So she turned it back instead. \u201cAnd maybe your purpose was to save me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMaybe so. Maybe we\u2019ll end up saving each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need saving, Rio? Who are you? Is Rio your real name?\u201d</p><p>Some of the light dimmed in his eyes and his lips flatlined. He went silent and his fingers slowly drifted from her hair. Then he grimaced. \u201cMy real name is Eduardo Bezerra. There, I\u2019ve told you something that most other living people don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like an Eduardo. Rio suits you. But how did you get the name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone usually ends up with a nickname in the military. My father was American. My mother was Brazilian. I was born in Rio de Janeiro, but we moved with him back to the U.S. when I was very young. I joined the military right out of high school. When I entered Black Ops, I ceased to exist as Eduardo Bezerra anyway, and anyone who knew him was told he\u2019d died in combat.\u201d</p><p>The implication of what he said hit her hard. She frowned and stared up at him for confirmation. \u201cBut what about your family? Your parents? You said you had a sister. Surely they weren\u2019t told you died.\u201d</p><p>Pain swamped his eyes and then he simply turned away, rolling to the edge of the bed. He sat up, pulling the sheet with him, and he sat there on the edge, leaning forward, head down.</p><p>She got awkwardly to her knees, feeling exposed and vulnerable. But there was something about the look in his eyes that struck a chord deep within her. She\u2019d felt his pain. For a moment it was as if her mind had opened up that path again and she\u2019d gotten a glimpse inside his mind.</p><p>Tortured. Guilt. So much guilt and sorrow.</p><p>Tentatively, she touched his shoulder. He flinched and the muscles jumped and coiled underneath her fingers, but she didn\u2019t remove her hand.</p><p>Then she wrapped her arms around him, laid her head on his shoulder and hugged him tightly, her breasts pressed to his back. She kissed the ball of his shoulder and simply knelt there holding him.</p><p>\u201cDid you see it all? I felt you in my head for just a moment,\u201d he said bitterly.</p><p>She kissed him again and ignored the sharpness in his tone. \u201cNo. Even if I could, I wouldn\u2019t have. I don\u2019t establish links with people I\u2019m not close to. It\u2019s a breach in privacy and I\u2019d never en019 cocroach on yours.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand up to cover one of her hands that lay over his chest. \u201cWell, that put me in my place, I suppose. I snap because you\u2019re in my head and yet I don\u2019t like you saying that you wouldn\u2019t because you don\u2019t establish links with people you aren\u2019t close to. Guess I can\u2019t have it both ways, can I?\u201d</p><p>She rested her chin on his shoulder and sighed. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong, Rio. It doesn\u2019t have to be so difficult that I have to read your mind or see your thoughts. All you have to do is tell me what it is. They told your parents that you\u2019d died?\u201d</p><p>He gripped her hand tighter and then carefully loosened his hold. \u201cYes. At the time I was young and idealistic. It was all for the greater good. In order to serve my country, I had to die. I couldn\u2019t have ties. They needed the ultimate soldier. No family. No baggage. Nothing to hold me back. Nothing that would take a higher priority than my mission. My parents had Rosalina, and I thought everything would be fine.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply and wiped a hand over his face, pushing it back into his hair and holding it there at his nape, his knuckles white from his grip.</p><p>\u201cI was a selfish, glory-seeking fool.\u201d</p><p>Grace winced at the self-condemnation in his voice. \u201cAnd now? Do they know you\u2019re alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d Rio said, so soft she almost didn\u2019t hear. \u201cAnd yet I am dead to them still.\u201d</p><p>Grace blinked, not sure she\u2019d heard him correctly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this part. My sister got involved with a man who was all wrong for her. He was older, controlling. He was a bastard of the first order. He killed her.\u201d</p><p>Even though he\u2019d already told her as much earlier, she still winced at how casually violence had been meted out.</p><p>\u201cI should have been there. It would have never happened. My father had suffered a heart attack. I never knew. I was too busy out saving the world, or so I thought. In truth, I was drowning in shades of gray so murky that I was treading water you couldn\u2019t see through. My mother was afraid of Rosalina\u2019s husband and there was little my father could do in his failing health.</p><p>\u201cI was between missions and having doubts about my purpose. Having doubts that I\u2019d done the right thing. I no longer believed in what we were doing. I wasn\u2019t even sure what master we served. I went to my sister\u2019s house, intending only to see her. I didn\u2019t even know if she had children. I just wanted to look. To make sure she was happy and healthy. What I found was a pregnant woman beaten so badly that she died in my arms, thinking I was a fucking ghost.\u201d</p><p>He choked off and covered part of his face with his hand. \u201cI swore vengeance. It was all I could think to do. I felt so damn guilty. I felt responsible. It became my sole mission in life to make the bastard pay for what he\u2019d done. I tracked him down and I killed him. I don\u2019t regret it. He suffered just as Rosalina suffered. And when I was done, I went to my mother and my father and I told them what I\u2019d done. All of it.\u201d</p><p>Grace caught her breath and went still against him. She hugged him tighter because she sensed that this was where it had gotten bad. She held her breath, dreading what he would say next.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the way my mother looked at me. With such grief and disappointment. My father just looked weary and gray. She said that no son of hers would have ever let his family grieve for his death and that no son of hers would come to her house with blood on his hands, stinkingande the rig of revenge. She then said that in her eyes I was no better than the man who\u2019d killed her daughter and that her son died years before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Rio,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deserved it,\u201d he said bleakly.</p><p>\u201cNo one deserves to be denied forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned my back on my family.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue. There was a lot she could say, but in the end, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. And he didn\u2019t need meaningless platitudes. Some pain just had to be healed over time. And some wounds took much longer than others to mend.</p><p>But she could offer him comfort. The same comfort he\u2019d given to her. She slid off the bed and then climbed onto his lap, straddling his legs as she wrapped her arms around his neck.</p><p>He stared into her eyes, his own gaze serious and intense. \u201cYou have to understand, Grace. I\u2019ll never turn my back on you. I\u2019m not walking away. I swore I\u2019d protect you and I\u2019ll die before going back on my word. I\u2019ll never let what happened to my sister and to my family happen to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She ran her hand over his brow, pushing at his hair. She stroked softly, hoping her touch was as comforting to him as his was to her. \u201cHad you already walked away from Titan before you went to Rosalina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t decided fully yet. As I said, I was between missions. When she died, I quit and spent the next year hunting the bastard. And then after the confrontation with my family, I knew I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. Couldn\u2019t go back. It felt like a betrayal even though they didn\u2019t acknowledge that I was alive. But even then, I didn\u2019t join KGI for them. I did it for me. Because I wanted to be able to look at myself in the mirror each morning and recognize the person looking back at me. And be at peace with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you took the mission to come after me?\u201d she asked curiously. \u201cWas it penance? Did you feel like you had to make up for the past?\u201d</p><p>Rio frowned and his expression grew fierce. He caught her chin in his hand and held her firmly in place as his stare blazed over her face.</p> <p>\u201cFuck no. You\u2019re not some object to assuage my guilt. Is that what you think? Because you</p><p>couldn\u2019t be more wrong. I volunteered to find you because when I looked at you, I saw my future. It was like a flashbang grenade in the face. It all came together in my head. I couldn\u2019t have walked away if I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in utter bewilderment.</p><p>He rubbed his thumb over her bottom lip and then leaned forward to kiss it. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to understand it. Hell, I don\u2019t understand it myself. But I do expect you to accept it. And me. Because, honey, whether you realize it or not, I\u2019m going to be a steady presence in your life from now on. It\u2019s just a matter of how and where I fit in when all of this is over with, but I\u2019m telling you right now, I\u2019m not going away.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p> <p>IT amused Rio to see Grace so befuddled over his claim. He\u2019d all but told her she was his and she had no choice in the matter. Not that she didn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t good enough for her, and he damn well knew that. She needed someone far better than him. She deserved better. And if she told him to take a hike...Well, he\u2019d be lying if he said he\u2019d give in gracefully.</p><p>Some things were worth fighting for. Grace Peterson was one of them.</p><p>But he also knew they had a very lher.&amp; face.ong road ahead of them. Hurdles both visible and not yet visible. It wouldn\u2019t be easy and it wouldn\u2019t be overnight.</p><p>As much as it amused him, however, it also pissed him off that she\u2019d be so bewildered that someone would be so adamant about wanting her. She acted like she\u2019d never really had anyone but her sister care for her.</p><p>Just the idea of her having those kinds of thoughts made his chest ache. It was high time someone appreciated what an amazing woman she was.</p><p>She touched his face again with those soft fingers and he couldn\u2019t help it. He just reacted to her. His dick stirred and hardened. Since she was sitting on his lap, he couldn\u2019t very well hide that fact from her. Hell, he was prodding her ass with the goddamn thing.</p> <p>\u201cI never know quite what to say around you, Rio. I keep thinking that none of this is real. That it\u2019s some bizarre figment of my imagination and that I\u2019ll wake up in captivity and all of this will have been a wonderful dream. Stuff like this just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHoney, listen to what you\u2019re saying. You\u2019re being all skeptical and saying that stuff like this doesn\u2019t happen. Do you have any idea how absurd that sounds coming from a woman with extraordinary abilities? It\u2019s me who should be screaming shit like this doesn\u2019t happen in real life. But the fact of the matter is that it does happen. To me. To you. I go on missions all the time. That\u2019s nothing new. What\u2019s different is being knocked on my ass by simply seeing a woman on surveillance footage and knowing that somehow her life is irrevocably entwined with mine. Now that\u2019s the kind of stuff that doesn\u2019t happen every day. Everything else? Completely normal.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him. One minute he was talking to her and the next she slammed her mouth down over his and took him hungrily. He nearly lost his balance and fell backward, so fierce was she. She wrapped her arms around his neck, thrust her hands in his hair and balled up one fist, holding him in place. As if he\u2019d actually move a damn muscle.</p><p>He\u2019d sit here all night if she wanted to keep kissing him this way.</p><p>He almost whimpered when she pulled away. She continued to stroke his face and he felt like purring. He was such a goner. He wondered if she had any idea that all she\u2019d have to do is pet him a little, look at him a certain way, and he\u2019d lay the damn world at her feet.</p><p>It was insane. All of it. He\u2019d never fallen for a woman. Certainly not in the span of a few days. Certainly not before meeting her.</p><p>But fuck it all, he had fallen hard for Grace Peterson.</p><p>She eased from his lap, and before he could protest, she lowered herself to her knees right between his thighs. She wrapped her fingers around his erection and slid gently up and down, staring avidly as he hardened further.</p> <p>Oh hell, this was going to be torture. She looked for the world like she wanted to explore. Like she was checking things out and doing a little experimenting. Not that he had any objections whatsoever, but this would be a test of his endurance. If he got through this without embarrassing himself, he was going to deserve a medal.</p><p>\u201cRio?\u201d</p><p>His name came out all breathy and hesitant but a little excited, which made him a lot excited. But he forced himself under control and tried not to think about the fact that his cock was wrapped up in her hand and she was driving him crazy with her every movement.</p><p>\u201cYes, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to do this. But I\u2019d like to. I mean...\u201d</p><p>She broke off, blushing madly, and ducked her headuckI don.</p><p>\u201cCan you show me how to do it?\u201d</p><p>Unless he was completely off by a mile, she was kneeling in front of him, hand around his cock, asking him to show her how to give him a blow job.</p><p>One side told him not to be an asshole and to pick her up, spread her out like a feast and show her how good his mouth could feel on her. No way he was going to get inside her when she\u2019d been a virgin just an hour ago and was likely tender from the experience.</p><p>The other side, the side screaming at him inside his head, was telling him to show her exactly how he liked it in great detail.</p><p>What decided it for him was when she looked back up at him, those gorgeous blue eyes wide and imploring, and said, \u201cI want to taste you, Rio. Like you were doing with me. I know guys like it but I have no idea what I should do or how I should do it.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cOh yeah, baby, we like it all right.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThen show me.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand over the top of her head and then dove his fingers into her hair. With his other hand, he gently took his dick from her grasp and pumped a few times until he was rigid.</p><p>\u201cUp higher on your knees,\u201d he directed.</p><p>She braced both palms on the tops of his thighs and pushed herself upward.</p><p>He rubbed his hand over her nape, gently squeezing and caressing to put her at ease. He positioned his cock so it was in line with her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNow open,\u201d he said gently. \u201cLick the head. Don\u2019t take it in just yet. Tease me. I love to be teased. Think of it like flirting. Give me just a taste of how good it can be.\u201d</p><p>Her pink tongue slid over her lip and tentatively touched the tip of his cock. He sucked in his breath harshly and called back the groan of agony. Goddamn it felt so good and she\u2019d barely touched him.</p><p>\u201cA little more,\u201d he encouraged.</p><p>She circled the head with her tongue and then gave him a little extra stroke to the underside. Ah shit but he loved that. It was his favorite place.</p><p>He grasped his dick with a firmer hand and pulled back. She frowned and looked so dismayed that he was kicking himself.</p><p>\u201cWas I doing it wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no. I was going to tell you how right you were doing it.\u201d</p><p>He lifted and ran his fingers up the length to the tightly stretched underside right below the angled tip of the crown. \u201cYou\u2019re sweet spot is your breasts. This is my sweet spot. I love to be touched there. Sucked, licked, whatever you want to do, I guarantee I\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>He clutched at her hair and guided her back. \u201cOpen again.\u201d</p><p>This time she took more initiative. She licked teasingly over the top and then around, pausing to give extra attention to the area he\u2019d pointed out. He closed his eyes and let her play for a moment.</p><p>\u201cNow take me deeper. Real slow. Watch your teeth and make it tight. Suck lightly as you take me in but not too hard.\u201d</p><p>He eased his length deeper into her mouth. All the while, her gaze was locked with his. She watched him closely as if gauging his reaction to each touch, each suck, and each time she moved her tongue sensuously over his length.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it nice and slow. I don\u2019t want to overwhelm you,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you get used to it, I\u2019ll show you more. For now, find your rhythm and find a way to breathe. Suck in through your nose when I\u2019m deep. As I slide back out, you can breathe around me. In a minute, I mnd 2019;ll want to go as deep as you can take me. I don\u2019t want you to panic. You\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat. You\u2019ll take as much or as little as you feel comfortable doing, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, the motion sliding her tongue up the underside of his erection.</p><p>\u201cGet a little higher on your knees so you\u2019re above me. Then I\u2019m going to move my hand and you take me. I\u2019m just going to lean back and let you do what you want for a little while.\u201d</p><p>She cast him an anxious glance but he smiled reassuringly at her. Hell, she didn\u2019t need any instruction, but he had to admit, it was a hell of a turn-on to have an almost virgin between his thighs, listening to his every instruction on how to please him.</p><p>She was pulling fantasies out of his head that he hadn\u2019t realized he had.</p><p>As soon as her hand slid over his, he loosened his hold and allowed her to take over. He leaned back, bracing himself with his palms on the mattress while she rose up and over him.</p><p>\u201cMove your hand in time with your mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you suck in and take me inside, work your hand down to the base. As you let out, work your hand back up and make it tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>She tightened her grip around his cock and then slowly sucked the crown inside her mouth, but she didn\u2019t stop. She rolled her hand down and followed with her mouth, taking him deep while exerting pressure with both her hand and her mouth.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cExactly like that,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>He felt her smile around his erection and then she let back up, gliding her warm, moist mouth over his length. At the top, she stopped and held the head on her tongue and then swirled it around, laving the bottom and teasing the area with a series of licks and swipes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an awful quick study,\u201d he said from behind clenched teeth. His entire jaw was set tight, bulging outward as he struggled not to orgasm.</p><p>She pulled her mouth away but continued to stroke him with her hand. She looked up, her lips swollen from the attention she was giving him.</p><p>\u201cI like the way you taste,\u201d she said in a sweet, shy voice that had him groaning all over again. \u201cYou\u2019re so hard but yet completely soft. It\u2019s so interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it taste like when you come?\u201d</p><p>He coughed and leaned upward again. \u201cUh, as I\u2019ve never tasted it, I can\u2019t really answer that one for you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDo you mind coming, in my mouth, I mean? Or is it too soon? I\u2019ve heard that it takes a long time for guys to...you know...rebound after having sex. I\u2019ve read that women can orgasm much more quickly and don\u2019t require as much recovery time between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell have you been doing, checking out library books on the subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can find anything on Google,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>An anxious note had crept into her voice, and he nearly shouted hell no but he managed to control himself. Barely.</p><p>Mind? She had to be kidding. He\u2019d shock the hell out of her if she could see into his mind at the moment because he was holding on to a particularly vivid image of him being so deep inside her mouth that his balls rested on her chin while he came.</p><p>He even managed to sound calm when he finally re-sponded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all. I just want to make sure this is what you s iweet,want.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she continued to stroke him. \u201cI do. I like the idea...I mean I guess it sounds stupid, but there\u2019s something so...intimate about it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and merely nodded because, at this point, if she kept this up, he\u2019d never make it to her mouth before he started coming.</p><p>And to think she was worried about recovery time. He didn\u2019t know whether to be insulted or amused. It was obvious she really didn\u2019t know that much about sex but had tried to remedy it and have as much foreknowledge as possible for when she made love the first time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This time she uncurled her fingers so she wasn\u2019t fisting him and held him by her fingertips. Then she licked from the very base, her tongue glancing over his balls, all the way up the underside to the very tip. Before he had any chance to imagine what she\u2019d do next, she sucked him in deep and hard.</p><p>He landed at the back of her throat, and he automatically bucked upward, unable to control his response.</p><p>She gripped him again, steadying herself, and then she slowly worked back up. This time she didn\u2019t tease but rather set a steady rhythm with her hand and mouth, growing tighter with each stroke.</p><p>\u201cUse your other hand to cup my balls,\u201d he said in a tight voice. \u201cSqueeze but not too hard. Work them while you suck me.\u201d</p> <p>The raw, coarse language had the same effect on them both. Grace trembled. Her nipples tightened and became rigid, erect points as they bobbed in front of him. Precum leaked into her mouth, and he worried at first that she\u2019d decide this wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d imagined and bail.</p><p>Instead she slowed and seemed to savor it, almost like she was deciding how she liked it. She rolled her tongue around, catching every bit of the liquid before resuming the slow, sucking motions.</p><p>She had both hands wrapped around him, one around his balls, squeezing and massaging gently, and the other stretched around the base, working up and down in time with her mouth.</p><p>\u201cDeeper,\u201d he urged. \u201cTake me deep, baby. Hold me there. See how deep you can take me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to take over and force her to do anything. He\u2019d rather let her set her own pace, explore at her leisure and do what came naturally to her. It was sexy as hell to discover a blow job with her.</p> <p>In a lot of ways it felt like he was getting his first ever. He could also say he\u2019d never had anything better than right here, right now, with a woman who wanted nothing more than to please him.</p><p>She sucked down until her chin brushed over his balls and her nose rested against his groin. Then she swallowed, her throat closing around him, and he lost the last vestiges of his control.</p><p>He arched into her, barely able to utter a harsh warning that he was coming. He began to spill into her mouth but she kept sucking and moving, seemingly unfazed by the sudden, forceful ejaculation into her mouth.</p><p>He reached out to run his fingers through her hair, his touch gentle and loving as she slowed in her movements. He felt her swallow against him and groaned, knowing she\u2019d just taken everything he\u2019d had to give.</p><p>She seemed to instinctively know he was a lot more sensitive now, and she loosened her grip and suction until she very gently released him. His erection sagged to the side, still semierect, and she looked up at him, her lips still glistening with his release.</p><p>\u201cThat was incredible,\u201d he said</p> <p>hoarsely. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She blushed but smiled big, her blue eyes shining.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, f1D;inding her hands and pulling her toward him.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and lay back so she was atop him on the bed. Then he rolled so she was tucked into his side, their legs all tangled up.</p><p>\u201cThank you. That was very sweet of you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a woman who wanted to please me as much as you.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin up so that her mouth was close to his ear and she whispered as if imparting something top secret. \u201cI love the way you taste. Can I do it again sometime?\u201d</p><p>He groaned again. Did she honestly think he was going to tell her no?</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p> <p>GRACE was shaken awake to see Rio looming above her, a tight frown marring his face. She came instantly to awareness, blinking away the layers of sleep. Sunlight shone in from the high window, softly illuminating the room in morning sunshine.</p><p>\u201cI have to do some recon,\u201d he said tersely.</p><p>She scrambled to a sitting position. \u201cWhat does that mean? Do I need to go?\u201d</p><p>He held out a hand. \u201cNo, no. You stay here. Browning\u2019s going to be here with you. I\u2019m going out with Terrence while Decker, Diego and Alton are going to post a perimeter to make sure no one gets in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs someone here?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Rio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe nothing, but I\u2019m not taking any chances. Browning just came off his watch and he reported movement in the southern sector bordering the river. Said they didn\u2019t look like locals. As I said, it could be nothing, but I\u2019m sure as hell going to check it out.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip but nodded.</p><p>\u201cListen to me. I want you up and dressed and prepared for anything. But I want you to stay in this room until I come back. Unless Browning tells you to move out. If for some reason I can\u2019t return to get you and we need to move, he\u2019ll bring you to meet me through one of the escape tunnels.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse raced out of control until she could feel it at her temples. She scrambled out of bed, staring left and right, unsure of what she was even looking for.</p><p>Rio put his hands on her shoulders and then turned her around to meet his gaze. He lowered his head and kissed her hard and quick.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t freak. I need you calm. There are clothes in the closet. Get what you need. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her one last time and then was gone before she could even tell him to be careful.</p><p>There was no hope of her actually relaxing after that kind of wake-up call. She rummaged through the closet until she found a shirt and a pair of shorts with a drawstring waist. Perfect.</p><p>She frowned as she considered whether or not to take a quick shower. He hadn\u2019t really had time to leave yet. If he found trouble, he wouldn\u2019t find it this quickly, would he?</p><p>Finally deciding to risk it, she set a record for getting hair and body washed and clean. She toweled off, pulled her clothing on and then began drying her hair. She combed it out, left it mostly damp and pulled it back into one of the rubber bands she found in the bathroom drawer.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t win any beauty contests but she was ready for anything.</p><p>Knowing her morning was shot to hell and she needed to find a way to relax, she climbed onto the bed and went through the exercises Rio had shown her the day before.</p><p>Gradually the anxiety melted away and she found her focus. Calm descended. It was as if her mind was a knotted rope that was uncoiling and loosening and fs iwe1em\"&gt;inding its way free.</p><p>Tentatively she reached for her sister, trying to find her way back to that familiar path she\u2019d used for so many years. She was changed, though. Her mind was different. She was different. Nothing was as it was before, and she had to find her way again.</p><p>She brought the image of Shea\u2019s face to the center of her focus and let everything else fall away. She brought to mind the sound of her sister\u2019s voice. How it echoed in her memory. The way it sounded through the telepathic link.</p><p>Warmth spread over her, soothing and comforting. She could literally feel her sister\u2019s smile. And then the faintest echo, so faint she thought she\u2019d imagined it.</p><p>Grace.</p><p>Her name. Shea was calling to her.</p><p>She was about to respond when her door burst open and Browning flew inside, his expression grave.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We have to meet Rio.\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounding out of her chest, she scrambled off the bed, thrust her feet into the pair of shoes on the floor and hurried after Browning, who was already on his way down the hall.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have all the details. Rio said to get you out and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. He\u2019ll meet us in the northwest corner.\u201d</p><p>Grace frowned. That was away from the river. Had they come for her? Had she been found this quickly?</p><p>Browning led her through a tunnel she hadn\u2019t been in. It came out in a small cave, really more of a carved-out hole a few feet up a cliff overgrown with vines and thick moss.</p><p>He dropped down first and then motioned for her to jump to him. He broke her fall and then took her hand, tugging her farther into the dense foliage.</p><p>Limbs and brush slapped at her face, chest and legs. Several times she got tangled up in the undergrowth and nearly fell. She stumbled into Browning, who seemed impatient with how slowly she was moving.</p><p>Several times he looked as though he would say something, but he clamped his lips shut and urged her on.</p><p>After what seemed like an hour of him all but dragging her through the jungle, they stepped into a clearing. Ahead, there was what looked like a village right on the banks of the river. Browning had said northwest, but northwest from the house wasn\u2019t the river.</p><p>She struggled to catch up then pulled at his arm when several people stepped from the small huts that were erected a distance from the banks.</p><p>\u201cBrowning, what\u2019s going on? What are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced and then caught hold of her wrist. He held it so firmly that it hurt, but when she tried to twist away, he only tightened his hold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grace,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cThis is something I had to do. Rio\u2019s going to be pissed that I gave him false information so he and the others would go out, but I had to do it because he would have never let you come otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Fear burned through her stomach. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She tried to take a step back, but he wouldn\u2019t release her hand. She started to struggle, but he pulled out his pistol. She went still, unbelieving what she was seeing. What was happening? Browning pointed the gun at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Grace. Please. I\u2019m not going to hurt you unless you make it necessary. Just listen to me, okay? We don\u2019t have a lot of time.\u201d</p><p>Just then a young woman ran up to Browning, babbling a stream that Grace didn\u2019t understand. Browning held up the hand holp tx20ding the pistol to silence the other woman but then pulled her into his side and held her, even as he gripped Grace\u2019s wrist with his other hand.</p><p>Grace\u2019s blood ran cold and panic gripped her throat. She hadn\u2019t questioned Browning. Rio himself had told her to go with Browning if he told her to. She\u2019d trusted Rio\u2019s men because they were an extension of him. What was she supposed to have done, though, when Rio told her to do just as she\u2019d done?</p><p>Browning had set Rio and the others up so he could get Grace out of the house. But why?</p><p>Browning said something to the woman and then gestured her away. He then turned his attention back to Grace. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>His tone was pleading but Grace was just pissed. \u201cLying to me, dragging me through a jungle and pointing a gun at me isn\u2019t the way to go about asking for my help.\u201d She looked pointedly down at her wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>He loosened his grip slightly but wouldn\u2019t let her go. He kept looking in the direction that the woman had run, and a moment later, relief flooded his eyes. Grace followed the direction of his gaze to see the woman hurrying toward them with a baby in her arms.</p><p>Several of the villagers had formed a loose perimeter, and still more gathered, murmuring in low voices. Several shot the young woman holding the baby looks of sympathy. Others shook their heads and made gestures to suggest she was crazy.</p><p>The woman slowed as she approached Grace. Her expression was pleading and she spoke to Grace in broken English. \u201cPlease do not be angry with Mitch. I begged him to do this. It\u2019s the only way. You\u2019re our only hope.\u201d</p><p>Grace looked at Browning in confusion.</p><p>\u201cMitch is my first name,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d she asked for what seemed like the hundredth time. \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d</p><p>Finally he let go of her wrist but then she noticed that several of the villagers were behind her as well. She had nowhere to go even if she decided to run. She cupped her arm, rubbing absently at the red marks as she waited for someone to tell her what the hell was happening.</p><p>Browning pulled the young woman into his side, his arm wrapped possessively around her waist. There was a fierceness in his expression, one she recognized because it was the way Rio looked at her.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sumathi, my woman, and our child, Ana. Ana is...\u201d He broke off, his voice thick with emotion. \u201cShe\u2019s sick. She\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>Sumathi interjected again. \u201cPlease, you must help her. There is nothing else to do. She\u2019s so weak. I\u2019m afraid she will die today if nothing is done to help her.\u201d</p><p>Some of Grace\u2019s anger slipped away as she stared at the infant in Sumathi\u2019s arms. She was a thin baby, not at all like the chubby, rosy-looking babies that signified good health. The baby lay listlessly in the blanket.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Grace asked Browning.</p><p>\u201cThe doctors call it failure to thrive. No one really knows. She just won\u2019t eat. She has no strength. She\u2019s wasting away and I don\u2019t know what to do. I wanted to take her to the U.S. so she could be hospitalized. I was going to ask Rio for help. I know he would have given it to me. But I didn\u2019t know until just a short time ago and now I don\u2019t think she would be able to make the trip. Sumathi has taken her to see doctors here, but they tell her to feed her. Give her special formulas. She\u2019s tried everything, even asking another woman to nurse her. But she\u2019s dying.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The despair in his voice softened her anger. She looked helplessly at the baby, knowing that she had to try. Knowing what it would do to her and that she might not be able to sustain another healing.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t even sure she could do it.</p><p>Her voice cracked. Emotion and dread knotted in her throat. \u201cYou should know that I\u2019m not certain I can do this. I haven\u2019t been able to connect to my sister since...all this happened. I haven\u2019t tried to heal. I don\u2019t know if I can do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I ask is that you try,\u201d Browning said in a soft voice. \u201cAll we ask is that you try.\u201d</p> <p>Grace glanced around at all the curious spectators. Unease crawled over her. Did they all know what it was Browning was asking her to do? She glanced sharply at him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve only told them you were a physician and that you specialized in matters like this. They don\u2019t know what you can do. I may be a selfish, lying bastard, but I wouldn\u2019t have exposed you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll want privacy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><p>The instant hope in his voice was crushing. Sumathi\u2019s eyes lit up and tears swamped her vision.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sumathi whispered. \u201cMay God bless you for the rest of your days.\u201d</p><p>How to tell this woman that the end of her days might well be here and that she could well be trading her life for this child\u2019s? But as she stared down at that tiny life, so weak and barely fighting, Grace knew she couldn\u2019t turn her back. She couldn\u2019t walk away no matter what it did to her. This child was innocent. She deserved a chance to grow up and be someone extraordinary.</p><p>Maybe her purpose was to save this child.</p><p>\u201cCome this way,\u201d Browning said, guiding her toward a distant hut.</p><p>\u201cWhy are they here?\u201d Grace demanded. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they with you in the U.S., where they can be taken care of?\u201d</p><p>Browning sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know of Sumathi\u2019s pregnancy. We met between missions, when I was here with Rio. The next time I was able to see her was for just a few moments because we were involved in another mission, using Rio\u2019s place as a safe house. I came to see her this time because I wanted her to come back with me to the U.S. I wanted to buy her a house so we could be a family. I\u2019ve missed so much of Ana\u2019s childhood already and she\u2019s just an infant. Maybe...Maybe if I\u2019d been here sooner, I could have done something. Taken her to doctors in the U.S. But now we\u2019re out of time and you\u2019re our only hope.\u201d</p> <p>Grace closed her eyes. It was a familiar story. She was someone\u2019s only hope. Who was supposed to be hers?</p><p>When they reached the hut, Grace stepped inside and Browning came in behind her, closing the door. Sumathi stood anxiously to the side, cradling Ana as she stared hopefully at Grace.</p><p>\u201cYou know what this does to me,\u201d Grace said in a low voice. \u201cYou can\u2019t just leave me here. I\u2019ll be completely helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you may think of me, I would never just leave you. Rio will know where to find you.\u201d</p><p>It was only a small consolation. She was still riddled with fear and uncertainty. She warred with the consequences. Before she wouldn\u2019t have hesitated. She\u2019d been so depleted, so broken, she would have chosen to give this baby her life at the expense of her own in a heartbeat.</p><p>But things were different now. Weren ow.see19;t they?</p><p>Someone cared about her. Rio said he was going to be part of her life.</p><p>But then she stared at Sumathi\u2019s tearstained face and saw a mother\u2019s love and desperation shining in the nearly black depths. How could she live with herself if she sentenced this baby to die in her mother\u2019s arms?</p> <p>She would be no better than the man who\u2019d murdered Rio\u2019s sister.</p><p>\u201cBring her to me,\u201d she said in resignation.</p><p>Sumathi hurried over and readily relinquished the baby into Grace\u2019s arms. Grace sank to the floor on her knees and then positioned the baby so she\u2019d be warm and comfortable.</p><p>She was so listless. As if she\u2019d already given up the fight.</p><p>Grace reached out to her, hoping to find a connection. She made the contact as warm and as soothing as she knew how. Closing her eyes, she narrowed her focus to nothing but this baby in front of her. She blocked out her surroundings, the distant noises, even the worried parents who loomed over her.</p><p>The pathway was so feeble that Grace almost missed it. There was only the faintest sign of life, and she knew that indeed it was nearly too late for this little one.</p><p>As soon as she was able to feel the pathway, she then concentrated on drawing away the weakness, the faint darkness that seemed to surround the baby\u2019s soul. Death had come for her and it was up to Grace to deny it.</p><p>Even the smell of death hovered close by. Grace drew it into herself, pulling all the blackness away from the baby, replacing it with gentle warmth, encouragement and the goodness that had seemed so distant to Grace until the last few days.</p><p>She drew on the strength that Rio had given her. The will to live that he\u2019d inspired. And she gave it to this child.</p><p>Weakness invaded her body. She moaned with the weight of it. It was suffocating, pressing down relentlessly. Despair tugged at her, sucking her i</p><p>nto a black hole she\u2019d sworn she\u2019d never return to.</p><p>She wobbled and felt Browning hold her up, supporting her as she slumped. But it was useless. Grace lacked the strength even to hold up her head.</p><p>She was no longer herself, but this tiny baby barely clinging to life. She was cognizant of the need to break away and summoned the last of her strength to sever the connection between woman and child.</p><p>A lusty cry split the air and Sumathi gasped in wonder. Grace stared dully down at the baby, who now kicked and threw her arms about as if demanding to be fed that instant. Her color was better and she no longer looked as if death was winning the battle.</p><p>But as she glanced up at Browning and saw the paleness of his face and the horror in his eyes, she knew that death had found a new victim.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>RAGE was a terrible, black thing, swelling out of control as Rio cut a path through the jungle. Terrence was barely able to keep up, and Decker, Alton and Diego followed close behind but no one was able to keep pace with their team leader.</p><p>The message had been simple. Browning had Grace and now Grace needed Rio. Browning had sounded bleak and resigned through the com. Fear as Rio had never experienced had struck him and then black rage that he\u2019d been betrayed by a man he trusted. One of his team.</p><p>They weren\u2019t just a team. They lived, breathed the same air, they had a bond unexplainable by most. And yet Browning had taken Grace. Had put her in unimaginable danger. He\u2019d lied to Rio. Lied to his teammates.</p><p>For that alone he deserved to die.</p><p>But Browning had messed with Grace. The one thing Rio considerer whaas cognizad his own. A woman he\u2019d die protecting.</p><p>He\u2019d put his hands on Grace. He\u2019d frightened her and God knows what else. He\u2019d touched what belonged to Rio.</p><p>\u201cRio, man, you have to slow down,\u201d Terrence called. \u201cYou\u2019ll kill him before we get the full story.\u201d</p><p>Rio paused only long enough to stare coldly back at his first, a man he trusted implicitly, but then he was fast learning that trust could be broken as easily as a bone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to die. There is no doubt about that. The question is how long he suffers before I kill the son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Diego let out a curse and surged forward, trying to overtake Rio. But Rio resumed his ruthless pace through the jungle toward the southeastern bank of the river. His pulse was like a hammer, pounding furiously through his veins.</p><p>What had Browning done? And why?</p><p>He\u2019d entertained countless scenarios. That Browning had turned traitor and delivered Grace into Hancock\u2019s hands. But then why would he tell Rio where to find Grace and that she needed him?</p><p>He charged through the last of the thick overgrowth separating him from the village that was just down the river from his compound. His gaze swept the perimeter, his rifle raised and ready to lay waste to any threat.</p><p>Villagers scattered. Sounds of distress and fear rose, and children were quickly herded away toward the cover of the jungle. But Rio wasn\u2019t focused on them. His gaze found Browning, standing outside one of the huts, unarmed, stiff and straight as if awaiting judgment.</p><p>Rio charged toward him, but Browning didn\u2019t flinch away. Didn\u2019t even try to defend himself when Rio drove him to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Rio growled.</p><p>His voice was of someone possessed. A product of his demonic rage and overwhelming fear for Grace.</p><p>He grasped Browning\u2019s shirt, yanked him upward until their faces were close.</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d Browning said, sorrow thick in his voice.</p><p>Rio dropped him and then got up, running for the door. He yanked it open and saw Grace lying on the floor, a young woman hovering over her. Across from Grace on a tiny pallet lay an infant swaddled in a blanket.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>He dropped to his knees, nearly shoving the frightened woman out of the way. Grace lay completely still, pale, her breathing so shallow he could barely see her chest rise and fall. He felt for a pulse and it fluttered ever so lightly, erratic and weak.</p><p>Oh God. What had she done?</p><p>He picked his head up as the door opened and he locked on to the guilt in Browning\u2019s eyes. Terrence stood behind Browning, his face a mask of rage.</p><p>Terrence shoved Browning through the opening. \u201cTell him what you did.\u201d</p><p>The woman scrambled up and ran toward Browning. She threw herself between him and Rio and clung tenaciously as if trying to protect him.</p><p>Gently, Browning disentangled the woman and pushed her away. \u201cNo, Sumathi. You knew this would happen. A trade. My life for my daughter\u2019s. You knew he would kill me for this betrayal.\u201d He cast a look filled with regret and sorrow toward where Grace lay. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt her. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>Rio rose, his hands trembling. \u201cYou did this to her? After seeing what it did, you made her do this?\u201d</p><p>Sumathi thrust her chin up. \u201cNo! He didn\u2019t make her. It was her choice. He brought her here, but it was her choice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSumathi, be quiet,\u201dquio! Browning said in a low, firm voice. \u201cTake our daughter and leave. Go to your parents\u2019 hut and stay there until this is over.\u201d</p><p>She started to protest, but Browning quieted her with a look and an upheld hand.</p><p>Sumathi flew toward where the baby lay, gathered the sleeping infant in her arms, and with a last sorrowful look in Browning\u2019s direction, left the hut.</p><p>Rio couldn\u2019t wrap his head around any of it. There was a lot he didn\u2019t know but all he could think of was the fact that Grace lay a few feet away and she was in a bad, bad way. And his teammate was at the heart of it all.</p><p>\u201cYou have thirty seconds to explain yourself,\u201d Rio gritted out.</p><p>Browning gestured in the direction Sumathi had fled. \u201cShe\u2019s my woman and she had my child. Ana. But she\u2019s been sick since birth. She\u2019s never gained weight. She grows weaker by the day. The doctors say it\u2019s failure to thrive and that we should do this and that but nothing has worked and she was dying.\u201d</p><p>The frustration in Browning\u2019s voice mounted and echoed through the small room.</p><p>\u201cWhen we pulled the mission to retrieve Grace, it gave me hope. After hearing of what she could do, I thought, my God, she\u2019s a miracle. She could save my daughter. And I knew then, that I\u2019d do anything at all, even betray you, to save her.\u201d</p><p>A sick knot formed in Rio\u2019s stomach. \u201cDid you force her to do this? What did you threaten her with?\u201d</p><p>Browning\u2019s head snapped up and his eyes blazed. \u201cI didn\u2019t threaten her. I gave you false information so I could set it up to get her out of the compound without raising suspicion. I brought her here and then explained why. She was frightened and confused at first. Then she seemed resigned. Once she saw Ana, she couldn\u2019t refuse. I knew she shouldn\u2019t have done it. God, I knew it, but I didn\u2019t care because I also knew she was my daughter\u2019s only chance.\u201d</p><p>There was a mixture of emotions on the rest of Rio\u2019s men\u2019s faces. Anger. Betrayal. But also understanding. And indecision. As if they couldn\u2019t make up their mind to be judge and jury over a man desperate to save his daughter.</p><p>But Rio couldn\u2019t give him a pass. Not when it meant Grace could die. May even be dying now. Browning had broken the trust of the team. He\u2019d betrayed them all. How could they ever trust him again? How could he possibly trust Grace to Browning\u2019s protection now that he\u2019d shown he would sacrifice her to achieve his ends?</p><p>Rio wanted to rage at him. Wanted to kill him. But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to give in to the urge when there was so much resignation in Browning\u2019s eyes. A man would do a lot to protect what belonged to him. Rio didn\u2019t fault the intent, but he sure as hell took issue with the method.</p><p>Knowing he had to see to Grace, he turned away from Browning, his action significant in that he no longer looked at or acknowledged his former teammate. His heart was heavy as he bent and gently picked up Grace\u2019s limp body from the mat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As he walked toward the door of the hut, Diego, Alton, Decker and Terrence all stood to the side to let him pass. Browning stood, unmoving, and Rio walked by him without a word or a glance.</p><p>Browning had made his choice. It was a choice that he was right to make, but Rio couldn\u2019t forgive it all the same. Not when what he loved had been sacrificed for what Browning loved and valued.</p><p>Now Browning would live with the consequences. As would Rio.</p><p>Silently, Terrence, Decker, Diego and Alton followed Rio from the hut, leaving Browning inside. Riong ith stepped into the sunlight and then waited for Terrence to catch up.</p> <p>\u201cSee if there is a boat that will take us back. I want the journey to be as smooth as possible for Grace instead of us making a rough trek through the jungle the way we came.\u201d</p><p>An older man, his skin worn and leathery from a lifetime in the sun, stepped forward. He wore baggy, torn pants and a dirty T-shirt. He was missing at least two of his front teeth but he regarded Rio somberly.</p><p>\u201cI have a boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy woman has great need,\u201d Rio said in a quiet voice. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you well for the use of your boat.\u201d</p><p>The old man shook his head and then stepped forward. He placed his palm down over Grace\u2019s forehead and murmured a quiet incantation. Then he stepped away and motioned for Rio to follow.</p> <p>\u201cT, you\u2019re with me,\u201d Rio said. To the others he said, \u201cMeet us back at the house. I want the perimeter secure.\u201d</p><p>The boat was small, one guided with poles, though there were other motorboats pulled up on shore. Rio stepped carefully into the boat, keeping his weight in the center as he gently eased down with Grace held tightly in his arms. Terrence came aboard, followed by the old man, who then gestured for a young boy to come. The boy clambered on, moving swiftly to the back.</p><p>The old man and the young boy worked in unison, positioning the poles and pulling the boat into the current. They kept close to shore, in the shallower water, poles moving swiftly.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Terrence asked in a low voice.</p><p>Rio stared down at Grace\u2019s still face. She was unmoving against him. She wasn\u2019t moving enough air for him to even notice the rise of her chest. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She wasn\u2019t strong enough for this, Terrence. I could kill Browning for this. She\u2019s already been through so much. How could he ask her to do more? To risk her life this way?\u201d</p><p>Terrence sighed and looked away. The big man was struggling. Rio knew him too well to be fooled.</p> <p>\u201cSay whatever it is that\u2019s on your mind,\u201d Rio said grimly.</p><p>Terrence looked back. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt what he did was wrong. I\u2019ve gotten attached to this little lady. She\u2019s strong. She\u2019s a fighter. I like her style. Part of me wanted to stomp Browning\u2019s miserable ass into a paste and feed him to the crocs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood why he did what he did.\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fair. If it were only that, I could overlook it. But he betrayed the team. He went against us. He chose dishonor over unity. That I can\u2019t forgive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t disagree. I guess I just get why he did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let him live,\u201d Rio said simply. \u201cHe\u2019s free to make his life with his woman and child. But he\u2019ll never work for me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d Terrence said. \u201cSome wouldn\u2019t have been as understanding as you.\u201d</p> <p>Rio\u2019s lip curled into a snarl. \u201cI wanted to kill him for daring to touch her. For frightening her and for one minute making her doubt me. Because he led her away on my order. I told her to go with him if he told her to. I told her to do it. And now she has to believe I fed her to the wolves. He\u2019s lucky that my concern for Grace overshadowed my rage because I wanted to shed his blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have believed that,\u201d Terrence said in a quiet voice. \u201cNo matter what line of bullshit he fed her, once she war, em\"s there, she knew you would have never sent her to do that.\u201d</p><p>Rio returned his gaze to Grace and then leaned down to press his lips to her forehead. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right, T.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the boat neared the dock in the alcove off the river that led to Rio\u2019s compound, the old man leaned forward, waited until the boat got close enough and then jumped onto the aged wood and held the boat against the dock with his pole so the others could get off.</p><p>Terrence went first and reached down to collect Grace from Rio. Rio then hauled himself out of the boat and stopped beside the old man.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>The old man nodded formally. \u201cAna is my granddaughter. This woman gave her back to me. My debt is still great. May the Great One be with her on her journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d Rio snarled.</p><p>The old man studied him for a long moment and then flashed a toothless smile. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose she will.\u201d</p><p>He hopped down into the boat, and he and the boy maneuvered back into the main river channel to return to the village upriver.</p><p>Rio strode toward Terrence, who waited on the dock on the bank of the alcove, Grace still in his arms. Rio took her carefully from Terrence and cradled her close. He tucked his chin over her dark hair and began the climb up th</p><p>e stone walkway leading to the first security gate.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Rio stepped inside his house, some of the anxiety evaporating away. He was home. This was where he felt the safest. He had Grace back where she belonged. Now he had to make sure she got well again.</p><p>He laid Grace down in the bed where he\u2019d made love to her just a day ago and tucked the covers around her chilled skin. He had no idea what to do for her. He had no idea to what extent she\u2019d be ill.</p><p>Judging by what she\u2019d said of the other illnesses and injuries she\u2019d healed, she\u2019d taken the baby\u2019s ailment and made it her own. If the baby had been failing to thrive, for the next while, Grace would also struggle to thrive and survive. He just had to hope to hell she had the strength to fight long enough not to succumb to a losing battle.</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>RIO never left her bedside over the next two days. He sat with her, not sleeping except in fits and spurts. He tried to get her to eat, to drink, but as with the baby, it did no good. She lacked the strength and will to survive.</p><p>Rio knew that it wasn\u2019t her. It wasn\u2019t her wanting to give up. But she was having to battle not only the weakness and the illness itself but the child\u2019s will. He could only imagine the hell she was enduring.</p><p>And so he stayed with her through it all, never once leaving her side. He held her through the night. Sat with her during the day. He spoke to her, mostly nonsense, but he was determined that she not think he left her even for a moment. If he could somehow lend her strength by allowing her to know that he was fighting with her, then he\u2019d damn well do it.</p><p>He called Sam the morning after he\u2019d retrieved Grace. In terse tones, he informed Sam they were short a man. When Sam asked, Rio would only say that it wasn\u2019t because they\u2019d engaged the enemy.</p><p>Sam was wise enough to leave the running of Rio\u2019s team to him. He trained his men. He trusted them. He dealt with any issues that arose. Rio\u2019s men followed him and him alone. They didn\u2019t take orders from Sam or KGI. They came from Rio.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send someone to you,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rio said shortly. \u201cI need a few days here and then we\u2019re going to move out. That gives Steele time to be back from his assignment unless you have him scheduled for something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re clear right now. I can provide all the backup you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need it when we bug out. I don\u2019t want to draw attention by having you guys swarm in here. We\u2019ll move out and then meet up with the teams at a different location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName it and I\u2019ll make damn sure we have the manpower there,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the word on Shea? I\u2019d like to be able to give Grace good news when she comes out of this.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened, Rio? When we spoke last, Grace was doing better, or so you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be better,\u201d Rio said, determination resonating from deep within. \u201cI won\u2019t let her be anything else.\u201d</p><p>There were several more moments of silence and then Rio said grimly, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to fight, Sam. There\u2019s no way around it. Titan\u2019s not going to give up and we can\u2019t run forever. I\u2019m buying as much time as possible because I need Grace as close to a hundred percent as I can get her before the shit hits the fan. But it\u2019s coming and there\u2019s not a damn thing I can do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pissant special ops wannabe group is going to get one over on us,\u201d Sam growled.</p><p>Rio laughed at Sam\u2019s arrogance. Titan was far from a special ops wannabe, but Rio liked the insult that Sam hurled out.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me about Shea so I can give Grace something when she comes around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not happy with you or me at the moment,\u201d Sam said dryly. \u201cWhen I told her that you\u2019d called, she immediately wanted to talk to her sister. Telling her it wasn\u2019t possible because I didn\u2019t exactly know where you were wasn\u2019t one of my more favorite moments in my leadership capacity.\u201d</p><p>Rio chuckled. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t imagine it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s fine. Tell Grace she\u2019s doing far better than Grace herself is from the sound of it. Nathan is taking very good care of her. She\u2019s desperate to reconnect with Grace, and she asked me to pass along that she\u2019s felt close to the path more than once. She wanted Grace to keep trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Rio said in a somber voice. \u201cGrace has been trying. It hurts her that she\u2019s been unable to forge that path again. If you could talk to Shea again, tell her...Look, I know Grace hadn\u2019t wanted Shea to see what all she\u2019s endured. But Grace needs her help. She wouldn\u2019t want me to say it. She wouldn\u2019t want me to involve Shea, but right now I\u2019ll take whatever I can get. She\u2019s not doing well, Sam,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cIf Shea can somehow break through to her, I think it would make a world of difference. I need...I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened out there, Rio?\u201d</p><p>Rio hesitated a moment and then said, \u201cSomeone I trusted took advantage of what Grace is able to do. He put her in a position where she couldn\u2019t say no, and she was in no condition to be healing another. She nearly died when I found her, and now she lies here hovering between life and death, fighting a battle that I can\u2019t help her with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou care for her. More than just in a capacity of the mission.\u201d</p><p>Rio dth#x2went silent, refusing to acknowledge Sam\u2019s realization.</p><p>\u201cI should have seen it when you jumped on this mission the way you did,\u201d Sam murmured. \u201cI\u2019m sorry things aren\u2019t good, man. I\u2019ll talk to Shea immediately. She\u2019d want to know. Nathan won\u2019t be happy about it but he can\u2019t very well tell Shea she can\u2019t help her sister out. Particularly when Grace helped Nathan and Swanny when Swanny was injured during their escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, Sam,\u201d Rio said in a low voice. He hated asking for anything, but for Grace, he\u2019d set aside his pride. He\u2019d do anything to get her back. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me when, Rio. I\u2019ll have everyone in position on your go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact you in forty-eight hours. Hopefully the situation here will have changed for the better by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d Sam said. \u201cWe all will be.\u201d</p><p>Rio ended the call, and then returned to where Grace lay so quiet and still on the bed. He sat on the edge, angling his body so that he could see her face. He reached out to touch her, flinching at the chill of her skin and how pale and translucent her face was.</p><p>She looked so vulnerable and defenseless even though Rio knew her to be far from it. She had the courage and resiliency of the strongest of warriors. He\u2019d never witnessed anything like it.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me, Grace,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything hurt you. You\u2019re safe here. Just come back to me. Fight this, baby. Fight one more time. Come back to the people who love you.\u201d</p><p>GRACE knew she was dying and it pissed her off. Her body just sort of accepted it, lying there like it was already dead and her brain just hadn\u2019t gotten the message.</p><p>It was as if it had endured enough and finally just shut down. Her natural ability to heal wasn\u2019t responding as it normally did.</p><p>The dark shadows of death clung to her, enveloping her in their uncomfortable embrace. The longer she drifted as she did, the more the darkness crept in until she existed in that dark place. A world with no lights. It was the ultimate dark room, the bedroom with no night light. It was scary and overwhelming, and the longer it went on, the more she seemed to drift farther away from where she knew she wanted to be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was hard to separate herself from the child she\u2019d saved. She no longer knew where one began and the other left off.</p><p>She was so tired. It would be so easy to just let go and drift away to a much more comfortable place. The shadows whispered to her. Beckoned her gently, a soft lullaby that soothed her soul.</p><p>But each time she thought that she would give in, she was pulled back by an unseen force. A will much stronger than her own in its current state.</p><p>It was uncomfortable. Stark. Unyielding. And yet she gravitated toward it because she sensed that it was where she needed to be. Not this other dark, quiet place.</p> <p>And then, in the dark, a gentle presence. A sliver of sunshine. Warmth stole over her, replacing some of the bone-deep cold that had invaded her body.</p><p>Grace.</p><p>She stirred, hearing her name. She tried to respond but lacked the knowledge of how to. She waited, wanting to hear her name again, but silence settled around her and the cold crept back in.</p><p>No! She wanted to weep. For just a moment, she\u2019d known true comfort. She\u2019d felt warmth and gentleness. She\u2019d felt love and known it was for her, aimed at her, that someone was fighting for her.</p><p>Grace, goddamn rach ait. Don\u2019t you fucking give up. I have no idea if you can hear me. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing this right, but don\u2019t you dare leave me.</p> <p>She frowned because that was someone entirely different. It confused her, being pulled in two directions and yet they both beckoned from the same place. There were two distinct people fighting...For her.</p><p>Grace. I know you\u2019re out there and that you need me right now. I\u2019m here. I love you. Please fight.</p><p>Shea.</p><p>Hearing her sister\u2019s voice after so long devastated Grace. Crumbled her heart to pieces. Stripped her down to her very soul. Tears were wet on her cheeks. Warm tears against cold skin.</p><p>Can you hear her, Grace? Is Shea talking to you? You\u2019re crying, baby. I know you can hear at least one of us. Fight this. We want you back. Fight, Grace. Don\u2019t you dare give up. You\u2019re stronger than this. There is nothing that can beat you down. Do you hear me? Nothing can defeat you except your own will.</p><p>Rio.</p> <p>Grace, please talk to me. Let me know how to help you. You\u2019ve always been so strong for both of us. Let me be the strong one now. Let me help you.</p><p>Shea?</p><p>She put everything she had into reaching out to her sister. Fear paralyzed her because if she couldn\u2019t reconnect, if she couldn\u2019t respond, it would devastate her.</p><p>Grace! I hear you. I hear you, Grace. Barely. You sound so weak, but you\u2019ll get stronger. Talk to me. Don\u2019t let go. Tell me what you need.</p><p>Didn\u2019t want you to see me like this.</p><p>The tears were strong in the message she sent back to her sister. Her best friend in the whole world. The one person she loved and who loved her unconditionally.</p><p>Oh, Grace. Don\u2019t you know how much I love you? How much you are loved? We\u2019ve both been so intent on protecting the other that we\u2019ve forgotten that we\u2019re best when we\u2019re strong. Together. Side by side. No more shutting each other out. Do you hear me? From now on, it\u2019s you and me against the world.</p><p>Grace smiled at the ferocity in her younger sister\u2019s words. Warmth was spreading through her mind and heart. Sunshine replaced the darkness, chasing away the shadows that stubbornly clung, unwilling to relinquish their hold just yet.</p> <p>I\u2019m just so tired, Shea. So cold. I\u2019ve never felt this weak. I don\u2019t want to give up, but I don\u2019t know if I have the strength left to fight.</p><p>And then she felt another presence. Warm but different. So strong and overpowering. It surrounded her from every angle. Lifting her up, lending her the strength she so desperately needed.</p><p>I\u2019m here. We\u2019re here. I can feel him there with you. Can you feel him? I can sense him through you, and he\u2019s strong, Grace. He\u2019s strong enough for both of you. Lean on him. Lean on us.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She sent out the one word, releasing it from the deepest part of her soul. It was a cry in the night, chased by the promise of dawn.</p><p>I\u2019m here, Grace. Right here, baby. I won\u2019t let you go. Take what you need. You\u2019ve been alone for so long. Never leaning on anyone else. This time be strong enough to ask for help.</p><p>She soaked up every bit of comfort. Absorbed the light, embracing it to ward off the dark. She grabbed hold of the hope and the love so readily offered by the two people who loved her.</p><p>Warmth spread to every part of her body. It was an electric current arcing through every muscle, ridding her body of the lingering effects of ng wiillness, madness and the loss of hope.</p><p>I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.</p><p>She sent out the message to both Rio and Shea, bridging the gap, forming an irrevocable pathway between the three of them.</p><p>Don\u2019t let me go. I don\u2019t want to go.</p><p>This time, the voices were stronger. Louder in her mind. So very close.</p><p>No one\u2019s letting you go, honey.</p><p>I\u2019m here, Grace. I\u2019m always here. Always with you, Shea said fiercely.</p><p>And then some of the pain and despair simply began fading away. Absorbed by Shea, who had the ability to take people\u2019s pain and emotions and absorb them into her own body. Just as she\u2019d done for Nathan when he\u2019d been tortured. Just as she\u2019d done so many times since. This was why she hadn\u2019t wanted Shea to know. Hadn\u2019t wanted her to see the depths of Grace\u2019s pain and despair.</p><p>No! Shea, stop it! Don\u2019t you dare take this. It\u2019s enough that you\u2019re here. Don\u2019t do this. Do you hear me? Don\u2019t suffer this for me. You\u2019ve been through enough.</p><p>Tears of frustration burned her eyes. This wasn\u2019t what she wanted.</p><p>Let her help you, Grace.</p><p>Rio\u2019s command was strong. Compelling. He was firm and unyielding. He had a tight hold on her and he wasn\u2019t letting go, almost as if he had a part of her captive.</p><p>I don\u2019t want her to ever feel this, Grace choked out.</p><p>She has people to support her. She has Nathan there. She isn\u2019t alone. And now neither are you. Don\u2019t be so stubborn. Lean on us. Allow us in. Allow us to take it for you until you\u2019re strong enough to bear it yourself.</p><p>More warmth and love po</p><p>ured into her through the connection to Shea. Grace felt herself enfolded by her sister, held tight and rocked back and forth as if she were a child in need of comfort.</p><p>She clung to her sister, hugging her back, afraid to let go for fear the connection would be broken. Shea pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead and smoothed away the hair from her face.</p><p>Sleep now, Grace. Rest so your body can heal, so that when you awake, you\u2019ll be stronger and yourself once more.</p><p>Then she felt the kiss of another. More intimate. Loving. The kiss of a lover. A warm caress. A gentle touch. His arms replaced Shea\u2019s, pulled her into his embrace. Strong. Protective. A barrier between her and all the darkness.</p><p>It\u2019s okay now, Grace. I\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re going to be okay. Sleep now and know that I\u2019ll be here when you wake.</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>WHEN Grace opened her eyes, she wasn\u2019t entirely certain where she was. The ceiling came into focus and then she saw the high window and the soft light pouring into the bedroom where she and Rio had made love.</p><p>She then became aware that she wasn\u2019t alone. Not only was she not alone, but Rio was wrapped around her as if he was shielding her from the world. His leg was thrown over hers. His arm lay possessively over her midsection and his other arm was beneath her head so that she was cradled into his side. And she was completely naked.</p><p>She smiled. She was back. She was alive. She\u2019d made it through.</p><p>There was no doubt she was as weak as a newborn kitten. She felt as limp as a wet noodle and her mind was mush. But she had renewed strength. Strength she hadn\u2019t possessed before and an awareness she hadn\u2019t felt since before she\u2019d severed the link between her and Shea.</p><p>Shea! The awareness was of her sister\u2019s presence in her mind. Always there, just as she\u2019d been before. Tears gathered in her eyes and she bit her lip, afraid to call out, afraid that she\u2019d only dreamed that she\u2019d been able to reconnect with Shea. I\u2019m here, Grace.</p><p>The calm sound of her sister\u2019s voice sent joy coursing through her soul.</p><p>I worried I\u2019d dreamed it all. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. I\u2019ve missed you so much.</p><p>I\u2019ve missed you too, Grace. I love you. It\u2019s been too long. We can be together now. Things are different. We can have a...life. I don\u2019t want to be without you anymore. There\u2019s no reason for it. Nathan and his family have promised to keep you safe. And now you have...Rio. You know you\u2019re going to have to tell me all about him.</p><p>Grace smiled through her tears. Happy tears. So like old times when they shared everything.</p><p>Deal. Just as soon as you tell me everything about Nathan.</p><p>She felt Shea\u2019s answering smile.</p><p>We\u2019ll talk when you\u2019re stronger, Grace. Right now I just want you to focus on getting better.</p><p>Love you.</p><p>Love you too.</p><p>Even though the communication ended, Grace could still feel the lingering presence of her sister. She hadn\u2019t realized just how much she\u2019d missed having her there until she\u2019d been permanently gone.</p><p>\u201cHave a nice chat with Shea?\u201d</p><p>She turned, realizing that Rio was awake and had been silently watching her. She smiled. \u201cYeah. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s back. I thought I\u2019d never be able to talk to her telepathically again.\u201d</p><p>Rio kissed her, his lips gentle and loving over hers. For the longest time he stayed there even when he\u2019d pulled his mouth away. His forehead rested against hers and he cupped her jaw in his palm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou scared me, Grace. I thought I\u2019d lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d lost myself,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>Rio pulled slightly away but kept hold on her jaw, tilting so she met his gaze. \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and closed her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to die if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. I almost refused because I was afraid I would die.\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s face went hard and his eyes cold. \u201cBrowning said he didn\u2019t threaten you. Did he? Did he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She could only imagine what Rio had done to his teammate. She wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to know. She shook her head, feeling the firm imprint of his fingers on her face. It was comforting. There was strength in his touch. And possession. A clear message that he considered her his.</p><p>\u201cI think he was scared. And resigned. It was as if he knew the consequences of what he\u2019d done. Knew you\u2019d be furious. I was pretty pissed too. But I also understood why he\u2019d done it. I can only imagine how I\u2019d feel if it were my child and I couldn\u2019t do anything to help her. I\u2019d lie, cheat, steal, threaten or kidnap anyone who could help her, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you did it? Because you understood?\u201d</p><p>She leaned her forehead against his lips, liking the warmth of his mouth on her skin. \u201cI did it because once I saw her, I knew she was dying. I knew she wouldn\u2019t last much longer. Death surrounded her and I knew that if I didn\u2019t help her, I wouelp onld be responsible for her death and I couldn\u2019t look Browning and Sumathi in the eye and tell them I wouldn\u2019t help their daughter because I was afraid of dying when I\u2019d finally found a reason to live.\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled in her hair. He pulled her back so they were looking eye to eye. \u201cWhat\u2019s your reason, Grace?\u201d</p><p>There was such a multitude of things in such a simple question. There was hope. Curiosity. A little dread. Didn\u2019t he realize? She guessed he didn\u2019t. Things had moved so fast. She hadn\u2019t really been that forthcoming about her feelings. She hadn\u2019t even been sure of what she felt.</p><p>Her entire world had been turned upside down. She\u2019d barely existed for the last year, and yet in the midst of it all, her life in ruins, had come this man.</p><p>He\u2019d challenged her, bullied her and made her feel more loved than she\u2019d ever felt with another human being. He hadn\u2019t allowed her to quit.</p><p>Why? What had he seen in her that very first time to make him so determined to track her down?</p><p>She touched his face, stroking over the roughness of his jaw. He hadn\u2019t shaved and the stubble was bristly over her fingers.</p><p>He looked like hell.</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been asleep?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes narrowed at her avoidance of the question. But she just hadn\u2019t quite found the right words yet.</p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth popped open in dismay. \u201cThree days?\u201d</p><p>He nodded grimly.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the baby?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I assume she\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to ask about Browning and what had been done with him.</p><p>Rio sighed. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>She nibbled at her bottom lip. \u201cAbout Browning. And his family. Did you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I did? The bastard deserved it.\u201d</p><p>She frowned unhappily. \u201cHe was only protecting his daughter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, by risking what belongs to me and betraying his team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why you\u2019d be angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Grace? You can see why I\u2019d be angry? I was fucking furious. You don\u2019t get it, do you? He took what was mine. He took what was important to me and he used you. He could have killed you. And you see why I\u2019d be angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe betrayed you,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Rio rose up on his elbow, his eyes blazing. \u201cIt has nothing to do with me, goddamn it! Don\u2019t you get it? I love you and he tried to suck the life right out of you. Yes, he betrayed me, but I wanted to kill him because he nearly took you away from me.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, opened her mouth and then snapped it shut again. He didn\u2019t give her another opportunity. He slid his hand around to her nape and pulled her to meet his kiss.</p><p>It was fierce and possessive. She felt branded and marked. He kissed her like he was swallowing her whole, devouring her and pulling her into himself.</p><p>He turned her fully onto her back and then he was over her, pushing into her, hot and hard. He slid into her body, locking them together, and then he stared down at her, his eyes burning with emotion.</p><p>\u201cDo you get it now, Grace? You\u2019re mine. I\u2019ve never felt this way about a woman, and I don\u2019t like how goddamn crazy it makes me.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled and arched up with a sigh, taking him farther insim f thisde.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you find this so damn funny,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Her smile got bigger. She wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him down into a kiss.</p><p>\u201cWould it make it better if I told you that I\u2019m just as crazy over you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr that I\u2019m pretty sure I love you just as much?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow we\u2019re getting somewhere,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>She stroked his cheek. She wrapped her legs around him, wanting him closer still. Wanting to find that warmth that burned from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cOr that my reason for finding the will to live after wanting to die is you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened and he went still above her. For the longest time he simply stared down at her as if he was trying to collect himself.</p><p>He was still deeply embedded inside her. She was tight around him and he seemed to swell larger even though he hadn\u2019t yet moved.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI\u2019ve never mattered to anyone. Not in this way. No one has depended emotionally on me. I\u2019m depended on for leadership and strength. Discipline and determination. No one has ever needed me for who I am. Just what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI need you, Rio. You saved me. I\u2019ve never mattered to another soul besides my sister. No one has ever cared about me or about what happens to me. Not until you. I wasn\u2019t just someone with special abilities to you. You saw the real me, and you cared about her. Not what I could do for the world or for someone you knew. You looked inside and saw me.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his forehead to hers until they were touching. \u201cSay it. Say the words, Grace. I don\u2019t just want to hear them. I need to hear them. I need...you.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled, tenderness filling her heart. \u201cI love you, Rio.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared and his jaw went tight as if he were fighting to maintain his control and composure. There was such vulnerability in his dark eyes, and she realized in that moment that for all his strength and resolve, for how protective and possessive he was of her, he needed those same things from her.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Grace Peterson.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew and then pushed forward again, more gently this time and without the urgency he\u2019d displayed when he\u2019d first taken her.</p><p>He kissed her lips then moved to her cheeks, giving each a kiss in turn. Then he kissed her nose, her eyelids and each temple. All the while he continued his gentle thrusting, gliding in and out a</p><p>s he restaked his claim all over again.</p><p>Slowly he ran his hands down her body, then underneath to cup her behind. He held her in place, positioning her for his thrusts as he worked deeper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever risk yourself like that again,\u201d he admonished. \u201cYou can\u2019t save everyone, and I won\u2019t lose you so that you can save one more person. Maybe that\u2019s selfish of me, but I don\u2019t really give a damn.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the gruffness of his tone because underneath was a layer of fear. Fear for her. Fear that he\u2019d lose her. She kissed him again as the first waves of her orgasm rolled over her.</p><p>She held on to him, her anchor, the person who\u2019d taken her from death\u2019s grasp more than once. He\u2019d protect her. She had absolute faith in him. How could she not? He\u2019d faced death down for her and won.</p><p>CHAPTEnada etersonR 29</p><p>\u201cYOU better have something good to report,\u201d Farnsworth growled into the phone. \u201cWith what I\u2019m paying you, you should have had Grace Peterson to me weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t respond well to threats, Mr. Farnsworth. You\u2019d do well to remember that.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth froze at the icy implication in Hancock\u2019s voice. He hated that this man intimidated him. And he didn\u2019t simply intimidate him. He bloody well terrified him, and that pissed him off because he feared no one. People feared him.</p><p>Except this man who headed up Titan. Farnsworth was certain there wasn\u2019t a man alive that Hancock feared.</p><p>\u201cWell? Have you located her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Hancock said simply. \u201cRumor is she healed a child in a village on the Belize River and that it nearly killed her. Nothing is known of her current condition, but I have a lock on her location. My contact there says they\u2019re moving her out soon. If I\u2019m patient, they\u2019ll come to me.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth swore savagely. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to wait a minute longer. What if the little fool had killed herself trying to heal this other child? If she\u2019s going to die healing someone, it\u2019s damn well going to be my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand your impatience,\u201d Hancock said in a mild tone. \u201cBut impatience won\u2019t get you what you want any faster. You hired me to do a job. I\u2019ve never failed a mission yet. Think about that when you\u2019re issuing idle threats because my next mission will be to come after you if you continue your present line of discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get her here. I\u2019m running out of time. I\u2019ll double your price. I don\u2019t care what it takes. You can have all I have because if my daughter dies, I\u2019ll have nothing anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour devotion to your daughter is admirable and I\u2019ve already said that I would have Grace Peterson delivered to your daughter\u2019s bedside in a timely manner. She won\u2019t escape. I know the man who protects her far too well. I know how he thinks.</p><p>I know his next move. I should. He taught me everything I know.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead and Farnsworth threw it across the room. He hated how this mercenary reduced him to feeling insignificant and powerless. As if Hancock held all the cards and he knew it.</p><p>Time was running out. The doctor had seen her again today and had faced Farnsworth with a grim expression and a shake of his head. She didn\u2019t have long. She was growing weaker. Her body could no longer fight off the cancer. It was insidious, growing and multiplying at an alarming rate. There was simply nothing to be done.</p><p>She had days, maybe weeks, but nothing more. She could die tonight or she could die next week. He was afraid to enter her bedroom for fear that he\u2019d find her already gone.</p><p>He slumped into his chair and buried his face in his hands, and for the first time since learning of his daughter\u2019s illness, he wept.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>\u201cRIO, I\u2019m perfectly capable of walking,\u201d Grace protested as he carried her out of the bedroom and into the living room.</p><p>He ignored her and she sighed, though she really didn\u2019t mind him carrying her. She was still living in the new and shiny revelation of knowing this man cared so much for her. It was a little frightening and yet it made her giddy, like a teenage girl with her first crush.</p><p>She was deathly afraid of having that bubble burst. They were not living in a dream world. Not everything was hearts and roses. They\u2019d hollowed out a little niche, a temporary break from reality, but the real world waited like a predator. Teeth gnashing, evil. Those who pursued her hadn\u2019t given up. And they wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Soon they\u2019d go back into that harsh, cold reality, a place where people died, a place where people gave no thought to humanity. She\u2019d be caged, used, the equivalent of a monkey taken out when it was time to perform and then shoved back into her cold, impersonal prison.</p><p>\u201cGrace.\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s impatient voice cut through her maudlin thoughts and she realized it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d called her name. She blinked, also realizing that he\u2019d already put her on the couch and apparently he\u2019d been trying to get her attention for some time.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on in that head of yours?\u201d</p><p>His frown was deep, his lips set into a firm line. It was clear he had no liking for her expression, or perhaps the darkness of her thoughts had transmitted themselves to him. He looked worried and a little pissed.</p><p>She closed her mouth mutinously, not wanting to be a huge damper. It wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t know all of what she\u2019d been thinking anyway. It was a reality he lived with each and every day. He didn\u2019t need her adding to his worry with her whining.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re seriously going to have to work on communication. This clamming up when I ask you what you\u2019re thinking drives me insane. I\u2019m a result-oriented guy. When I ask, I\u2019m not used to being told no.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cGuess there\u2019s always a first time for everything.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a dark scowl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of your men or your underlings,\u201d she said with a snort. \u201cI don\u2019t take having orders barked at me too well. It\u2019s the rebel in me. Shea used to try to boss me around all the time, especially after we split up and went our separate ways for safety reasons. We see how well that worked out.\u201d</p><p>Rio tipped her chin up so they were eye to eye. \u201cThe only time I expect you to obey me without hesitation is when your life is on the line and we\u2019re in a combat situation. The rest of the time, you\u2019re perfectly free to argue all you like. But I\u2019ll tell you now, if I tell you to do something when it counts and you balk, I\u2019ll tan your behind. You don\u2019t get a free pass from me just because you\u2019re gorgeous and I happen to be in love with your ass.\u201d</p><p>A giggle escaped and she clapped a hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNow, you want to tell me what had you looking so worried a minute ago? It has nothing to do with you being submissive to my overbearing arrogant self. I can\u2019t exactly reassure you if I don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re worrying over.\u201d</p><p>Her heart softened and she reached out to touch his cheek. \u201cI love that you don\u2019t want me to worry, but until this is over, until I know for certain that I\u2019m safe and can lead a normal life, I\u2019m going to worry. Because now, I don\u2019t only have myself and Shea to worry about. I have you and your men. Shea\u2019s new family and her loved ones. You\u2019re all involved and I hate that I\u2019m responsible for so much danger to so many people.\u201d</p><p>He started to protest, but she silenced him with a finger to his lips. \u201cYou asked and I\u2019m just being honest. I know that we\u2019re in this kind of bubble right now where time is standing still and that, all too soon, at any moment, we\u2019re going to be thrust back into the harsh reality that is my existence. y existeAnd I hate it. I dread it. I\u2019m sick with worry. Before, I was ready to die. I had given up. I didn\u2019t care what happened to me because I couldn\u2019t imagine ever being free and I\u2019d rather have died than to continue to live in captivity being used on a daily basis.</p><p>\u201cBut now I have people who matter to me. People I care about. And I don\u2019t want them to die for me. I don\u2019t want them to make sacrifices for me. So I dread losing the temporary reprieve, the fantasy of a normal life with a man who loves me. Because I know tomorrow, it may all come to an end.\u201d</p><p>Rio framed her face in both hands, his eyes as fierce as his expression. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you, Grace. I don\u2019t know what will happen. I\u2019m not going to offer you any guarantees and say that we\u2019re going to be able to keep you safe from any threat or that nothing will ever hurt you again. I can\u2019t do that. I know what we\u2019re up against. But what I can promise you is that, as long as I\u2019m breathing, I will do anything I can to protect you. With my dying breath, I\u2019ll always be between you and whatever is threatening you. And if, God forbid, you\u2019re ever taken from me, I will go to hell to get you back.\u201d</p><p>She pulled him to her, kissing him fiercely, allowing the depth of her feelings to pour out physically and emotionally. She opened the path between them, showing him not only with her body but with her mind what his declaration meant to her. To have this proud warrior pledge his very life to keeping her safe was more than she could even process. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wasn\u2019t deserving. She wasn\u2019t brave like he was. She didn\u2019t have a fourth of his courage. She had no idea why of all the women in the world, he\u2019d chosen her. But she was savagely happy that he had, and by God, she\u2019d never let him go.</p><p>Rio yanked away, his eyes sparking with fury. \u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and then her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cDeserving? You aren\u2019t worthy of me? You don\u2019t have my courage or bravery? That\u2019s the biggest bunch of bullshit I\u2019ve ever heard in my life.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth fell open. Yeah, she\u2019d opened the link but hadn\u2019t considered the consequences of him knowing her every thought.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you something, Grace. I\u2019m not worthy of you. Do you even know the things I\u2019ve done? What\u2019s your worst sin? Wanting to give up rather than face a lifetime of pain and misery and of having the misery of others foisted onto you in an endless cycle? Look at the things you\u2019ve done, willingly or not. You\u2019ve given people a new lease on life. You saved a child who would otherwise be dead right now and you risked your own life to do it because your heart is too soft for you to say no even though it might have meant your own death.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea of the things I\u2019ve done, the choices I\u2019ve made. Most of my life has been spent in areas so gray that light had long since fled. Always in the shadows. Questionable causes. Hell, I\u2019m a mercenary, Grace. Which means that if someone pays me enough money, I\u2019ll do the job.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even want to know some of the jobs I\u2019ve taken. Your soft heart would weep over some of the things I\u2019ve done and the choices I\u2019ve made. All in the name of the greater good. Fuck that. Good for who? That\u2019s always the question. Someone always benefits and someone always suffers. There\u2019s no way for everyone to be happy or safe or content. I\u2019m a saint to some, the very devil himself to others. It all depends on which side of the coin you find yourself on. So don\u2019t give me this bullshit about how you don\u2019t have#x2019;t my courage or bravery because that\u2019s just going to piss me off. What you have is something I\u2019ll never have. Goodness that goes bone deep. Unwavering convictions and empathy for others. You have a soul, Grace. I lost mine when I allowed myself to die and my parents to be told I no longer existed. I lost my soul when my sister died in my arms because I wasn\u2019t there to protect her.\u201d</p><p>Grace silenced him with a kiss. She grabbed his face and slammed her lips over his, feeding hungrily on his mouth. Tears ran freely down her cheeks until they both tasted the slight salt on their tongues.</p> <p>\u201cStop, just stop,\u201d she whispered brokenly. \u201cI can\u2019t bear that you see yourself that way.\u201d</p><p>He pulled gently away, his eyes bleak as he stood. He believed everything he\u2019d said so passionately. And she hated it.</p><p>She scooted forward on the couch, not willing to let him escape. She tried to stand but he wouldn\u2019t let her, and so she pulled him back down until he was on his knees in front of her, their faces just inches apart.</p><p>She stroked his face with both hands, smoothing over his jaw and cheekbones, frantic to ease some of the pain and self-condemnation that billowed from his soul.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know what I see when I look at you?\u201d she said around the knot in her throat.</p><p>He tried to look away but she held firm, turning his face, refusing to allow him to escape her gaze.</p> <p>\u201cI see a man who\u2019s honorable. Who gave his everything to a cause he believed in. I see a man who, upon realizing that the path he\u2019d chosen was no longer in keeping with the principles he held close, walked away and re-created himself in a role as protector, savior, leader and, yes, hero. You may not like the label, Rio, but you are a hero. You\u2019re my hero. You\u2019re my savior and protector. Who else would have come for me if not you? Who else would have fought for me, refusing to let me go?</p><p>\u201cWe all make mistakes, Rio. The mark of a man is how he makes up for those mistakes, and you\u2019ve more than paid your penance.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his forehead against hers, and for a moment</p><p>they sat there in silence, their breathing the only sound in the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI won\u2019t think I\u2019m unworthy of you and your love if you never ever question that you\u2019re worthy of mine. Deal?\u201d</p><p>Rio smiled. He kissed her long and sweet, their tongues dueling and teasing. Light touches. Loving touches. His hands were on her face just as hers were on his. Holding. Touching. Caressing.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cNow I want you to sit here while I fix you something to eat. You need to regain your strength for what lies ahead. The others will join us because we have to plan our departure.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to flinch. She knew it had to come to an end, this idyllic escape from reality. But it didn\u2019t stop the regret or the knowledge that her entire world could change and she could lose everything in as little as a day.</p> <p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>GRACE was welcomed by Rio\u2019s team members with great enthusiasm. They all gathered to sit at the bar in the kitchen while Rio fried up hamburgers. They spent several minutes grilling her on her condition, how she was feeling and if she was going to be okay.</p><p>Smiling, she assured them that she would be fine.</p><p>Rio let them fuss over Grace for a period of time and then he effectively put a halt to any lighthearted banter by announcing that they were pulling out.</p><p>The men immediately becamer all business.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Terrence asked.</p><p>Rio stood over the stove eyeing his team with utter seriousness. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re getting close. It\u2019s a gut feeling and I don\u2019t want to take any chances. My main reason for coming here was to give Grace time to heal. This isn\u2019t where I want to engage Titan. There are some advantages. This our home turf. We know the lay of the land. But we don\u2019t have the manpower necessary, and if Sam sends in Steele or we have all of KGI pouring in here, if Titan didn\u2019t already know where we were, they sure as hell would at that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Diego agreed.</p><p>\u201cPlus we\u2019re a man short,\u201d Alton said grimly.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Decker said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d Rio said matter-of-factly. \u201cBut not that good. Against a group like Titan, we\u2019re going to need all the manpower we can get. You can bet your asses they aren\u2019t coming to a fight with only a few good men. They\u2019ll come with the best and they\u2019ll come to win. Which is why we\u2019re going to rendezvous with Sam. He\u2019s calling in all we\u2019ve got on this one.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s brows came together in confusion. She put a hand up to massage her temple because this whole thing was making her crazy. Rio made it sound like they were going to schedule a damn war or something. On the count of three, everyone starts shooting. That sort of thing. It sounded...crazy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou make it sound so organized. How do we know when or where this happens. I mean, are you actually going to pick a place and start shooting each other?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t keep the horror from her voice. The very last thing she wanted was people to die because of her.</p><p>She turned to Rio, her expression pleading, but she used telepathy because she didn\u2019t want the others to hear.</p><p>Let\u2019s go away, Rio. Just you and me. Why couldn\u2019t we go someplace where they\u2019d never find us? Why do we have to involve so many people? I don\u2019t want them to die for me. I don\u2019t want anyone to die.</p><p>Rio used the spatula to remove the last burger from the pan, then put it aside and walked around the bar to where Grace sat. He framed her face and stared down at her, his eyes intense and sincere.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t just involve you, honey. If it did, then what you suggest might be the best option. But it involves Shea and, by proxy, everyone at KGI because now you and your sister both are part of us. We don\u2019t run from a fight. It\u2019s not what KGI is about. KGI is about family. It\u2019s about protecting what matters the most to us. It\u2019s about never letting anyone take what is ours. You and Shea are ours now, and we\u2019ll protect you with our last breaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s straight-up righteous,\u201d Terrence rumbled out.</p><p>Diego, Decker and Alton all nodded their agreement.</p><p>Grace shook off Rio\u2019s hands but kept hold of one, lowering it to her lap. It was comforting. Just being able to touch him calmed her more than she could have imagined.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she admitted. \u201cNot just scared. Terrified. For the last year, I\u2019ve lived my life day to day, never looking ahead, never knowing if I had a tomorrow. But now...I look to the future. It\u2019s a future I want more than I can express in words. And I\u2019m scared to death to trade someone\u2019s life for that bright shiny future I now dream about.\u201d</p><p>\u201dDiego stared at her for a long moment. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t already won my respect and admiration, you would have just now. It\u2019s an unselfish person who can acknowledge that they value someone\u2019s life over their own dreams. But here\u2019s the thing, and maybe you already know this. Nobody made us take this mission. Rio is our leader, yeah, and we follow him. But we do it because we want to. We can walk away anytime. No one owns us. We don\u2019t give our loyalty blindly. It\u2019s earned, and he and KGI have earned ours. And now so have you. So while it\u2019s admirable that you don\u2019t want one of us to sacrifice anything for you, we\u2019d prefer you just shut up and deal with it because we aren\u2019t backing down from this.\u201d</p><p>Decker grinned and Alton slapped Diego on the back. Even Terrence laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Diego doesn\u2019t always have a whole lot to say, but when he does, it\u2019s usually something epic,\u201d Alton said with a laugh.</p><p>Rio was smiling when Grace turned back to him, completely befuddled by their reaction.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re one of us, Grace. We wouldn\u2019t leave any one of us to fight alone and we\u2019re damn sure not going to bail on you. So get used to it. You\u2019re not getting rid of us, and you sure as hell aren\u2019t getting rid of me.\u201d</p><p>Relief, light and bubbly, flooded her heart and soul. She smiled, her smile growing bigger and bigger as she glanced around to all of Rio\u2019s men sitting at the bar.</p><p>\u201cSo when do we leave?\u201d she asked.</p><p>RIO made the call to Sam that afternoon. He wanted to give Grace more time to rest, and he put her to bed to ensure she did just that. But his gut was screaming that they needed to move now. They didn\u2019t have a few days to wait for Grace to rebound totally.</p><p>She\u2019d made it out of the mountains by sheer grit and determination. She\u2019d basically been a walking corpse. If she could do that, then she could handle what was ahead.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the plan,\u201d Sam said. \u201cWe\u2019ll rendezvous at the airstrip in Virginia. We\u2019ll take both jets to Kodiak and then boat over to Afognak Island. If they show, we\u2019ll know. We\u2019ll fight on our terms, our turf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your family?\u201d Rio asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stashing them at Fort Campbell under heavy guard. No one in their right mind would stage an attack at a U.S. military base. It\u2019s the safest place I can think of for them to be. Shea will be staying behind too. You may want to consider sending Grace to her.\u201d</p><p>As much as it went against his every principle to trust Grace\u2019s safety to anyone but himself, he also knew that it was, in fact, the safest, securest place for her to be. She wouldn\u2019t like it, but he wouldn\u2019t give her a choice in the matter. Plus, he\u2019d dangle a reunion with her sister in front of her, and she would have a much harder time arguing with him then.</p><p>\u201cWe have to make this look good then,\u201d Rio said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to lure Titan to Afognak Island, then we have to make damn sure they think Grace is with us. Otherwise this is a pointless endeavor\u2014they\u2019ll sit back and bide their time and strike when we\u2019ve relaxed our guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019ve already thought of that. We\u2019re going to make P.J. be a stand-in for Grace. She has a similar build, similar coloring. It\u2019ll kill her to have to get out of her combat boots and lose her weapons, but she\u2019ll do her job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you plan to get Grace from Virginia to Fort Cnia to Fampbell safely?\u201d Rio asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call in a favor and have a pilot from Fort Campbell accompany us so he can fly Grace back to the base to meet Shea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d Rio said bluntly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a simple escort. One army pilot won\u2019t be enough if they run into Titan.\u201d</p><p>Sam paused for a moment. \u201cWhat do you want then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want at least two other men with her. Not cops either. I\u2019m already down a man, but if Steele\u2019s team and the rest of KGI are going, then I can spare two of my team to go with Grace. They\u2019re the only ones I\u2019ll trust her with apart from myself. Terrence and Diego will go with her. They\u2019d die before allowing anything to happen to her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThen that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. Can you make it to Virginia by sixteen hundred hours tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there,\u201d Rio said grimly.</p><p>ADAM Resnick never knew anyone was in his house until he felt the cold slide of a knife against his neck. His hands froze on the keyboard of his computer and he went utterly still, not wanting to do anything to make the blade sink farther into his flesh.</p><p>Already blood welled and trickled down his skin. He could smell it.</p> <p>He was disciplined enough not to shake, but that didn\u2019t mean his pulse wasn\u2019t about to explode inside his head.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d the man murmured behind his ear. \u201cMost people would panic, then have their throat cut and die as a result of their own stupidity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Resnick demanded, his hands still locked in place.</p><p>\u201cI understand you have quite the association with KGI. I need information. They\u2019ll be making a move soon and I, of course, want to head them off at the pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>The knife bit farther into his neck, and Resnick gritted his teeth against the sting.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not play games. You know who I am. I know who you are. I know you have KGI in your back pocket and I also know you have the information I want.\u201d</p><p>Resnick\u2019s lip curled in disgust, but he held his tongue. Pissing off this faceless man would only get his throat cut.</p><p>And then the knife was gone and the hard point of a pistol dug into the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cGet up. Slowly. No sudden moves. My friend here is somewhat of a whiz when it comes to computers. They like him, you see. They always tell him what he wants to know. I have a feeling yours will have everything we need to know about KGI.\u201d</p><p>Resnick closed his eyes, knowing there was no way out. He could die but they\u2019d still have access to his computer, and Titan would have someone who could hack into the best system. The average computer expert wouldn\u2019t have a prayer of hacking into Resnick\u2019s files, but Titan wouldn\u2019t have anyone average on their payroll.</p> <p>He slowly rose, holding his hands up where they could be seen. A hand curled around his arm and pulled him to the side. He stumbled over the chair leg and then righted himself before he was instructed to stand facing away from the desk.</p><p>\u201cHands behind your head, fingers laced together. I better not even hear you breathe or you\u2019re a dead man.\u201d</p><p>He was a dead man anyway. It was a simple truth, one he accepted with no emotion. He should have already died. He was a marked man, and not by Titan, but by his own government for what he\u2019d done to help Shea and Grace Peterson and, by proxy, KGI.</p><p>He\u2019d blown the top off the secret research that had been resumed after years of dormancy. Even now, in the upper echelons of the military and the U.S. government, an investigation was ongoing about who and what was responsible for the group who\u2019d been behind the creation of the two women with extraordinary powers.</p><p>And Resnick was waiting to die for the simple fact that he now knew too much.</p><p>He closed his eyes and listened to the tapping of fingers on his keyboard. The men di</p><p>dn\u2019t talk, didn\u2019t communicate verbally, not until the end when the newcomer said, \u201cI have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Resnick, for your service,\u201d the one who\u2019d held the knife to his throat said.</p> <p>A single pop followed, the unmistakable sound of a silencer. Pain sliced through Resnick\u2019s back and into his chest. His knees buckled and he pitched forward, agony tearing through his body at supersonic speed.</p><p>Blood was warm, the smell sickening, and it pooled underneath him, soaking into the carpet.</p><p>After a moment the pain faded, replaced by complete numbness. He couldn\u2019t breathe. Every time he tried, a peculiar gurgling sound erupted from his throat and the metallic taste of blood seeped onto his tongue.</p><p>He tried to roll over, tried to move, but even sliding his hand along the carpet took unimaginable strength.</p><p>The phone. He had to get to the phone. He had to warn Sam.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>RIO gently shook Grace awake as the plane touched down on the private airstrip owned and maintained by KGI. He dreaded being separated from Grace, especially when he had no idea if he\u2019d make it back to her. But what mattered was her being safe, and he didn\u2019t want her anywhere near when Titan made their eventual appearance.</p><p>Grace sat up, sleepily rubbing at her eyes, and then she looked at Rio, sorrow tugging at her features as she realized where they were.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look like that,\u201d he said, forcing a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for you before you know it. And you\u2019ll get to see Shea.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cYes, I can\u2019t wait to see her, but I don\u2019t want you to go, Rio. I hate that you\u2019ll be so far away and I won\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>He touched his mouth to hers as the plane came to a stop near the hangar. \u201cYou\u2019ll know. We have a connection that distance can\u2019t break. We\u2019ll still be together.\u201d</p><p>She smiled then and squeezed his hand. \u201cI love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do know. We\u2019re going to do this, Grace. Go see your sister and get better for me, okay? I want you at full strength when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Rio stood and then motioned for Alton and Decker to follow him. Grace also stood, but Rio put his hand on her shoulder and gently pushed her back down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get off,\u201d he said. \u201cTerrence and Diego will stay on with you while the plane is refueled and you\u2019ll be taking off immediately. You have clearance to land at Fort Campbell. Sam brought along an army pilot who\u2019ll fly you to Kentucky.\u201d</p><p>Panic flared in her eyes as the hatch opened and the steps were pushed to the doorway. Rio leaned in one last time, kissed her hard and then pulled away, not looking back as he disembarked the plane. If he looked back, he wouldn\u2019t be able to walk away.</p><p>On the tarmac stood the rest of KGI. It was an impressive sight. Sam and his brothers Garrett, Donovan, Ethan, Nathan and Joe, along with Swanny, their newest recrnuit, stood next to Steele and his team. Dolphin, Renshaw and Baker stood on one side of their team leader, while Cole stood near P.J. Rutherford, the only female member of KGI. P.J. was in civilian clothing, though she didn\u2019t look too happy about it. Her hair hung loose, fashioned like Grace\u2019s. She wore jeans, a T-shirt and simple tennis shoes.</p><p>As soon as she saw him, she walked toward him. When she neared, she bared her teeth in a smile and spoke from behind those teeth.</p><p>\u201cHello, sweetheart. I hear we\u2019re off on a lover\u2019s retreat to bum fuck Alaska.\u201d</p><p>Rio chuckled. \u201cAnd may I say how lovely you look, P.J.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Grace, dumbass. We can\u2019t afford any fuckups, so get it right.\u201d</p><p>Rio looked beyond P.J. to where Sam stood next to Garrett. \u201cWe ready to roll?\u201d The longer they stood around, the uneasier Rio grew. His gut was screaming and the hair prickled and stood up on his nape.</p><p>There was something decidedly wrong with this picture.</p><p>He was about to shout a warning when a gun barrel was shoved against the back of his head. In his periphery, he saw the men who were refueling the jets yank out automatic rifles and train them on the assembled group.</p><p>The reaction was instantaneous. Steele and his team dove behind the pile of bags and supplies. Sam and his brothers scattered, some hitting the ground, others diving for cover behind one of the planes. Guns came up in all directions.</p><p>Hancock grabbed P.J. by the hair and yanked back. Then he glanced sideways at Rio. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m that dumb, Rio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want an answer to that?\u201d Rio snarled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d Hancock called out. \u201cThis can be as bloody or as civil as you choose to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t getting her,\u201d Rio gritted out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never make it out of here alive,\u201d Sam returned from behind a barrel where he\u2019d crouched.</p><p>Dolphin scooted out to the side, rifle up, aiming toward Hancock. A shot rang out, knocking Dolphin back several feet. He hit the ground hard.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Dolphin yelled. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m hit! Goddamn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet him back,\u201d Steele snapped. \u201cGet him out now!\u201d</p><p>Cole grabbed him by the back of his shirt and dragged him to cover.</p><p>\u201cSniper at six o\u2019clock!\u201d Garrett yelled.</p><p>\u201cAnd nine and noon and three,\u201d Hancock calmly called out. \u201cWe have you completely surrounded. Yeah, we can shoot each other all to hell, but in the end, you\u2019ll all be dead and I\u2019ll still get the girl. If I die, she still gets delivered. Mission accomplished. Maybe Rio hasn\u2019t informed you, but Titan never fails to complete their mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBunch of crazy-ass motherfuckers,\u201d Donovan snarled.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you want this to go down?\u201d Hancock yelled. \u201cGrace, I know you can hear me. Is this what you want? Do you want them all to die for nothing? If you come with me, there\u2019ll be no further need for bloodshed. My mission isn\u2019t to kill all these men. My mission is to bring you in however I have to accomplish it. So, it\u2019s all up to you. We can do it the easy way. Or we can do it the hard way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d Rio snarled. \u201cGrace, don\u2019t you goddamn do it, do you hear me? You stay the fuck out of sight.\u201d</p><p>Inside the plane, Grace shook so hard that she managed to shake Terrence, who covered her. The mod her. Tment the gunshot sounded, Terrence and Diego had hauled her over the seat and stuffed her underneath them. They were crouched behind a row of seats, using them for cover, their rifles up and trained on the doorway.</p><p>The door was wide open. She could hear every single thing that had occurred. She knew that a member of KGI had been shot. He may even now be dead.</p><p>She opened her mind, put all her strength and energy to reaching out, casting her net wide to pull in the surroundings. She was instantly bombarded by a myriad of adrenaline, anger, fear, calm assurance. There. She refocused on the calm one. He was the one dictating the action. He was the one who\u2019d issued her the challenge. Come quietly or suffer the consequences.</p><p>She focused intently on him. His mind was a fascinating irregularity. More machine than human. He had an objective and he was single-minded in his determination to achieve that objective. But what she saw, what she knew without doubt, was that he was utterly serious about killing every last person who stood between him and his objective.</p><p>He may die doing it, and he was at peace with that outcome. But he\u2019d turn the airfield into a war zone and take out any threat to his success.</p><p>She pushed at Terrence, panic rising sharp and furious within her. Diego turned, his face a mask of anger and determination.</p><p>\u201cDo you honest to God think Rio would ever let you just walk into the hands of the enemy? Think about what you\u2019re doing, Grace. He\u2019ll go crazy. He\u2019ll get himself killed. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be killed anyway,\u201d she said with forced calm. It was imperative that she convince Terrence and Diego that this was the only choice. This was their only option. \u201cI saw into his head, Diego. You don\u2019t understand. I saw him. I know how he thinks. I saw his resolve. He has a sense of honor, as twisted as it may be. His only objective is to take me. However he has to do it. He is absolutely prepared to give the order for every single person out there to be killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t giving us any credit,\u201d Terrence snarled.</p><p>She shoved at him again, pushing herself up into the seat. \u201cIt has nothing to do with credit. What I\u2019m trying to tell you is that he is perfectly willing to die. It doesn\u2019t matter to him because he has men behind him who\u2019ll complete the mission. He has snipers surrounding us all. They\u2019ve already shot one of your men. How many more are you willing to sacrifice?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not normal. Threats won\u2019t work. He doesn\u2019t care if KGI starts shooting back. He doesn\u2019t care if they take a stand. He\u2019ll mow down anyone who gets in his way. Will we win in the end? Maybe. But at what cost? How many families will lose their husbands, fathers, sons, brothers? Is one person worth that many deaths? No. It\u2019s not. And what you\u2019re not considering, what you don\u2019t realize, is that they have no intention of killing me. They want me for what I can do. And that buys you and Rio and KGI time. This isn\u2019t the time or place to take a stand. They have the advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Diego swore. \u201cGoddamn it, Grace. We can\u2019t just let you walk into that son of a bitch\u2019s clutches. Do you not remember what they did to you before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI survived,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cI survived before. I\u2019ll do it again. Besides, I have a hell of a lot more to live for now. If you think I\u2019m giving up and rolling over, you have another think coming. I\u2019m going, but I damn well expect you guys to get your asses in gear and come save my ass before it gets too bad. All I\u2019m doing is buying us some time.\u201d</p><p>idth=\"1em\"&gt;Terrence stared hard at her, respect and admiration bright in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never known another woman with bigger balls than you, Miss Grace.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She forced a laugh. \u201cThanks. I think.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she pushed upward and this time they let her go. Diego caught her hand, and she turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cThis is a hell of a brave thing you\u2019re doing. I won\u2019t ever forget it and I\u2019ll make damn sure no one else does either. Go with God, Grace, and fight like the devil himself.\u201d</p><p>She smiled faintly and then turned her head toward Terrence. \u201cGive me your handgun.\u201d</p> <p>He looked strangely at her but didn\u2019t hesitate. He pulled a smaller nine millimeter from his ankle holster and extended it to her. She slid her fingers around the stock, jacked a shell into the chamber and thumbed off the safety.</p><p>Then she took a deep breath and stepped onto the platform that had been pushed up to the hatch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said calmly.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Grace, get the fuck back in the plane!\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s furious voice made her flinch. He stood a short distance away, beside another woman who\u2019d been made to resemble her. The woman\u2019s hair was twisted tightly around the fist of the man holding her captive while he held a gun to the back of Rio\u2019s head.</p> <p>She took a step down, her gaze connecting to the man behind Rio. Then she paused, never backing down from his stare.</p><p>\u201cI want your word. I go with you, no one else gets hurt. I know much about you, Hancock. I\u2019ve seen inside your mind. I know how it works. So maybe you\u2019ll appreciate the implications of what I\u2019m about to say.\u201d</p><p>The entire area went quiet, held captive by the strength in her words.</p><p>She raised the gun held loosely by her side, but she didn\u2019t point it at anyone. There was a mad scramble within the ranks of Hancock\u2019s men, and he barked a terse order for them not to shoot her. No, they wouldn\u2019t shoot her. A point that worked hugely in her favor. She could take one of them out right now and they still wouldn\u2019t shoot her. They\u2019d just slaughter everyone else while she watched.</p><p>Instead she continued to raise the gun until she pointed it at her own temple. A series of gasps, curses and what-the-fucks quickly made the rounds from both sides.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Rio croaked. \u201cPut the gun down and get your ass back in that plane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s the deal, Hancock,\u201d she said in just as arrogant a voice as he\u2019d used moments earlier. \u201cYou\u2019re going to let every last person go until it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>There was more curiosity in his voice than any real threat. It was apparent that he\u2019d been caught off guard by her approach. Maybe he\u2019d expected her to be crying or screaming or cowering behind Terrence and Diego.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, then I shoot myself and you have yourself one fucked-up failure of a mission.\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s roar of denial echoed and mixed with all the other shouts and exclamations of surprise.</p><p>Hancock smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re bluffing, and you\u2019re insane. No one here believes you. I hold all the cards, Grace. You hold nothing.\u201d</p><p>Her stare grew colder. She stared until he actually flinched and glanced away for the briefest of moments.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she said coolly. \u201cI saw into your mind, Hancock. I know you\u2019re telling the trutling theh about slaughtering these people to achieve your aim. I also know that your death is meaningless to you. Your sense of honor, however twisted, is that the mission comes first. Above all else. Above life. Even your own. You don\u2019t care if you die because one of the others will deliver me, accomplishing the mission. But guess what? I\u2019m about to let you into my mind so you can see that I\u2019m dead serious too. The very last thing I want to do is go back to the endless torture I was subjected to. But I\u2019ll do it if it saves people I care about. If you kill them, I\u2019ll have nothing left to live for anyway, and it would give me great pleasure to deny you what you most want.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time, a flash of uncertainty crossed his face. She opened herself to him, focusing intensely on the pathway she\u2019d traced to him just moments earlier. She saw his indecision and oddly his admiration for her. There was grudging respect that she\u2019d stand up and bargain for the lives of the others.</p><p>Then she closed her eyes and let him feel her own determination. Let him feel the despair and the helplessness that had long been weighing down on her. She let him see the past and how many times she\u2019d wanted to die. And then she showed him cold resolve. Her decision to die by her own hand before she allowed that evil son of a bitch to win. She felt his shock at the realization that she\u2019d been utterly serious.</p><p>She felt the quick change in him, his sudden urgency to acquiesce to her demands. The very last thing he wanted was for her to kill herself because then it made him a failure, and he saw failure as the ultimate dishonor.</p><p>She also saw the acknowledgment that he would end his own life before ever facing the shame of that dishonor.</p><p>She stared at him, a mocking smile on her lips. \u201cIt would seem we\u2019re both willing to die but for different reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand down,\u201d Hancock shouted. Then he pushed Rio forward, and the rest of the men behind him spread out, training their guns on the members of KGI.</p><p>Don\u2019t be angry, Rio, she said gently in his mind.</p><p>Why? Why did you do it?</p><p>His voice was shaken and broken, despair ripping through him. Feelings of failure, his inability to protect her. That she\u2019d sacrifice herself for the rest. It made him furious and yet he was awed by her courage. And finally, finally she felt worthy of that regard. She\u2019d taken a stand. No longer was she a victim.</p><p>Because it\u2019s the only way. I won\u2019t have you all die for nothing. Either way he\u2019s going to take me. You can\u2019t help me if you\u2019re dead. It\u2019ll be up to you to find me. Don\u2019t keep me waiting, Rio. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll last this time.</p><p>You survive, he demanded harshly. You do whatever the fuck it takes to survive. You stay alive for me. I\u2019ll come for you. There isn\u2019t a force on this goddamn earth that can keep me away from you. You just do whatever it takes. You do what they want. And you goddamn stay alive for me. Live for both of us, baby. Because I\u2019m coming for you and I\u2019ll go to hell and back if that\u2019s what it takes.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>God, Grace, I love you too. So damn much.</p><p>Make sure they leave. All of them. They will kill you. I saw into his mind, Rio. He doesn\u2019t care about you or anyone else. All he cares about is carrying out his orders.</p><p>\u201cStand down,\u201d Rio barked, echoing Hancock\u2019s order. Then he turned to stare hard at the man who now held Grace\u2019s fate in his hands. \u201cHow are we going to play this, Hancock?\u201d</p><p>width=\"\u201cTell your men to get out of the plane. We\u2019ll take that one. It\u2019s been refueled already. As long as Grace is in that plane, you won\u2019t do anything to bring it down.\u201d</p><p>Rio gave a terse nod and then called to Terrence and Diego. A moment later they appeared just above Grace and she moved to the side so they could pass.</p><p>The gun in Grace\u2019s hand never wavered. She kept it firmly to her temple, a sight that would forever be burned into Rio\u2019s memory. It scared him to death because he too had seen Grace\u2019s resolve. He was so damn in awe of her courage and daring he could barely breathe.</p><p>Hancock let go of P.J.\u2019s hair and pushed her forward. She stumbled and went to her knees but then slowly picked herself up and held her hands out from her sides.</p><p>\u201cEveryone over in the hangar,\u201d Hancock directed. \u201cNo surprises or I give the order to start firing. I\u2019ve always thought playing last man standing would be kind of cool.\u201d</p><p>Insane son of a bitch. He\u2019d always been a morbid bastard, but he hadn\u2019t been this fucking crazy. Maybe Rio would\u2019ve been this way if he hadn\u2019t walked away from Titan when he had. Maybe he would be the one throwing Grace to the wolves. The knowledge hurt. This was what he used to be. Mission above all else. No conscience. No sense of right or wrong. Only of what his directive was. Right or wrong hadn\u2019t been for them to decide.</p><p>Sam motioned for his men to fall back. Cole and Steele dragged Dolphin toward the hangar. He was bleeding heavily and Rio\u2019s heart sank. He hadn\u2019t wanted to lose even one man to this. He\u2019d been a fool.</p><p>\u201cDisable the other planes,\u201d Hancock called to his men. \u201cMake damn sure they can\u2019t take off in them.\u201d</p><p>Then Hancock turned to face Grace, and it was all Rio could do not to lunge after him.</p><p>\u201cWell, Grace? Care to give me the gun now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>The corner of Rio\u2019s mouth lifted in a half smile. She was fucking fierce.</p><p>Hancock held up his hands. \u201cOkay, okay, we\u2019ll do it your way. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want and what I can have are two different things,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to know what I want right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what the next move is. Ball is in your court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want every one of your men gone. If they\u2019re getting on the plane, then get them there now. You have five minutes or I decorate the tarmac with my brains.\u201d</p><p>Rio winced and closed his eyes. Calm down, Grace. You\u2019re scaring the shit out of me.</p><p>She ignored his reprimand and continued to stare at Hancock like he was the nastiest sort of bug. \u201cGet them moving. We don\u2019t have all day. They have an injured man who needs medical attention.\u201d</p><p>Hancock directed the men on the tarmac to board. Grace quickly stepped down and away so they couldn\u2019t get close enough to wrest the gun from her grip. Rio had to admit, she\u2019d thought this through with admirable speed and common sense. She was giving them no opening. No opportunity to back out of the agreement.</p><p>When the last of the men was on board, leaving only her and Hancock facing each other, Grace said, \u201cNow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not boarding without you.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she lowered the gun and then extended it toward Hancock. Rio died a thousand deaths. Terrence wrapped beefy arms around him as if knowing he was about to go after Grace.</p><p>\u201cShe knows wC;She knhat she\u2019s doing,\u201d Terrence said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got one hell of a woman, Rio.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t make any moves, Rio. He has snipers out there. At least half a dozen. I have no way of knowing if he called them off but I\u2019m betting not. You\u2019ll have to figure a way out of the hangar without getting shot at.</p><p>You leave that to us. You just do what he says and give them no reason to hurt you.</p><p>I love you, Rio. I don\u2019t regret any of our time together. I wouldn\u2019t change a single thing about what happened to me because it brought us togethe</p><p>r if only for a little while. Thank you.</p><p>It sounded too goddamn much like good-bye and he couldn\u2019t stand it. His mind was filled with so much grief and rage that he couldn\u2019t even communicate back.</p><p>He\u2019ll likely make it impossible for me to communicate with you. He knows I\u2019m telepathic and he won\u2019t want me to be able to relay information. Don\u2019t panic if I go silent. If and when I\u2019m able, I\u2019ll tell you what I can.</p><p>Rio closed his eyes as Hancock slowly took the gun from Grace\u2019s hand and gestured for her to climb the steps leading back into the plane.</p><p>The door closed and for a moment Rio felt a surge of fear through the pathway to Grace. And then, as she\u2019d predicted, he sensed a sudden flash of pain and then darkness settled over his mind.</p><p>The plane began an immediate taxi and soon it was zipping down the runway, lifting off in the distance until the lights from the wings were barely visible in the overcast sky.</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>STEELE tossed P.J.\u2019s rifle toward her. She deftly caught it, checked the chamber and then set it aside to yank a camo shirt over the soft yellow T-shirt she\u2019d worn to pose as Grace.</p><p>\u201cNever could stand yellow on me,\u201d she muttered. \u201cMakes me look washed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cP.J. and Cole, I need you to find those goddamn snipers and take them out,\u201d Steele barked. \u201cRenshaw and Baker and I will try to draw their fire. When they shoot, take them out.\u201d</p><p>Rio dove for the hangar just as a shot cracked in the distance. The bullet ricocheted off the concrete a mere foot from where he landed, kicking up shards of rock.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ethan Kelly yelled in his ear.</p><p>He was surrounded by Kellys, all pulling him farther into the hangar and out of danger. He felt gut-shot. He rolled to his back and stared up at the faces looking down at him.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d he croaked out. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that bastard get far.\u201d</p><p>Nathan Kelly knelt beside Rio while Sam, Garrett and Donovan hurried over to tend to Dolphin, who was steadily swearing a blue streak.</p><p>\u201cShea felt her go out too,\u201d Nathan said quietly. \u201cShea\u2019s going to try to stay with her, but it takes a lot out of Shea. She isn\u2019t like Grace. She doesn\u2019t have Grace\u2019s control or focus. But she\u2019s going to keep trying. She said to tell you to keep trying.\u201d</p><p>Joe and Nathan reached down to pull Rio to his feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGot one,\u201d P.J. called. \u201cMotherfucker is ball-less and singing soprano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, that woman is vicious,\u201d Joe muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our girl,\u201d Renshaw called back smugly.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up and do your job,\u201d Steele barked. \u201cWe have a man down and I\u2019m not losing him. We have to get him to a hospital yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo down,\u201d Cole called from his position in the far corner. He\u2019d settled beside a small hole in the metal building and had the barrel of his rifle inserted through the opening. There was just enough room for his scope without having his vision obscured.</p><p>\u201cLike hell you\u2019re outdoing me,\u201d P.J. muttered. \u201cNumber three down. Ah hell, there\u2019s four. Seven o\u2019clock, Cole, moving out fast. Nail his ass.\u201d</p><p>Cole fired and then held up four fingers to signal his man was down.</p><p>\u201cOn my count,\u201d Steele said. \u201cRenshaw, you take right. Baker, you\u2019re my left. Make a run for the jet and take cover. P.J., Cole, be ready. Make this count. I\u2019m not getting my ass shot off because of you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck it,\u201d P.J. snapped. \u201cI haven\u2019t missed my mark yet.\u201d</p> <p>Steele uttered the count and he and his men ran, ducking and rolling. Gunfire erupted from the surrounding wooded area, and P.J. and Cole were quick to get off their shots.</p><p>\u201cI got two,\u201d P.J. called. \u201cCole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne. I don\u2019t see any more.\u201d</p><p>Swanny edged to the doorway and peered around, quietly surveying the area. In the distance, Steele and his two men had their backs to the side of the jet, guns up as they awaited word.</p><p>Swanny motioned for Ethan and Joe. \u201cLet\u2019s go for round two and see if they take the bait. If there are any more out there, P.J. will get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that, asshole,\u201d Cole snapped.</p> <p>Swanny grinned and P.J. blew him a kiss.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Swanny said.</p><p>Ethan and Joe exchanged amused glances. \u201cSince when does he give the orders around here? He\u2019s the freshman in this operation,\u201d Joe complained.</p><p>Still, he and Ethan ducked out, running balls to the wall toward the plane. Not a single shot was fired from the woods, which meant the snipers had wised up and weren\u2019t giving up their positions, there weren\u2019t any left, or they\u2019d just decided to retreat and make a run for it.</p><p>Rio stood amid all the chaos, his heart numb. Breaths frozen in his chest. Blackness filling his mind. Grace was gone. Hancock had taken her. How the hell had he gotten to them so fast? How could he have anticipated their move before they ever made it? How could he have known where they were going?</p><p>None of it made sense.</p><p>Unless they had a goddamn leak. Before Browning, he would have beat the hell out of anyone who suggested anyone in the KGI organization would be capable of selling out a teammate. But now he wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>Sam rose to his feet, his expression grim. \u201cI\u2019ve got a chopper coming for Dolphin and transport for us to the nearest hospital. Our first priority is getting him help. Then we have to regroup, consider our options and figure out our next move.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur first priority is Grace,\u201d Rio snarled.</p><p>Sam held up his hand. \u201cI get it, man. But I have a man down. They aren\u2019t going to kill Grace. At least not yet. They haven\u2019t had time. Dolphin\u2019s going to die if we don\u2019t get him stabilized. He comes first.\u201d</p><p>Rio closed his eyes because he knew this to be true. Team first. Never leave a man down. It was a motto they clung to as fiercely as they did anything else. But goddamn it, that had all changed for him the minute Grace had entered his life.</p><p>Nothing\u2014no one\u2014mattered as much as she did, and if something happened to her, he was done for.</p><p>\u201cP.J., Cole,C;P.J., I need you guys to spread out. Do a recon of the area. Make sure it\u2019s safe for the incoming chopper. ETA is fifteen minutes, so you have to make this fast. Rio, I need your guys to help,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Terrence, Diego and Decker grabbed their rifles, followed quickly by Alton, and then Garrett left Dolphin\u2019s side and grabbed his gun. The six men followed P.J. and Cole out the back and into the dark.</p><p>Rio hurried over to where Dolphin lay. Blood soaked his entire chest. The bullet had entered at an angle, effectively going under the Kevlar vest. Hell. It was a mess, and he was bleeding like a stuck pig.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d Dolphin snarled.</p><p>Rio couldn\u2019t even believe he was still conscious.</p><p>\u201cAnd tell your damn woman to get the fuck away from me. I can do this on my own. I won\u2019t be responsible for her going down.\u201d</p><p>Rio stared down at Dolphin, sure he hadn\u2019t heard right. \u201cWhat the fuck? What the hell are you talking about, Dolphin? Are you out of your head? Quit talking shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d Dolphin gasped out. \u201cI can feel her. She\u2019s fixing shit. I\u2019m a mess, man. Couldn\u2019t breathe for shit. I tried to fight her and she told me to stop being a goddamn baby and take it like a man.\u201d</p><p>Rio reached out, sharp and probing, like an arrow aimed at the very heart of their connection. Goddamn it, Grace, you stop it! Do you hear me! We\u2019ve got this situation under control. You have to save your strength because you have no idea what they\u2019re going to make you do.</p><p>Her answer was faint, barely discernible, almost as if she wasn\u2019t fully conscious herself.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t let him die because of me.</p><p>Rio swore viciously. He balled his fist, wanting to destroy something.</p><p>\u201cSave it, man. She said to tell you to chill out. She\u2019s only sticking a Band-Aid on me until they can get me to the hospital. She actually apologized for not being able to do more. Son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Dolphin wasn\u2019t any happier about Grace\u2019s help than Rio was. But Rio also knew the moment Grace broke away from the other man. He lost color and slumped weakly back onto the concrete. His strength seemed to leach right out of him, but at least he wasn\u2019t coughing up blood and his breaths were even and strong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a son of a bitch,\u201d Donovan murmured. \u201cDamndest thing I ever saw.\u201d</p><p>Donovan had been working diligently on a pressure bandage, trying to stop the bleeding. He was up to his elbows in bright red blood. It was all over his shirt. All over the ground. And yet now it had slowed to an ooze.</p><p>\u201cI hear the chopper,\u201d Steele bellowed from the runway.</p><p>The others scrambled, forming a tight line all the way to the landing pad so that Dolphin could be carried behind cover. As soon as the helo touched down, Donovan, Garrett and Sam hoisted Dolphin upward and rushed him toward the waiting stretcher.</p><p>Donovan climbed in with the other medic, and the chopper immediately took off, buzzing over the distant trees.</p><p>A few moments later, a line of SUVs roared down the runway.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be the cavalry,\u201d Sam said. \u201cFall in and let\u2019s get the hell out of here!\u201d</p><p>Rio didn\u2019t question who came to get them or how Sam had arranged it so fast, but then Sam had a lot of damn connections, especially with the milita</p><p>ry. He was just grateful to get away so that they could regroup and figure out where to find Grace.</p><p>He reached out to her again, needing rea, needinssurance that she was okay.</p><p>Are you okay, honey? Do you know where they\u2019re taking you?</p><p>There was only a faint whisper back. They drugged me, but I have to pretend it\u2019s stronger than what it is because I don\u2019t want them to know I can still function. I was out for a while because he hit me over the head. I don\u2019t know anything yet. Don\u2019t contact me. I don\u2019t want to betray our link. I\u2019ll reach out to you when it\u2019s time.</p><p>I love you, he said fiercely. I\u2019ll come for you, Grace. I\u2019ll never leave you. Rest now and know that we\u2019re going to get you out of this.</p><p>He felt her answering smile, so full of love and trust. Trust. It hit him like a hammer. She had absolute faith that he would indeed come for her, and like hell he was going to let her down.</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>\u201cRIO, you\u2019re going to want to hear this,\u201d Sam said in a grim voice.</p><p>Rio turned where he\u2019d taken position in the hospital waiting room with the others. Dolphin had been taken to surgery a half hour before and they were likely in for a long wait.</p><p>Garrett stood next to his brother, and Steele was on Sam\u2019s other side.</p><p>\u201cResnick was shot earlier today in his home.\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s brows went up. \u201cDead?\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head. \u201cCritical. He was found by Kyle Phillips. He was the one who notified me. He and his team are on constant guard because they fear Resnick is still a target and someone will want to finish the job while he\u2019s vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s this have to do with what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Rio asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cBecause I was the last person Resnick tried to contact, and when Phillips found Resnick, his computer files were open to everything he had on KGI. Including the airfield we flew into and the locations of the majority of our safe houses. Phillips lifted fingerprints not belonging to Resnick from the keyboard, and when he ran them, they came back to a deceased former member of the Army Special Forces. Pretty coincidental, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Rio swore. \u201cThey got to him. Titan fucking got to him and that\u2019s how they knew where to find us. Son of a bitch, Sam, why the hell does Resnick have that kind of information?\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI know you\u2019re pissed, but you need to back the fuck off, Rio. We do a lot of damn jobs for Resnick. Hell, he\u2019s paid for half of those facilities, from the safe houses to the airstrip we used today. In the past we\u2019ve never had a reason not to trust him. It wasn\u2019t until recently that he gave us a reason to second-guess that decision.\u201d</p><p>Rio shoved the strands of hair that had come loose from his ponytail behind his ears and blew out a breath.</p><p>\u201cI think we should go see Resnick and Phillips,\u201d Garrett said in a low voice. \u201cIf Resnick comes around, he may be able to tell us something that helps us locate Grace.\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cHow far? Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour away. We can get there quicker,\u201d Sam said. \u201cLet me tell the others what\u2019s up. I want protection for Dolphin but I also want them on standby for orders if we get information that helps us from Resnick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Rio said quietly. \u201cI know I\u2019ve made this personal. She\u2019s not just a mission, Sam. She\u2019s my fucking life.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled faintly. \u201cEvery mission is personal, Rio. Some are just more personal than others.\u201d</p><p>Sam slapped him on the shoulder and then walked away to talk to Steele. Nathan came up behind Rio and nudged him over to the side.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Has Shea heard anything from Grace?\u201d Rio asked anxiously.</p><p>Nathan shook his head. \u201cLook, I just wanted to tell you or rather explain something. When Shea was taken, it was hard. A lot harder because she can\u2019t focus her ability like Grace can. Plus they\u2019d drugged her with something that made trying to communicate telepathically unbearable and caused her unimaginable agony. We have an advantage here because Grace is smart. She\u2019s tough as nails. She\u2019s a fighter. And she can talk to you. She can talk to Shea. She can pretty much damn well talk to whomever she needs to talk to, so that gives us more to go on.</p><p>\u201cShe took charge of the situation and in a lot of ways she\u2019s calling the shots because she knows they want her alive. As soon as she has information to pass on to us, I know you\u2019ll hear from her. Shea has a hard time maintaining a link for a long period of time. It makes her weak, and she\u2019s still recovering from what she went through at the hands of these bastards. But she\u2019s ready and willing to do whatever Grace needs even if it means making herself vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>Rio put his hand on Nathan\u2019s arm. \u201cThanks, man. I appreciate that. Tell Shea that I appreciate her. I also want you to tell her that I\u2019m going to get her sister back. I don\u2019t give a fuck what it takes. And if she hears from Grace before I do, I want to know about it. I\u2019m going with Sam and Garrett to run down a lead, but let me know the minute you hear anything and tell Shea I\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p><p>Nathan nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re special, Rio, but then you know that. Shea and Grace are very special and they don\u2019t deserve what\u2019s happened to them. They just want to have a normal life and I\u2019m going to make that happen for Shea if it takes the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like we\u2019re on the same page,\u201d Rio murmured.</p><p>He caught Sam\u2019s eye from across the room and Sam flung his thumb over his shoulder to let Rio know it was time to bug out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch you later, Nathan.\u201d</p><p>Nathan slapped Rio on the back as he walked away. \u201cGood luck, man. You know we have your back.\u201d</p><p>RIO hated hospitals. He hated the cold, sterile smell. He always thought that hospitals reeked of the stench of death. Sam took care of getting them into the ICU wing and whatever he said must have impressed the hell out of someone, because they let all three men pass with no argument. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they got to the end where Resnick\u2019s room was, Kyle Phillips was standing guard outside the door.</p><p>\u201cAny change?\u201d Sam asked the young Marine.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Some. He came around briefly. Kept saying your name. He was extremely agitated. Wanted to warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get in there to see him,\u201d Sam said. \u201cA woman\u2019s life depends on it.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips hesitated only a moment and then opened the door, calling to one of his men who was stationed at Resnick\u2019s bedside.</p><p>Once the other Marine took Phillips\u2019s post, Phillips then motioned Sam, Garrett and Rio inside, following close behind.</p><p>The mechanical sounds of so much hospital equipment were loud in the otherwise silent room. It creeped Rio out. He wanted to get the hell out as soon as possible. He wanted to get to Grace. He wanted this over withhis over.</p><p>Sam stopped at the head of the bed and lowered himself so he could speak close to Resnick\u2019s ear. \u201cAdam, it\u2019s me, Sam. I\u2019m here. I need to talk to you. Grace\u2019s life is on the line.\u201d</p><p>For a moment there was no response from Resnick, and then he stirred lightly. His eyes fluttered open and he gave Sam a groggy look of half recognition.</p> <p>\u201cTitan,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Rio simmered with impatience. \u201cWe know it\u2019s Titan.\u201d</p><p>Sam shot Rio a scowl to silence him and then returned his attention to Resnick.</p><p>Resnick tried to raise his hand to grasp Sam\u2019s shirt. Sam caught Resnick\u2019s hand and held on so he wouldn\u2019t overexert himself.</p><p>\u201cWas looking up a lead I had when I was shot. Take a look at Gordon Farnsworth. He\u2019s dirty but pays a lot of damn money for legitimacy. He\u2019s got his fingers into damn near everything under the sun. Politics. Military. Funds other countries. Drugs. Gun running. There isn\u2019t much he hasn\u2019t done. He\u2019s on everyone\u2019s list but he\u2019s slick as snot and no one\u2019s been able to nail him on shit yet. He\u2019s someone who would have had access to Titan and also the means to purchase their services.\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned. \u201cWhy would he want Grace? Money? Sell her to the highest bidder?\u201d</p> <p>Resnick slowly shook his head then made a choking sound. He went gray, and for a minute, Rio thought they\u2019d lost him. He leaned forward, desperate to know what Res-nick could tell them.</p><p>\u201cHas a daughter,\u201d Resnick rasped out. \u201cRumor is she\u2019s very ill and he\u2019s desperate to save her. All the money in the world can\u2019t buy her a cure. He\u2019s tried. She\u2019s the only thing he loves. The only thing that makes him halfway human. She is his one weakness. The one thing that can be used against him.\u201d</p><p>Rio straightened, his face going tight, his nostrils flaring. The bastard didn\u2019t want Grace for any research program. He didn\u2019t want her for the military and what she would mean for soldiers in battle. He wanted her to save his daughter.</p><p>\u201cFind him,\u201d Resnick whispered. \u201cIf he\u2019s after Grace, I\u2019d bet all I own that he wants her because she\u2019s the only person who can save his daughter.\u201d</p><p>Garrett pushed forward. \u201cDo you know where he is, Adam? Do you have any information at all?\u201d</p><p>Resnick sank into the pillow, and for a long moment was silent, his chest barely moving with air exchange. Phillips shot them a nervous look.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go now. The nurse would have a fit if she knew we were pushing him this far.\u201d</p><p>Rio leaned down, so he was just inches from Resnick\u2019s face. \u201cYou care about her. You care about her and Shea both. You tried to protect them. Shea has Nathan, but now Grace has me. I\u2019m going to get her back, Resnick. If I have to turn the whole goddamn world over, I\u2019m going to get her back. Now help us, damn it. Anything. Give us a starting point. You have to know something. You\u2019re a goddamn library of classified information.\u201d</p> <p>Resnick\u2019s eyes opened to narrow slits, like he didn\u2019t have the strength to open them farther.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rumored he has an island in the Mediterranean, just off the coast of Greece. He\u2019s generous to the local economy, and with Greece in the economic state it\u2019s currently in, his money has bought a lot of loyalty. Even if they do know who and what he is, they\u2019ll never give him up because he provides jobs for the entire island and keeps the economy afloat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s flown in doctors from all over the world, and the word is, they\u2019ve all told him the same thing. That there is no hope and that she doesn\u2019t have long. Such news would have made him desperate enough to</p><p>do whatever it took to save her.\u201d</p><p>Resnick paused and labored to catch his breath. His face was strained and it was evident he was in a great deal of pain. Again, Phillips stepped forward as if to put an end to the inquisition, but Resnick stopped him with a barely raised hand.</p><p>\u201cMost notable is that CIA surveillance tapped into a phone conversation between Farnsworth and the man they believe led Titan when it was still in existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHancock,\u201d Rio muttered. \u201cGoddamn Hancock.\u201d</p><p>Sam put a hand on Resnick\u2019s arm. \u201cThank you, Adam.\u201d</p><p>Resnick stared up at Rio. \u201cYou just get her back. I very much want to meet the woman I consider a sister.\u201d</p><p>Rio swallowed and nodded. \u201cFailure isn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately that is also Titan\u2019s motto,\u201d Resnick said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Rio said calmly. \u201cI\u2019m the one who coined it for them.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>\u201cYOU realize if you try to communicate with your boyfriend, Rio, that you\u2019ll just get him killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Grace said rudely from her perch on the couch in the airplane. They\u2019d flown from the airstrip in the small jet that Hancock had appropriated from Rio\u2019s group, but they\u2019d landed an hour later and boarded a larger jet, taking off immediately. She still had no idea where they were going and she was pissed enough not to feel fear. Yet.</p><p>Hancock laughed. \u201cI can see what he sees in you. You\u2019re well matched, I think. I can\u2019t ever imagine Rio with a dainty little mouse. He\u2019d eat her alive.\u201d</p><p>Grace faked a yawn. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in your analysis of Rio\u2019s love life. I want to know where the hell you\u2019re taking me and why.\u201d</p><p>Hancock ignored her and looked out the window before checking one of his handheld devices. \u201cWe\u2019ll be landing soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon? Soon would have been six hours ago. We\u2019ve been on this plane forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a complainer. Don\u2019t bite the hand that will have to keep you alive once you\u2019ve served your purpose,\u201d he said in a dangerously soft voice.</p><p>The subtle threat sent chills dancing up her spine.</p><p>She glanced toward the window, but Hancock snapped it shut, blocking her view. All she knew was it was daylight and they were over a large body of water.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t panic yet. There was plenty of time to glean information to pass on to Rio. Shea had been a quiet presence in her mind. As was Rio. It was the only reason she hadn\u2019t lost her composure yet.</p><p>Neither had tried to talk to her. She\u2019d been very specific in asking them not to use the pathway until she initiated contact. Knowing Rio, he\u2019d wait only so long before his impatience got the better of him and he would be yelling in her head, asking her if she was okay.</p><p>Strangely, that thought brought her comfort. It was nice to have someone who cared.</p><p>The plane continued its sharp descent and then she heard the sound of the landing gear lowering. She instinctively braced herself, tensing until they touched down.</p><p>Now fear began a steady thrum in her chest. She tried to swallow it back, but it chooked her, cutting off her air.</p><p>This was it. Wherever it was that Hancock was taking her, they were here and hell awaited.</p><p>Grace, goddamn it, I can feel your fear. Tell me what the hell is going on. Where are you? Can you tell me anything about your location?</p><p>Rio\u2019s voice blew into her mind, taking away some of the fear that threatened to overwhelm her.</p><p>We just landed. I don\u2019t know anything more yet.</p><p>She forced calm into her message and made sure to include Shea. Neither of them needed her to be hysterical. They felt helpless enough not knowing her fate, not knowing what lay in store for her or where she was.</p><p>I\u2019ll tell you more when I\u2019m able. Please be patient. He watches me and he knows when I\u2019m communicating with you. I have to remain conscious or I\u2019ll never be able to give you any information.</p><p>I\u2019m going to kill that son of a bitch for hurting you, Rio seethed.</p><p>But Grace shut him out, forcing a bland expression to her face. Emotionless. Untouchable. She wouldn\u2019t show this man her fear. She wouldn\u2019t show anyone how terrified she was. She was finished being a victim, and by God, she was through wishing to die. She wanted to live. She was going to live. She\u2019d promised Rio she\u2019d do whatever it damn well took to survive, and it was one promise she wasn\u2019t going to break.</p><p>To her dismay, Hancock jerked her upward, twisted her arms behind her back and handcuffed her wrists. Then he hastily tied a blindfold around her eyes before the hatch opened so they could disembark.</p><p>She was careful to keep her emotions in check because they would only set Rio off again and Shea would worry more than she already was.</p><p>Hancock\u2019s men filed off the plane and then Hancock took her arm in a surprisingly gentle grip and guided her toward the steps.</p><p>\u201cWatch your step,\u201d he ordered. \u201cFirst one coming up. Stay beside me and take your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do to have the lab rat break her neck before she can perform,\u201d Grace said nastily.</p><p>\u201cIf you break your neck, I don\u2019t get paid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you choke on your damn blood money.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIn another situation, I just might like you, Grace. But quite frankly you\u2019ve been nothing but a pain in my ass since I took this mission and I\u2019ll be happy to see the back of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling is entirely mutual,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>She found herself shoved into the back of a car. It was comfortable. Expensive leather. It even smelled expensive. The ride was smooth too. Unlike the various vehicles she\u2019d been hauled around in when she\u2019d been captured before.</p><p>\u201cWho do you work for?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll meet him soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Him. Not them. One person. She didn\u2019t know what to make of that revelation.</p><p>I don\u2019t think this is the government or some lab like last time, Rio. She tried to keep the worry out of her message. It has a different feel. Not much has been said but I just got off a plane and I\u2019ve been on one since we left you in Virginia. Hancock just said \u201chim\u201d when I asked who he worked for. Not \u201cthem.\u201d Not some faceless group. He said \u201chim.\u201d But I\u2019m blindfolded so I can\u2019t see anything!</p><p>We\u2019re on our way, honey. I don\u2019t want you to worry, okay? I want you to stall for time. Do what you need to do but do not make them angry. If your chy. If yooices are to submit or for them to hurt you, then you damn well do what they want you to do. Do you understand? No matter what happens, baby, you and I will deal with it together. I\u2019ll always be here for you. You\u2019ll never be alone again.</p><p>She closed her eyes, knowing Hancock wouldn\u2019t be able to see through the blindfold. She knew exactly what Rio was telling her. No matter how bad it got. No matter what she was asked to do. No matter what was done to her. He didn\u2019t want her to give up and choose to die. He wanted her to live.</p><p>I\u2019ll be here waiting. I know you\u2019ll come for me, Rio.</p><p>She poured every ounce of her trust, her faith, her absolute belief in this man. He loved her. She had no doubt. He was an honorable man no matter what he thought of himself or his past choices. She knew without doubt that he\u2019d move heaven and earth to bring her home again. Home to him.</p><p>What seemed an eternity later, the car ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was urgency to everyone\u2019s movements. Orders were issued in stilted English, with an accent she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>Hancock yanked her roughly from the car and shoved her forward. Her tennis shoes crunched the gravel beneath them and then she nearly stumbled when it turned to smooth pavement. Hancock righted her and continued forward past the sound of bubbling water. A fountain?</p><p>The air was warm. Hot even. She could feel the sun\u2019s direct rays on her arms. The smell of salt was heavy in the air and a breeze blew over her, bringing with it the feel of the sea. They were close to the water.</p><p>As soon as they stepped inside the building or house or whatever the hell it was, the air was much cooler. She went through a series of hallways before Hancock finally stopped.</p><p>She heard the door in front of her fly open and she took an instinctive step back, bumping into Hancock.</p><p>\u201cIs this her? Is she the one?\u201d a man demanded in a voice that sent fear snaking down her spine once more. There was something about his voice. It reeked of desperation. It was cold, hard and determined. Evil.</p><p>Her pulse sped up and her hands began to shake in the cuffs that still circled her wrists. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is her,\u201d Hancock said in an even tone.</p><p>She found herself yanked forward and then the door slammed behind her. Suddenly the blindfold was torn from her eyes, and she rapidly blinked to adjust to her surroundings.</p><p>She was in a large study or office. It had the look of a library but there was a large executive desk at the back. To the right was a large fireplace, which despite the warmth of the day, was burning.</p><p>She took in as much as she possibly could as quickly as she could. She glanced left, hoping for a window, hoping for some sign of where she was, but was frustrated as she realized there were no windows. It was more like a dark cave where a beast skulked about.</p> <p>Then she focused on the man in front of her who was staring every bit as hard at her as she was at him. For someone who\u2019d frightened her so much with his voice alone, his appearance was deceptiv</p><p>ely mild.</p><p>He was average height. Maybe late forties. He was obviously a bit prideful because there wasn\u2019t a hair on his head that was out of place, thanks largely to the amount of styling products evident.</p><p>He wore expensive clothing. Diamond cufflinks. A gaudy gold chain hung around his neck, and in one ear he wore a diamond stud earring.</p><p>He would probably appear arrogant on most days, but there was so much relief in his expression that it took Grace aback. He looked...happy...to see her.</p> <p>\u201cGet the cuffs off her,\u201d her, the man ordered. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any time to lose. I need her upstairs right now.\u201d</p><p>Hancock quickly unlocked the cuffs and Grace pulled her hands around to her front, rubbing her wrists as she stared warily at the man in front of her.</p><p>\u201cWho are you and why am I here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWho I am isn\u2019t important. What\u2019s important is that my daughter is very ill, and you\u2019re going to heal her.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>GRACE was taken aback by the utter despair that choked his voice. It wasn\u2019t that she hadn\u2019t expected to be used for her abilities. She just hadn\u2019t expected...this. A man on a mission. A single mission.</p> <p>She reached into his mind, wanting confirmation or perhaps to know what else he intended to use her for. Was she some sort of experiment once again? Was his daughter a guinea pig, and if Grace was successful, would she then be turned over to some government agency? Sold to the highest bidder?</p><p>What she found shocked her. Gordon Farnsworth wasn\u2019t a good man. She saw things that made her blood run cold. He\u2019d led a life filled with atrocities, bloodshed, selling out whomever he needed to, to achieve his ends. He was unapologetic and completely unremorseful over his choices.</p><p>But she also saw a grieving father whose only daughter was dying, and he was frustrated by his inability to buy her health and happiness. It was a harsh realization for him, that given his immense wealth, he couldn\u2019t have the one thing he most wanted.</p><p>His daughter\u2019s life.</p><p>Though she knew the answer to her question, she posed it anyway in an effort to buy time, to plan her next move and to somehow maneuver herself out of an impossible situation.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCancer,\u201d he bit out. \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly invasive, aggressive form of cancer. Supposedly rare. The doctors all have names for it. I just know that it\u2019s slowly sucking my daughter\u2019s life from her. It began in an innocuous enough place, but before she could be treated, it had already spread to her liver and then into her bones. She\u2019s riddled with cancer. There isn\u2019t a part of her body that hasn\u2019t been besieged by the disease. It\u2019s in her lungs, and at times she has to be put on a respirator so she can survive. It\u2019s spread to her brain and at times she\u2019ll lie in a coma, unaware of her surroundings.\u201d</p><p>He advanced on Grace, his face ugly, and she got her first look at what this man was to the rest of the world. Cold, evil, the very devil.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll cure her. I know of your abilities. I made damn sure that you were able to do what was said could be done before I had you brought here. I wouldn\u2019t trust my daughter to someone who would cause her harm.\u201d</p><p>Grace swallowed, sent a simple message to Rio.</p><p>Gordon Farnsworth.</p><p>Rio was silent but then he had to know how precarious Grace\u2019s current position was. Shea stirred in her mind but also remained silent, a steady support.</p><p>\u201cIt would seem, Mr. Farnsworth, that I hold all the cards,\u201d Grace said coolly.</p><p>\u201cYou hold nothing!\u201d</p><p>He yanked her toward him, his hands wrapped in her shirt until their faces were inches apart. Spittle hit her cheek from the explosion of his outburst.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll heal my daughter or I\u2019ll make you wish you were never born.\u201d</p><p>She reached for his wrists with renewed strength and yanked them dDownward, separating herself from his touch. It repulsed her. His entire being vibrated with the stench of evil and death. It nearly overwhelmed her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too late for that,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019ve wished for my death many times. Threats have no meaning to me. How much is your daughter\u2019s life worth to you?\u201d</p><p>Clearly he hadn\u2019t expected this. He took a step back, eyes narrowed in rage and surprise. He seemed at a loss for words and then he slammed his gaze back into hers and made a visible effort to collect himself.</p><p>\u201cMoney? Is money what you want? You\u2019d sell your ability to save a child\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>The judgment and condemnation in his words pissed her off. Dangerously so. She had to remain calm. She couldn\u2019t allow her own volcanic rage to erupt.</p><p>\u201cAfter everything you\u2019ve done to ensure that I was brought to you, after the countless days of agony and pain that were brought on me as a result of your experiments to make sure I was qualified to touch your daughter, you dare to come at me with this holier-than-thou put-down because I would bargain with you?\u201d</p><p>She gave a derisive laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou hold none of the cards, Mr. Farnsworth, and if you think you do, you\u2019re as deluded as your ego is. Kill me. Go ahead. I dare you. Then who will save your daughter? Torture me. Spend days trying to make me desperate enough to give in to anything. Your daughter doesn\u2019t have those days. But I don\u2019t care. You can\u2019t do anything to me that hasn\u2019t already been done. It\u2019s not possible to endure more than what I\u2019ve already endured. While your conceit and arrogance tell you that you are all mighty and powerful, just remember that your daughter could be dead in the next hour or the next day. And then you stand there like a pompous jackass and presume to call my ethics into question. Do you think I give a shit what you think of me, you worthless, dirt-eating worm?\u201d</p><p>Hancock chuckled, which only served to enrage Farnsworth further.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, Farnsworth,\u201d Hancock said in amusement. \u201cDid I tell you she threatened to kill herself if I didn\u2019t cooperate with her demands? I saw into her mind. I assure you she isn\u2019t bluffing. She\u2019s just crazy enough to blow her own brains out to spite you.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth looked between Grace and Hancock, sucking in air through extended nostrils. Then he visibly collected himself and turned away, walking toward his desk. He turned back, calmer now, and he stared at Grace with a calculated gleam.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Miss Peterson. What do you want? Money? You can have all that I own in exchange for my daughter\u2019s life. I\u2019ll make you wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I dream about,\u201d she said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth\u2019s brows drew together in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI want a life. I want to be free. I want to be able to have what your kind takes for granted. Freedom from looking over my shoulder every damn minute because some fuckwad wants to use me like a lab rat. I want my freedom, and I want your guarantee that when I heal your daughter, you will cease to pursue me. You\u2019ll call off Titan, and moreover, you\u2019d do well to make damn sure I stay safe, because if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed in fury. \u201cYou dare to threaten me?\u201d</p><p>Grace eyed him calmly. She needed him to believe what she was about to say. And honestly who was to say she couldn\u2019t do it? She\u2019d certainly ;d certanever tried. Given what she could do, it wasn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility that she could do the complete opposite.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll grant me everything I want, or I\u2019ll suck the life right out of your daughter.\u201d</p><p>He whitened. His jaw clenched and he seemed speechless.</p><p>\u201cLet me just explain how my ability works,\u201d Grace said in a quiet tone. \u201cI absorb an illness or an injury from the affected person. I take it from them and make it my own. They leave happy and healed. I\u2019m crippled by their affliction, and then I have to take the time to heal myself. But just as I take the illness or injury, just as I give life, my life, to the person I\u2019m linked with? So too can I take their spirit, their life, their very soul. And I don\u2019t have to be standing next to her, so if you think you can hide from me, if you think you can take her some place I\u2019ll never find her, you\u2019re dead wrong. Once I link to her, I\u2019ll be able to locate her anywhere and I\u2019ll take what it is you treasure so much.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth stared her down, almost like he was trying to see into her mind. Evaluating whether she was telling the truth. She met his gaze unflinching. Then Farnsworth looked to Hancock as if for guidance. Hancock shrugged and the corner of his mouth turned up in a smirk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you have yourself a standoff, Farnsworth. In some circles, this might be called checkmate. I believe she has you by the balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd while you stand here being outraged that I would actually give a damn about my own life and my own future, your daughter is upstairs dying,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019d suggest we come to an agreement pretty damn fast. Or maybe your ego is worth more than your daughter\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth whitened and he leaned over, slapping his hands on the polished surface of his desk. For the first time, she absolutely believed the conviction in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing. Nothing more important to me than Elizabeth. You think me an evil man, Miss Peterson. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m a bastard of the first order. But I love my daughter and I\u2019ll do anything at all to save her. So give me your conditions. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to gain your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want Rio here,\u201d she said calmly. She opened her mind, that pathway to Rio so he would see and hear what it was she was saying. \u201cI am defenseless once I\u2019ve healed. It would be easy for you to go back on your word. I would have no recourse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to just turn myself over to some mercenary? Do you realize how many government and nongovernment agencies are after me? You\u2019re out of your damn mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about you,\u201d she said in an even tone. \u201cWhat I care about is my ability to walk out of here. You\u2019ll excuse my lack of trust in you, but your promise doesn\u2019t mean shit to me. I\u2019ve told you I can kill your daughter at any time, so that gives you more incentive to kill me once you\u2019ve gotten what you want.\u201d</p><p>She felt Rio stir, felt his anger and his fear for her. His anger that she\u2019d provoke him and that she\u2019d bargain so ruthlessly and risk the very thing she\u2019d just accused Farnsworth of being able to do.</p><p>\u201cWe both want the same things, Mr. Farnsworth. I have no desire to ever see you again. Call me self-centered but I\u2019m more interested in having a normal life than I am in seeing you punished for your crimes. I want Rio here. I want his team to be allowed here. They are my protection. My guarantee that you uphold your end of the bargain. And once I\u2019ve co\u2019mpleted the healing, he\u2019ll walk out of here with me because I swear to you by all that\u2019s holy, if you kill me, if you try to kill me, I\u2019ll take your daughter with me.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth went pale. He shoved a hand through his hair, mussing the immaculately styled strands. Then he yanked his hand away. \u201cIt will take too damn long to get them here!\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOh, I think they\u2019re probably closer than you think. Shall I find out for you?\u201d</p><p>Rio, I need you. I\u2019ve been buying time, but I don\u2019t have it to spare. If his daughter dies before you get here, he\u2019ll be out of control. He\u2019ll kill me. He\u2019ll kill you. The one thing keeping him in check right now is his utter terror that his daughter will die. If that happens, nothing will matter to him any longer.</p><p>We\u2019re on our way, Grace. You did good, baby. You scare the shit out of me, but you did good. You\u2019re so damn fierce. You even have me convinced you\u2019ll take his daughter down with you if it comes to that.</p><p>We got a lead even before you told me who he was. We\u2019re in the air now. Tell him we\u2019ll land on the mainland and then take a chopper to the island. The others will boat in, but he doesn\u2019t need to know that. Three hours, Grace. Buy us three more hours and we\u2019ll be there.</p><p>She looked back up at Farnsworth. \u201cThree hours. Rio and his team will land a helicopter here. Until he arrives, I won\u2019t do a thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Farnsworth closed his eyes. \u201cWill you...Will you at least go see her? Will you stay with her? I need her to have a reason to hold on. A reason to hope. I\u2019ll give the order for my men to stand down. Your Rio and his team will have clearance to land and will be escorted to you the moment they arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYou can leave the same way they came. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>She reached into his mind but only found sincerity. No hint of deception. He was too focused on having his daughter well and healthy. He\u2019d gladly let her go if it meant having Elizabeth be a normal little girl again.</p> <p>\u201cThen take me to her,\u201d Grace said quietly.</p><p>Hancock automatically took Grace\u2019s arm and she tried to yank it away, but he held firm.</p><p>She glared pointedly at Farnsworth. \u201cDoes he have to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your conditions. I have mine. He\u2019s there to make sure you uphold your end of the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to touch me in order to do that,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>Farnsworth gestured for Hancock to let her go. Hancock\u2019s gaze was cool and unreadable. Like his mind. He had admirable control over his thoughts. Every time Grace tried to get a read on him again, she saw blankness. Like he was so focused and disciplined that he could shut out everything but what was his primary goal. She\u2019d thought it before and she hadn\u2019t seen anything to the contrary\u2014he was more machine than man and it creeped her the hell out.</p><p>She thought she saw annoyance in his gaze, and irritation, as if he loathed taking orders from Farnsworth. But his thoughts didn\u2019t reflect his expression whatsoever.</p><p>He let go of her arm but not fast enough for her liking. She ached to put her knee right in his balls and see if the bastard was more machine than man then.</p><p>Farnsworth walked ahead of Grace, leaving her sandwiched between him and Hancock. They mounted a winding staircase and then traveled to the end of the hallway once on the second floor.</p><p>When Farnsworth o Farnswopened the door, she could see the immediate fear that leapt into his eyes. His entire body went tense, as if he was afraid to hear the worst.</p><p>From the bedside of the little girl Grace still couldn\u2019t see, a man looked up, a stethoscope in his ears. On the other side was what appeared to be a nurse or at least someone who sat with the girl.</p> <p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Farnsworth said in a low voice that carried for its sheer determination.</p><p>\u201cBut she needs care,\u201d the doctor protested as he took down the stethoscope and let it hang from his neck. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be left alone right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet. Out.\u201d Farnsworth enunciated each word, so much menace in them that the doctor paled and backed away from the bed. \u201cThere is a helicopter waiting to take you back to the mainland. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d He motioned for the woman. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>They hurriedly left the room, the doctor muttering about the \u201cpoor girl\u201d as he passed Grace.</p><p>Farnsworth immediately went to Elizabeth\u2019s bedside and knelt beside it. He cupped his hand over her forehead and gently stroked away her hair.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth, sweetheart, I have someone I\u2019d like you to meet. She\u2019s here to help you.\u201d</p><p>Curious, Grace moved in closer until finally she could see the tiny, fragile girl lying on the bed. She looked as delicate as a porcelain doll. She looked nothing like her father. While he was all dark and sinister\u2014he had that smarmy used car salesman look\u2014Elizabeth was blond and pale.</p><p>Elizabeth struggled to open her eyes and then she dimly focused on her father. \u201cDaddy,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby,\u201d Farnsworth said in a choked voice.</p><p>\u201cYou always say that. That someone will help me. But they never do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time is different. She\u2019s special. Her name is Grace. She\u2019s promised to help you.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth pursed her lips as if she was giving the matter serious consideration. \u201cGrace. I like that name. Maybe God sent her. Everyone needs grace.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s heart clutched. It went against everything she was and who she was to have threatened this child as coldly as she\u2019d done, but she\u2019d known that it was the only way she\u2019d save herself. Even now, she steeled her features, trying to be as impassive as she could because she didn\u2019t want Farnsworth to know she\u2019d already lost her heart to this beautiful, brave little girl.</p><p>She moved forward, not waiting for permission. She pulled the chair from the opposite side of the bed and positioned it right next to Elizabeth\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cHello, Elizabeth,\u201d she said in a low, soothing voice. \u201cMy name is Grace and I fix people.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth turned slowly, her eyes weak and dull as she focused her stare on Grace. \u201cYou mean like God does?\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled. \u201cNo. Not like God. I believe He gave me the ability and I don\u2019t always know what to do with it. Someone wise once told me that perhaps my purpose hadn\u2019t yet been revealed. But I\u2019m learning and I\u2019m going to do my absolute best to take away your sickness.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth nodded solemnly. \u201cI want to make Daddy smile again. He\u2019s been sad. I don\u2019t want to die and leave him alone. He needs me.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth made a choking sound and abruptly rose, turning his back to face the other way.</p><p>Grace slipped her hand into Elizabeth\u2019s and squeezed lightly. \u201cCan you hold on for just a little while longer? I\u2019m waiting for some people to get here. Healing someone takes a lot of energy and I need them to help me afterward.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth frowned. \u201cWill you be all right? Daddy can help you, can\u2019t you, Daddy?\u201d She turned in her father\u2019s direction.</p><p>Farnsworth slowly turned, struggling to smile through his obvious distress. \u201cOf course I will, sweetheart. I\u2019ve given my word to her that all will be taken care of. All I want you to concern yourself with is getting better.\u201d</p><p>Grace slid into Elizabeth\u2019s weakened mind, nearly weeping as she witnessed firsthand all that the child had endured in her very short life. But she was also awed by Elizabeth\u2019s sheer determination. Her strength of will. It was the only reason she was still alive, because her body had long since given up.</p><p>She pushed as much hope and warmth through the pathway, hoping to bolster the child\u2019s spirits.</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s eyes widened as she stared at Grace in wonder. \u201cHow did you do that? I felt you. Inside my head, I mean. It was wonderful. Like magic.\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled. \u201cI suppose it is magic in a way. No one really knows why or how I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should eat,\u201d Farnsworth said gruffly.</p><p>At first Grace thought he was talking to his daughter, but he was staring directly at Grace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need your strength. I don\u2019</p><p>t imagine you\u2019ve eaten for hours.\u201d</p><p>Grace turned to Elizabeth. \u201cWhat do you say? Are you up for something to eat? Maybe we both need to keep our strength up for what is to come.\u201d</p><p>Grace felt a stirring in Elizabeth\u2019s mind. A tiny beacon of hope. The child was afraid to hope. She\u2019d been disappointed so many times so she\u2019d resigned herself to her fate long ago. She kept up the act for her father because she knew how devastated he\u2019d be, but she\u2019d long since stopped believing in miracles.</p><p>Don\u2019t ever give up hope. Sometimes it\u2019s all we have.</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s smile broadened, her eyes widening in wonder as she nodded wordlessly in response to Grace\u2019s silent communication. Then she turned to her dad. \u201cI\u2019d like some soup. Could I have some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d Farnsworth said in a shaken voice. \u201cI\u2019ll have something brought up for the both of you. I need you to hold on, baby. Just a little bit longer, and then I promise everything will be all right.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>HANCOCK put his hand to his ear for a moment and then said, \u201cThe helicopter is landing.\u201d</p><p>Grace looked up, her heart leaping into her throat. She was suddenly grateful she\u2019d merely picked at the food, because her stomach rolled up into a tight ball.</p><p>Elizabeth glanced up, her fingers curling tightly around the spoon she\u2019d used to eat her soup. There was so much hope and fear reflected in her gaze that it made Grace want to wrap her arms around her and hug her.</p><p>Farnsworth leapt to his feet, agitated, pacing toward the door until Hancock put his hand out to halt the other man.</p><p>\u201cMy men will handle the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell your men to get them up here at once,\u201d Farnsworth snarled. \u201cMy daughter has waited long enough.\u201d</p><p>Hancock gave Farnsworth a chilling stare that immediately took some of the belligerence from Farnsworth\u2019s stance.</p><p>Grace rose, her fingers fisted at her sides. She stared expectantly at the doorway, and after whiat seemed an interminable wait, Rio appeared.</p><p>His gaze immediately found Grace and he would have started forward but she reached out to him.</p><p>Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t give him any reason to believe I\u2019m anything more than a mission to you. Just as Hancock\u2019s is to Farnsworth. Don\u2019t give him anything to use against you or me.</p><p>Are you all right?</p><p>Even as he murmured the words in her mind, he relaxed, glancing around the room, his gaze cool as he seemed to take in any potential threat. He finally settled on Hancock and his lip curled in distaste.</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to greet an old friend?\u201d Hancock mocked.</p><p>Farnsworth\u2019s gaze narrowed suspiciously. \u201cYou know each other? What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you need concern yourself with. Merely renewing an old acquaintance,\u201d Hancock said mildly.</p><p>One by one, Rio\u2019s team filed into the room. Elizabeth shrank into her pillow, and Grace reached down to take her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she soothed. \u201cNo one here will hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Soon the room was filled with men. Hard warriors. Armed. Expressions harsh as they seemed to weigh the opposition.</p><p>\u201cThis is how it\u2019s going to play out,\u201d Hancock began.</p><p>But Grace slipped her hand from Elizabeth\u2019s and boldly stepped forward, staring Hancock in the eye.</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t calling the shots here. This is the way it\u2019s going to happen. I want everyone out.\u201d</p><p>She felt Rio\u2019s immediate protest, but she shut him down with a quick mental rebuke.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have this little girl intimidated by a bunch of hulking Neanderthals. You can all wait in the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving my daughter,\u201d Farnsworth said tightly.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Grace murmured.</p><p>Then she looked to Rio. \u201cMake sure he isn\u2019t armed. He only stays if he has nothing on him that threatens me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell could you defend yourself against anything at all?\u201d Rio ground out. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be defenseless. He could kill you with nothing more than his bare hands.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth made a sound of alarm and then stared questioningly at her father.</p><p>\u201cHe and I have an understanding,\u201d Grace said calmly. \u201cHe\u2019s well aware of the consequences of him trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth whitened but he nodded. \u201cAll I want is for my daughter to be well again. What happens after is of little consequence to me. I\u2019ve given her my guarantee that she and whoever accompanies her will leave the island unharmed.\u201d</p><p>Rio looked like he wanted to say more, but instead he looked at Grace.</p><p>I love you. The fierceness in the declaration gave Grace the strength she needed for what was to come. Don\u2019t you dare leave me. You hang on.</p><p>I love you too. Trust me.</p><p>I do, honey. I do. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be tearing this fucking place apart from the top down. I don\u2019t want you to worry. The entire KGI team is here. We\u2019re not going to go down without a fight if that\u2019s what it comes to.</p><p>Grace looked pointedly at Farnsworth. \u201cWe\u2019re wasting valuable time.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth jerked in reaction and then barked the order. \u201cEveryone out.\u201d</p><p>Hancock waited until Rio made the first move, and when Rio and his team retreate\u00c0team retd from the room flanked by Hancock\u2019s men, Hancock left last, turning one last time. But it wasn\u2019t Farnsworth he looked at. It was Grace. His gaze was intense, and she was sure it held some meaning she wasn\u2019t able to pick up on.</p><p>When everyone had left, Farnsworth closed the door and then turned back to Grace, hurrying to the bed. \u201cHurry, please. Whatever it is you need, just tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I need is for you to take a seat over there,\u201d she said, pointing calmly to a chair by the window. \u201cAnd don\u2019t interfere. I don\u2019t care what you see, what you hear, what happens. Do not interfere.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth leaned over the bed, gathered his frail daughter into his arms and pressed a kiss to her forehead. \u201cI love you, little one. Daddy loves you. I want you to always know that.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth smiled faintly. \u201cI love you too. Now go so Grace can help me. She promised she would and I trust her.\u201d</p><p>He looked startled by his daughter\u2019s words, but he backed away, taking position on the very edge of the seat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace took a deep breath and then she settled onto the bed next to Elizabeth, took both hands in hers and tried to infuse as much confidence into her smile as she could. She dreaded what she was about to do. She knew it could well be too much. The child was too far gone. So much cancer. Maybe they\u2019d both die. But at least Grace would try. She had so very much to live for, and she knew if she failed, Rio and all his men\u2019s lives would be forfeit.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d Grace said softly. \u201cAnd I want you to concentrate hard. You\u2019re going to feel me. Don\u2019t fight it. But what I need you to do for me is to focus on being better, on fighting this illness and on getting better. The stronger you are, the stronger I can be.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth nodded and squeezed Grace\u2019s hands. Grace smiled at the child\u2019s obvious effort to give Grace reassurance.</p><p>Grace sucked in another breath, closed her eyes and then focused all her mental energy into the pathway between her and Elizabeth.</p> <p>She nearly recoiled from the sheer magnitude of the cancer eating away at Elizabeth\u2019s body. It was everywhere. There was no medical explanation for why this child had lived as long as she had. She\u2019d hung on by sheer force of will.</p><p>Grace drew it away, absorbing it in her own body, and felt herself weakening with every passing second. But then she was joined by Elizabeth\u2019s own iron will.</p><p>It was a light in the darkest tunnel. Dawn breaking after a stormy night. Strength. Hope. Love. Only the resilience offered by the young. Elizabeth\u2019s spirit was as strong as her will. Her soul hadn\u2019t given up. Nothing about this girl had signaled defeat.</p><p>Fused together, their wills strengthened, the light became stronger. The warmth and power of their combined determination infused Grace with much-needed support.</p><p>Grace sagged, struggled to keep herself upright, to keep her focus and not lose the battle for Elizabeth\u2019s life. And then tiny arms wrapped around her, holding and supporting her.</p> <p>A whisper in her ear. \u201cYou can do it. I know you can. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Grace reached for the last of the darkness, those ugly shadows that hung tenaciously, and with the last of her strength, she yanked them away, taking them into her own body. She fell forward into the pillows, heard Elizabeth\u2019s cry of alarm. Her plea for her father to help.</p><p>Farnsworth\u2019s hands gripped her shoulders, turned her until she was on her side. His face was grim, but full of hope as he looked between her and his daughter.</p><p>Elizabeth scrambled \u00c0th scramup to her knees, looking worriedly down at Grace.</p><p>\u201cHelp her, Daddy. She needs help!\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth\u2019s eyes filled with tears as he stared at his daughter, pink, healthy looking, her eyes full of vibrancy that had been lacking for so long.</p> <p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>For a moment, he left Grace and enfolded his daughter into his arms. Muffled sobs erupted as he crushed her to him.</p><p>\u201cMy baby. My baby.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth pried herself away and again looked down at Grace, who tried to offer her a reassuring smile. She was weak, yes, but she wasn\u2019t incapacitated. She had Elizabeth to thank for that. Elizabeth, who was strong, whose will to live had been so strong that it had aided Grace in the healing process.</p><p>She\u2019d lent her strength to Grace so that Grace hadn\u2019t shouldered it all alone.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, she needs help. Go get them. They can help her. You promised they could go.\u201d</p><p>Farnsworth looked reluctant to leave her even for a moment, but he edged away from the bed and then walked toward the door.</p><p>RIO paced outside the doorway. The hall was filled with soldiers. Mercenaries. It was tense. Titan had their guns on Rio\u2019s team as if daring them to make a move. Any move. They looked way too damned trigger-happy.</p> <p>Rio just hoped to hell that the rest of KGI had made it ashore after the helo drop and were in position. This could all go to hell at a moment\u2019s notice, and he damn sure didn\u2019t want to be without backup.</p><p>The door opened and the tension soared in the hallway. Farnsworth stepped out, his back to Rio as he faced Hancock.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done. She needs help, though. She\u2019s weak. Let them take her and go. I promised them safe passage off the island.\u201d</p><p>Hancock pulled his gun, pointed it at Farnsworth, and shot.</p><p>Rio leapt instinctively to the side, drawing his own weapon. The hallway became instant chaos. Another shot fired and pain screamed through Rio\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cCease fire!\u201d Hancock roared. \u201cGoddamn it! I did not give the order to fire!\u201d He turned in rage and squeezed off another shot, downing the man who\u2019d taken the shot at Rio.</p><p>Then he held his gun up high while every one of his team members covered Rio\u2019s team, effectively preventing them from acting.</p><p>Rio slid to the floor, blood running like a damn river from his chest and onto the floor. \u201cSon of a bitch! Hancock, you stupid fuck! What the hell are you trying to pull here?\u201d</p><p>Hancock nudged Farnsworth\u2019s body as if making sure the man was dead, and then he crouched down beside Rio. His expression was grim.</p><p>\u201cFuck it all, Rio. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. This was a planned maneuver and one of my goddamn men panicked and got trigger-happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><p>The shrill, high-pitched scream echoed through the hallway. Elizabeth ran, trying to get to her father, but Terrence scooped her up, hugging her to his broad chest and shielding her from the gruesome sight.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out,\u201d Hancock bellowed. \u201cClear this goddamn area.\u201d Then to Rio, \u201cI know goddamn well you have the rest of your team here. Unless you want this to become a goddamn bloodbath, you better get a handle on them quick. We have no interest in KGI. You were just collateral damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiego,\u201d Rio called, his voice fading with every breath. Son of a bitch, it hurt. \u201cGet word out. Stand down. Meet with Sam. Tell him what\u2019s happened. For God\u2019s s\u00c0od\u201ake, tell them not to fire unless fired upon.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at Hancock with glassy eyes. \u201cYou better be telling me the goddamn truth about this. If not, I can guarantee not a goddamn one of you will leave this island alive.\u201d</p><p>Hancock nodded.</p><p>\u201cTell Grace...\u201d He gasped, pissed that he couldn\u2019t seem to get air into his lungs. \u201cTell Grace I love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRio!\u201d</p><p>Grace tried to push Hancock aside, but nearly fell over with the effort. Hancock reached up to steady her with a gentle grasp.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Hancock said gruffly.</p><p>Fear and panic slammed into Grace. She collapsed to her knees, wobbling precariously. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>She reached down, putting her hands over the wound just below Rio\u2019s neck. Blood was everywhere. Soaking his clothing, her hands, seeping onto the floor.</p><p>Hancock tried to pull her away and she rounded furiously on him. \u201cYou know what I can do. Damn it, let me go. I have to save him. I won\u2019t leave him like this!\u201d</p><p>Hancock stared hard into her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this, Grace. You\u2019re too weak and this is a mortal wound. There\u2019s no saving him. You need to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou have no idea what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will kill you,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I care? Do you think I could live with myself knowing I did nothing to save him? Do you think I want to live knowing he died for me? Get out of my way. If you won\u2019t help me, then go. Go with the others. But get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>Hancock sighed and then slowly relinquished his grip on Grace\u2019s arm. She fell over Rio\u2019s chest, hugging him tightly to her.</p><p>Don\u2019t leave me, Rio.</p><p>The broken words poured from the very depths of her soul.</p><p>Grace.</p><p>There was a faint stirring as if he was barely hanging on.</p><p>Don\u2019t you dare do this. Get out. Go to Terrence. He\u2019ll get you out safely. You\u2019re too weak, baby. Don\u2019t do this. I\u2019m begging you.</p><p>She ignored his pleading. She slammed into his mind with the last remaining strength she had. She overpowered his objections, held her ground when he would have fought her off. Nothing, no one, would keep her from saving him.</p><p>He was hers, goddamn it, and he\u2019d damn well live even if it killed her.</p><p>She reached deep, found reserves she never knew she had. Desperation and her love for this man gave her power she would have never dreamed she possessed.</p><p>She pulled, absorbed, and the more she did, the more pain cr</p><p>acked through her, splintering, cutting into her like a thousand knives.</p><p>She gasped, flinched. She thought she cried out, but she couldn\u2019t be sure. Her focus was solely on him. On stopping the flow of blood. On healing the terrible wound that would most certainly kill him if she couldn\u2019t save him in time.</p><p>The smell of blood was strong. So strong she gagged. It was then she realized it wasn\u2019t his blood. It was hers. On her tongue. Seeping down her neck.</p><p>As his wound closed beneath her hands, hers opened, tearing a hole in her flesh.</p><p>Her vision went dim. It was hard to breathe. So very hard to breathe.</p><p>Never had she felt this kind of pain.</p><p>Her body, already so weak and embattled by absorbing Elizabeth\u2019s illness, had reached its limit. Not even she could help herself anymore.</p><p>She was dimly aware of f\u00c0ly awareootsteps pounding down the hallway. Distant gunshots. Yells. Barked orders.</p><p>With the last of her waning strength, she sealed the wound in Rio\u2019s chest. And then she gave one last, stuttered breath and slid soundlessly to the floor beside him.</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>RIO took a huge, gulping breath, jerking to awareness as if someone had just defibrillated his heart and he\u2019d come back from the dead. His hand automatically went to his upper chest, to the terrible wound so near his throat. Only he found nothing. No gaping hole.</p><p>His hand came away bloodstained. He hadn\u2019t imagined it. And yet the pain was gone. He could breathe. It was as if it had never happened.</p><p>And then he remembered Grace\u2019s broken pleas. Her desperation to save him. And him begging her not to try to save him.</p><p>He rolled, immediately coming into contact with her limp body lying next to his. The wound\u2014his wound\u2014was there in her chest. The flesh lay open, and blood ran in a seemingly never-ending stream.</p><p>\u201cGrace.\u201d</p><p>It came out as barely a whisper.</p><p>\u201cGrace!\u201d</p><p>He went to his knees, his hands covering the wound, trying desperately to stop the flow of blood. He looked around, panicked. No idea what to do, how to save her.</p><p>Hancock shoved in beside him and Rio went for him, not wanting him to so much as touch Grace. Hancock knocked him back and then pressed a thick towel to Grace\u2019s wound, holding firm pressure.</p><p>\u201cTerrence!\u201d Rio yelled. \u201cDiego! Somebody! Goddamn it, I need help! We have to get her out of here!\u201d</p><p>He returned to Grace, noting the pallor of her face and her complete lack of movement.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Grace,\u201d he said, his voice completely cracking. \u201cNo, no, baby. Why. Oh God, why?\u201d</p><p>The rest came out in a tortured moan. With Hancock still holding firm pressure to Grace\u2019s wound, Rio gathered her in his arms, rocking back and forth as tears ran freely down his cheeks.</p><p>He knew. He knew what this had cost her. He could feel no air exchange. Could feel no breath from her nose or mouth. He buried his face in her hair and wept because he\u2019d lost the one thing in this world that mattered the most to him.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been strong enough to heal him. Not a mortal wound. And so she\u2019d taken it in his stead, knowing the sacrifice she was making.</p><p>He kissed her temple, his tears wetting her hair. He gently pushed the strands back away from her beautiful face. He stroked her cheek, ran his fingers over motionless lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said brokenly. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me, Grace. Please don\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Pounding footsteps in the hall. Diego followed closely behind by Donovan. Donovan pushed Hancock aside and quickly worked to seal the wound.</p><p>He spared Rio a quick glance, full of regret and resignation. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, man. We have to move now. Chopper\u2019s waiting. Our only hope is to get her to a hospital so she can be stabilized long enough for her natural healing ability to kick in.\u201d</p><p>While Donovan spoke, he felt for a pulse. For a moment his fingers remained at her neck and then he cursed.</p><p>\u201cPut her down, Rio,\u201d he barked.</p><p>Rio complied, easing her to the floor. His heart dropped when Donovan rose over her, his hands overlaid as he began to compress her chest.</p><p>\u201cHold pressure to that wound,\u201d Donovan ordered. \u201cMake sure that airway is sealed.\u201d Then to Diego.\u0180 \u201cGive her mouth to mouth. We have to get her back.\u201d</p><p>Donovan pumped her chest and then lifted his gaze down the hall. \u201cWhere\u2019s the goddamn med pack? I need an IV yesterday!\u201d</p><p>More footsteps in the hall, but all Rio saw, all he could focus on, was Grace and her fight to live.</p><p>He slipped into her mind just as she\u2019d done to him.</p><p>Goddamn it, Grace. Don\u2019t you go out like this. You hang on. You can beat this.</p><p>No regrets.</p><p>The whisper was faint in his mind just as Donovan shouted for Diego to stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have a pulse. It\u2019s weak, barely there, but goddamn it, I have one. Get me that goddamn IV and let\u2019s move!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d do it again. Never regret.</p><p>Rio wiped at the tears running down his cheeks.</p><p>Just hold on, honey. Please. For me. Don\u2019t give up.</p> <p>Hurts.</p><p>The simple word tore his heart to shreds. Tears burned his eyes and scoured trails of acid down his cheeks.</p><p>Garrett and Nathan dumped the bag next to Donovan, and Nathan scrambled to get the IV set up. Donovan wasted no time. He inserted the needle directly into the jugular vein, taped it and instructed Garrett to hold the bag up.</p><p>He took another setup from Nathan and found a vein in her arm and plunged the needle in. He withdrew the needle, held the catheter in place, quickly taped it and tossed the other bag up to Nathan.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hell of a fight going on, so we have to be quick about this,\u201d Donovan said in terse tones.</p> <p>Hancock rose, picked up his rifle and leveled a stare at Donovan. \u201cMy men and I have this. Farnsworth\u2019s security is a joke. We\u2019ll cover your exit.\u201d</p><p>Donovan lifted Grace while Nathan and Garrett held the IV bags high over her. Rio slammed into Hancock, driving him into the wall. \u201cYou have a hell of a lot of explaining to do, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Hancock smiled faintly. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing each other again, Rio. Count on it.\u201d</p><p>Rio shoved him away and then strode down the hallway, rifle up as he ducked around Garrett to take the lead. Nothing and no one would touch Grace without going through him first.</p><p>Once to the doorway leading to the helipad, they ducked and ran, sliding Grace onto the floor of the chopper before climbing in with her.</p><p>\u201cSam said he and the others will cover our exit and take care of things here. He said to take care of Grace and they\u2019ll catch up with us,\u201d Garrett shouted.</p> <p>Nathan climbed into the cockpit and in moments the helicopter rose and flew low and fast over the water toward the mainland.</p><p>Donovan hovered over Grace, but it was Rio who held her in his firm grasp.</p><p>You\u2019re going to make it, baby. Don\u2019t let go. Just don\u2019t let go. Do it for me. I need you, Grace. I need you.</p><p>\u201cI hope to fuck someone speaks Greek,\u201d Garrett muttered. \u201cThis could get hard to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get by,\u201d Diego said. \u201cLanguages are my thing. Besides, a gun is kind of a universal language all by itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 A,\u201d Garrett agreed. Then he turned to glare at his brother. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you say a goddamn thing to my wife about my language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan, give me an ETA,\u201d Donovan yelled. \u201cShe\u2019s barely hanging on with my patchwork job. We need to be there five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pushing the bitch as hard as she\u02c0s hard a\u2019ll fly,\u201d Nathan hollered.</p> <p>Twenty long minutes later, Nathan landed the helicopter right in the middle of the hospital parking lot. This time Rio gathered Grace in his arms while Donovan held pressure on the wound and Garrett and Diego held the bags as they ran for the entrance.</p><p>With the combination of what was obviously a seriously injured woman, the fact that every man was packing, and Diego\u2019s fractured Greek, they were quickly shown into a small area Rio assumed was their version of an emergency room. He just hoped to fuck he wasn\u2019t trusting Grace\u2019s life to a bunch of incompetent quacks.</p><p>The medical team worked fast, taking over, but Rio was reluctant to step back. At one point one of the nurses shoved him away with a stern glare that could only be interpreted as \u201cget out of my way.\u201d</p><p>One of the doctors let out a stream of Greek aimed at Rio, who turned to Diego. \u201cWhat the fuck is he saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says they need to take her to surgery right away. He doubts she\u2019ll survive. He wants you to know the chances are little but that he\u2019ll do what he can to save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d Rio snarled. \u201cYou tell him his best</p><p>isn\u2019t good enough. He\u2019ll goddamn save her or it\u2019ll be his ass.\u201d</p><p>Diego gave Rio a wry look and then turned to speak to the doctor. The message must have been adequately conveyed because the doctor paled and then began barking orders to his staff.</p><p>Moments later, Grace was wheeled past Rio and Donovan and the others. Rio stood there, feeling like the life had gone right out of him. He was heartsick over the thought that that might be his last glimpse of her. Broken, bloody, pale as death.</p><p>Donovan clapped a hand on his shoulder. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go commandeer the waiting room and scare the shit out of anyone there so we\u2019ll have some privacy. We need to check in with Sam so he knows where to find us and make sure we don\u2019t have any casualties.\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded numbly and allowed himself to be pulled away. Nathan fell into step beside him and said in a low voice, \u201cShea is fighting for her too, man. I know you are as well. Grace is a survivor. She\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to,\u201d Rio said, darkness seeping into his soul. \u201cI\u2019m lost without her.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>RIO stood broodingly in the corner of the waiting room, staring out the window that overlooked the sea in the distance. It should be dark and raining, the sky filled with thunderclouds, but it was an absolutely beautiful Mediterranean day. Flawless, bright blue sky, the water dazzling like diamonds and winking in the sun.</p><p>Around him, the room had filled up with a steady stream of KGI members. Most left him alone to do his brooding. Terrence sat across the room next to Elizabeth, talking in soothing tones to the sobbing girl.</p><p>Rio should say something to her. Offer comfort. He wasn\u2019t a complete bastard. But what could he say to her? He was raw and hurting, knowing that this child lived because of Grace, and that at any moment Grace could be taken from him.</p><p>The hum of conversation that echoed through the room came to an abrupt halt. The hairs on Rio\u2019s nape prickled and he turned to see Hancock standing in the doorway, still in fatigues, blood\u2014Grace\u2019s blood\u2014still smeared on his shirt and his hands.</p><p>Hancock started forward, stopping a safe distance from Rio. He regarded Rio warily, without the innate cockiness that always accompanied Hancock\u2019s demeanor.</p><p>\u0201\u0380 C;Grace?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn surgery,\u201d Rio said shortly. \u201cNo word. They didn\u2019t give us much hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a walk with me. There\u2019s a lot I want to explain.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t said \u201cneed,\u201d because Hancock was the sort who never felt the need to do anything. If he wanted you to know something, he\u2019d tell you. But he never felt compelled to offer anything.</p><p>Rio\u2019s gaze drifted downward and Hancock emitted a soft laugh. \u201cIf I had any intention of killing you, you\u2019d long be dead, my friend. I\u2019m unarmed, which is saying a lot, since I walked in here with over a dozen men all ready to slit me from asshole to appetite.\u201d</p><p>Rio glanced toward Nathan, who was the closest to him and Hancock. \u201cWe\u2019ll be just down the hall. Come get me immediately if there\u2019s word on Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do, man,\u201d Nathan returned.</p><p>Rio followed Hancock into the hall and down the long corridor, ironically into a small chapel at the end. Hancock stopped a moment in the doorway, made the sign of the cross and then passed through.</p><p>Rio also paused, reached into his pocket for the rosary his mother had once given him. He made the sign and then kissed the beads and whispered a prayer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a good man. I\u2019m not worthy in so many ways. But Grace is all that\u2019s good. She\u2019s one of yours. A gift to so many. She\u2019s my light and my hope. Please don\u2019t take her. I\u2019ll do my best to prove worthy of her and of the gift of her. Just please bring her back to me.\u201d</p><p>He walked farther into the chapel and settled on the front pew next to Hancock. For a moment, no words were exchanged. Then Hancock turned to Rio.</p><p>\u201cGrace was never the target. She was just a means to an end.\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t the target and yet you damn near got her killed. Hell, you might have killed her.\u201d</p><p>Hancock continued on in an emotionless tone. \u201cFarnsworth was and always has been the primary objective. He was a slippery, cagey bastard who always had an eerie sixth sense when someone was closing in on him and he\u2019d pull a disappearing act. It helped that he was one of the most paranoid bastards to ever live. He trusted no one. But he had a weakness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis daughter,\u201d Rio muttered.</p><p>Hancock nodded. \u201cWhen she grew so ill, Farnsworth got sloppy. He would have done anything in the world to save her, and yet no one could give him what he most wanted. His contact in the government made sure he leaked information about Grace Peterson, whom the government also had a keen interest in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you dangled Grace in front of him like a fucking carrot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically, yeah. The problem was that Farnsworth wouldn\u2019t do face-to-face meetings. If he did, it would have been a simple matter when he hired Titan. I could have gotten to him then and Grace would never have been involved. But the only way we were going to get close to him was if we handed Grace over to him. And in order to do that, we had to have her.\u201d</p><p>Rio shook his head. \u201cThen why the fuck did you let us go that first time?\u201d</p><p>Hancock looked away, toward the crucifix centered behind the small pulpit. \u201cBecause I owed you. You saved my life. I\u2019m not completely without honor. I knew that Grace had been through hell. I knew she wouldn\u2019t be worth a damn if I took her to Farnsworth in her present condition. I wanted to buy her time because I knew it would damn well kill her to heal his daughter, and if she failed, she\u04c0e failed\u2019d be dead anyway because he\u2019d kill her in his rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wanted Farnsworth?\u201d Rio asked bluntly. \u201cWho are you working for these days? Last I heard, Titan had ceased to exist even unofficially.\u201d</p><p>A crooked grin lifted Hancock\u2019s lips. \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you\u2019re told. I haven\u2019t completely lost all my belief in my country or the principles that made it great. Farnsworth was an evil son of a bitch who deserved to die. He was responsible for a lot of American lives lost. Military lives. Men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. He had no honor. He had no principles. Some would say the same for you and me, and yet we know that to be an untruth. What we did and do isn\u2019t always on the straight and narrow, but they are necessary things and they are for the greater good. The day I stop believing that is the day I die because I don\u2019t want to live in a world where I believe that good has no place in it any longer.\u201d</p><p>The quiet impassioned words cut straight to Rio\u2019s soul. It was as if he\u2019d been taken back in time, so many years before when he and Hancock had fought so hard. For a cause. Because they believed in what they were doing.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Rio asked softly. \u201cDoes Titan exist? Are you your own entity now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re there. We\u2019re always there. Rarely seen. But always there. We\u2019re a lot alike, you know. Titan. KGI. We see the world with different eyes. We fight for what we believe in. We do the jobs that no one else wants to do or has the means to. Some call us evil. Others call us heroes. But it\u2019s what we call ourselves that matters, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>In a completely twisted, ridiculous way, Hancock made perfect sense.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry. I never meant for you or Grace to get hurt. I didn\u2019t fire the shot, but it came from one of my men. A man I trained. So it\u2019s my responsibility. He reacted without thinking, a mistake that will get you killed every damn time. I made an example of him, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the woman you love is fighting for her life because of a mistake made by one of my men.\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded. There wasn\u2019t much to say to that. The man had paid with his life. What else was there for Rio to do? Rage and hatred had no place in his heart right now. His focus had to be on Grace. His love for Grace. And his absolute faith that she would win the fight for her life.</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d Rio asked. \u201cWhat happens now? Farnsworth is dead. Grace and Shea will both still be hunted. We can sit here and talk civilly all day long, but if I ever see you coming for what is mine, I\u2019ll kill you without any regret.\u201d</p><p>Hancock smiled. \u201cI\u2019d think less of you if you didn\u2019t.\u201d Then he sobered. \u201cMy report will contain the following information. That Farnsworth was eliminated. His assets will be seized by the government. Many will celebrate. Included in the report will be that, regrettably, Grace Peterson died as a result of her attempt to heal Elizabeth Farnsworth.\u201d</p><p>Rio sucked in his breath and stared back at Hancock as he processed what it would mean for Grace to have \u201cdied\u201d while trying to save Farnsworth\u2019s daughter. Freedom.</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019d have to make her someone else entirely and that you\u2019d have to stay off the government\u2019s radar. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have no problem keeping her hidden in that damn jungle lair of yours. And I\u2019m sure with the connections that KGI has, getting a new identity should be a simple matter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hope started a vicio\u04c0arted a us beat in Rio\u2019s chest. A life. A normal life. All that Grace had dreamed of. Free of fear. Of always looking over her shoulder. She\u2019d be dead to the rest of the world. Loved and forever cherished by him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her sister, Shea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout Grace, her value decreases. I\u2019ll do my best to dim any enthusiasm for Shea, but I can\u2019t guarantee anything. I have no doubt that KGI will keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Rio said in a low voice.</p> <p>It was hard to say to this man. But Hancock was trying to make amends. He\u2019d tried to save Grace. He\u2019d done what was necessary to accomplish the mission, and a lifetime ago, Rio would have applauded that drive and single-minded determination. He would have admired it. Would have aspired to have been like that. Machine, not man. The greater good above all else.</p><p>Hancock stood and started to walk away, and Rio knew, without a doubt, he wouldn\u2019t see Hancock again. Not unless Hancock wanted it. He\u2019d fade back into the shadows. Back into a life steeped in gray. A gray world Rio himself had existed in before Grace had barged in with a burst of color, love and understanding.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Elizabeth?\u201d Rio called after him. \u201cWhat will your report say about her?\u201d</p><p>Hancock paused and turned around. \u201cWhat would you like it to say?\u201d</p><p>Rio hesitated and thought back to that innocent little girl who\u2019d been so close to death before Grace had given her back her life. He lifted his gaze back to Hancock. \u201cTell them...Tell them that she died as well. That Grace was unable to save her.\u201d</p> <p>Hancock nodded. \u201cTell Grace...Tell her that she\u2019s one hell of a woman. She had Farnsworth by the balls. Never quite seen anything like it. She\u2019s pretty damn fierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her,\u201d Rio said, feeling the first surge of hope creep over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSafe journey,\u201d Hancock said before disappearing from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cSafe journey,\u201d Rio murmured in the empty air.</p><p>Rio hurried back to the waiting room, anxious to know if there was any word on Grace. She\u2019d been in surgery for three hours already and he had no idea how long to expect it to last.</p><p>As soon as he hit the doorway, he knew there was no word. Nathan looked up and silently shook his head. Rio bit back his frustration and blew out his breath, his shoulders sagging with fatigue and worry.</p> <p>Elizabeth was sitting next to Terrence. The picture of the tiny little girl next to the mountain that was Terrence would be amusing in other circumstances. But then Elizabeth looked up and caught Rio\u2019s gaze. Sorrow swamped her expressive brown eyes.</p><p>Then to Rio\u2019s surprise, she pushed away the blanket Terrence had wrapped her in and got up. She walked to Rio, her face solemn, eyes sad. She stopped in front of him and looked up to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI know my father wasn\u2019t a good man. I\u2019m sorry for what he did to Grace. She\u2019s such a good person. She\u2019s like sunshine and love all wrapped up in one.\u201d</p><p>Damn if tears didn\u2019t burn Rio\u2019s eyes all over again.</p><p>Gently he reached down and tucked her hand into his. \u201cCome sit down and talk to me, Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>She followed him to the far corner, away from the others. He sat and she stood awkwardly as if she had no idea what to do or what she should do. His heart broke when he looked at her, because she was trying so hard to be brave when her entire world had shattered around her.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he sai\u04c0x201D; hd softly.</p><p>He held out his arms and she went willingly into his embrace. He hugged her to him and then lifted her onto his knee.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Your father wasn\u2019t a very good man.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t lie to her. Elizabeth wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew what her father was. \u201cBut he loved you very much. Love will make you do all manner of things. He would have done anything to save you because he loved you that much.\u201d</p><p>She nodded solemnly. \u201cI wished to be better so many times. I kept praying for a miracle because I wanted him to be good. I used to pray that God would make me well and that my father and I could go somewhere and start over. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, but Rio could still see her entire mouth trembling.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d he gently prompted.</p><p>\u201cI used to think that me being sick was his punishment for all the bad things he\u2019d done,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Rio hugged her tightly, his heart breaking for the burden this child had carried for so long. She was just a baby. Old beyond her years.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, no. That\u2019s not how it works. Your father made choices. God doesn\u2019t punish you for the choices he made. You were a gift to your father. He loved you so very much. Bad things happen to good people all the time. It sucks. It doesn\u2019t always make sense. But look at Grace. She\u2019s been treated horrifically by people who want her for what she can do. She\u2019s good through and through. But she\u2019s suffered so much. It\u2019s not fair bu</p><p>t then much of life isn\u2019t fair. It\u2019s how you live that matters. It\u2019s how you deal with the bumps in the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anyone now,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI never knew who my mother was. I think my father took me from her when I was a baby. What will happen to me, Rio?\u201d</p><p>He smiled tenderly and wiped the hair from her forehead. \u201cI have an idea that I\u2019d very much like to get your input on.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled and she stared questioningly up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say, you and I go down and see if we can find something to eat and we\u2019ll talk over the proposition I have for you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up for a moment but then they dimmed, and she glanced toward the door as if expecting someone to walk through at any moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Grace? I don\u2019t want to leave her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrence will call us the minute the doctor comes in if we\u2019re not here. Then we\u2019ll race back up as fast as we can so we can be there when she wakes up. Deal?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth smiled and bobbed her head up and down. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 40</p><p>GRACE struggled through an endless sea of murkiness, shadows that seemed to reach out and wrap around her like vines. She warded off the encroaching darkness, wanting instead to savor the warmth of the distant light that seemed to grow dimmer all the time.</p><p>She knew she wasn\u2019t dead, but she also knew that she was dying. This was it. The epic battle between life and death. It all sounded so poetic but quite frankly it sucked and there was nothing particularly poetic about dying.</p><p>Rio?</p><p>It was a small whisper in her mind. She wasn\u2019t sure she had the strength to push it out, but she desperately needed confirmation that he was alive and okay, that she hadn\u2019t failed. And she needed the comfort of his presence because her mind was frighteningly blank. So dark and barren and cold.</p><p>I\u0580019;m here, baby. Right here. With you always. Just open your eyes, Grace. I\u2019m right here. Open your eyes and look at me.</p><p>Her brow furrowed and her nose scrunched up. He made it sound so easy. She had no idea where she was. Somewhere between life and death, and yet he made it seem like all she had to do was open her eyes.</p><p>Her entire body was heavy. Understanding was slow to come, but with each passing moment, she became aware of more. She was cold because it was like a freaking icebox wherever she was. It was dark because she couldn\u2019t seem to pry her eyes open.</p><p>There were lots of sounds, harsh in her silent, dark world. Strange beeps. A whooshing sound. Distant buzzing, like conversation but not close.</p><p>Grace, I\u2019m right here. Come back to us. Just open your eyes. You\u2019ve been sleeping too long. You\u2019re safe now. You\u2019re with people who love you.</p><p>Shea.</p><p>Warmth spread, replacing some of the bone-deep chill. Rio and Shea both held her lovingly in their grasp. She was cradled in their arms, supported. Loved.</p><p>She tried. She truly tried to open her eyes, but it was as if someone had cemented them shut. She allowed some of the frustration to spill down the pathway to Rio and Shea.</p><p>It\u2019s okay, honey, Rio soothed. You\u2019ll get there. Don\u2019t overexert yourself. Relax. Think of the happiest thought you can imagine. Then open your eyes so you can see it.</p><p>That was easy. What she wanted most in the world was to see him. Know that he was alive. That he was here beside her.</p><p>She pushed everything away except the unerring desire to open her eyes. It was like rolling back a stone from a tomb. Heavy. Cumbersome. She\u2019d never felt so weak in her life.</p><p>Her eyelashes fluttered.</p><p>Excitement coursed through her body, and she realized it was Rio\u2019s excitement.</p><p>That\u2019s it, Grace. You can do it. You are doing it. Just a little more.</p><p>It took every ounce of willpower she had to force her eyelids open the rest of the way. For a moment all she could see was one huge blur.</p><p>But then her vision cleared and the first thing she saw was Rio leaning over her, his eyes filled with such joy. He was smiling so big that his cheeks dimpled. She\u2019d never known he had dimples.</p><p>His hair hung limply over his shoulders, some of it falling forward into his face. Moisture welled in those deep brown eyes, and his hand shook as he lifted it to touch her forehead.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She tried to smile and it was then she realized that something was terribly wrong. She couldn\u2019t move her mouth. There was a tube down her throat. She panicked, reaching, trying to yank it out. Then she gagged.</p><p>Rio grabbed both her hands and held them tightly, all the while yelling over his shoulder for help.</p><p>She was only dimly aware of what they were saying. She caught a few words from Rio. She\u2019d woken up. She\u2019d realized there was a breathing tube. She\u2019d been more aware than maybe they\u2019d thought she\u2019d be. Or maybe it was that she\u2019d come around before they expected.</p><p>Then from the nurse, talking to Rio about sedating her so they could remove the tube, but they had to wait for the doctor\u2019s orders. Had to be certain she could breathe adequately on her own.</p><p>She tried to protest, but she couldn\u2019t talk around that damn tube. All that came out was a muffled choking sound.</p><p>Rio turned back to her, still gripping her hands tightly. He put his lips to her forehead.</p><p>I need you to calm yourself, Grace. It\u06c0, Grace.x2019;s just a breathing tube. You\u2019ve been in a coma and you weren\u2019t able to breathe on your own at first. They\u2019ll take it out. All will be well.</p><p>And suddenly her world went fuzzier. That panicked her too.</p><p>Rio!</p><p>Shhh, it\u2019s okay. They\u2019re just sedating you so the tube can be removed. They don\u2019t want you pulling it out and doing more damage. I\u2019ll be here when you wake up again. I swear it.</p><p>WHEN she woke again, her eyes came open immediately. There was no fight just to crack her eyelids. She felt stronger. Relief coursed through her veins until she was heady with it. She wanted to crawl out of the stupid hospital bed and do a double fist pump.</p><p>She was here. She was alive. She was going to make it.</p><p>She lifted her head, immediately searching for Rio. She frowned when she didn\u2019t see him anywhere. Figures. She was finally something other than a panicked, freaking-out nitwit and he wasn\u2019t even here.</p><p>Shea?</p><p>The response was immediate. She could feel her sister\u2019s relief.</p><p>Grace, you\u2019re awake. You\u2019re stronger. I can feel it. You\u2019re already so much better.</p><p>Thanks for being there. For all of it. I couldn\u2019t have done it without you.</p><p>It\u2019s over now, Grace. I can\u2019t wait to see you. You have to come for my wedding.</p><p>Wedding?</p><p>Grace felt Shea\u2019s beautiful smile, her absolute joy, and it warmed Grace to her very soul.</p><p>Nathan and I are going to marry at the same time that his older brother and his fianc\u00e9e get married. We were the reason they waited as long as they did, so it\u2019s kind of fitting that we do it all together.</p><p>That\u2019s wonderful, Shea. I\u2019m so happy for you. And of course I\u2019ll be there. Nothing could keep me away. Now go. I know you can\u2019t keep up a link for long. We\u2019ll talk later. Right now I have a man to track down.</p><p>Shea\u2019s laughter lingered in Grace\u2019s mind long after her sister left the conversation.</p><p>She was about to send out a demand to Rio to ask where the hell he was when her door opened and she saw him stick his head in.</p><p>His eyes brightened with joy and relief when he saw that she was awake and looking in his direction.</p><p>\u201cHey you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHey yourself. Where you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought someone to see you. I wanted to make sure you were up for it. She just wanted to peek in on you while you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s brow furrowed and then Rio walked farther in. Elizabeth came in behind him, holding his hand, a shy smile on her face. As soon as she saw that Grace was awake, her face lit up. She dropped Rio\u2019s hand and ran for the bed.</p><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d Rio warned, not a second too late.</p><p>Elizabeth pulled up when she would have leapt onto the bed and instead stood beside it, jittering with excitement.</p><p>Then her smile turned down into a frown. \u201cI was so worried for you. They told us you would die.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace smiled and then held up an arm to hug her. Elizabeth needed no urging and snuggled immediately into Grace\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cThey were wrong,\u201d Grace said. \u201cI have too much to live for to die now.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze found Rio\u2019s as she spoke, and his warm gaze stroked gently over her face.</p><p>He walked around to the other side of her bed, pulled up a chair and sat. He took her f\u06c0He took ree hand, the one that wasn\u2019t occupied with holding Elizabeth, and he ran his fingers over the back of her hand and then her palm, over and over as if reassuring himself that she was here and alive.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>She thought about it for a moment, mentally running down her body, testing what hurt and what didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cTired,\u201d she finally said. \u201cMentally tired. Like I\u2019m burned out, you know? The mental fatigue is more overwhelming tha</p><p>n the physical pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot. It\u2019s amazing you still have your sanity intact.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth snuggled harder into Grace\u2019s side and laid her head on Grace\u2019s shoulder. Her tiny hand crept over Grace\u2019s belly until she was wrapped firmly around Grace.</p><p>Grace snuck a glance at the little girl, who\u2019d gained and lost so much in an instant. Her eyes were already closing, as if she too had reached her limit and now felt safe enough to rest.</p><p>Grace smiled and pressed a soft kiss to Elizabeth\u2019s hair. When she was sure Elizabeth was asleep, she turned to Rio, her gaze worried.</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen to her? She has no one.\u201d</p><p>Rio smiled, slid their hands over to cup over Elizabeth\u2019s. \u201cShe has us.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, his answer didn\u2019t sink in, but when it did, tears pricked her eyelids and she blinked furiously as her vision blurred.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I have you,\u201d he said as he leaned forward to brush his lips over hers. \u201cI have everything I could possibly want right here.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 41</p><p>IT was a frustration for Grace that the first time she was getting to see her sister in over a year was on her sister\u2019s wedding day. She wanted to come as soon as she\u2019d been discharged from the hospital, but Rio had tucked her and Elizabeth away immediately and had insisted that Grace do nothing more taxing than eat and rest for several weeks.</p><p>While it had frustrated her, she had needed that time to heal. As did Elizabeth. She still grieved for her father, even knowing the sort of man he was, and she was dealing with guilt over her part in the whole sordid affair.</p><p>It had been a good time. Just the three of them. Rio had been so good to them both. She still got teary-eyed just thinking of how gentle and understanding he\u2019d been with them and how he\u2019d spoiled them so ridiculously.</p><p>Under Rio\u2019s gruff, tough-as-nails, badass mercenary exterior was a man with a heart of gold and a soft spot a mile wide.</p><p>Rio drove into the Kelly compound, and Grace marveled at its size and also how it resembled a military base with all the security. But she quickly forgot all about her surroundings when she saw her sister running to meet the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she cried to Rio.</p> <p>Rio braked, and before he\u2019d come to a complete stop, Grace was out of the SUV and running as fast as she could to meet her sister.</p><p>They met halfway and Shea threw her arms around Grace. Shea was the smaller of the two and yet she engulfed Grace, squeezing like she was three times Grace\u2019s size.</p><p>Grace returned her hug, holding on. Just holding on.</p><p>Tears ran freely down Grace\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI love you,\u201d she choked out. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re together. That we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Shea\u2019s muffled sobs were lost in Grace\u2019s shoulder. The two sisters stood in the sun, hugging, \u0780slaughing, crying and then hugging some more.</p><p>Around them, the Kellys gathered, all present for the double wedding. They smiled indulgently while the Kelly wives and wife-to-be sniffled and wiped at their eyes.</p><p>Rio got out and leaned against the hood of the SUV, smiling as he watched the sisters\u2019 reunion. Elizabeth snuck into his side and he wrapped his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cThey must have missed each other an awful lot,\u201d Elizabeth said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they did,\u201d Rio said softly. \u201cThey\u2019ve been apart for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>After several more minutes, they broke apart and wiped at each other\u2019s faces with their hands. Finally they gave up, laughing.</p><p>\u201cCome on, there are so many people I want you to meet,\u201d Shea said as she pulled at Grace.</p><p>Grace turned to look back at Rio and Elizabeth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d he mouthed. \u201cYou go on. We\u2019ll catch up.\u201d</p><p>Shea dragged Grace toward where the others were gathered a short distance away. She beamed as she pushed Grace forward.</p><p>\u201cGrace, I\u2019d like you to meet my\u2014our\u2014family.\u201d</p><p>Grace nearly teared up all over again at the inclusion of her as family to all these others.</p><p>\u201cThis is Rachel, Ethan\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>The pretty brunette with soft brown eyes hugged Grace fiercely. \u201cWelcome to our family, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Sam\u2019s wife, Sophie, and their daughter, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Sophie stepped forward, a toddler on her hip, and smiled broadly at Grace. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to finally meet you, Grace. We\u2019re so glad you\u2019re here and safe. Shea\u2019s been so worried for you.\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled back, her throat aching with emotion.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sarah, Garrett\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, and my wedding mate. Nathan and I kept interfering with their wedding plans, so I know they\u2019re just happy to get on with it at this point.\u201d</p><p>Sarah laughed and punched Shea in the arm. \u201cThe wedding will be so much more special now that everyone is home where they belong. Including you, Grace.\u201d</p><p>Sarah hugged her tightly and then stepped back.</p><p>Then Shea took her through every single one of the Kelly brothers, all of whom she\u2019d met or seen, but Shea insisted on introducing them when they were out of camo and not shooting at people.</p><p>When she got to the end, there was an older couple, their smiles as warm as the sun.</p><p>\u201cAnd these two people are the most wonderful people in the world,\u201d Shea breathed. \u201cI want you to meet Marlene and Frank Kelly. Or Mama and Papa Kelly, as they are often referred to. They spawned all those Kelly boys plus picked up more than a few strays along the way.\u201d She pointed in the direction of two men to the side. \u201cThose are Sean and Swanny, two of Marlene\u2019s adoptees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou poor dear,\u201d Marlene said as she enfolded Grace in a hug. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through so much and now this. This family is enough to overwhelm anyone. But welcome to our family. Your family. You\u2019re one of us now. Just like Rio, though he\u2019d probably twitch at the thought. He\u2019s just as much my boy as any I gave birth to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Grace whispered.</p><p>As soon as Marlene released her, Frank enfolded her into a huge hug. She\u2019d never felt so loved as she did right now, surrounded by all these people. Family. It boggled her mind.</p><p>Standing on Frank\u2019s other si19;s othde was a young woman that he pulled forward. \u201cThis is Rusty. She\u2019s a Kelly too. The only Kelly sister to the horde of boys.\u201d</p><p>Rusty\u2019s face lit up and Grace could swear her eyes glistened with tears at the way Frank introduced her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to UT,\u201d Marlene said, beaming with pride.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the chaos,\u201d Rusty said as she hugged Grace. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy and overwhelming around here.\u201d Then her gaze softened as she stared at her family surrounding her. \u201cBut it\u2019s the very best kind of crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s all go inside,\u201d Marlene suggested. \u201cWe have a wedding to get ready for. I\u2019m sure Grace is tired from her trip and would like a shower and something to eat. We\u2019re only down to a few hours, girls. Better get on the stick.\u201d</p><p>Everyone dissolved into laughter and then there was a chorus of \u201cyes ma\u2019ams\u201d all around.</p><p>\u201cNATHAN, Rio, I need to see you both for a moment,\u201d Sam murmured.</p><p>Rio and Nathan, who\u2019d been standing together talking in Sam\u2019s living room while the women were dressing for the ceremony, turned in Sam\u2019s direction.</p><p>Rio frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He motioned them away and they stepped onto the wooden deck that overlooked the lake in the distance.</p><p>\u201cResnick wanted to come. I told him no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Shouldn\u2019t he still be in the hospital anyway?\u201d Nathan asked.</p><p>Sam shrugged. \u201cProbably, but I think he was more afraid to stay where he was vulnerable. He\u2019d rather risk getting out so he can protect himself from any assassination attempts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him about Grace.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t come out as a question. Rio said it fiercely, more of a demand than anything.</p><p>\u201cI told him what Hancock put in his report. That she died,\u201d Sam said quietly. \u201cWhich is why I wouldn\u2019t allow him here. If he does ever come into contact with Shea, she can\u2019t let on that Grace is alive. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust him\u2014I don\u2019t fully\u2014but I don\u2019t want any leaks where Grace is concerned and I know you don\u2019t either, Rio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no,\u201d Rio growled.</p><p>\u201cHe was devastated when I told him Grace had died. He feels responsible. He\u2019s tried to protect them since they were young. He\u2019s long suspected that he\u2019s their biological brother or at least half brother. Chances are Grace and Shea aren\u2019t even full-blooded sisters and maybe not even half sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to them,\u201d Nathan said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. But I wanted to tell you both. Rio, you\u2019ll need to get Grace out soon after the ceremony. I don\u2019t want to take a chance on Resnick not taking no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>Sam nudged Rio on the shoulder. \u201cAnd hey, man, for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m damn glad she saved your sorry ass.\u201d</p><p>Rio smiled faintly because he still couldn\u2019t think about what she\u2019d done without a cold fist clutching his gut. The thought of losing her, even so many weeks later, sent him into an instant sweat.</p><p>Just as they reentered the house, Marlene swept into the living room, arms waving. \u201cOkay, everyone, let\u2019s get this show on the road. Places everyone. Outside. Shoo shoo.\u201d</p><p>The men all laughed and then grumbled but good-naturedly fled outdoly fled ors.</p><p>It was a wedding fit for the lifestyle of KGI to a T. Although outdoors, the area where the ceremony was being held was between Sam\u2019s and Garrett\u2019s houses, but on the exposed sides, huge, bulletproof glass barriers had been erected, one facing the lake and the other facing the building referred to as the War Room.</p><p>Nobody let that get them down. The family had been through enough that no one took security lightly. Marlene had insisted on draping flowers from one end of the bulletproof barriers to the other. There was an awning with flowering vines from top to bottom, and rows of chairs lined the pathway from the house to the archway, where the preacher waited.</p><p>Rio ushered Grace into the back row and sat next to the open pathway, placing Grace on his other side. The wedding was small enough that neither bride was having attendants, but they\u2019d immediately pounced on Elizabeth, welcoming the shy little girl into the fold and declaring that she had to be the flower girl for the occasion. Elizabeth had been so excited that she\u2019d fairly danced down the aisle, sprinkling rose petals and honeysuckle as she went.</p><p>Nathan and Garrett waited at the end and smiled indulgently as Elizabeth took her place next to them. Then Shea and Sarah made their way toward their future husbands, their smiles big enough to light the darkest night.</p><p>Rio stared around him, soaking it all in. He squeezed Grace\u2019s hand, his heart so full of love that he could barely get out what he wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we can do this one day?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She cocked her head to the side and eyed him with one raised eyebrow. \u201cAre you asking me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he hedged. He looked almost nervous. \u201cIf I were, what would you say?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWell, hypothetically speaking, if you were to, I don\u2019t know, propose to me, I\u2019d probably have to think about it for a while, but since this is all hypothetical, it\u2019s hard to know exactly what I\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cYou just like to torture me, don\u2019t you? You know damn well I\u2019m asking you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around. At all the love, the unconditional love and support of the Kelly family. \u201cI want this,\u201d he said in a quiet voice. \u201cI want what they have. I want us to be family, Grace. You, me and Elizabeth. Nathan and Shea. I want our kids to grow up playing together. I want to know that if something ever happens to me, you\u2019ll have them to lean on.</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m asking is a lot. You\u2019d give up a lot. I\u2019ll always be overprotective of you and Elizabeth and any other children we have. We\u2019ll live in isolation in my home in Belize, where it\u2019s a veritable prison. You\u2019ve had to become a different person, and you won\u2019t be able to just pop over to your sister\u2019s for a visit whenever you </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>want. But no one will ever love you more than I do. I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life loving and protecting you with every breath I have.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled Grace\u2019s beautiful blue eyes. She reached up to touch his face and then leaned in to kiss him, uncaring of what was going on around them or that her sister was in the act of getting married.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll marry you, Eduardo Bezerra. And no one will ever love you more than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know that,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cYou nearly died for me and don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you also gave me a reason to live,\u201d she said in a quiet voice. \u201cYou came to me when I was at my lowest point and you wont and yuldn\u2019t let me give up. You saved me, Rio. You made me stronger.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her back, long and sweet. \u201cI love you, Grace. I already love Elizabeth. I feel as though she\u2019s my own. But I\u2019ll also want to give her a few brothers and sisters down the road.\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled. \u201cI\u2019d like that. I think you\u2019d be a whiz at changing diapers.\u201d</p><p>He grinned then. \u201cBet your ass I would.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
