The four-and-a-half-hour flight from Nashville to Los Angeles was fine. The layover was tolerable, thanks to the airport bar. But the last leg of our flight to Australia is becoming more and more unbearable with each passing minute.</p><p>I try to calculate how much longer it is until we land in Sydney. My exhaustion makes it difficult for me to do the simple equation in my head, but it looks like it\u2019s still almost two hours until I will feel solid ground beneath my feet again. I sigh and tell myself to be patient. I\u2019ve made it this far. I can take another two hours. I mean, I don\u2019t really have a choice at this point, right?</p> <p>I look at my best friend sleeping in the seat next to me and I\u2019m irritated. Addison has slept most of the flight, leaving me to entertain myself. She offered to share her Valium, but I declined, certain I wouldn\u2019t need it. Wrong.</p><p>I climb over Addison and take a walk up and down the aisle to stretch my legs, which helps me feel better. Upon returning to my seat, I decide reading will help pass the time, so I grab my e-reader and pick up where I stopped on the slutmance I\u2019d started earlier. Only at chapter six and of course, the woman is in love with the hot new guy but is in denial. How typical.</p><p>Chapter twelve is winding down when the pilot announces that we\u2019ll be landing in Sydney in ten minutes. Addison doesn\u2019t stir, so I put my naughty tale away and nudge her, knowing it will take the next ten minutes to get her out of her drug-induced slumber.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Addison. We\u2019re almost in Sydney.\u201d</p><p>She barely stirs so I nudge her again. \u201cAddison. Get up. We\u2019re in Sydney. You need to get buckled for the landing.\u201d</p> <p>She lifts her head and stares at me with unfocused eyes. She straightens in her seat and takes a moment to get her bearings. \u201cWow, that went faster than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so since you were in a freakin\u2019 coma. It was the longest thirteen hours of my life. I didn\u2019t sleep a wink the whole flight because I was too busy wondering if we were going to end up being shark food.\u201d That came out a little pissier than I\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no reason to be miserable when you don\u2019t have to be. You should\u2019ve taken a happy pill and then maybe you wouldn\u2019t be so cranky right now.\u201d She won\u2019t have to offer twice on the flight home three months from now. Lesson learned.</p><p>Buckled into my seat, I squeeze my eyes as the plane\u2019s wheels screech against pavement. Our fellow passengers erupt into cheer and clapping when we\u2019re safely on the ground. I\u2019m not the only one glad to be getting off this plane.</p><p>We collect our three months\u2019 worth of luggage and take a seat in the terminal to wait for our last flight. With an hour layover, I decide to visit the airport bar. \u201cI\u2019m gonna grab a much-needed and well-deserved toddy.\u201d</p><p>Addison\u2019s phone rings and I recognize her brother\u2019s ringtone. Before she answers, she gives me a warning. \u201cBe back in thirty minutes or I\u2019m sending security for you.\u201d I don\u2019t reply in words but make sure she sees the hand gesture I have for her.</p> <p>The airport bar isn\u2019t far from our terminal and I plop down on a stool. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d I might not be able to tell by my surroundings, but I know I\u2019m in Australia when I hear his accent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like something from a local brewery. I tend to favor lighter flavors.\u201d</p><p>He serves me a pale ale from a Sydney brewery. It\u2019s stout, but good.</p><p>I sit at the bar enjoying my ale. The bartender doesn\u2019t try to talk about where I\u2019m from or where I\u2019m heading. He appears to be in his fifties, so I can only assume he\u2019s heard more shit than he\u2019d like over the years and thus isn\u2019t interested in mine. Works fine for me.</p><p>When I finish, I go back to where Addison is guarding our huge pile of luggage. \u201cWas Ben calling to check on us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He was making sure our flight was running on time. I told him to expect us to arrive around three. He said he\u2019s bringing a friend to help with our luggage.\u201d</p><p>I see how many bags we have and I swear we look like a traveling band of gypsies. Most of it is Addison\u2019s, but I have my fair share\u2014there\u2019s no way to pack lightly for a three-month stay. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my brother. He knows how high maintenance I am.\u201d I sit and prop my feet on the suitcase in front of me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say it, but he\u2019s really excited to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s really excited to meet me. This is a huge red flag. I hope she isn\u2019t thinking of playing matchmaker.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare even think about encouraging him.\u201d I\u2019m not interested in dating anyone right now. She knows this better than anyone. This whole Australia gig is about getting away from all that shit, not finding another pile of it.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t dated many Aussies while he\u2019s lived here. I\u2019m just saying you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if he tries to start something with you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell no. We\u2019re not even there yet and she\u2019s already trying to hook us up. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening, Addison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be living in the same apartment with him for the next three months. Who knows what could happen?\u201d</p><p>Okay. Now, I\u2019m getting pissed because it feels like I\u2019m being ambushed. \u201cI might not know what will happen, but I know what won\u2019t, so forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine, I won\u2019t mention it again. Ben wants to take us out tonight, but I know you haven\u2019t slept much. I told him you might not feel like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll feel up to it if I can catch a power nap on the flight to Wagga Wagga.\u201d</p><p>This time it\u2019s Addison nudging me when our flight is preparing to land. \u201cLaurelyn. Wake up. We\u2019re finally here.\u201d</p><p>I sit up and fluff my long brown hair. I look terrible when it\u2019s flat and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s lying against my head after my nap.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have slept more than forty minutes, but I welcome the overall refreshed feeling it brings\u2014except for my mouth. The combination of mouth breathing, beer drinking, and lack of oral hygiene during our travels has skunked things up. I don\u2019t want to meet Addison\u2019s brother for the first time and have him question which end is my face. \u201cI need some gum. Do you have any on you?\u201d</p><p>Addison reaches into her purse and holds out the lime-green pack in my direction. \u201cDoublemint work for you?\u201d</p><p>I take two pieces because I\u2019m fairly certain it\u2019s going to take two shots of Doublemint to do the job. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>We walk out of the jet bridge with our carry-ons and I see two great-looking guys standing in the terminal watching the disembarking passengers. I know Ben as soon as I see him. I could pick him out of a crowd anywhere, even if I\u2019d never seen his picture. There\u2019s no way to miss him; he\u2019s the perfect male version of Addison. His blond hair is darker than hers (her monthly date with the hairdresser helps those playful highlights). Their olive skin presents a striking contrast with their light hair. He is stunning, just like his sister, but in a masculine way. It\u2019s too bad I\u2019m not interested in dating because he is hot.</p><p>He puts his arms around his sister\u2019s middle and squeezes as he lifts her from the floor and spins several times. \u201cI can\u2019t believe my little sister has come all this way to see me.\u201d He lowers her feet to the floor and looks at me. \u201cAnd you must be Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed I am.\u201d</p><p>Addison and I have been best friends since we met our freshman year at Vanderbilt, but my path has always failed to cross Ben\u2019s for one reason or another. Now that we\u2019re meeting after four years, I\u2019m not sure if I should extend my hand for a shake or lift my arms for a hug, so I wait for his cue.</p><p>He goes for the hug. \u201cIt\u2019s good to meet you, Laurelyn. I\u2019ve been hearing about you for years, so I feel like I already know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope my best friend hasn\u2019t ruined your opinion of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d His crooked grin shows off one of his deep dimples. It\u2019s not a friendly nice to meet you smile. He\u2019s flirting with me already, so I\u2019m wondering what my good pal might have told him.</p><p>Addison clears her throat. \u201cAre you going to introduce us to your friend?\u201d</p><p>The vibe I\u2019m getting from Ben makes me uncomfortable, so I\u2019m happy to shift my focus from him to his buddy. Zac is tall with an athletic build. His dark hair is buzzed close to his scalp except for the spiked tuft on top, and long, sooty lashes frame his almost-black eyes. He\u2019s wearing a fitted black T-shirt and I spy the tribal art tat wrapping around his bicep. His whole exterior screams trouble and that means one thing: my bad-boy-loving pal is going to be all over him.</p><p>He offers his hand to Addison first. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, swoon. I\u2019m not into guys like him, but I could listen to his smooth Aussie accent all day.</p><p>I think I hear a sigh from Addison, and I know she\u2019s thinking the same thing. \u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you. Love your accent.\u201d</p><p>He offers his hand to me, but not his attention\u2014that still belongs to Addison. \u201cI hope your trip has been a pleasant one.\u201d</p><p>The trip here wasn\u2019t a damn bit pleasant, but it\u2019s rude to complain to someone I\u2019ve just met. Addison replies, so I\u2019m neither forced to lie nor complain because she is eager to keep Mr. Dark and Handsome\u2019s attention. \u201cWe had a super trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ladies feel up for hitting a club tonight?\u201d</p><p>I feel like hitting something, but it\u2019s called a bed.</p><p>Addison is well rested from her snooze on the plane, so that means I\u2019ll be the party pooper if I decline, which I\u2019ve never been labeled as, and I don\u2019t intend to start now. \u201cI\u2019m like an Energizer bunny, ready to go.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll sleep when I\u2019m dead, right?</p><p>2</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>I sit in the dark corner and scan the room like a starved predator searching for prey. I haven\u2019t chosen her yet, but the woman who will share my bed for the next few months is in this room right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watch a lovely blond approach my table. \u201cWhat can I bring you?\u201d Hmm. A waitress\u2014not at all my usual taste.</p><p>I have a type. Attractive. Mature. Refined. This barmaid meets the attractive requirement well enough, but she\u2019s void of refinement or maturity as displayed by her choice of apparel\u2014a white, barely there tank top and frazzled cutoff denim shorts. She doesn\u2019t do it for me. Plus, my last two companions were blond. I want a different flavor this time, but no redheads. I want a brunette. A beautiful one.</p><p>I remind myself I\u2019m not in Sydney where I have an endless variety of sophisticated women from which to choose. My choices are more limited in the small town of Wagga Wagga, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to settle for the first attractive woman I see.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a Shiraz.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m prepared for a more prolonged relationship this time\u2014three whole months instead of the usual three or four weeks. I\u2019m looking forward to keeping this one around a little longer, and that\u2019s all the more reason to be certain I make a wise choice.</p><p>I begin my search of the club with the first table toward the front of the room. A brunette beauty sits with a group of women. I watch her for a while, but decide she\u2019s too friendly with the woman sitting next to her. Lesbians aren\u2019t in my repertoire.</p><p>I spend the next hour scanning the club and come up empty-handed. I\u2019m discouraged. No one stands out as the one and this club is by far my best bet for meeting single women in this town. Maybe I should consider coming back another time when it\u2019s not open mic night. Tonight, the place is crawling with boozed college students.</p><p>Tonight\u2019s search has been a failure, but at least the karaoke was entertaining.</p> <p>I\u2019m finishing off the last of my wine before I leave when an announcer from the club takes the stage and asks for the next singer to step forward. A small group of people across the room nominates one of its own. My view of the poor bastard is blocked by the crowd of intoxicated kids standing between us, but I\u2019m certain this is going to be another delightful train wreck.</p><p>The club erupts into cheer and chants. \u201cDo. It. Do. It. Do. It.\u201d A young woman walks onto the stage and stands with her back to the crowd as she takes a guitar from its stand. She lifts its strap over her head and then tosses her long brown hair over one shoulder. When she\u2019s finished settling the guitar into place, she circles around and sits on the stool in the middle of the stage.</p><p>She\u2019s beautiful. And somehow overlooked during my search.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a short ivory dress and a denim jacket with brown cowgirl boots. She bares her thighs as she lifts her feet to rest on the bottom rail, but she\u2019s careful to push her dress between her legs so she doesn\u2019t provide a peep show to the crowd.</p><p>She strums the borrowed guitar a few times and then leans into the microphone. \u201cIs everyone having a good time tonight?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s American. I think. Her accent sounds different\u2014not like what I\u2019ve heard in the past.</p> <p>The crowd erupts into a drunken cheer and I hear a man\u2019s voice yell over the crowd, \u201cIt\u2019s better now, sweet thing!\u201d</p><p>She smiles and adjusts the mic. \u201cI\u2019m not from around here. It\u2019s my first night in Australia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave with me and I\u2019ll make you feel right at home!\u201d a man shouts from the back of the room.</p><p>She ignores the fat, ugly bastard yelling at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of music Australians like, but this has been one of my favorites for as long as I can remember.\u201d She strums a few more chords. \u201cThis is \u2018Crash Into Me\u2019 by the Dave Matthews Band.\u201d</p><p>She sings it slower than the original, putting her own twist on it. Her voice is raspy and sexy, her eyes closed. She oozes eroticism. She tilts her head and opens her eyes when she begins to sing the chorus. I swear it feels like she\u2019s looking right in my direction, singing to me. \u201cOh, and you come craasshh ... into me. And I come into ... you ... And I come into you ... in a boy\u2019s dream ... in a boy\u2019s dream.\u201d</p><p>The stage lights shine in her face and common sense tells me she can\u2019t see me sitting in the dark corner at the back of the club, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from hoping.</p><p>She finishes the chorus and shuts her eyes again. Her long legs bounce against the rail of the stool to keep rhythm and I fall victim to her siren\u2019s song. She has bewitched me. And I want her. She\u2019s the one.</p><p>She opens her eyes and looks in my direction again. \u201cOh, and you come craasshh ... into me, yeah ... baby ... And I come into ... you ... Oh, hike up your skirt a little more ... and show the world to me ... Hike up your skirt a little more ... and show your world to me ... In a boy\u2019s dream ... in a boy\u2019s dream.\u201d</p> <p>The waitress returns to my table, but I don\u2019t glance in her direction when she speaks. I can\u2019t take my eyes from the beautiful brunette on stage for even a second. \u201cCan I bring you another Shiraz?\u201d</p><p>My plans have changed. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>The American girl finishes her song and the crowd is all cheers and whistles. She smiles as she pulls the guitar strap over her head and then leans forward to the mic. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I watch her leave the stage and return to a table where she is sitting with a blond woman and two blokes. Damn! A boyfriend, perhaps?</p><p>My waitress returns with my wine and places it on the table in front of me. \u201cExcuse me, do you know the girl who just performed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She said it was her first night in Australia.\u201d</p><p>I take my wallet from my interior jacket pocket and remove a hundred-dollar bill. I slide it in her direction across the table. \u201cWhat about the people she\u2019s sitting with?\u201d</p><p>She sees the money on the table and picks it up to deposit in the pocket of her black apron before turning to see who my songstress is sitting with. \u201cThe blond guy is Ben Donavon and his friend is Zac Kingston. They\u2019re regulars in here, two or three times a week.\u201d</p><p>Why is this American here with those blokes? \u201cShe sounds American. Do you know why she would be with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen is a Yank. His family owns a vineyard in California and he\u2019s here to study wine at the uni. I think she\u2019d have to be someone he knows from home.\u201d</p><p>I hold up a second hundred-dollar bill between my fingers. \u201cSee this? It\u2019s yours if you can find out what she\u2019s doing here and how long she\u2019ll be in Wagga Wagga. And find out if she\u2019s dating either one of the blokes.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and I see she\u2019s interested in playing my little game. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to collect that in a minute.\u201d</p><p>I sit back and enjoy my Shiraz while the waitress does my detective work. A visiting American couldn\u2019t be more perfect for my next companion. Once our relationship is over, she would be on an entirely different continent, which ensures we won\u2019t have any accidental future run-ins.</p><p>My stay in Wagga Wagga is becoming more promising.</p><p>I finish my glass of Shiraz as my waitress returns. \u201cHer name is ...\u201d</p><p>I cut her off before she can finish her sentence. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to know her name.\u201d</p><p>I can see this stumps her, but money is money. \u201cBen\u2019s sister is her best friend and they\u2019ve come to spend the summer with him. She met Ben and Zac for the first time today.\u201d</p><p>Good. That means she isn\u2019t dating either of them.</p><p>If the guys are students in the wine science program at the university, I\u2019m guessing they will be at the vintage dinner at the school on Friday night. They\u2019ll be anxious to showcase their wines. I wonder if she\u2019ll be there as a guest.</p><p>I pull another bill from my wallet and hold it up for Blondie to see. \u201cThis is yours if you can find out what their plans are for the vintage dinner at the university on Friday night. I want to know if the brunette will be there.\u201d</p><p>She smiles again. \u201cI could play this game all night.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, she returns with another Shiraz and an update. \u201cThe guys will be presenting their wines at the dinner, and both girls will be guests.\u201d</p><p>I slide the well-earned bill across the table. \u201cPerfect. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been my pleasure. Would you like me to keep the Shiraz coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I spend the next hour stealing glances at the beautiful American through the crowd of people between us as they shift. I\u2019m disappointed when the foursome gets up to leave, but I see the perfect opportunity for a convenient face-to-face encounter when she moves toward the restrooms.</p><p>I migrate in that direction and wait for her to emerge for our chance meeting in the hallway. When the door to the ladies\u2019 room opens, I walk toward her, but she\u2019s looking down into her purse. She attempts to dodge right, so I move with her. \u201cPardon me.\u201d</p><p>Her accent is so unusual. And endearing.</p><p>She steps to her left and I move with her like a mirror image. \u201cSo sorry, Miss.\u201d</p><p>Look up at me.</p><p>\u201cWanna dance?\u201d she laughs as she lifts her eyes from her purse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d Her smile spreads with my reply. We lock eyes and I try to identify the color of hers, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s too dark in the narrow hallway.</p><p>I was right. She is the one.</p><p>She seems embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Asking someone to dance is an expression we use where I\u2019m from. You know? Like when two people try to get around one another as we just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m familiar with the expression, but one can always hope.\u201d I step around her toward the door to the men\u2019s room. \u201cI think I would have enjoyed a dance with you.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>How do you decide what to wear to a vintage dinner at an Australian university when you aren\u2019t really sure what a vintage dinner is?</p><p>I stand at the sink brushing my teeth while Addison showers. Man, this sharing a bathroom with two other people is no joke, especially when one of them is as high maintenance as Addison.</p><p>I rinse and wipe my mouth. \u201cYou never told me what this thing is that we\u2019re going to tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a vintage dinner.\u201d Awesome. That tells me everything I need to know.</p><p>I grab my makeup bag and begin applying my foundation. The lighting in our bedroom is terrible and the bathroom isn\u2019t much better, but who am I to complain when I\u2019m staying here as a nonpaying guest. Besides, Addison complains enough for both of us. \u201cCan you give me a little more to go on? Like, what\u2019s going to be happening and what I need to wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be too formal if it\u2019s hosted by a university, so I think a sundress should be fine. What about that black strapless with the wide white band around the waist? It\u2019s a chameleon and will fit in if this shindig is on the dressier side. Didn\u2019t you bring it?\u201d</p> <p>I remember hanging it in the closet when we unpacked. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen says the event begins outdoors with hors d\u2019oeuvres where we\u2019ll try the first round of new vintages. When we finish that, we\u2019ll go inside for dinner and have more wine. There\u2019ll probably be a band, so expect some dancing.\u201d</p><p>Eating, drinking, and dancing. Slow dancing. It sounds fun and innocent enough, except I suspect Ben considers me more than a simple guest.</p><p>After I finish my hair and makeup, I slip into the black strapless. When Addison comes into our bedroom, she has me make a complete spin and gives me a whistle. \u201cLooking good in the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s wearing an ivory halter dress I don\u2019t recognize. The ivory against her blond hair and olive skin is gorgeous. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s new. I bought it before we left. Think Zac will like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Zac would like you in anything. Or nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>She laughs but knows it\u2019s true. He wants her bad. \u201cI think he likes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing reserved doesn\u2019t suit you, Addie. Of course he likes you. I don\u2019t know how you could question it. He\u2019s been here constantly since we arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but he hasn\u2019t said anything or made a move.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been three days. Not every guy tries to get you in the sack thirty seconds after you meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I guess I\u2019m second-guessing myself because he hasn\u2019t tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch his reaction when we walk out. You\u2019ll know where his head\u2019s at.\u201d</p><p>The eyes tell it all when Zac sees Addison. He is hot for her. Unfortunately, Ben\u2019s reaction to me is very similar. What the hell am I thinking? It\u2019s a huge mistake for me to attend this event as Ben\u2019s guest wearing this dress, but it\u2019s too late now.</p><p>Luck is with me the first half of the night as I\u2019m able to avoid Ben. He\u2019s busy presenting his vintages, but like always, my luck runs out. We finish dinner and he takes my hand to pull me from my chair. \u201cCome dance with me.\u201d</p><p>I smile and follow him onto the dance floor, mostly because I don\u2019t have a reasonable excuse not to. One dance. I can do that.</p><p>I glance over at Addison dancing with Zac. She\u2019s giddier than a pig in shit and I\u2019m happy for her. Her relationship luck hasn\u2019t been much better than mine. \u201cShe seems to be having a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZac doesn\u2019t appear too unhappy, either. If I had to guess, I\u2019d bet you and I have officially been dropped for the rest of the night.\u201d</p> <p>Shit! That means we\u2019ll be alone when we get back to the apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I still have jet lag. I\u2019ll probably go straight to bed anyway.\u201d</p><p>A young man walks up beside us. \u201cMr. Donavon, I\u2019m sorry to disturb you, but we\u2019re having trouble finding your merlot.\u201d</p><p>Ben stops swaying, but doesn\u2019t release me from his embrace. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Greg, one of the servers for tonight\u2019s event.\u201d</p><p>Ben looks puzzled. \u201cAll of my vintages were stored together.\u201d</p><p>Greg appears apologetic as he shrugs. \u201cWe\u2019ve searched everywhere and can\u2019t find it with the others.\u201d</p><p>He releases me. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s been shuffled around in all the chaos. Will you excuse me for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. This is your special night. You need to do whatever it takes to make this successful.\u201d</p><p>He strokes his hand down my arm. \u201cI won\u2019t be gone long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. No hurry.\u201d Really. Don\u2019t hurry.</p><p>I walk to the dinner table feeling a little guilty that I\u2019m relieved by the interruption. I eye Addison and Zac on the dance floor and recognize her signature moves. When they circle around and his back is turned to me, she points to him and mouths, \u201cI\u2019m fucking him tonight.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve heard that before and I have no doubt she will. That\u2019s Addison. She\u2019s been on a different continent for all of three days and she\u2019s already found her next hookup. I put my hand in the air to mimic that of a tigress claw and mouth a silent roar.</p><p>I\u2019m giggling at her doing the same gesture behind his back when a man\u2019s voice startles me. \u201cEnjoying the wine this evening?\u201d</p><p>I look up at the person speaking and I\u2019m not prepared for whom I see. A feather could knock me over. It\u2019s him, the beautiful man from the club.</p><p>I didn\u2019t get to study him for long the other night, but he\u2019s even better looking than I remember. He\u2019s tall with broad shoulders, the kind I\u2019d like to run my hands across and glide down his strong arms. His dark hair is unruly in contrast to his businesslike attire, and I wonder if he purposely fixed it that way or if a woman has just finished running her fingers through it. If it is the latter, then damn, what a lucky woman.</p><p>He\u2019s dressed in another suit, this one dark platinum with a pinstriped shirt beneath. His coordinating blue and platinum tie makes his azure eyes even more intense.</p><p>Did he say something? Wait\u2014he asked if I was enjoying the wine? At least that\u2019s what I think he said. \u201cI am. Very much.\u201d</p><p>He shifts his attention to the glass in front of me. \u201cWhat are you having?\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. I don\u2019t know what kind of wine it is. There are only two kinds in my book: good or bad. I give it a once-over and decide there\u2019s no reason to pretend I know. \u201cHonestly? I don\u2019t have a damn clue. It\u2019s red and it\u2019s good. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>He smiles as he takes the glass from my hand. He lifts it for inspection before tucking it under his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s Cabernet Sauvignon.\u201d He tilts it upward and takes a small sip. \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>Oh, double swoon. His lips are where mine were. Lucky glass. \u201cI\u2019ll have to take your word for it because I know nothing about wine.\u201d</p><p>His brow wrinkles as he looks at me. Damn. His eyes are mesmerizing, the kind you can get lost in with very little effort. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know wine, then how did you come to be at a vintage dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the guest of one of the students showcasing his vintages.\u201d</p><p>He gestures to my glass of wine he\u2019s still holding. \u201cIs this one your friend\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Is it Ben\u2019s? They\u2019d started running together several glasses ago. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. As for most of the others I\u2019ve tried tonight, I can\u2019t say the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Ben you said so. Or perhaps you\u2019d like to. He stepped away, but he should be back any minute.\u201d I silently pray he won\u2019t return and ruin my conversation with this man I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about since our prior meeting.</p><p>He has a crooked grin. \u201cIf I recall correctly, I think you owe me a dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I believe I do.\u201d He reaches for my hand and leads me to the dance floor where the band is playing a fairly decent version of Van Morrison\u2019s \u201cSomeone Like You.\u201d We begin to step with the tempo.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re American?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryday and twice on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cWhat brings a funny Yank like you to Wagga Wagga?\u201d</p><p>I glance over his shoulder and see Addison noticing us, so I give her a smile. \u201cMy best friend invited me to spend the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour accent sounds different from the other Americans I\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>I had taken a lot of flack from Addison over the years about my strong twang. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m from the South,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, how were you were able to put your life on hold for three months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to step away from my career for a little while so I could clear my head about some decisions I need to make.\u201d</p><p>He peers over my shoulder and an irritated countenance appears on his face. \u201cI have somewhere to be in a few minutes, so I have to cut our dance short, but would you join me for dinner tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>How could I tell this man no? \u201cYes, I would like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a meeting tomorrow evening and I expect it to run late. May I send my driver to pick you up around seven?\u201d</p><p>He has a driver? \u201cUmm, okay.\u201d</p><p>He takes his phone from his pocket. \u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d</p><p>It takes a moment for me to recall the unfamiliar address, but he puts it into his phone as I call it off. \u201c452 Stanton Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy driver\u2019s name is Daniel and you can expect him to be prompt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d As he walks away, I remember we never introduced ourselves. \u201cWait. I didn\u2019t get your name.\u201d</p><p>He smiles as he walks backwards away from me. \u201cIt will be more interesting if you don\u2019t know. See you tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>More interesting? What the hell is that supposed to mean? He tells me his driver\u2019s name, but not his? That\u2019s weird. I should know his name if I\u2019ve agreed to meet him for dinner.</p><p>I\u2019m about to chase him when I feel a warm hand on my arm. \u201cHey, what are you doing standing out here on the dance floor by yourself?\u201d Ben asks.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t alone. I was dancing with someone, but he had to leave.\u201d I search for Nameless, but he is already gone. Like a phantom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ben gives me a bewildered look, as if I made up the whole thing. \u201cOkay. Would you like to finish the dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As I dance with Ben, I can\u2019t stop thinking about the phantom or the way he disappeared without giving me his name. Shit! I bet the good-looking bastard is married and that\u2019s why he wouldn\u2019t tell me who he is.</p> <p>That isn\u2019t going to work for me. If there is one thing I don\u2019t do, it\u2019s married men.</p><p>I need to talk to Addison, but she is in the middle of her presex show with Zac. That means she\u2019s sending me home alone with Ben. I\u2019m not in the mood to deal with that. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well. I think I\u2019m going to catch a cab back to the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on his arm. \u201cI can\u2019t ask you to do that. This is your big night. Stay and show off what you\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Really.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, I know. He\u2019s such a nice guy, but I\u2019m not interested. \u201cI know, but I\u2019d feel worse if you didn\u2019t stay to promote what you\u2019ve worked so hard for.\u201d</p><p>He concedes and I catch a cab back to the apartment. I make a point to be in bed when he comes home. I pretend to be asleep when he taps on the bedroom door because I\u2019m not sure what he wants.</p><p>Well, that\u2019s not true. I know what he wants, but I\u2019ve chosen the coward\u2019s way. I should be brutal and tell him to back off, but I don\u2019t. I dodge him, only prolonging the inevitable.</p><p>I jerk awake with the shift of the bed beside me. What the hell? The adrenaline surging through my veins makes my heart take off like a helicopter. It\u2019s throbbing erratically in my neck, my chest, my head. Even my hands.</p><p>\u201cAddison?\u201d I pray I hear her voice answer me.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She whispers like she\u2019s afraid she\u2019ll wake someone. Too late.</p> <p>I\u2019m relieved to hear her voice instead of Ben\u2019s, but I\u2019m madder than hell. I look at the clock on the nightstand. It\u2019s 3:18 in the morning. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me. What are you doing climbing into bed at this time of the morning? I thought you were at Zac\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and now you\u2019re not. \u201cWhy did you come back? Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you know me. I don\u2019t want to be that girl, the one who wears out her welcome.\u201d</p><p>Right. Because Dude doesn\u2019t owe you anything after he gets in your pants. \u201cLet me get straight on this. You don\u2019t want to be the girl to wear out your welcome, but you\u2019ll be the girl who lets him wear out your vagina?\u201d</p><p>She slaps my arm in the dark. \u201cThat\u2019s just crude, Laurie.\u201d She giggles. \u201cBut oh so true. He did wear it out like a champ.\u201d</p><p>Ugh! I was joking. She\u2019s not.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a game, Laurelyn. Trust me. I know what I\u2019m doing. He\u2019ll want me more if he has to lie in bed thinking about me from across the hall. He\u2019ll wish he\u2019d asked me to stay, but there\u2019s another reason I came home. I don\u2019t want Ben to know I locked loins with Zac.\u201d</p> <p>Good grief. That\u2019s what we\u2019re calling it these days. \u201cWhy would Ben care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an only child so you don\u2019t get it. Brothers don\u2019t care how old you are. They\u2019re weird about their friends screwing their sisters.\u201d</p><p>What about a sister freaking out over her brother trying to lock loins with her best friend? Shouldn\u2019t she be trying to dissuade Ben or something?</p><p>\u201cSo, I saw you dancing with a good-looking suit last night. What\u2019s going on with that?\u201d</p><p>Good-looking suit. I can roll with that. \u201cThat was him, the man I ran into at the club on our way out the other night. The same one I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about for three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow. What a coincidence.\u201d She doesn\u2019t have to tell me. I thought I\u2019d never see him again.</p><p>\u201cI know. He asked me to dinner tonight.\u201d I let out a high-pitched squeal that shouldn\u2019t come from a twenty-two-year-old woman. \u201cHe\u2019s sending his driver to pick me up because he has an afternoon meeting. Is that weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not, unless he\u2019s calling the man behind the wheel of a taxi his driver. He must be rich. What does he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t get that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>I opt to not tell her he said it would be more exciting if I didn\u2019t know. \u201cUmm, we didn\u2019t get that far, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s fucked up. You\u2019re going out with a guy and don\u2019t know who he is? Who am I going to report to the police if you go missing because he\u2019s another good-looking serial killer? You know, Ted Bundy was terribly charming too.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. I hadn\u2019t thought of that. What if he is some kind of weirdo? \u201cI guess tell them it was the good-looking suit who did it.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>Daniel messages me when he is pulling up to the front of The Ashford Hotel, so I leave our table in the hotel restaurant to meet her. When I walk out of the hotel to greet my American girl, Daniel is circling around to open her door, but I stop him. \u201cI have it, Daniel. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>After opening her door, she steps out onto the sidewalk. She\u2019s wearing a satiny floral one-shouldered dress belted at the waist and mile-high heels that stretch her legs even longer than they already are. She\u2019s beautiful and I ache to reach out my hand to touch the exposed skin on her shoulder.</p><p>She looks up at the hotel and then back to me. \u201cSeriously? You brought me to a hotel?\u201d</p><p>Her face tells me she\u2019s pissed off, but it\u2019s easy to see why she might jump to conclusions. \u201cThe meeting with my sales team was in the hotel\u2019s conference room. I thought we might have dinner at Ash. It\u2019s the hotel restaurant. I\u2019m told it\u2019s the best in town.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks pink. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give it another thought.\u201d</p><p>She takes my offered arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not from Wagga Wagga?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That\u2019s all I give her and she doesn\u2019t push further.</p><p>I allow her to walk ahead of me through the revolving door into the lobby. \u201cAre you staying in this hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m staying at an estate in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I escort her toward the back of the restaurant to our table. I pull out her chair and slide it under her when she sits. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>She smiles and I find myself wanting to know all the secrets she hides behind it. \u201cVery. I\u2019m not one of those girls who\u2019s scared to eat in front of a date. I hope you don\u2019t mind that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet as she reads the wine list and our server arrives to take our drink order. \u201cI\u2019ll have a Sauvignon Blanc.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her eyes from the list. \u201cI have no idea how to order wine. I\u2019ll have what you\u2019re having.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo Sauvignon Blancs.\u201d</p><p>She holds the menu in front of her and I can\u2019t see her face. She\u2019s studying it like there could be an exam later. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want. Everything looks good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy business associate recommended anything seafood.\u201d</p><p>A moment later she places the menu on the table. \u201cSeafood sounds good. I\u2019ll have the stuffed prawns.\u201d</p><p>After the server brings the wine and takes our order, we continue our safe, generic conversation. \u201cHow did your friend\u2019s vintages fare last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen did well, but I never expected anything less. Wine is his family\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>I remember the waitress mentioning that. I believe she said he was from California. \u201cI understand that. You\u2019re much more passionate about it when it\u2019s your livelihood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that like you know from experience.\u201d She\u2019s a sharp one.</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019m employed in the wine-making business as well.\u201d It\u2019s a half-truth since I neglect to tell her I own a large number of the wineries across South Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>She smiles and I see her make the connection. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you were at the vintage dinner last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My employer donates money to the wine program, so he is given an automatic invitation to the event. I was sent in his place as a representative.\u201d</p><p>We talk about nothing in particular and I feel the mood of our conversation shift when we finish eating. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last hour having dinner with you and you still haven\u2019t told me your name. Maybe it\u2019s an Australian thing, but where I come from, that is one of the first things you tell someone. Is there a reason you haven\u2019t told me?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m interested in picking her brain, hearing her possible explanation. \u201cWhy do you think that could be?\u201d</p><p>She studies my face and for the first time I notice her unusual eye color. I thought they were brown, but now I see I was only half-right. They\u2019re lighter, more like caramel than chocolate. And her hair isn\u2019t a single shade of brown; it\u2019s full of honey-colored streaks.</p><p>Her back stiffens. \u201cI think you\u2019re married with a wife and two-point-five kids waiting for you to come home.\u201d</p><p>I almost forget her question, I\u2019m so caught up in watching the windows to her soul. I see something there, but I can\u2019t put my finger on what it is.</p><p>I hold up my empty left hand and point to where a wedding band would be if I had one. I smile because the thought of me being married is such a polar opposite from the truth. \u201cNo wife. No two-point-five kids.\u201d</p><p>She sits back in her chair and doesn\u2019t appear as though she\u2019s buying what I\u2019m selling. \u201cThe lack of a wedding band doesn\u2019t prove anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am secretive, but it has nothing to do with being married.\u201d</p><p>Our server returns to remove our dishes and we fall silent until he walks away. \u201cWhy are you secretive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor lack of a better answer, it\u2019s just how I am.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She frowns. \u201cWell, that explains everything.\u201d</p><p>These are dangerous waters I\u2019m treading.

Disclosing my identity complicates things, so you wouldn\u2019t know my real name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not joking.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t read her reaction. I have no idea if she\u2019s on board or freaking out. \u201cWhen the three months is over, so are we. I\u2019ll move on and you will too. Because you won\u2019t know my name or any identifying information about me, you\u2019ll have no way to contact me. Ever.\u201d</p><p>This face I can read, and it\u2019s full of confusion. \u201cBut why?\u201d</p> <p>I have reasons, but I won\u2019t explain them. \u201cBecause that\u2019s the way I need things to be.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s clearly pissed off as evidenced by the scowl on her face. \u201cIf you never wanted to hear from me again, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem on my end, Jack.\u201d</p><p>I smile because she has no idea she just used my real name. \u201cYou\u2019d have the same courtesy. You don\u2019t have to tell me your real name and you choose how much or how little you want to tell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>She puts her elbows on the table and leans forward. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy as hell, but you already know that, right?\u201d</p><p>I feel her slipping through my fingers, so I\u2019m forced to use my last line of defense. \u201cI\u2019m a very wealthy man. The three months we spend together would be the best of your life. You\u2019d never be able to top what you\u2019d experience with me.\u201d</p><p>She sits back and laughs. \u201cWell, at least you\u2019re not egotistical.\u201d</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t finished. I had one more card up my sleeve. \u201cI\u2019d make your fantasies a reality.\u201d</p><p>She licks her lips and then draws the bottom one into her mouth. God, I\u2019d love to do that for her. \u201cYou want me to have sex with you.\u201d</p><p>Now she\u2019s catching on. \u201cYes, I would like that very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you need an escort or a prostitute, and I\u2019m neither of those things.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. I\u2019ve fucked up royally now.</p><p>I reach for her hand to calm her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting you were either. Sex wouldn\u2019t be the only part of our relationship. There would be much more to it than that.\u201d</p><p>She jerks her hand away. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep with strangers and apparently that\u2019s what you\u2019d continue to be since you won\u2019t even tell me something as basic as your name.\u201d</p><p>I pull my hand back. \u201cYou have a very reasonable argument, but it wouldn\u2019t be like that. We would come to know each other in our own way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo hell with this shit. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d She pushes away from the table. \u201cPlease call your driver and ask him to take me home.\u201d</p><p>Way to go, Jack. Way to go.</p><p>I pull my phone from my pocket and call Daniel. \u201cFront of the hotel, now.\u201d</p><p>I watch her face as she stares off, refusing to look at me. I regret we didn\u2019t have more time together. I wish I could take it all back and handle it differently.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll only be a minute. Please, allow me to walk you out.\u201d She doesn\u2019t agree or object as I stand to walk her toward the exit.</p><p>The car is at the curb as we move through the revolving doors. I open the back passenger door for her and her caramel eyes meet mine before she gets inside. \u201cHave a nice life, whoever you are.\u201d</p><p>Wow, that\u2019s final.</p><p>She climbs in and I stand, my hand on the door, waiting to shut it. I don\u2019t want to let her go like this. I fight the urge to get into the backseat with her but I know it\u2019s useless. I\u2019ve insulted her, and she\u2019s made it clear she wouldn\u2019t accept my proposition. But dammit, I don\u2019t want this to be the last time I see her, so I stop arguing with myself and get into the car.</p><p>She regards me with narrowed, suspicious eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I close the door. \u201cI\u2019m riding with you.\u201d</p><p>She scoots as far from me as possible. \u201cMy answer is no, so what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>Great question. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>We ride in uncomfortable silence as Daniel drives us to where she is staying. I rack my brain trying to think of an alternate approach, but come up short.</p><p>After the car stops, Daniel opens the door and she gets out. I follow, walking by her side toward the apartment\u2019s entrance, and I can\u2019t fight the urge to make another plea. \u201cPlease, think it over and reconsider my offer.\u201d</p><p>She stops dead in her tracks. \u201cYou arrogant jackass! You rode with me so you could try to talk me into going along with this crazy-ass idea of yours.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure why I feel like I have the right to touch her or why I think she\u2019d let me, but I reach out and place my finger over her lips. \u201cShh. Don\u2019t say no again right now. Wait until you\u2019ve had time to think about it. This is a new idea, and you might find you feel different about it once you\u2019ve thought it over.\u201d</p><p>I trail my thumb to her bottom lip and rub it as I remember the way she sucked it. If you say yes, you\u2019d spend the next three months having the time of your life.\u201d</p><p>I take my hand from her face. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the hotel restaurant tomorrow night at eight o\u2019clock if you decide you want to discuss it further.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>I unlock the door and all but fall inside the empty apartment. Addison is out with Zac for their first postcoital date. I have no idea where Ben is, but I\u2019m glad to be alone. I don\u2019t want to explain why I\u2019ve returned from a date with a man I can\u2019t name.</p><p>It\u2019s still early but nothing is on television, so I change into my pajamas and go to bed. Sleep doesn\u2019t find me easily because my mind keeps racing with thoughts of what Mr. Nameless has asked me to do.</p><p>It\u2019s shocking. It\u2019s bizarre. It\u2019s interesting.</p><p>It\u2019s a fascinating idea. At least I know how things would end. There would be no chance of a broken heart. He said it would be the best three months of my life. I\u2019d experience new and wonderful things. He\u2019d make my fantasies come true.</p><p>Why choose me?</p><p>I\u2019ve known from the time I was a small child something was wrong with me. I\u2019ve never been able to have a normal relationship with a man\u2014neither romantic or nonromantic. Maybe my problems stem from my father\u2014or lack thereof\u2013\u2013or my mother\u2019s unrequited love for him. Neither have been much of a positive influence on my feelings regarding romantic relationships. Whatever the cause, I\u2019m damaged goods. Maybe I should consider this. It\u2019s not like I have better offer on the table.</p><p>It takes hours for me to doze off because I can\u2019t stop thinking about the things Nameless said. But I do fall asleep, only to be awakened by Addison sneaking into our bedroom again. Does she think that Ben is stupid? He has to know what she\u2019s doing with Zac.</p><p>I look at the clock: 6:27 a.m. this time. She almost made it to a reasonable hour.</p><p>She slides into bed next to me. \u201cTell me I\u2019m not going to wake up to this for the next three months,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI make no promises. I see you\u2019re here so the good-looking suit must not have been a serial-killing weirdo. How did it go?\u201d</p><p>She was dead wrong about the weirdo part. \u201cIt was a bizarre date to say the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finding out Aussie guys are different.\u201d</p><p>I can think of many words to describe Nameless, but none do him justice. There needs to be a new word for what he is. \u201cDifferent doesn\u2019t even begin to cover what this guy asked me to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, that doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first thoughts were that it was crazy, but now I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve had time to think about it ... and it might be sort of hot.\u201d</p><p>Addison sits straight up in the bed. I have her full attention. \u201cWhat did he do? Ask you to give him a hand job under the table at dinner?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t bring myself to tell her the part about how he wouldn\u2019t tell me his name or anything personal about his life. \u201cHe asked me to date him for the next three months and then walk away without any further contact.\u201d</p><p>She lies back on the bed. \u201cSo, the guy isn\u2019t into long-distant relationships? Seems pretty reasonable since you\u2019ll be nine thousand miles away. Zac and I sort of have the same arrangement.\u201d</p><p>No, it\u2019s not the same, but I can\u2019t tell her the rest. \u201cI guess. He told me he was rich and he would make the next three months of my life the best I\u2019ve ever had. He said he\u2019d make my fantasies come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, the best three months of your life and fantasies coming true? What\u2019s holding you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just seems pointless to date someone when I know it\u2019s going to end in three months.\u201d And then there\u2019s the whole issue of having sex with someone I don\u2019t love. I\u2019m not sure I can do that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overthinking it, Laurelyn. The guy\u2019s rich and he promises you the best three months of your life. It\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m considering it. \u201cYou think I should do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, will you go home and wonder what you might have missed?\u201d</p><p>The answer is clear. \u201cOf course I would.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at our bedroom door. \u201cCome in,\u201d Addison says. Ben opens it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a delivery in here.\u201d</p><p>Addison\u2019s face lights up. \u201cWhat kind of delivery?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s flowers and a catered breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d she says, throwing back the covers. \u201cSee? I told you I knew how to play the game.\u201d It looks like Ben is going to find out about Zac sooner than she\u2019d planned.</p><p>We walk into the kitchen and there\u2019s a floral arrangement on the counter next to a basket of breakfast pastries. Addison holds a bottle of champagne in one hand and orange juice in the other. \u201cMimosas for breakfast. Can you believe that? And this isn\u2019t cheap champagne. It\u2019s expensive. Very expensive.\u201d</p> <p>She takes the card from the blank envelope and her smile fades after she reads it. \u201cOh. This isn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>I feel a surge of hope. Could all of this be for me? From him, the man with no name? \u201cWhat does the card say?\u201d</p><p>She holds it up. \u201c\u2018You won\u2019t regret saying yes.\u2019 It\u2019s signed, \u2018from Lachlan.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I smile, but bite my lip in a failed attempt to hide my pleasure. His name is Lachlan.</p><p>I\u2019m confused by this unexpected confession. He said names weren\u2019t part of the game, so what has changed? Maybe he decided he is more interested in a normal relationship than the bizarre one he proposed last night.</p> <p>I pluck the card from Addison\u2019s hand because I want to read it for myself. I rub my thumb over his written words. The penmanship is masculine. I\u2019m sure he signed it personally.</p><p>I hear a pop as Addison opens the champagne. \u201cLaurie, this guy is jockeying hard for you, girl.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s arms are crossed and he looks pissed. \u201cCome on. You just met this guy. Doesn\u2019t this seem like a little much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it if a guy did this for me.\u201d Addison tops up her champagne with some orange juice. \u201cThis is a guaranteed panty-dropper in my book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAddison!\u201d</p><p>Ben storms out of the kitchen and slams his bedroom door. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have said that in front of him, and we both know why.\u201d</p> <p>Addison reaches for a pastry. \u201cOh, he\u2019ll get over it. So, what are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with trying it. If it doesn\u2019t feel right, I can always back out. \u201cHe asked me to meet him tonight if I wanted to discuss it further. I think I\u2019m going to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl. I love that he has to wait all day wondering if you\u2019ll show tonight. He\u2019ll be so hard up by the time he sees you walk in. You have to show up late. I have the perfect little black dress that will knock his socks off. The back of it is so low, you can almost see your ass crack.\u201d</p><p>She runs into our room and returns with a next-to-nothing black minidress. Wow, she\u2019s right. It is low. And short. Maybe even too short. I hold it up and have no doubt it is going to hit me high thigh since I\u2019m taller than she is.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this gonna be too short for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean too short? Have we met?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a lazy Sunday so we spend the day hanging out in the apartment after gorging on quiche and Mimosas. Ben is sullen the rest of the day, his attitude suggesting he is unhappy about the prospect of my new acquaintance. He doesn\u2019t speak to me all day, but that\u2019s all right. I may be staying with him, but I don\u2019t owe him anything. And his behavior is making it a lot easier to not feel guilty about meeting up with another guy tonight.</p><p>It\u2019s six o\u2019clock and I decide to start getting ready to meet Lachlan. Addison wants me to be late so he\u2019ll sweat it out, but if I\u2019m tardy, it won\u2019t be because I wasn\u2019t ready on time.</p> <p>I jump in the shower and shave my legs and pits twice, just in case, but in case of what, I don\u2019t know. I apply my makeup as I stand with one towel wrapped around my hair and one around my body. I decide to go with smoky eyes\u2014the sultriness will go well with the sensual dress and tall heels Addison has chosen for me.</p><p>It\u2019s twenty minutes until eight and I stand in front of the mirror studying the final product. Hmm, not bad if I do say so myself. The smoky eyes and scarlet lips are definitely going to get his attention but my upswept hair makes my bare back call out to be touched, and quite possibly, kissed. I have never felt so alluring in all of my life\u2014or so much like a ho\u2014because I know why I\u2019m going.</p><p>Addison surveys me and instructs me to do a spin. \u201cLaurelyn, you\u2019re smokin\u2019 hot.\u201d</p><p>She is my best friend so it\u2019s her job to say stuff like that. \u201cIt\u2019s the dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s all you, and he\u2019ll know it when he peels that dress off you.\u201d</p><p>Someone\u2019s awfully anxious for me to get it on with this guy. \u201cHe\u2019s not peeling jack off me tonight. I\u2019m just going to talk.\u201d</p><p>She takes my hands and looks like she\u2019s going to give me some serious advice. I prepare because this isn\u2019t something I would expect from her. \u201cListen to me, Laurelyn. The best way to get over somebody is to get under someone else.\u201d</p><p>Well, her record stands unblemished. She\u2019s yet to blow my mind with deep, philosophical advice. I\u2019m laughing when I hear my cab blow for me. \u201cCab\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>She hugs me before I leave. \u201cHave a great time. Text if you see you\u2019ll be late so I won\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s uncomfortable, but I look to where Ben is sitting on the couch. He doesn\u2019t make a move to even glance in my direction, so I leave without speaking to him. It\u2019s probably better that way.</p><p>It\u2019s a short drive to the hotel and I\u2019m almost hyperventilating by the time I walk up to the hostess. \u201cI\u2019m meeting someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe name?\u201d</p><p>I smile as I say it. \u201cLachlan.\u201d It\u2019s ridiculous that I feel like I\u2019ve won some sort of battle by knowing his name. Laurelyn, one. Lachlan, zero.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look happy about my arrival. \u201cOh, yes. He left word he might have a guest joining him. Right this way.\u201d She leads me to a table for two in the same dimly lit corner we occupied last night. As I walk toward him, he looks up from the menu. His gaze follows my body from my feet up to my eyes. He smiles.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to see his reaction to the back of this dress.</p><p>He stands and walks around to slide my chair out for me, just as he did the prior evening. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d ...\u201d He trails off and I know he\u2019s giving his full attention to the back\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of my dress. He clears his voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d come or not.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I think he likes the dress just fine. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend on coming, but here I am all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very glad you did. You look lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lachlan.\u201d His light blue eyes lock with mine and I give him a smug smile, letting him know I\u2019m happy I won.</p><p>The smile he gives me in return is complacent. \u201cDid you like the Sauvignon Blanc last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to have that again or try something else?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He orders our wine and then sits back in his chair, seemingly pleased with himself. \u201cI assume you\u2019re here to discuss my proposal.\u201d</p><p>I sit up straighter when I take notice of myself slouching. I can\u2019t show any sign of weakness if I\u2019m going to keep the upper hand. \u201cIt would seem so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me anything.\u201d He\u2019s so beautiful and confident. Dammit, it\u2019s unnerving.</p><p>I lace my fingers together and prop my elbows on the table. Yes, I know that\u2019s considered rude at dinner, but I like the confidence it gives me. \u201cYou have no qualms about asking me to do this. I assume you\u2019ve done this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but never for more than three to four weeks. Three months would be new for me, but I\u2019m excited about trying something different.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m anxious to point out how he has already tried something new by giving up one of his biggest stipulations for me. \u201cYou told me your name, so that\u2019s different. Does that mean your issue with being anonymous has changed?\u201d</p><p>He takes a big drink of wine. \u201cLachlan isn\u2019t my real name. You needed something to call me, so that\u2019s what I chose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I feel my silly girlish hope deflate. \u201cHow many times have you done this?\u201d</p><p>It could be in the hundreds. Or worse, maybe he has no idea.</p><p>\u201cIs that really important?\u201d He\u2019s stalling, so knowing the number becomes crucial to me at this point\u2014a make-or-break kind of significance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to me.\u201d</p><p>His brow wrinkles and I think he\u2019s doing the math in his head. \u201cI guess there\u2019s been twelve.\u201d</p><p>I admit twelve is far fewer than I\u2019d imagined, but he has to guess? We\u2019re not talking a hundred and twelve, so is it really that hard to be sure? \u201cWhen did you start doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time was four years ago. I did it on a whim and I liked it. It works for me, so I haven\u2019t had any other type of relationship since.\u201d</p><p>Twelve women in four years. That wasn\u2019t ... terrible. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell any of those women who you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Here comes the biggie. \u201cDo you always have sex with the women who agree to a relationship like this with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d That\u2019s what I expected him to say, but hearing him admit it gives me more of a reality check. I would be added to a list occupied by twelve others before me.</p><p>He sees the reality of it all registering in my head. \u201cDon\u2019t think about the others. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And he wouldn\u2019t think of me either three months from now when he moves on to the woman after me. I\u2019m surprised by how that bothers me. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m cut out for this.\u201d</p><p>He reaches across the table and puts his hand on top of mine. \u201cI won\u2019t feel like a stranger to you for long. You\u2019ll come to know me quickly. And it\u2019ll be the real me, even if you don\u2019t know my name.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m attracted to this man, but I\u2019m not sure I can ever feel comfortable enough to have sex with him when I don\u2019t know his name. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised how quickly our relationship will progress when there are no silly pretenses.

There\u2019s no pressure and it\u2019s ... fantastic.\u201d</p><p>I guess there isn\u2019t any pressure when he knows I\u2019m a sure thing.</p><p>\u201cAre you on birth control?\u201d</p> <p>Damn, he\u2019s no nonsense and doesn\u2019t hesitate in getting right down to business, although I haven\u2019t agreed to any of this. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cGood. We\u2019ll still use condoms. I\u2019m more comfortable with two forms of birth control since none of them are a hundred percent. I don\u2019t want you leaving here with my ankle-biter in your belly.\u201d</p><p>Damn, he\u2019s presumptuous.</p><p>As the child of a single mother, I neither want nor need a child. I catch a rigor thinking about it. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p><p>Casual sex. Can I do this? At least when I was sleeping with Blake, I thought I loved him. As beautiful as he is, I don\u2019t know if I can be intimate with Lachlan when I feel no love for him. Hell, I don\u2019t even know him, but he says I will. And soon, it seems. \u201cIs it difficult to end the relationship when it\u2019s over?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s so casual about the whole thing. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a problem with it. There\u2019s no kind of attachment because we\u2019re not together long enough, and we\u2019re both aware of how things will end.\u201d</p><p>But we wouldn\u2019t be together for three to four weeks like his other relationships. We\u2019d be together for three months. That seems like a big difference to me, but what do I know? I\u2019m not the one who has done this before.</p><p>\u201cSo, in all that time, I wouldn\u2019t meet your friends or family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Meeting those people who are closest to me is too complicated. It would be impossible for you to meet them without learning who I am, and I don\u2019t want the task of lying to them about what we are to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, they\u2019d never know I existed. Of course, that makes sense.\u201d I swallow hard. Am I really thinking of agreeing to this total madness? To becoming someone else\u2019s secret? Haven\u2019t I played that part enough already?</p><p>\u201cAre you accepting? Because it sounds like you are.\u201d His intense blue eyes smolder, begging me to tell him I will be his for the next three months.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying yes yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, you\u2019re not saying no.\u201d</p><p>He wants this badly. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m agreeing to do is spend time with you. We\u2019ll see how things go from there.\u201d</p><p>He beams. \u201cI need something to call you besides Yank or American girl.\u201d</p><p>If I don\u2019t know his real name, he doesn\u2019t deserve to know mine. I try to think on my feet, but it\u2019s hard to come up with an alias I\u2019d like to be called for the next three months. I go with my middle name and my sperm donor\u2019s last name. \u201cPaige Beckett.\u201d</p><p>He reaches across the table and strokes my fingers with his, igniting a swarm of butterflies low in my gut. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you, Paige Beckett.\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p> <p>I already see Paige Beckett isn\u2019t going to make this easy for me. The others never made me wait for an answer. This is something new, but I like the thrill of not knowing. I don\u2019t need to hear her say yes tonight because working to win her over is going to be so much more fun.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are Lachlan who?\u201d</p><p>Everyone knew me as Jack, but my mother called me Jack Henry my whole life, so I go with something that feels familiar. \u201cLachlan Henry.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never used a name so similar to my real one, but I know why this is a first. Being coy with myself is useless; I don\u2019t want to hear her shout another man\u2019s name when I make her come. I want to hear her say my name, or at least some semblance of it.</p><p>I smile as I think about the things I will do to hear her call out my name. \u201cAnd how old are you, Miss Beckett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d There is no way she\u2019s seventeen. I inspect her face, studying it intently, but don\u2019t know what it is I hope to find. Laugh lines maybe?</p><p>She watches my face. \u201cIs my age a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, seventeen is a problem.\u201d I throw my napkin on the table. All of this has been a waste. \u201cForget it all. This whole thing is off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t act seventeen. I\u2019m very mature for my age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. You\u2019re not even old enough to be drinking that wine.\u201d I lean in and whisper so no one will overhear. \u201cI\u2019m almost twice your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. I have daddy issues.\u201d She breaks into a huge grin and I hear a girlish giggle. That\u2019s when I realize she\u2019s fucking with me and has the ability to lie with a straight face. I\u2019ll have to remember that for future reference.</p><p>I\u2019m not amused. \u201cI see I have a comedienne on my hands.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s still smiling, seemingly pleased by my sharp reaction. \u201cI\u2019m not really, but you walked right into that one and I couldn\u2019t resist. Relax, I\u2019m twenty-two, at least until the groundhog comes out in search of his shadow. How old are you?\u201d</p><p>None of the women I\u2019ve been with have been playful like she is. Since I always choose older women, she\u2019s quite a bit younger than what I\u2019m used to. At least fifteen years. Maybe twenty. Will she wonder if I\u2019m too old for her the same way I\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s too young for me? \u201cI\u2019ll be thirty next month. Is that a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I hope to be thirty in about eight years.\u201d</p><p>All right, Jack. You could have your hands full with this one. Are you ready for her and what she could bring?</p><p>\u201cAre you in school or do you have a profession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a musician.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that explains why she sings and plays the guitar so well. \u201cI heard you at the club the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you were there when I sang.\u201d</p><p>I decline telling her I was the guy sitting in the corner being a creepy stalker. \u201cYou\u2019re very good. I\u2019ve never heard \u2018Crash Into Me\u2019 sound quite like that before. I won\u2019t forget it anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>She blushes like she\u2019s not used to hearing compliments. \u201cThank you. It was a pretty big coincidence that we ended up at the same vintage dinner after running into each other at the club.\u201d</p><p>Should I tell her how I worked everything out so I could see her again? Oh, why not? \u201cI don\u2019t think it can be called a coincidence since I already knew you were going to be there. I paid my waitress to find out if you\u2019d be accompanying your friend\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>She gawks at me. \u201cSo, that\u2019s why that waitress was so damn nosy?\u201d</p><p>I smile with pride. \u201cYes, and I arranged for your friend\u2019s wine to be temporarily misplaced so I could lure him away from you. You do realize he\u2019s quite smitten with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a master of manipulation.\u201d</p><p>I notice the way she chooses to not acknowledge my comment about her roommate\u2019s attraction and I wonder if she is well versed in the game of manipulation as well. \u201cI prefer to call it determination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you always that determined to get what you want?\u201d</p><p>I go to extreme measures to have my way, but I think I\u2019ll keep that to myself. \u201cWithin reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain I want to hear anymore about the tactics you use to get what you want.\u201d That\u2019s probably a wise choice.</p><p>I decide to let her choose our new topic of conversation. \u201cSo, what would you like to hear about?\u201d</p><p>She shifts her attention to the glass of wine in her hand. \u201cTell me more about what you do in the wine industry.\u201d</p><p>That is an easy one. I can recite this in my sleep. \u201cMy employer owns a vast majority of the wineries across Australia and New Zealand. You can call me his right-hand man. I travel from vineyard to vineyard to oversee everything from the books to the harvest.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI see. Do you have family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She\u2019s waiting for more of an answer, but I don\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cDo you see them often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI visit when I\u2019m in between vineyards.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a quizzical look. \u201cThis is like pulling teeth with you. I just want to understand you better. I\u2019m not asking you to tell me anything identifying.\u201d</p><p>None of the other women were interested in knowing about my family, so I\u2019m not well prepared for how to answer. \u201cMy oldies live outside Sydney. I have a younger brother. He\u2019s married and has two little girls. I also have a younger sister still living at home. She\u2019s a year younger than you and studies at a culinary institute.\u201d That\u2019s all she\u2019s getting from me. \u201cWhat about your rellies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just my mom and me.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have a father? \u201cWhat about your old man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s not fair of me to ask since I\u2019m unwilling to share much about my family, but I want to know her story. \u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere to be.\u201d</p><p>She looks like she\u2019s settling in for a long explanation. \u201cMy mom was a rising musician when she got pregnant with me. My sperm donor was a famous country music star. They met when my mom signed with his label.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cHe was married so they started having an affair. His wife didn\u2019t take too well to finding out about her husband\u2019s pregnant mistress, especially since she was pregnant too. I have a half-brother I\u2019ve never met and he\u2019s almost the exact same age as I am. Isn\u2019t that charming?\u201d</p><p>She lifts her wine glass to her mouth. \u201cSo, as you can see, I wasn\u2019t joking when I said I had daddy issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you immediately asked me if I was married.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s pushing food around her plate. \u201cIt\u2019s only one of the reasons.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat much. I thought you weren\u2019t scared to eat on a date.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs again. \u201cNervous stomach, you could say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re finished, you want to get out of here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>We leave through the same revolving doors we used the previous night, but under very different circumstances. We stand on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant and Daniel pulls to the curb from across the street where he\u2019s been waiting. He gets out to open the door, but I don\u2019t have a clue where I\u2019d have him drive us since I\u2019m unfamiliar with Wagga Wagga. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night. Do you feel like walking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I tell Daniel, \u201cI\u2019ll call when we\u2019re ready to be picked up.\u201d</p><p>He shuts the door. \u201cOf course, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich way? Lady\u2019s choice.\u201d</p><p>She glances in both directions and shrugs as she points to her right. \u201cAlways go right and you\u2019ll never go wrong.\u201d</p><p>We start walking and I remember the shoes she\u2019s wearing. She looks great in them, but there is no way they will be comfortable for walking. \u201cThose heels are sexy as hell but don\u2019t they hurt your feet?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m used to wearing high heels. I\u2019ll be okay. But it\u2019s very considerate of you to think of my feet.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s being honest. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to be uncomfortable, so please tell me if they hurt and I will call Daniel to pick us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She surprises me by looping her arm through mine. \u201cThank you for the beautiful flowers and breakfast you sent. Addison and I were almost drunk by ten o\u2019clock. It was great.\u201d</p> <p>Flowers and breakfast were nothing compared to what I would give her if she agreed to be with me. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m glad you liked the champagne. What about Australia? Are you enjoying it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it very much, but I can\u2019t get use to the idea of Christmas during summer.\u201d</p><p>I had forgotten December is winter in the US. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought of it being any other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you spend Christmas with your family outside of Sydney?\u201d</p><p>Her questions aren\u2019t identifying, but they still make me uncomfortable. \u201cYes. Everyone gathers at my parents\u2019 on Christmas Eve and we spend Christmas Day together. It makes for an interesting night with my brother\u2019s kids waiting for Santa to come since the oldest is three now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>I can tell she\u2019s an only child. \u201cIt is fun for about two minutes, and then everyone is sick of each other.\u201d</p><p>She stops dead in her tracks and places her palms against the glass window of a store. \u201cLook at that. I think it\u2019s a Martin D-45.\u201d</p> <p>I inspect the guitar on the stand in the window and see nothing special about it. It just looks like any other to me. \u201cI take it that\u2019s good?\u201d</p><p>I think she might be amused by my question when I see her grin. \u201cYes, that\u2019s very good. I\u2019ve dreamed of having one forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gotten one?\u201d</p><p>She gazes into the window and reminds me of a child wishing for a toy at Christmas. \u201cBecause a D-45 costs about twelve grand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you have one if you\u2019re going to be a successful musician?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I need one, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can afford it. I have my mom\u2019s guitar to get me by until I can afford one. It\u2019s older than I am, but it\u2019s still good.\u201d Her hands are still splayed against the storefront glass. \u201cShe\u2019s never told me so, but I think the sperm donor gave it to her. Sometimes I catch her playing it and she looks like she\u2019s been crying.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t kidding about having daddy issues.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a Martin one day,\u201d she sighs as she steps away from the storefront.</p><p>We continue our walk until we come to the next street and I see the sign for Stout Avenue. \u201cThe Blues Club shouldn\u2019t be far from here. You want to swing by and see what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Which way do you think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne way to find out.\u201d I pull out my phone and use an app to find it several blocks to the north. \u201cIt\u2019s six blocks that way.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her foot from one of her shoes and inspects it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can walk six blocks. My heels are starting to rub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you would tell me if they hurt. I don\u2019t want you to be in pain. I\u2019ll call Daniel.\u201d</p><p>She lifts the other foot and inspects it. \u201cWould you think I was weak if I let you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think for one minute there\u2019s anything weak about you.\u201d I spot a bench on the sidewalk. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for him here.\u201d</p><p>While awaiting Daniel\u2019s arrival, we sit on the bench and I reach for her feet. \u201cLet me see what we\u2019ve got going on here.\u201d</p><p>She resists as I try to pull her feet into my lap. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like? I\u2019m going to rub your feet while we wait for Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I don\u2019t have to. I want to.\u201d</p><p>She gives in and twists on the bench to put her feet in my lap. I slip off her shoes and begin rubbing the first foot. \u201cIf you say yes, I will pamper you everyday like a princess.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, clearly not realizing how serious I am. \u201cThat certainly sweetens the offer and makes it more tempting.\u201d</p><p>I slide my palm from her foot up her calf. \u201cI don\u2019t want my offer to be tempting. I want it to be irresistible, so tell me what it will take for you to say yes.\u201d</p><p>She studies me and grins. \u201cI need time, and I need to know you better.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s always guarded, but I\u2019m impatient, so the time she needs for getting to know me is the one thing I don\u2019t want to give her. Doesn\u2019t she understand we can do that after she agrees?</p><p>In a fine example of Daniel\u2019s impeccably wrong timing, he pulls up as I am trying to warm Paige to the idea of us. I slip her shoes back onto her feet. When she stands, I scoop her in my arms and carry her to the car where Daniel is waiting with the opened door.</p><p>Her arms are around my neck and she gives me a disapproving look. \u201cI think this is a little over the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tend to be that way, and you\u2019d do well to remember that. I meant it when I said I didn\u2019t want you in pain and I\u2019d pamper you like a princess.\u201d</p><p>She giggles again like that seventeen-year-old girl she pretended to be earlier. \u201cI think I could\u2019ve managed the few steps it would\u2019ve taken me to get to the car.\u201d</p><p>We slide across the backseat. \u201cThis is me trying to persuade you to say yes, Paige.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you, but it\u2019s quite unnecessary. And I hope you don\u2019t think you\u2019re carrying me from the car into the club because that\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Daniel stops on the street in front of The Blues Club. \u201cI\u2019m not getting out unless I\u2019m walking on my own. No sneaking to scoop me up again. Got it, Jack?\u201d</p><p>I whirl around before I get out of the car. She has called me Jack for a second time. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I get out of the car and offer my hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s standing in front of me and I can\u2019t resist asking, \u201cWhy do you call me Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s something my mom has always said, so I say it too. Sort of like when I asked you if you wanted to dance when we were trying to dodge around each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>We walk into the club and sit at a table close to the stage. There is a full band tonight and I recognize \u201cEvery Breath You Take\u201d by The Police.</p><p>Paige pecks the tabletop with her fingertips to the beat and a waitress comes to our table. We\u2019re sitting right next to the speakers, so she yells out over the music, \u201cWhat can I get for you?\u201d</p><p>Paige smiles and winks at me when she places her order. \u201cI\u2019ll have a screaming orgasm, please.\u201d Hell, yeah. She\u2019ll have plenty of those over the next few months if I have anything to do with it.</p><p>\u201cAnd for you?\u201d</p><p>Interesting drink choice. Interesting enough that I think I might need to try one. I stare at Paige as I call out my order. \u201cI\u2019ll have a screaming orgasm also.\u201d</p><p>I slip out of my jacket and toss it across the empty chair next to me. \u201cDo you always wear a suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do when I have business meetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you had a meeting tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a brief one.\u201d She watches as I loosen the knot of my tie and unfasten the top button of my shirt. I unbutton my sleeves and roll them up on my forearms. \u201cYou don\u2019t like the suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it very much, but I\u2019m curious to see what else you wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess you\u2019ll have to see me again so you can find out.\u201d</p><p>Our waitress returns with our drinks and I pass her my card to start a tab. \u201cI\u2019ll be suitless for the next few days. Would you like to come out to the estate where I\u2019m staying for a visit tomorrow? I\u2019d love to give you a tour of the vineyard.\u201d</p><p>She takes a drink of her screaming orgasm as she watches me over the rim of her glass. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Another yes. It isn\u2019t the one I want, but it\u2019s a start and could lead to the one I\u2019m desperate to hear. \u201cPerfect. If I pick you up around ten, that will give us time to drive back for lunch. Does that work for you?\u201d</p><p>One-on-one time is what I need to persuade her to accept, so tomorrow I will get the yes I so desire.</p><p>7</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>Four screaming orgasms later, which is two more than I usually have, Lachlan and I slide into the backseat of his car. I only make it to the middle of the seat as I glide across, so our legs are touching when he gets in beside me. The only thing separating our skin is the fabric of his trousers, but his touch sends a thrill of excitement throughout my body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Daniel peers at Lachlan through the rearview mirror. \u201cWhere to, sir?\u201d</p><p>He surveys me for an answer. I think he\u2019s hoping I\u2019ll tell him I want to go home with him tonight, but I don\u2019t. I haven\u2019t agreed to this insanity yet.</p><p>\u201cTo Miss Beckett\u2019s,\u201d he tells Daniel.</p> <p>I\u2019m feeling the effects of my four cocktails. Liquid courage pulsates through my veins. I feel brave. And flirty. I put my hand on Lachlan\u2019s thigh and use my fingertip to trace an imaginary infinity symbol. I feel the muscle in his thigh grow taut through his pants. \u201cMr. Henry, does Daniel have any idea what it is you do with the women you keep in your company?\u201d</p><p>Without being asked, Daniel reaches for the control on the radio and increases the volume of the music in the front of the car. I hear \u201cTalk Dirty To Me\u201d for a brief second before he changes the station to classical. Or maybe opera. I\u2019m too buzzed to tell. Either way, I don\u2019t care for it.</p><p>I lean forward. \u201cDaniel. Change it back to Poison.\u201d</p><p>I see him eye his employer in the rearview mirror. Lachlan gives him a curt nod and I hear Bret Michaels singing again.</p><p>\u201cI love this song.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do too, but I\u2019d like it much better if you were singing it to me instead of Poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been known to take requests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I can talk dirty by request anytime.\u201d</p><p>I become hypersensitive to everything about this man. His breathing sounds louder and his scent stronger, so masculine. I love the feel of his leg beneath my finger. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me. Does Daniel know what you do with women?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s dark and I can\u2019t make out his expression. \u201cI pay Daniel to be available when I need him. He isn\u2019t my confidant, so we don\u2019t discuss what I do with the women I date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women you date,\u201d I whisper as I turn to stare out the window. The streetlights flash like strobes as we pass. If I say yes, I will be number thirteen. I can\u2019t imagine that going well. Thirteen is always unlucky.</p> <p>He puts his hand on my knee and heat radiates up my thigh. \u201cI want to know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>His intimate gesture gains my full attention. \u201cI would be number thirteen.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not certain, but I think he\u2019s amused by my observation. \u201cI suppose you would be.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m superstitious. I always have been. \u201cIt\u2019s an unlucky number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it is. I was born on the thirteenth.\u201d</p><p>If I do this, something will go wrong and this man will hurt me. I know it as sure as I\u2019m sitting here next to him feeling how much he makes me want to say yes. \u201cHow can you think it\u2019s possible to have something this hot without one of us getting burned?\u201d</p><p>I see him grin in the darkness. \u201cYou think this thing between us is hot?\u201d</p><p>Daniel pulls to a stop in front of Ben\u2019s apartment building. I don\u2019t reply to Lachlan\u2014it\u2019s never wise to throw fuel on a fire already raging out of control.</p> <p>Daniel opens the door and I get out of the car behind Lachlan. We walk up the sidewalk to the building\u2019s entrance and he shocks me by reaching for my hand. It\u2019s such a sweet and intimate thing to do. \u201cDo you have your own bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Addison and I share the guest room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>What? Did he think I was sharing a bed with Ben? What if I were? He didn\u2019t have a claim on me. Yet. \u201cWhere did you think I was sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea since these apartments are so small. However, I do know your friend\u2019s brother would like nothing better than to have you in his bed. Then again, so would I, so I don\u2019t guess I have room to say much.\u201d</p><p>There he goes again, saying whatever is on his mind. I\u2019m not sure if I should appreciate his honesty or brace myself for whatever might come out of his mouth next. \u201cAre you missing your filter, or is it an Aussie thing to blurt out every inappropriate thought you have?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re standing at the entrance to the building and I sense what\u2019s coming next. I feel it in my bones. And my groin. He\u2019s going to kiss me. And I want him to. Badly.</p><p>But then that isn\u2019t what he does.</p><p>He pushes me until my back is against the building. He pins me with his hips so I\u2019m trapped. There\u2019s no escape\u2014not that I would try. His eyes dart from mine to my mouth, then back up to my eyes. \u201cI say exactly what\u2019s on my mind because I don\u2019t have time for silly games. I told you I don\u2019t do pretenses, and this is me showing you what I mean. I want you to know exactly what\u2019s on my mind.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s unnerving the way his eyes pierce mine. \u201cAnd what\u2019s on your mind right now?\u201d</p><p>His mouth is so close to mine, I feel his warm breath on my lips. \u201cRight now, all I\u2019m thinking about is how I\u2019m going to get you in my bed so I can show you all the ways I can make you come.\u201d</p><p>Umm ... yes, please and thank you.</p><p>He makes me want to get on all fours and crawl like a tigress. I\u2019m burning from the inside out, and he hasn\u2019t even kissed me yet. This man is talented. I wonder what he\u2019d be able to do if we weren\u2019t standing in a very public place.</p><p>He takes my mouth with his hand and squeezes my jaw inward before he rubs his thumb over my lips. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to devour this mouth since the first time I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, why don\u2019t you?\u201d I feel audacious so I issue a challenge. \u201cI dare you.\u201d</p><p>I watch his face as I wait for him to take me up on my invite. Come on, I want you to do it. My chest heaves up and down so hard, I can see it moving in my peripheral vision, and my breathing is embarrassingly loud. I\u2019m stunned by my sudden and unexpected urgency for him. I shove the bells and whistles I hear aside\u2014the ones alerting me to how wrong this is\u2014because I don\u2019t want to heed my subconscious warnings. I only want to feel what this man is offering\u2014to make my fantasies come true.</p><p>The next moment, his lips are on mine and my mouth opens to invite his tongue inside to play. His hand slides from my face to the nape of my neck and pulls me hard against his body, holding me prisoner. Through the thin material of my dress, I can feel how hard he is for me.</p><p>His tongue finds mine and begins a slow, seductive dance. This man knows how to kiss. He has the ability to weaken my knees, and my body is no longer my own to control. It belongs to him, to do with as he wishes. He\u2019s my puppeteer.</p><p>I moan against his mouth and he slides his hands up the bare skin of my back through the opening of my dress. His mouth leaves mine and he drags it across my face to hover over my ear. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to have a naughty with you. You know it\u2019s only a matter of time, and when I do, I\u2019m going to make you come so hard.\u201d</p><p>I hear the catch in my own breath. No one has ever said anything like that to me, even Blake, and Lachlan\u2019s promise pools like pure liquid seduction between my thighs.</p><p>His mouth is hovering over my ear when I hear his husky voice again. \u201cYou want that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I don\u2019t know whose voice I hear, but it sounds nothing like mine\u2014it\u2019s that of a desperate woman.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason you have to be in my bed for me to make you come.\u201d He takes his hand out of the back of my dress. I feel it slide around my waist down toward the spot where I want his touch most. I pant with anticipation.</p><p>I hear the sound of someone clearing his voice and I jump because I\u2019m startled. But Lachlan isn\u2019t\u2014he\u2019s annoyed as he drops his hand from its southern destination. He sighs heavily and inspects the person interrupting us.</p><p>It could have been anyone in the building\u2014or the world\u2014but of course, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s Ben. His voice drips with contempt as he walks past us to the door. \u201cExcuse me. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m embarrassed and don\u2019t know what to say. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. You weren\u2019t interrupting anything.\u201d</p><p>Liar, liar. My pants are so on fire. And so is the rest of me.</p><p>Ben interrupted Lachlan at the very moment he was about to stroke my slut button. Oh, dammit, the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse. \u201cI\u2019d like to introduce you to Lachlan Henry. This is Ben Donavon.\u201d</p><p>They stare at each other for a few seconds and I wait for them to whip out their dicks and start a pissing contest. Wow. The silence isn\u2019t awkward at all.</p><p>Lachlan extends his hand first. \u201cNice to meet you, Ben.\u201d</p><p>Ben takes his hand but doesn\u2019t appear at all pleased about doing so. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize your name, but your face is familiar. Have we met before?\u201d</p><p>Lachlan releases his hand and shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Ben continues to study Lachlan. \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain we have.\u201d</p><p>Lachlan rubs his chin with his palm. \u201cI was at the university\u2019s vintage dinner. That must be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><p>Lachlan shrugs and puts his hands in his pockets. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you, mate.\u201d</p><p>Ben makes no attempt to hide that he wants me away from the opposition. \u201cIf you\u2019re done here, I\u2019ll walk you up.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so not done here. Not even close. \u201cUmm, I\u2019ll be up in a minute.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything as he slings the door open with more force than is necessary.</p><p>Lachlan doesn\u2019t wait for the door to shut before he brings up Ben\u2019s attraction to me again. \u201cThat bloke wants you in a bad way.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to talk about Ben. I want to get back to Lachlan sliding his hand under my dress, so I move closer and put my arms around his shoulders. \u201cWhere were we?\u201d</p><p>He brings his mouth back to mine and tugs on my bottom lip with his teeth. \u201cI will spontaneously combust if we are interrupted again. How about I make good on my promise tomorrow when you come out to the vineyard with me?\u201d</p><p>I want to tell him I\u2019m willing to take the risk, but he\u2019s right. Being interrupted again would blow. \u201cOkay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kisses my forehead and it\u2019s unexpected because it feels affectionate\u2014not at all like the arranged relationship we\u2019re entering into. \u201cI\u2019ll be here to pick you up at ten o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d Breathless and aroused.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no pressure, but my schedule is clear through Thursday evening. I\u2019d really like for you to stay a few days with me at the vineyard. I\u2019m eager to get our stranger anxiety behind us so we can move on to the fun stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t said yes.\u201d That\u2019s me playing hard to get.</p><p>He pulls me close and whispers against my ear. \u201cBut you will.\u201d</p><p>He is one cocky son of a bitch. But an accurate one. Still, I\u2019m not ready to let him in on that little secret. I want him to work for it a little longer. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll think of you until tomorrow.\u201d He kisses my forehead again and I watch him walk to his car.</p><p>This beautiful man has a dark side that draws me in, yet makes me want to run. I\u2019ve never been more certain of anything in my life, and I wonder how I\u2019ve allowed myself to be pulled in.</p> <p>When I walk into the apartment, Ben is nowhere in sight. I guess he\u2019s in his bedroom avoiding me, which is fine. I refuse to feel guilty about having a relationship with someone else. I never led him to believe there was anything between us.</p><p>I go into the bedroom and Addison isn\u2019t home, so I check my phone. She\u2019s sent a text to let me know she\u2019s staying at Zac\u2019s. Good. I hope she stays all night this time.</p><p>8</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>After enjoying a very pleasant evening with Miss Beckett, I\u2019m in bed no more than an hour when I get a call from my right-hand man at the Chalice Vineyard. I immediately sit up, knowing something serious has happened if he\u2019s calling me at this hour. \u201cClyde, what\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to wake you at this hour, Jack, but there\u2019s been a fire at Chalice tonight. It\u2019s under control now, but there\u2019s damage on the south side.\u201d</p> <p>Chalice is my favorite vineyard. My father owned it when I was growing up and I spent a lot of time there as a child with its workers, who are now my employees. As such, they are almost family\u2014their safety is priority. \u201cWas anyone injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo injuries.\u201d</p><p>Thank God no one is hurt. \u201cHave you been able to assess the damage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell because it\u2019s still dark, but it appears to be minimal. We were lucky to catch it when we did. John was awake and saw the blaze from his bedroom window.\u201d It helps that the vines are still green and there\u2019s moisture from a rain we had a couple of days ago. At least we had that in our favor.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell how it started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire chief will be back to inspect it in the morning, but he told me he has reason to believe it was arson. He said he should be able to give us a definite answer tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Arson? That isn\u2019t good.</p><p>I call Daniel to let him know I will be leaving for Sydney within the hour.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have Paige\u2019s number, but I\u2019ll need to let her know of the change in plans. I go into my library and take out the phone I\u2019ve already chosen to give her. I write a quick note and insert it inside the package.</p><p>My next call is to my personal assistant, Jonathan. \u201cIt\u2019s Jack. I\u2019m sorry to call at this hour, but I have a job for you that must be done first thing in the morning. When you come into my office, you\u2019ll find a small brown box on my desk. I need you to deliver it to the recipient by eight in the morning and not a minute later. It\u2019s personal and very important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir. No later than eight.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s little to no traffic on the road so I drive my black Fisker Karma coupe convertible faster than I should as I race toward Chalice. The businessman in me should use the drive to think about how I plan to handle the problem at Chalice, but I have something else on my mind. This something else has long brown hair, big golden-brown eyes, and a body that makes me hard just thinking about it.</p><p>9</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>I wake the next morning to an arm smacking me across my face. Ugh! She\u2019s back again. My vacation from getting smacked around in my sleep is short-lived. I give her a stout shove. \u201cKnock that shit off, Addison.\u201d</p><p>She grunts and flops away from me. Good. I\u2019m safest when she\u2019s facing away from me.</p><p>I hear a loud knock on my bedroom door and Ben\u2019s irritated voice on the other side. \u201cYou have another delivery from him.\u201d</p><p>Addison\u2019s eyes pop open. She stretches like a cat and moans like a porn star. \u201cAnother delivery? Maybe he sent breakfast again. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>I look at the clock and see that it isn\u2019t quite eight o\u2019clock. It was late when he brought me home last night, so how has he managed to have something delivered to me this early?</p><p>I put on my bra because I won\u2019t go free-boobin\u2019 in front of Ben. My robe provides added protection over the pajamas before I investigate what my three-month fling has sent me.</p><p>A small brown package is on the table. I use the scissors to cut into it. Inside I find a new iPhone with a personalized card:</p><p>I have an emergency at one of the vineyards. I\u2019ll be gone most of the day so I\u2019m forced to cancel our plans for today. This phone is your direct line to me\u2014my number is already programmed in. I\u2019ll call you later when the situation is under control and we\u2019ll make plans for a rain check soon. \u2014Lachlan</p><p>I\u2019m surprised by the disappointment I feel. \u201cLachlan has a problem at work, so it seems I\u2019m free for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Zac and Ben are tied up with some kind of project, so I think we should have a girls\u2019 day out and go shopping.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have money for shopping, so I guess I\u2019m browsing. \u201cThat sounds like a great idea.\u201d</p><p>Addison picks up the new iPhone. \u201cWhy did he send you another phone? Doesn\u2019t he know you already have one?\u201d</p><p>The iPhone isn\u2019t a gift. It\u2019s a booty-call device\u2014his means of communicating with me about hooking up while he holds all the control. This is one way he remains untraceable. He\u2019d never give me his real number, so I predict he has one just like this designated only for my calls. That\u2019s what he means when he says it is my direct line to him.</p><p>It\u2019s also a reminder that this relationship isn\u2019t romantic and won\u2019t ever be. It is arranged and temporary. I\u2019d do well to not forget that any time soon.</p><p>\u201cMy phone\u2019s been acting up since we got here. It won\u2019t hold a charge so I guess he thought I needed a new one.\u201d I lie to my best friend because I can\u2019t bring myself to confess the terms of Lachlan\u2019s arrangement. She\u2019ll think he\u2019s bat-shit crazy. And that I am, too, for agreeing to it.</p><p>10</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>I turn the five-hour drive to Chalice into a little more than four. When I arrive, I see Clyde standing outside the office building, waiting for me. \u201cJack, it\u2019s been too long. I\u2019m glad to have you here, but I\u2019d be happier if it wasn\u2019t under these circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Clyde began working for my father at Chalice before I was born and now he works for me. I\u2019ve known him my entire life, so I trust him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I had to drag you out of bed in the middle of the night for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt goes with the territory, Clyde. The good, the bad, and the ugly. This just happens to be a dose of the bad and ugly at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire chief said he would be here at nine, so I expect him any minute.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m anxious to see the burned area. \u201cCan we go out to survey the damage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until he\u2019s finished inspecting it in the daylight. There were a lot of people working to put out the fire, so he doesn\u2019t want any further contamination of the scene.\u201d</p><p>That seems reasonable. I check my watch and see it is a quarter to nine. Paige has gotten my package by now and I have a few minutes before the fire inspector will arrive, so I try out our new means of communication.</p><p>I take out the phone meant only for Paige\u2019s calls and dial her number. She must have had the phone in her hand because she answers on the first ring. \u201cGood mornin\u2019, Mr. Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Miss Beckett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you wondering how I knew it was you?\u201d I could hear the amusement in her voice.</p><p>\u201cCould it possibly be because I\u2019m the person who sent you the phone and I\u2019m the only person with the number? Or because my name came up on the caller ID?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cNone of the above.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, huh?\u201d Though I\u2019d been in a hurry before leaving this morning, I had taken the time to program a personalized ringtone. \u201cMaybe it was the \u2018Talk Dirty to Me\u2019 ringtone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the more likely reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiked that, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much so. You deserve extra points for that.\u201d</p><p>So, she\u2019s keeping score? \u201cI was unaware of the extra point system. What does a personalized ringtone earn me, Miss Beckett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t chosen a reward system yet, but I\u2019ll let you know once I decide.\u201d</p><p>She has another decision I am way more interested in than a points-and-reward system. \u201cPlease do. I might want to work harder on earning extra points if the reward is worth the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy prize is always worth the effort, Mr. Henry. Have you solved your problem at the vineyard yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no. There was a fire last night so the imminent danger is over, but I\u2019m waiting for the fire inspector to come out so he can tell us what happened. I\u2019ll be tied up with this mess most of the day. Since it\u2019s a four- to five-hour drive, I won\u2019t be back until late. I was hoping to get a rain check on our plans, possibly tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019ll have to check my social calendar. It seems to be pretty full at the moment.\u201d She hesitates. \u201cLooks like I can work you in.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if I\u2019ll ever get used to her playfulness. \u201cSame plan? Pick you up at ten?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>I see a vehicle coming up the drive and assume it\u2019s the fire inspector. Good. He\u2019s early. I\u2019m ready to be done with this so I can get back to Avalon. Back to Paige. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>We end our call and I meet the inspector outside my office. He explains the evidence he\u2019ll be collecting and how it\u2019ll be used in the investigation. I follow him to the site and stay out of his way as he gathers the proof of someone trying to burn my vineyard.</p> <p>Seeing the damage is painful, but I remind myself of how it could\u2019ve been much worse if any of my people had been injured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending this evidence for testing because I have to, but I don\u2019t need the results to tell you this was arson. There\u2019s accelerant all over the scene, so you might want to be thinking about who your enemies are. They could try this again.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to think about it; I know who did this. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>I walk the investigator back to his car and then go into my office where Clyde is waiting to hear the verdict. He\u2019s sitting in one of the chairs across from my desk, so I walk around and fall into an exhausted slump in my leather chair. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t need to see the results from the evidence to know it was arson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea who would want to do something like that?\u201d</p> <p>We went back a long way, but I couldn\u2019t tell Clyde about the knee-deep shit I\u2019d gotten myself into, so I lie to the man I thought of as a second father. \u201cNo. You have any suspicions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that pops into my head would be a competitor, but they wouldn\u2019t have struck this early in the season or after a rain. That is amateur work.\u201d</p><p>Or the work of a sociopath trying to get my attention.</p><p>11</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>During our girls\u2019 day shopping spree, Addison and I visit a lingerie shop at a plaza of boutiques near Ben\u2019s apartment. They have everything from naughty to nice, including a wide variety of sex toys.</p> <p>Addison couldn\u2019t be happier as she admires a Santa-themed bra with matching panties and garter belt complete with the red and white candy cane-striped thigh-highs. She stands in front of a mirror and holds it up to herself. \u201cDamn, Zac would have a very merry Christmas if I were wearing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Christmas, what are the plans? Are we cooking at the apartment?\u201d</p><p>She twists so I can\u2019t see her face and it\u2019s my first clue that something is going on. \u201cUmm, about that.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s my second clue. When she stutters and stalls, it\u2019s never good. \u201cWhat exactly does \u2018umm, about that\u2019 mean?\u201d</p><p>She has this please don\u2019t be pissed off look on her face. So, what do I do? I get pissed off. \u201cDon\u2019t freak out, but Zac wants to take me home with him for Christmas so I can meet his family.\u201d</p><p>Worst. Friend. Ever. \u201cAddison! You\u2019re not leaving me by myself with Ben. You know how he\u2019s been with me since I met Lachlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave you alone with him. Both of you are invited to Zac\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>No freakin\u2019 way. \u201cYou and Ben can go without me. I\u2019d rather spend Christmas by myself than be uncomfortable around a bunch of people I don\u2019t know.\u201d She knows I hate feeling like I\u2019m imposing. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s asked me to do this.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Lachlan will invite you home with him?\u201d This is Addison\u2019s way of trying to feel better about ditching me.</p><p>That would be a negative. \u201cDefinitely not. We just met.\u201d</p><p>She puts her hands on her hips as though I\u2019ve offended her. \u201cWhy do you say it like that?\u201d</p><p>Maybe because I don\u2019t even know his real name\u2014that would be my first reason. \u201cWe don\u2019t know each other well enough to spend the holidays together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t known Zac much longer than you\u2019ve known Lachlan.\u201d</p><p>Maybe not, but she\u2019d been banging him since the day we arrived. Okay, it was day three. \u201cYou and Zac are different. You\u2019ve spent almost every minute together since we got here. I\u2019ve only been out with Lachlan on a couple of dates. It\u2019s apples and oranges.\u201d</p><p>She holds the sexy Santa lingerie out for me. \u201cWear this for him and I guarantee you\u2019ll get an invite to his family\u2019s for the holidays. Maybe even a marriage proposal.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve gotten all the proposals I need from Mr. Lachlan Henry. I\u2019m still debating the one currently on the table. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to get an invite to his family\u2019s house. Or a marriage proposal.\u201d I take the red and white furry lingerie from her and admire it in the mirror. \u201cHe\u2019s asked me to spend the next few days with him. And nights. Maybe I need this. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you\u2019d be staying over at his place. That sounds more serious than a couple of dates.\u201d</p><p>I hang up the Santa outfit and pull a naughty-elf set from the rack. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He asked, but I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d That\u2019s another lie. I know I\u2019m staying with him, but I don\u2019t want to sound like a ho, so I pretend I\u2019m unsure. And I pretend like I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll buy this lingerie. But that\u2019s a lie too.</p><p>I hear fear is a gift. In the event that it\u2019s true, I\u2019m very gifted today. I\u2019m almost shaking as I wait for Lachlan to arrive.</p><p>My phone starts singing \u201cTalk Dirty to Me,\u201d so I answer and try to sound like I\u2019m not a bundle of nerves. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you. I\u2019m almost at your place. Do I need to come to the door to challenge lover boy for your hand?\u201d</p><p>That might be the case if Ben were here, but he\u2019s not. Thank goodness. \u201cI\u2019m the only one here. I\u2019m ready so I\u2019ll come down and meet you.\u201d I hang up and slip my Lachlan issued cell into my purse next to my own. I grab my floral duffle and lock up.</p><p>As I come out of the apartment building, Lachlan steps out of a fancy-ass convertible wearing faded jeans and a khaki button-up. It\u2019s not dressy; it\u2019s rugged, more like what I\u2019d expect someone to wear in the outback. And I\u2019ll be damned if he\u2019s not wearing an Indiana Jones hat. Even out of a suit, he\u2019s hotter than the devil\u2019s ass.</p><p>This is going to be a great couple of days.</p><p>He meets me halfway on the sidewalk. \u201cNo suit today, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs promised.\u201d</p><p>One promise kept. We\u2019ll see if he keeps his other.</p><p>\u201cI see you have a bag.\u201d He grins and kisses my cheek as he reaches to take my bag from me.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m staying.\u201d That\u2019s such a lie. I wonder if he can tell by looking at me.</p><p>He cocks his head. \u201cAn overnight bag doesn\u2019t mean the same thing in the US as it does in Australia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one means I like to be prepared just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels heavy to me, like you\u2019re prepared to stay a couple of nights.\u201d He reaches for my hand and holds it as we walk to the car. This is him getting an early start on ridding us of our stranger anxiety.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see how things go.\u201d</p><p>He pops the trunk and puts my things inside the sporty, and very expensive, black convertible. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a car like this before. What kind is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Fisker Karma Sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that before. It\u2019s ... stunning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He opens the door for me. I get in and watch his beautiful form walk around to the driver\u2019s side. Let\u2019s be honest. Who wouldn\u2019t agree to a three-month fling with this man?</p><p>I know I\u2019m going to agree. And he knows it too. He\u2019s said as much, but I can\u2019t let him think I\u2019m giving in so easily.</p><p>He starts the car. It has a deep roar. \u201cTop up or down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown, but let me grab a ponytail holder out of my purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some in the glove compartment.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s only a ponytail holder, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m wearing anything belonging to number one through twelve. He reaches over to open it and notices my expression. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to wear another woman\u2019s undies. My little sister has long hair and she likes to ride with the top down. She keeps a stash in there.\u201d</p><p>Nice recovery.</p><p>I take the holder from him and pull my hair up, wondering if he\u2019s bullshitting me about his sister. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>The drive to the vineyard outside Wagga Wagga is beautiful. We pass mile after mile of grapes on the way to the house and as we get closer, I see a traditional old-world-style mansion in the distance. It looks Italian, not Australian, but then I\u2019m not really sure what I think constitutes Australian architecture. \u201cMiss Beckett, this is Avalon Vineyard.\u201d</p><p>Wow. It\u2019s incredible. \u201cYour boss must think a lot of you if he puts you up in a place this nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>When we get out of the car, Lachlan walks around to the trunk. He lifts his brow as he asks, \u201cSince you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re staying, does your bag go inside or remain in the trunk?\u201d</p><p>He is dying to hear my confirmation, but I\u2019m not finished having fun with this little game. \u201cUmm ... I think it\u2019s fine to take it inside to one of the guest rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re pretending you might say no.\u201d</p><p>Because this is your game. These are your rules. I need to feel like I have control over some aspect of it, even if it\u2019s only for a little while.</p><p>Our first stop is the kitchen. It\u2019s beautiful and fitting for the house, like one of those grand Italian kitchens from a luxury home magazine. At least, that\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve ever seen anything like it.</p><p>There\u2019s a basket of goodies on the counter, so I walk over and peek inside. It\u2019s filled with an assortment of food, and of course, a bottle of wine. \u201cVery nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take the credit. Mrs. Porcelli packed the lunch for us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Mrs. Porcelli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does my cooking and housekeeping.\u201d</p><p>How odd. His employer pays him enough to employ someone to do his cooking and cleaning. \u201cWill I meet her or does she fall into the friend/family/identifying information category?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided, but it won\u2019t be today because she\u2019s already gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s gone home for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right. Christmas is only a few days away. \u201cSo she doesn\u2019t live in Wagga Wagga, either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I employ her the same way I do Daniel. They go where I go.\u201d</p> <p>They go everywhere with him. How much does it cost to have employees like that? I can\u2019t imagine it being cheap. \u201cDaniel is on holiday as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. All the vineyard employees are gone until Monday, so it\u2019s just the two of us. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Was that supposed to scare me? \u201cSo, no one\u2019s around to hear my screams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re catching on. Come with me and I\u2019ll show you the rest of the house.\u201d</p><p>We enter the living room and there is a beautiful black baby grand in the corner. I\u2019m in love. \u201cYou play?\u201d</p><p>He laughs at my assumption. \u201cNot a note.\u201d</p> <p>I walk over and stroke the ivory keys. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe interior designer thought it would be a pretty piece to take up some of the void since the room is so big.\u201d</p><p>I toy with the keys, playing the chorus of a song I\u2019d been working on before I left home. Its tune is perfect.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame it never gets played. I\u2019m hoping it will get some use over the next few months.\u201d The piano isn\u2019t the only thing he hopes will get some action. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear you play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I say as I run my hand down the keys and walk away, even though I\u2019m dying to sit down and put it to use. There\u2019ll be plenty of time for that later. Three months to be exact.</p><p>\u201cThe bedrooms are this way.\u201d I follow him down the hall and he uses the tour to inform me that the previous owner, who died in a freak accident, now haunts the room I will be sleeping in.</p><p>Nice one. He wishes he could pull one over on me like that.</p><p>\u201cI usually get along with ghosts and poltergeists pretty well, so I should be fine.\u201d</p> <p>He takes me across the hall. \u201cIf you decide to stay in the guest room and get scared in that big lonely bed all by yourself, this is where you\u2019ll find me.\u201d</p><p>His bedroom is gender neutral and contemporary. The bedding is a modern geometric pattern of mostly gray and white with yellow and black accents. Everything from the flooring to the ceiling coordinates. The bedroom is aesthetically appealing, but there\u2019s nothing romantic about it, so it matches our relationship perfectly.</p><p>Every room in the house is spotless, and I wonder if it is Mrs. Porcelli\u2019s doing or if he likes things orderly because he is some kind of neat freak.</p><p>I think we are finished with the tour of the house, but he takes me to one more room we haven\u2019t visited. \u201cLast stop.\u201d</p><p>He opens the door to a room with wall-to-wall mirrors. The floor is covered with different kinds of exercise equipment, some I\u2019ve never seen before. \u201cGee, someone likes to see himself while he works out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe previous owner had a ballerina in the family and this was her studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. That\u2019s a little more acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to use this gym any time you want. It has surround sound for music or you can watch the idiot box.\u201d He points to a cabinet against the wall. \u201cThe flat screen and receiver are in there. It has Bluetooth so you can play your own music or you can stream anything you like.\u201d</p><p>There he goes assuming again. \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to stay long enough to need a workout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve not given me an answer, that still remains to be seen.\u201d</p><p>I walk over to an elliptical and step up. I make a few strides. \u201cI exercise at home, but this isn\u2019t what I do. Exercise equipment bores me.\u201d</p><p>He wiggles his eyebrows. \u201cSo what is your kind of workout?\u201d</p><p>I slow the speed of my stride on the machine. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be like that, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>I think for a minute, trying to decide if I want to tell him. \u201cI dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancing is great exercise.\u201d</p><p>I pick up speed again and stare straight ahead. I don\u2019t want to see his face when I tell him. \u201cI pole dance.\u201d</p><p>Yep. That got his attention. \u201cPole dance? You mean, like a stripper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t do it the way you\u2019re imagining. It\u2019s a beautiful art form when it\u2019s done tastefully. I do it because I like it, and it\u2019s a hell of a workout. Very strenuous. You use muscles you didn\u2019t know you had. You\u2019d be surprised what\u2019s sore the next day.\u201d I didn\u2019t look at him, but I knew he was smirking.</p><p>He walks around to stand in front of me and I look down at him from the elliptical. \u201cYou only do it for exercise?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah. No one knows I take lessons except my instructor and classmates. And now you.\u201d</p><p>He licks his lips and rubs them together. \u201cJust when I thought you couldn\u2019t get any hotter, you go and tell me something like this and prove me wrong.\u201d</p><p>I lift a brow at him. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you done it?\u201d</p><p>Hmm, I started my first year of college. \u201cI guess it\u2019s been about ... four years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be pretty good if you\u2019ve done it for that long.\u201d</p><p>I shrug because I\u2019ve never been one to brag, but I\u2019m damn good at it. \u201cI guess. My background in gymnastics doesn\u2019t hurt, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGymnastics too,\u201d he laughs. \u201cSo you\u2019ve never danced on a stage in fuck-me pumps for a bunch of horny bastards?\u201d</p><p>I think I just threw up in my mouth a little. \u201cYou say that like you\u2019re pretty familiar with the scene.\u201d</p><p>He holds up his hand. \u201cI\u2019m pleading the Fifth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an American amendment. It doesn\u2019t work for Australians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did you.\u201d</p><p>He has a huge grin. \u201cI may have seen a stripper on a pole once. Maybe twice.\u201d</p><p>Damn liar.</p><p>I stop the elliptical and sigh loudly, as though he is wearing me down. \u201cYes and no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes to what and no to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never danced on stage for horny bastards. But yes, I wear fuck-me pumps when I dance on the pole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, you\u2019re bloody hot in my book. What am I going to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the answer to that question still remains to be seen, now doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>I\u2019m installing a pole in this gym. ASAP.</p><p>We have to stop talking about pole dancing and anything containing the term fuck me in it before I bend her over my weight bench. I put my hands in my pockets to disguise the hard-on our conversation has triggered. \u201cAre you hungry? Good. Me too. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She laughs as she steps down from the elliptical. I suspect she knows what she\u2019s done to me. \u201cIs something wrong, Lachlan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m a bit peckish and ready for a bite of lunch.\u201d</p><p>My hands are still in my pockets when we start to walk out of the gym. She loops her arm through mine as we walk toward the door. \u201cMe, too. Where are we going for our picnic?\u201d</p><p>Her touch only adds fuel to the flame in my jeans. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided. I thought we\u2019d ride out on the ATV and pick a spot together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>We swing back through the kitchen to pick up the basket of food and wine before we head out across the vineyard. I drive out to the middle of the property and stop when I find a somewhat flat grassy area about a mile from the house. \u201cWhat do you think of this spot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe view is gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>We get off the ATV and spread a blanket across the ground. We sit next to each other with the basket between us and she helps me spread the food. \u201cTell me how you got into the wine business.\u201d</p><p>A little truth with a splash of lies on the side. \u201cI guess you could say I was born into it. This is what my dad did for a living before he retired, so it\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it makes you happy? I mean, the traveling and being away from your family?\u201d</p><p>The cork pops loudly from the bottle of Shiraz. I take a glass from the basket and fill it with wine. \u201cI\u2019m paid quite well to like it. Besides, I get to meet interesting people such as yourself during my travels, so what\u2019s not to like?\u201d</p><p>Paige takes the offered glass. \u201cBut what about having a family? Don\u2019t you want a wife and children?\u201d</p><p>I stifle my laugh. \u201cI decided a long time ago I would never marry.\u201d</p><p>I watch her as she holds the glass up to inspect the color of the vino before she smells it. She\u2019s a fast learner. \u201cMaybe the right woman hasn\u2019t come along and stolen your heart.\u201d</p><p>I hope she isn\u2019t suggesting she is the right woman because she\u2019d be wrong. There is no right woman for this kind of life. \u201cNo wife wants to be the center of her husband\u2019s world on a part-time basis, and that\u2019s what a marriage with me would be like.\u201d</p><p>She takes a small drink, waits for the aftertaste, and then smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s good. At least I think it is.\u201d</p><p>I take a small drink. \u201cI\u2019ve had better and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here\u2014to make this vineyard one of the best.\u201d</p><p>She reaches for a cheese cube and cracker. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let your job keep you from having a family if it\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>So we are back to that again. \u201cI watched my mom raise three kids in my dad\u2019s absence. Don\u2019t get me wrong. My dad is great, but he was never home. I\u2019m not doing that to a wife and kids. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d Wow, where did that come from? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very selfless way of thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat only proves you don\u2019t know me. I assure you I\u2019m anything but selfless.\u201d I don\u2019t want to talk about myself anymore. She makes me afraid I will slip and say too much. I\u2019m not used to so many personal questions. \u201cWhat about Paige Beckett? Does she see a band of gold in her future?\u201d</p><p>She gets that twinkle in her eye like most women have when they think about weddings and babies. \u201cI want to get married and have children one day.\u201d</p> <p>She finishes making a sanger from the fresh bread and deli meat and passes it to me. \u201cChildren? That must mean you want more than one ankle-biter, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely. I want at least two because it sucks being an only child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be hard to juggle with a music career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I had all the details worked out, but there\u2019s plenty of time for that.\u201d She holds her arms out toward the rows of vines. \u201cI want to know more about this.\u201d</p><p>I tell her about the vineyard, the grapes, and explain winemaking while we eat. She watches my face, truly interested and mesmerized by the process, which is unlike the other women I\u2019ve been with. They weren\u2019t interested in me\u2014only what I could do for them. Except for one.</p> <p>She has no idea, but this is a huge stretch for me. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve brought one of my companions to any of my homes on the vineyard. The remote distance from town doesn\u2019t leave me much choice, but I feel comfortable bringing her here since she isn\u2019t from Australia and won\u2019t be showing up on my doorstep six months from now.</p><p>After we finish eating, I stand and reach for her hands to help her up. \u201cCome with me. There\u2019s something I want to show you. I think you\u2019ll like it very much.\u201d</p><p>We pack the remains of our picnic and drive toward the property behind the house. I park the ATV outside a pair of large ornate wooden doors leading to the storage area for the wine.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a wine cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s where wine is stored.\u201d I reach for her hand and help her from the ATV. \u201cCome on. I can tell that you\u2019re going to appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>I open one of the doors to the cave and lead her inside to see the products of my livelihood. She\u2019s mesmerized as her eyes study everything from the stonework dome over our heads to the rows of wine barrels lining each room. \u201cThis is ... incredible. How was it built?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dug out of the ground like a basement and a frame is constructed to keep it from caving in from the weight of the ground around it.\u201d</p><p>She notices the ceiling. \u201cThe stone arches are gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>The arches aren\u2019t the only beautiful thing in this room. The dim glow of the lanterns dances across her face as she studies her surroundings, and I have no doubt that the next three months are going to be spectacular. But first, she has to tell me yes.</p><p>She is going to say yes. I\u2019m going to see to it.</p><p>I follow her into the next room where the special events are held and she explores like a curious child. She sees the tables and is about to ask for an explanation, but I don\u2019t want to talk anymore. I want to feel her against me again. I\u2019m eager to finish what I started two nights ago.</p><p>She\u2019s surveying the long dining hall table when I creep up behind her. \u201cWhy is there a ... oh.\u201d</p> <p>I slide one of my arms around her waist and pull her back against me. With my free arm, I push her hair over one shoulder. I press my lips to the exposed skin on her neck and trail kisses toward her ear. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it any longer. I need to touch you.\u201d</p><p>She leans against me and laces her fingers through my hand on her waist. This is her way of showing me that she\u2019ll welcome more of what I\u2019m doing. I sneak my hand under the hem of her shirt and glide it upward until my palm finds her lace-clad breast. I feel her nipple grow hard through the lace as I slowly stroke it. I push my hand inside the cup of her bra from the top so I can free it from its entrapment.</p><p>She moans softly and grinds herself against my groin as I gently knead her breasts. \u201cI think I have a promise to made good on, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer but nods in agreement.</p><p>I slide my hand down her flat stomach and feel a piercing in her navel. I make a mental note to investigate that later, but I have other plans in mind for right now.</p><p>I tug on the button at her waist to unfasten her shorts. It opens after a light jerk and I slowly slide the zipper down. I put my hand flat against her stomach and rub it in a circular motion, each rotation bringing my fingers closer to the spot she so desperately wants me to touch.</p><p>I slip my hand inside the top of her lacy panties. I smile against her neck when I feel the smooth skin beneath. \u201cYou have no idea how much I like that.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head up and back against me. Her breathing is deep and fast. I have her right where I want her, so I slide my finger down through her slickness and back up once in a slow, torturous stroke. She likes it and wants more because she\u2019s pushing her hips hard against my hand. \u201cPaige, you haven\u2019t given me an answer yet.\u201d</p><p>I hear a sweet, delicate whimper from her mouth. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t accepted my proposal.\u201d I slide my finger downward again and then slowly back up until I feel the little swollen button where I rub in a circular motion. \u201cI want you to tell me yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhh ... what? I can\u2019t think straight right now.\u201d</p><p>I stop the circular pleasure I\u2019m giving her and my fingers retreat because I\u2019m determined to hear her say it. I don\u2019t want to wait any longer. \u201cTell me you\u2019ll be mine while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She reaches for my wrist and pushes my hand further inside her panties. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>I give her a few more soft strokes before I come to a standstill again. \u201cGive me the answer I want to hear and I\u2019ll keep going.\u201d</p><p>She rocks against my hand, riding it hard. \u201cThat feels so good. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s desperate for my touch, so I use her need to get my answer a little earlier than she intended on giving it to me. She\u2019s trembling under my touch and I give her a few more strokes. \u201cTell me, Paige. Tell me you\u2019ll be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes to what?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s squeezing my forearm. Hard. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be yours while I\u2019m in Australia.\u201d</p><p>I smile against her neck again. \u201cThat\u2019s all I needed to hear.\u201d</p><p>I want to show her how happy she\u2019s made me. I pull my hand from her shorts and she whimpers at the loss of my touch, but it\u2019s only temporary.</p><p>I turn her around to face me. She watches my eyes as I place my hands on her hips and push her shorts and panties down to her feet. I lift her onto the table. \u201cLie back.\u201d</p><p>She knows what\u2019s coming and she welcomes it.</p><p>I put my lips against her inner thigh and place a kiss against her scalding skin. \u201cTell me again. I like hearing you say it.\u201d</p><p>I trail kisses up her inner thighs, waiting to hear her say it again so I can show her what being mine means.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she moans and I reward her for her acceptance. I place my tongue flat against her center and give her one slow upward swipe before I find her small, engorged bump and begin circling it. She tastes so good, even better than I\u2019d imagined.</p><p>I feel her reach for my hair and fist it, so I know I\u2019m right where I need to be. I lick and suck her until her screams echo from every wall inside the cave. When she stops screaming, she\u2019s statuesque across the dining table.</p><p>Good thing everyone\u2019s gone for the next several days if she screams that loud every time she comes.</p><p>I crawl up her body, kissing it as I go until we\u2019re face to face. She\u2019s breathing heavily and appears dazed. She blinks several times to focus on my face. A smile spreads and I\u2019m relieved to see that she\u2019s not angry with me about the tactics I used to get her answer.</p><p>I place a kiss against her mouth and smile because I know this is only the beginning. \u201cYou won\u2019t regret saying yes.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>I lie on my back, naked from my waist down, across an ornate dining table and stare up at the ceiling. I\u2019m lightheaded and dazed during my postorgasmic bliss. Drunk almost. I\u2019m no innocent virgin, but this is new for me. Blake never made me feel like that, not that he ever tried.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to think about him. I won\u2019t let him ruin anything else for me.</p><p>I feel Lachlan kissing his way up my body and it takes a minute before I\u2019m able to focus on him when he hovers above me. I see his smile and I know he\u2019s pleased with my acceptance of his proposal. He didn\u2019t play fairly, but he got what he wanted from me. That\u2019s something I\u2019ll need to remember in the future.</p><p>I wait for the sound of his zipper sliding down, but it doesn\u2019t come. Instead, I hear him tell me how I won\u2019t regret saying yes and I can\u2019t argue because I know he\u2019s right. The next three months are going to be extraordinary.</p><p>I find my voice and whisper, \u201cCaveman.\u201d That\u2019s going to be my nickname for him.</p><p>He throws his head back laughing and I join in soon after. He\u2019s so beautiful when he smiles. The happiness in his dazzling blue eyes is unmistakable. I\u2019m elated because it\u2019s all for me; I\u2019m the one making him beam, and I couldn\u2019t be happier about that.</p><p>He lowers his face to my neck and nuzzles it with his nose. I know he\u2019s smelling me because I hear his long, deep intake of air followed by a sigh. \u201cA caveman. You think that\u2019s what I am, huh?\u201d</p><p>I feel the warm rush of his breath against my skin and chills cover my body. \u201cYou definitely have caveman tendencies.\u201d</p><p>He places a kiss against my neck and I lift my chin so he can have full access. \u201cYou don\u2019t like my tendencies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only helping you say yes,\u201d he reminds me, as if he\u2019s afraid I have forgotten my agreement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was coerced by a caveman,\u201d I laugh. My laughter is cut off by my sharp intake of air when he runs his hand up my shirt to my naked nipple. He rolls it between his fingers and I feel it pebble from his touch all over again.</p><p>He sucks my earlobe and it\u2019s a reminder of how it felt to have his mouth between my legs. He whispers against my ear. \u201cBut you\u2019re not taking it back, are you?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s coercing me again, but in a different way. He doesn\u2019t realize it, but it\u2019s unnecessary. Paige Beckett already belongs to him.</p> <p>I think about how much fun his persuasion might be if I tell him I recant. I don\u2019t mind his way of compelling me, but I decide it\u2019s better to not push my luck since he warned me he gets what he wants. He claims to use reasonable means, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true after what he just did to me to get a simple yes. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not taking it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s what I hoped you say.\u201d His mouth leaves my neck and he pushes himself up to stand. His touch is gone too soon and I suppress a whimper. He takes my hands in his and helps me from the table.</p><p>I stand wearing nothing from the waist down in front of him, and I feel vulnerable, even though I know this won\u2019t be the last time I\u2019m naked with this man. The thought makes me want to do my happy dance, but I decide to save it for later when I\u2019m alone.</p><p>He picks up my panties and shorts from the stone floor and holds them out for me to step into, like an adult dressing a toddler. I balance by holding his shoulders, and he leans forward and inhales deeply before he places a kiss against my smooth mound. He makes me want to fall back across the table to have a second round, but I resist because I know he has other plans for me.</p><p>He pulls my panties and shorts up, and I\u2019m frightened by how well I know this place I shouldn\u2019t go. This man will be hazardous for my heart if I allow it. He\u2019ll use me up if I let him. I know this without a doubt and remind myself of a lesson well learned not so long ago. Never confuse sex for love.</p> <p>Right now, we\u2019re black and white, but I vow that the second it becomes a hazy shade of cold steel gray, I will get out. No question about it.</p><p>He kisses my mouth as I fasten my shorts. I wonder if he does it because he\u2019s curious to see my reaction\u2014if I\u2019ll kiss him back after he\u2019s had his mouth between my legs. I kiss him hard and he smiles.</p><p>\u201cTake a walk with me.\u201d He clutches my hand and leads me through the maze of rooms toward the cave\u2019s exit. I\u2019m a little disappointed to leave and I hope he brings me back here again soon. I\u2019m quite fond of his caveman ways.</p><p>We walk between two rows of vine-covered trellises that stretch as far as the eye can see. He\u2019s quiet, but simply walking next to him is peaceful. My mind isn\u2019t spinning in search of our next topic of conversation\u2014for some reason, not talking is okay. Simply being next to him is enough to keep me content and that\u2019s when I realize what is happening. He is right about this relationship. We feel relaxed with each other because there are no pretenses.</p><p>I\u2019m his for the next three months and I\u2019m prepared for what that means. It\u2019s clear he has boundaries, and he\u2019s told me what he expects from me. I\u2019m stoked about my sudden epiphany and stop dead in my tracks. \u201cThis relationship ... I get it now. I get why it works.\u201d</p><p>He smiles but still asks me for an explanation. \u201cTell me what you get.\u201d</p> <p>I think he wants to hear me say the words, and I\u2019m okay with that. \u201cBecause we have no pretenses and clear expectations, I don\u2019t feel pressured to be anything but me. I have no worries about what today, tomorrow, or next month means for us because I already know.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for my face and strokes his thumbs over my cheeks. He\u2019s beaming as he watches my eyes. \u201cYou get it full circle now\u2014what I want and need from you.\u201d</p><p>I see how delighted he is and I realize something. Pleasing this man brings me pleasure. Common sense tells me I should be frightened by that, but for some reason, I\u2019m not.</p><p>We go back to the cave after our walk and he drives us back to the house. I think about the things he has planned for tonight. I know he has something in mind because this man doesn\u2019t fly by the seat of his pants. He\u2019s done this enough to be calculating, his every move premeditated.</p><p>We get to the house and he drops me off by the door while he parks the ATV. I take the picnic basket to the counter to unload it and put the dirty dishes and utensils in the dishwasher. Any other time, I suspect Lachlan would leave the mess for Mrs. Porcelli. Since she isn\u2019t here, I make it my job.</p><p>When he enters the kitchen, I\u2019m loading the last of the dishes into the dishwasher. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but now it\u2019s done and we don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d</p><p>He opens the refrigerator and takes out two bottles of beer. He twists the tops off and pushes one across the counter to me. It\u2019s an unexpected surprise, but I guess it\u2019s presumptuous of me to think he only drinks wine. \u201cHave a coldie with me.\u201d</p> <p>Wine drinking is a lot of work. Beer drinking is more my speed. I reach for the amber bottle and sip without holding it up to the light or sniffing it. I don\u2019t swish it in my mouth to judge its aftertaste. I simply drink and enjoy it because that\u2019s all you have to do.</p><p>I check out the label and see it\u2019s an Australian brand. I like it and it goes down smoothly. \u201cNothin\u2019 like an ice cold beer.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for my free hand and tugs on it. \u201cCome into the living room with me so we can talk and relax.\u201d I follow him and we sit side by side on the couch. He\u2019s close enough that his leg brushes mine and I feel like a teenager all over again. The simple touch thrills me beyond belief. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about bailing on you yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I understand that it wasn\u2019t your choice.\u201d</p><p>He rests his free hand on my bare thigh and begins to work my muscle like a professional masseur. \u201cWhat did you end up doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAddison and I went shopping, which was probably the wrong thing to do considering Christmas is in three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you buy anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few things.\u201d I smile when I think of the lingerie. I didn\u2019t know if it would get any use when I decided to blow my budget by buying it, but now I\u2019m certain it will, and I can\u2019t wait.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in town long, but Wagga Wagga doesn\u2019t seem to have a lot of great places to shop.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. The shopping choices aren\u2019t great. I\u2019m used to Nashville. It\u2019s home to all the biggest country stars so places to shop are endless. \u201cIt\u2019s a little limited when compared to what I\u2019m used to.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s stroking my leg as he talks about Wagga Wagga, but I zone out for a minute because I\u2019m remembering what he did to me in the cave. I hear him saying something about Sydney and I force myself back into the conversation just in time to hear his invitation. \u201cI have tickets for Madama Butterfly in February in Sydney. Will you go with me and let me take you shopping?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s asking me to make plans with him two months from now, and I realize this relationship gives me the ability to accept his offer without worry about what will happen between now and then. \u201cSure, that sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>He probably thinks I like opera because I\u2019m a musician, but he\u2019d be wrong. I\u2019m not a fan, but I don\u2019t tell him this because he seems happy about taking me.</p><p>We finish our beers and have two more while we talk about everything and nothing at the same time. He tells me more about his life, but he\u2019s guarded and I wonder if he\u2019s telling me half-truths.</p><p>I hear \u201cJolene\u201d by Dolly Parton playing inside my purse. It\u2019s my mom\u2019s ringtone and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s wise to talk to her after having a few beers, but I decide I should probably answer since I\u2019ve only spoken to her once since I arrived in Australia.</p><p>I reach for my purse and apologize to Lachlan. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This is my mom calling, so I should probably answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>I take out my singing phone and I\u2019m reminded of the one Lachlan sent me. Neither of us has brought it up yet. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s appropriate to thank him for it or not. It\u2019s a weird situation. Not thanking him feels rude, so I\u2019ll think that one over later. Right now, I have to talk to Jolie Prescott.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl. I haven\u2019t heard from you in a few days. I\u2019ve been worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you shouldn\u2019t worry. Everything is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how am I supposed to know these things if I don\u2019t hear from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right and I\u2019m sorry. I should have called already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you having fun in the land down under?\u201d</p><p>Umm, yes. A lot. I delight in the source of my fun today and he holds up his empty beer bottle and waggles his eyebrows. He\u2019s asking me if I want another one, and I nod. He takes my empty bottle and I admire the incredible view as he walks away. He\u2019s been in a suit the other times we were together, so this is the first opportunity I\u2019ve had to see how great his ass looks in jeans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having lots of fun, Mom. Australia is great so far.\u201d</p><p>She gives me an update on the things I\u2019ve missed in Nashville this week and then I hear her exhale a long breath. That\u2019s when I know there\u2019s a reason behind her call. \u201cHave you thought any more about what we discussed before you left?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s called me to bring this up again. She isn\u2019t going to take no for an answer. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve told you, I\u2019m not doing that and I\u2019m not going to change my mind. Please stop asking.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong. My mom is a good woman, but she is approaching the point of obsession with my career and it\u2019s exhausting. \u201cYour father owes you, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I owe it to myself to make it on my own. When I look back on this years from now, I want to be proud of what I\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLaurelyn Paige, you are Jake Beckett\u2019s daughter and you should use that to your advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m Jolie Prescott\u2019s daughter, and I\u2019ll make my own way. I\u2019m done talking about this. I love you, Mom, but I\u2019ve gotta go. I\u2019ll call you next week.\u201d</p><p>I hang up as Lachlan reenters the living room. \u201cEverything okay with your mum?\u201d</p><p>Mum. It\u2019s so cute the way he says it. \u201cAs good as it can be. She can be difficult at times.\u201d</p><p>He passes me a beer. \u201cDid she give you a hard time?\u201d</p><p>A hard time is an understatement. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>No one besides my mother and grandparents know my father is a huge country music star. It\u2019s a secret I\u2019m forced to keep from everyone I know, but I don\u2019t have to do that with Lachlan. He doesn\u2019t know my true identity so that makes him my one exception. \u201cShe wants me to threaten my sperm donor with going public about my paternity in exchange for him getting me a record deal.\u201d</p><p>That sounds so much worse when I say it out loud and I feel the need to defend her, even if she is wrong. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t think my mom is a terrible person. She\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Lachlan scoots closer to me and puts his arm around my shoulders. He props his feet on the coffee table and I can tell he\u2019s prepared to talk and listen as long as I want. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s a terrible person. She only wants to see her daughter succeed, but the right way of achieving that has become blurred through her eyes.\u201d</p><p>We talk a long while and then go into the kitchen to continue our conversation over Mrs. Porcelli\u2019s reheated chicken casserole. I know nothing about her or their working relationship, but something tells me she has a soft spot in her heart for her employer. I picture a gray-haired woman who loves Lachlan like a son, but then a different notion strikes me. Perhaps she\u2019s younger than I imagine and is secretly in love with him.</p><p>We finish eating and thoughts of Mrs. Porcelli fade from my mind as we clear our dishes. When I finish, I\u2019m drying my hands when he approaches me from behind and kisses my neck as he slides his hands around my waist. I think he likes doing that\u2014surprising me\u2014and I imagine him liking other things from behind.</p><p>He pushes my hair away from my neck so he can place kisses there and I tilt my head to the side. When he\u2019s done, he reaches for my face and turns it toward him so I\u2019m peering at him over my shoulder. He presses his erection against my bottom and kisses the corner of my mouth. He wants me. Badly. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about getting you into my bed all day, and now I\u2019m done thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>He takes my hand and pulls me toward the bedroom. I happily follow because I\u2019m ready for this. I\u2019m anxious to begin what he has predicted as the best three months of my life. So far, he hasn\u2019t disappointed me.</p><p>We walk into the bedroom and I see my overnight bag on his bed. I wonder when he moved it from the guest room, but I don\u2019t ask because it doesn\u2019t matter. We both know I was never going to sleep in any other bed than his. That\u2019s isn\u2019t why I\u2019m here.</p><p>We stand in the middle of the bedroom facing each other and he cradles my face with his hands as he kisses my mouth. His tongue moves slowly in a wave against mine and I melt against him.</p><p>He stops kissing me but doesn\u2019t pull away. I feel his mouth move against mine when he speaks. \u201cDo you need a minute?\u201d</p><p>His inquiry makes me question if he snooped in my bag and saw the lingerie, but I don\u2019t care. There are no pretenses here. We both know what\u2019s about to happen. The only question is which set of lingerie I\u2019ll be wearing when it does.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a quick kiss. \u201cDon\u2019t be long. I\u2019m anxious to get you under me.\u201d</p><p>We haven\u2019t spent a lot of time together but I can tell that he likes to say things like that. He\u2019s already proven he\u2019s a man who speaks his mind. I bet he talks dirty in bed. I hope so.</p><p>I grab my bag and head into the bathroom. I quickly undress and try to decide which lingerie to wear. The naughty Christmas set is on top, but I\u2019m saving it for tomorrow night.</p> <p>I go with the sheer black lace baby-doll and matching panties\u2014it\u2019s naughty, yet somehow innocent at the same time. Something tells me Lachlan will like having it both ways. When I\u2019m dressed and ready for him, I fluff my hair and finish myself off with body spray as I inspect the final product in the mirror. I feel every beat of my heart in my flushed face, but I\u2019m not nervous. I want this man and everything he has planned for me.</p><p>I stop just inside the doorway. This no-pretense thing makes me brave, so I don\u2019t go to him right away. I feel playful, still a little buzzed from the alcohol. I want to tease him, so I put my hand on my hip and lean into the doorframe, supporting myself with a raised hand. The hunger in his eyes tells me everything his mouth doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s dying to have me.</p><p>He grins and sweet seduction oozes from him. I melt to a puddle on the floor because I know what he\u2019s about to do with that mouth; he\u2019s going to use it to make me come.</p><p>He watches as I walk to where he\u2019s standing by the bed. When I reach him, he twirls his finger in a circle. \u201cTurn around for me.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if he means all the way around because he wants to see the full view or because he wants my back turned to him. I know he likes to touch me from behind so I circle slowly, deciding he\u2019ll stop me if that\u2019s the way he wants me.</p><p>I make a full spin before he drops to his knees in front of me. He pushes my gown up above my hipbones. My panties are riding low and he kisses my stomach before he runs his tongue over the jeweled piercing through my belly button. \u201cThis was very unexpected today. I like it.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on top of his head and run my fingers through his thick, dark hair as he kisses each of my hipbones above the elastic waist of my panties. No man has ever knelt before me and explored my body like this. On one hand, it\u2019s unsettling. On the other, it\u2019s hot as hell and has me drenching wet.</p><p>He hooks his fingers in my black lace panties and drags them down my legs. I have to use his shoulders to balance myself as I step out of them because my head is spinning so hard from everything he\u2019s doing to me.</p><p>He tosses them aside and runs his hands up the back of my legs, starting at my ankles until he cups my cheeks and pulls me against his face. His mouth is almost right where I crave it, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how badly I yearn for it to be on me.</p><p>He gazes up at me. He smiles when his eyes meet mine and we don\u2019t break contact as he leans forward to lick me in one long stroke. I\u2019m shocked, but not by the feel of his tongue. It\u2019s the sight of seeing him do that to me. I think he wants me to watch the show.</p><p>\u201cSit on the bed.\u201d I do as I\u2019m told because I\u2019m afraid not to.</p><p>I sit farther back than he wants me to, so he grabs my legs behind my bent knees and pulls me until I\u2019m barely on the edge. He takes my feet and places them on the rails and pushes my legs apart. \u201cDon\u2019t lie back. I think you\u2019ll enjoy the visual.\u201d</p><p>Oh, fuck me running! Or on the edge of your bed using your mouth. I watch his head dip between my legs. He uses his tongue to lick me up and down before it circles the place throbbing with need for his attention. He pushes his thumb inside me and glides it in and out while his tongue works its magic. In little to no time at all, he takes me to that place\u2014the one where a little is too much, yet never enough, and I\u2019m close to coming undone.</p><p>It\u2019s that spot right there. As I\u2019m sending him the telepathic message, he receives it and gives me exactly what I need to finish. Once the rush of pure pleasure starts, I can\u2019t stifle the incoherent garble escaping my mouth. I fist his hair and pull his mouth harder against me.</p><p>I feel a new sensation\u2014tiny quivers deep inside as I spiral down from the place Lachlan has taken me. I come to my senses and realize I\u2019m still fisting his hair. I let go and know I should apologize, but I can\u2019t find the coherency required to speak.</p><p>My legs are quivering, boneless appendages in the aftermath and I think my knees will buckle if I try to stand. I look at Lachlan to make sure I didn\u2019t smother him when I slammed his face between my legs. He\u2019s peering up at me. \u201cYou are so damn beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m expressing gratitude for the compliment or the supernatural orgasm he just bestowed upon me. I don\u2019t have time to iron it out because he kicks off his shoes and strips his shirt over his head without unbuttoning it.</p><p>He\u2019s the beautiful one\u2014soft and hard in all the right places. He wastes no time in ridding himself of his jeans and boxer briefs. He\u2019s anxious to fuck me. And I\u2019m anxious to be fucked, but first I want to return the favor he has gifted me with twice.</p><p>He sees me get off the bed and knows I\u2019m about to drop to my knees, so he stops me. \u201cNot this time. I need to be in control or I\u2019ll blow as soon as your mouth touches me.\u201d Yeah, I sort of know the feeling.</p><p>He spins us around and sits on the bed. He needs the control, but I see what else he wants, so I climb up to straddle him. He rubs his thumbs over my nipples through my nightie and I hear him suck air through his teeth when I grind against him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ve got to have you right now.\u201d</p><p>He loops one arm around my waist and I hang on to him as he leans forward to get a condom from his nightstand drawer. When he sits on the bed again, he lets go of my waist and leans back. He tears the square package open with his teeth and rolls the condom on in one quick motion. I look down because I want to watch, but I\u2019m too late because he\u2019s so fast.</p><p>I feel his hands on each of my hips and I\u2019m flipped onto my back. He uses his legs to push mine apart and he positions his erection against the very wet center between my legs. He bites his bottom lip and shakes his head as he groans, \u201cPaige, I\u2019m about to fuck you so hard. You have no idea.\u201d</p><p>And then he drives into me with one smooth motion\u2014hard, just like he promised. Or threatened. I suppress the surprise behind my lips and the noise I make comes out sounding like a moan. He pulls back with deliberate leisure and it feels like he\u2019s going to slide out completely, but then he thrusts into me again even harder. He does this several times and I realize what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s pacing himself because he wants this to last as long as possible. And so do I. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m surprised when he reaches for my feet and brings them up to his shoulders so he can get deeper inside me. It\u2019s slow paced, but every stroke is deliberate. And oh so powerful. Nothing he does to me is unintentional.</p><p>He finds his voice between thrusts. \u201cYou. Feel. So. Damn. Good.\u201d</p><p>But all good things must come to an end, and this does too when everything inside my pelvis tenses and the sensation radiates down my thighs and curls my toes.</p> <p>Literally.</p><p>14</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>When I feel Paige spasm around my cock, it sets my undoing into motion. I watch her face as I thrust into her one last time and I discover something about her. I already knew she was beautiful, but she\u2019s even more so when she comes.</p><p>I\u2019m propped on my elbows and still inside Paige when I lower my face to kiss her. This is where I want to be right now. Inside her. And it\u2019s where I intend on being quite a bit over the next three months.</p> <p>This is the part where things always get messy in regular relationships. This is when women want to talk about love and commitment, but not Paige; we aren\u2019t like that, so I can relax.</p><p>I kiss her again and then pull out. She frowns at the loss. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The caveman will be right back.\u201d</p><p>I hear her laugh as I go into the bathroom to throw the condom in the trash. I pull it off and tie it in a knot before I give it a toss. I hate them, but they\u2019re a necessity in any sexual relationship outside of a monogamous marriage.</p><p>I walk back to the bed and Paige has no reluctance about ogling me. There\u2019s no shame in her game and it\u2019s a turn-on to see her almost salivating as she gapes at my body. I work hard for it, so I enjoy the pleasure I see in her eyes as she\u2019s admiring it. \u201cYou might as well be the devil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re the one holding the apple.\u201d I slide into bed next to her and she immediately climbs over and straddles me. She slides her hands from my pecs, down to my abs, and then up again. She leans forward and runs her tongue over each of my nipples before she glides down my body. Her legs move from my outer hips to between my thighs as she migrates south. She\u2019s slow about going down because she\u2019s giving me the time I need to get hard again.</p><p>I know she\u2019s about to take me in her mouth. I wait for it and then I feel a warm rush of breath on me. She runs her soft, wet tongue over my tip and I twitch in response. It\u2019s been a long time since anyone has done this for me. Too long.</p> <p>When she finishes licking me from base to tip, I can\u2019t silence the groan that comes out when she takes me completely in her mouth. Damn. This isn\u2019t going to take long because this woman has mad oral skills.</p><p>I run my fingers through her hair while she sucks me off, and I tap the top of her head when I\u2019m about to erupt. She doesn\u2019t stop and I wonder if Americans don\u2019t know about the universally known signal to stop, so I tap her again. \u201cI\u2019m about to come, Paige.\u201d</p><p>She sucks harder and that\u2019s when I realize she has no intention of stopping. It shocks me because no woman has ever let me come in her mouth. Damn, it\u2019s hot.</p><p>I\u2019m about to explode and I hear myself grunt, \u201cOoh, shit,\u201d as I flex my hips up to Paige\u2019s mouth. When I\u2019m done, she licks one last time and then peers up at me with a mischievous grin and laughs. \u201cMmm. Tastes like chicken.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m laughing after a blowjob. Those two things aren\u2019t supposed to go together, but I see they do with her. I think the odds of her killing me with sex are good, but what a way to go. At least I\u2019ll die happy.</p><p>When I wake the next morning, I feel very rested and I know it\u2019s the great sex. It\u2019s always like a sleeping pill for me.</p><p>Paige is asleep on her stomach, the sheet scrunched down over her perfect little ass. I can\u2019t help but study the arch of her back. Some men love asses. Some, tits. I love the curvature of a woman\u2019s back, especially the part at the small of her waist where it dips in.</p><p>And Paige\u2019s dip is beautiful. It\u2019s so deep I could drink from it. Maybe I\u2019ll do that sometime.</p> <p>I push the sheet away so I can better see the slope of her back. I\u2019m relieved when I don\u2019t find a tattoo in my favorite spot because that ruins the beauty of it for me. I don\u2019t think she has any tattoos, and the only piercing I\u2019ve found besides her ears is the dangling jewel in her navel. I don\u2019t mind that one at all.</p><p>I can\u2019t resist putting my fingertips against her upper back and slowly following her spine downward. Her skin is so soft and smooth. So perfect. And I can\u2019t wait to have her from behind.</p><p>She stirs a little so I lift my fingertips because I don\u2019t want to wake her. I place a butterfly kiss against the skin of her lower back and then leave her to sleep.</p><p>I get the newspaper and have my first cup of coffee at the bar in the kitchen. Nothing of much interest in the headlines\u2014mostly last-minute Christmas deals.</p><p>Christmas is in two days. I smile when I think of the delivery Paige will get from me while I\u2019m at my parents\u2019 house in Sydney. I\u2019m a little sad I won\u2019t be with her when she opens it. I\u2019d love to see her face.</p><p>I\u2019m on my second cup when Paige sneaks up behind me. She steals my MO when she snakes her arms around my waist and kisses the side of my neck. Her lips are warm and wet against my skin. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>I turn my face toward her and kiss the corner of her mouth. \u201cAnd good morning to you. Want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>She inspects my cup. \u201cHmm ... I guess not. I only drink flavored coffee with lots of creamer and sweetener. It ends up being dessert by the time I add everything I like. I\u2019ll take some juice if you have any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have orange juice.\u201d</p><p>She walks around the bar and goes for the cabinet above the dishwasher. \u201cGlasses?\u201d</p><p>She almost guesses right. \u201cThe one to the right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wanted to wait for you so we could eat together.\u201d</p><p>She waltzes over to the fridge and takes inventory. She\u2019s wearing the khaki shirt I stripped off and tossed to the floor last night. It hits her high on her thighs and when she bends over to see what\u2019s on the bottom shelf of the fridge, I see her black lace panties peeking out just below the hem.</p><p>I love having a woman in my life again.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Porcelli stocked the refrigerator well before she left. Want me to cook something?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want her to think I brought her here to be my cook or housekeeper. \u201cI don\u2019t mind eating a bagel or cereal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no gourmet chef like your sister.\u201d She stands with the door open, searching another minute while she sips her juice. \u201cWhat about an egg and bacon sandwich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sanger for brekkie sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sanger for brekkie,\u201d she repeats (with her southern accent I find so charming) as she pulls out the bacon and eggs and sets to work. It doesn\u2019t take her long to prepare our breakfast and so far, so good. We\u2019re finishing up when I hear my phone ring in the living room. I dash to catch it before it stops ringing.</p><p>It\u2019s my mum. I wouldn\u2019t answer except I know she\u2019ll keep calling until she gets me. We haven\u2019t spoken in a few days, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019s calling to finalize plans for Christmas Eve. \u201cHello, Mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Jack Henry. How\u2019s everything at Avalon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings couldn\u2019t be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh?\u201d</p><p>I walk into the kitchen and Paige is clearing our breakfast dishes. I walk over to her and whisper, \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019ll get it. You did the cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d Damn. My mum has sonar ears. That\u2019s why I never got away with anything as a kid.</p><p>\u201cI have a guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA female guest?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s going to love this. \u201cYes, Mum. It\u2019s a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have spent the night if she\u2019s at your house this time of the morning. I can\u2019t believe you have a girlfriend you haven\u2019t told me about. Are you bringing her home with you for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to meet her, son.\u201d</p><p>Of course she does. \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of relationship.\u201d</p><p>I hear her huff. Really? My mum huffed at me. \u201cAnd it never will be if you just said that in front of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe understands.\u201d It\u2019s you who doesn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cTrust me. She doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I try to steer her in a different direction. \u201cI think you were calling to touch base with me about your plans for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Everyone will be here around five, and we\u2019ll eat at six.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have to tell me this. It\u2019s the same every year. \u201cOkay, Mum. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, consider bringing her. It would make me very happy.\u201d Wrong. What she and I are doing wouldn\u2019t make you happy at all.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou break my heart, but I still love you, son. Be careful driving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Love you too.\u201d</p><p>When I hang up, I feel like I need to apologize to Paige for talking about her while she\u2019s standing right in front of me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry about.\u201d</p><p>The old girl thinks it\u2019s a tragedy to be almost thirty and unmarried without any prospects. She wants to marry me off to a wife who will start pushing out babies before our first anniversary, like my brother\u2019s wife did.</p><p>Not. Gonna. Happen. Hell will freeze over first.</p><p>I help finish the dishes and then we\u2019re free. \u201cI\u2019m going to work out. Want to join me?\u201d</p><p>She frowns and shrugs. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring the right kind of shoes or clothes for working out. Plus, you don\u2019t have the right kind of equipment for what I do, so I think I\u2019ll take a shower and get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I\u2019m installing a pole in the gym.\u201d Or maybe the bedroom. I haven\u2019t decided.</p><p>She smiles and dismisses my statement with the wave of her hand as she walks toward the bedroom. \u201cYeah, yeah.

Somewhere not too far in the back of my mind I hope Lachlan joins me, but I don\u2019t expect him to. He\u2019ll be working out for a while. No one has a body like that without spending a lot of time in the gym.</p><p>The hot water feels glorious\u2014I\u2019m a little sore today. Because of my usual workout regimen, it\u2019s hard to put me in many positions that will stress my muscles, so props to Lachlan for achieving that.</p><p>When I finish in the shower, I linger a little longer. Just in case. When he doesn\u2019t come into the shower with me, I\u2019m a little disappointed, but I don\u2019t dwell on it. We have until he leaves for his parents\u2019 house tomorrow.</p><p>I get ready and dress casually since I think we\u2019re staying at the vineyard today. I guess I should\u2019ve asked, but I didn\u2019t, so I choose faded denim shorts and a solid ivory tank. Maybe it\u2019s a little over the top, but I finish the ensemble off with my brown cowgirl boots.</p> <p>I\u2019m braiding my hair when he comes into the bathroom and we both smile when our eyes meet in the mirror. He\u2019s shirtless and glistening with sweat. Damn, if I hadn\u2019t just showered. \u201cSomeone had a productive workout.\u201d</p><p>He stands with his hands on his hips, a towel thrown over one shoulder. \u201cI did, thanks to you. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about yesterday and last night, so time got away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look very happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I wanted to catch you still in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stayed in a long time because I was hoping you would, but you didn\u2019t, so I gave up on you.\u201d</p><p>He walks toward me and I hold up a hand to stop him. \u201cNope. Too late now, caveman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Later then.\u201d He smiles and drops his sweaty bottoms to the floor before he kicks them toward a hamper and gets into the shower. Steam immediately billows into the space. \u201cI have some vines I need to check today. Do you want to go out with me to see how they\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to. There\u2019s not a problem, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m going out to check.\u201d</p><p>It feels like a sauna in here and I have to get out. How can he stand the water so hot after a workout? \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll wait for you in the living room.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m watching some kind of Australian Christmas special when he plops on the couch beside me. He\u2019s wearing khaki cargo pants and a fitted navy V-neck T-shirt. I can see a few sparse hairs peeking over the V\u2019s point, but I know there\u2019s more underneath and think about how I ran my hands over them last night.</p><p>Oh, my. He\u2019s a fine specimen of a man. Very fine indeed.</p><p>He puts his hand on my leg and massages it. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever you are.\u201d</p> <p>He stops by the refrigerator as we pass through and grabs a couple of bottled waters. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a hot one and we could be gone for a while. It\u2019s probably not a bad idea to take a cold drink.\u201d</p><p>He grabs his Indiana Jones hat from the hook as we\u2019re on our way out the door. I shake my head because I can\u2019t believe the good-looking suit can also be rugged sexiness on a stick. No man should be this desirable.</p><p>I follow him to the ATV garage and he gases up before we drive out to what must be the edge of the property. He parks and walks over to a vine, lifting it for inspection. He puts his hand up and motions for me. \u201cCome here, Paige. I want to show you this.\u201d</p><p>I walk over and he points to a section on the vine. \u201cI came to this vineyard for a very specific reason. The acidity of the soil and this particular type of grape are no longer compatible. The quality of the grapes is deteriorating. That means the quality of the wine is as well, so I\u2019m grafting a different variety onto the existing rootstock. If it doesn\u2019t reject the change, there will be a more compatible grape growing on these vines within two years.\u201d</p><p>The process sounds similar to skin grafting. \u201cIs it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still too early to tell, but it\u2019s doing well so far.\u201d</p><p>He releases the vine and we walk back to the ATV. \u201cI\u2019ve never really thought about all that goes into making wine. It seems like it\u2019s a very complicated and demanding business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see why your boss pays you well. You\u2019re very good at what you do. Did you learn all of this at the university where Ben attends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I learned from growing up around it and then I went to another university to learn what I needed to know about the business part of the industry, but that\u2019s been many moons ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you think you\u2019re so much older than I am.\u201d</p><p>He studies me like he\u2019s searching my eyes for something. \u201cI\u2019m eight years older.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at him. \u201cIt\u2019s seven, but whatever. I don\u2019t mind. I have daddy issues, remember?\u201d</p><p>He leans over and kisses my mouth. \u201cYes. How can I forget that, my sweet young thing?\u201d</p><p>We make several stops throughout the vineyard so Lachlan can inspect more grafts. He seems pleased with everything he sees, so I know he\u2019ll be able to leave the vineyard for the holidays without worry.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will you be leaving tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mum wants me at the house by five, so I guess I\u2019ll drive you back before lunch. What are your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAddison has invited me to Zac\u2019s house with her and Ben, but I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friends are going to leave you by yourself on Christmas? That\u2019s shitty.\u201d</p><p>He has no idea how much I agree. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay. I rather be alone than with a house full of strangers.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like the pity in his eyes. It\u2019s something I spent my whole childhood seeing and it makes me more uncomfortable as an adult, so I change the subject and hope he doesn\u2019t bring it up again.</p><p>We return to the house for lunch and then go back out onto the vineyard. I don\u2019t think Lachlan had the intention of working all day, but he sees how content I am to be outdoors, so we ramble on the ATV until late evening.</p><p>When the sun begins to drop from the sky, we go in for an early dinner. We\u2019re both pretty quiet while we eat, but we share a lot of smiles and knowing grins because we\u2019re anxious for what tonight will bring.</p><p>We\u2019re cleaning the kitchen together when Lachlan makes his signature move and comes up behind me. Why does he love doing that so much?</p><p>He grabs my hips and drags my bottom against him. He grinds against me and I can feel how hard he is. \u201cGo get ready. I\u2019ll finish up the kitchen and meet you in the bedroom in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>He kisses my neck and lets me go. I have to hurry because he isn\u2019t giving me long, so I scramble to the bathroom with my bag.</p><p>I\u2019m excited for this\u2014for him\u2014as I quickly freshen up before slipping into my naughty little Santa-themed lingerie. I think it\u2019s been a little longer than five minutes when I hear him call out from the bedroom. \u201cTime\u2019s up, Miss Beckett. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>I call out from inside the bathroom. \u201cSit on the bed and close your eyes. No peeking. I\u2019ll know if you do.\u201d</p><p>I open the door and see him sitting on the bed, eyes closed. \u201cAnd just how will you know if I peek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I always know when you\u2019ve been naughty.\u201d</p><p>I walk out into the room in the red lingerie with white fur trim and candy cane-striped thigh-highs. With hands on my hips, I say, \u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d</p><p>He does as I tell him and when he sees me, he breaks into a smile. It\u2019s all for me and no one else. \u201cI have a gift for you if you\u2019ve been a good little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I\u2019ve been naughty?\u201d</p><p>I stroll toward him. \u201cYou\u2019ll still get a present.\u201d</p><p>We reach for each other at the same time and he brings his mouth down hard on mine. It\u2019s almost painful, but I rejoice inside because it\u2019s the way I want it tonight. Rough and raw.</p><p>He quickly spins us around and shoves me backwards onto the bed. He strips his shirt over his head and I enjoy the show from where I\u2019m lying on the bed. \u201cGet on your stomach.\u201d</p><p>I flip over and hear the sound of his zipper, then that of the opening drawer. Boo. I\u2019m missing that part again.</p><p>I feel the bed dip and he crawls over me from behind. Hot skin is all I feel against my back. He\u2019s naked. And wanting, obvious from the hardness pressed against my thigh.</p><p>I\u2019ve come to expect him to push my hair from my shoulders, and he does. He puts his lips on the skin of my neck and then slowly moves to my shoulder. He grazes his teeth over it while his hands are all over me at once. I\u2019m squirming beneath him, chills erupting over my entire body. He continues to travel downward until his mouth reaches the band of my panties. He hooks his fingers inside and tugs. I lift my hips up from the bed a little so he can get them down.</p><p>When my panties are off and tossed aside, he unfastens my bra. He puts his palm flat against the small of my back and strokes it before his hand drops to my cheeks. I\u2019m afraid because I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do. I\u2019ve never done that before, and I don\u2019t think I want to.</p><p>I\u2019m face down, but I feel his hand creep around to my stomach and then down between my legs until he\u2019s stroking me in that delightful place. I temporarily forget my fear because all I feel is longing for more of what he\u2019s doing. I must have it. I\u2019ll explode with it or without it, but for two completely different reasons.</p><p>I feel him prodding me from behind, searching blindly for his way inside me, and I\u2019m back to thinking of his intent. I decide it doesn\u2019t matter. He can do anything to me as long as his fingers don\u2019t stop what they\u2019re doing right now.</p><p>He pushes my knees apart with his and then glides into the familiar place. I admit I\u2019m relieved, but I don\u2019t have time to think about it for long before he\u2019s directing me. \u201cSit up and lean back against me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I push myself up and then shift backwards until I\u2019m sitting on him with my knees spread apart. He grips my hips and begins to guide me up and down. This is a new position for me. Shit, I\u2019ve never felt so full.</p><p>He returns his fingers to my pleasureland as he fills me from behind. It\u2019s absurd how good he makes me feel.</p><p>When he sees he no longer has to guide my movement, he uses his free hand to palm one of my breasts. It\u2019s too many sensations to withstand at once. I\u2019m on the ledge, about to fall. Or jump. I\u2019m not sure which, and then I hear his possessive words through gritted teeth and it sends me over the edge. \u201cNo one else touches you. Only me. Do you understand?\u201d</p> <p>The quaking starts in my core and I don\u2019t answer him because I can\u2019t find my voice. I\u2019m too entangled in the flood of ecstasy to speak. I ride him harder as the waves of pleasure begin because I\u2019ll die if I don\u2019t. He squeezes my nipple hard and the sensation radiates down between my legs to finish me off. \u201cTell me you understand.\u201d</p><p>My hands grip the top of his thighs and I squeeze hard. My answer comes out as a scream. \u201cYes! I understand!\u201d</p><p>I fall forward onto my stomach with exhaustion and he collapses with me on top of my back. His weight pushes me into the mattress and he\u2019s breathing heavily against my ear. \u201cI won\u2019t share you with anyone.\u201d</p><p>His words remind me of my initial thoughts about him. Lachlan Henry\u2019s world is a dark place I know nothing about. I think it frightens me, but it\u2019s too late now. I\u2019m a part of it, no matter what it is.</p><p>16</p> <p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>I feel it in the way she\u2019s trembling and it has nothing to do with her orgasm. I\u2019ve been too aggressive with her. Now I need to show her I can be gentle.</p><p>I lift myself from Paige\u2019s body and kneel between her legs from behind. I kiss the dip in her lower back and taste the salty moisture created during our sexual frenzy. It\u2019s another way I love to taste this sweet girl.</p><p>I glide my hands from her waist to her shoulders and begin massaging her tense muscles. It takes a few minutes, but I feel her eventually relax under my touch and I contemplate how to justify my possessive outburst.</p><p>I could say that I don\u2019t know where my irrational demand came from, but that would be a lie. There should\u2019ve been no room for anything in my head other than how good it felt to be inside her, but something else slipped into my thoughts. Someone else\u2014Ben Donavon. I can\u2019t believe I let that little bastard get into my head. He wants what\u2019s mine and I\u2019m forced to deliver her to him tomorrow. She might as well be served on a silver platter.</p><p>For two days, I\u2019ll be in Sydney and she\u2019ll be with him in his apartment. They might find themselves alone. That\u2019s when shit happens.</p> <p>I might have gone about it poorly, but I want to be clear with Paige; she is mine while she\u2019s in Australia. I won\u2019t share her with Ben Donavon or any other dick.</p><p>I lean forward to kiss her shoulder and then skim my nose across the nape of her neck. She smells so good\u2014all fruit, sweat, and pheromones. Lots of pheromones. If I keep sniffing her, I could get sidetracked from what I need to do.</p><p>I place the side of my face against the center of her back and leave it there while I try to regain some of the footing I may have lost over my less-than-gentle treatment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I was too aggressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were pretty intense.\u201d She peers at me over her shoulder. \u201cBut I never said I was opposed to intense.\u201d I feel her words rumble against my ear pressed to her body. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m a little confused about what you said.\u201d</p><p>I roll off her and lie on my side. She does the same and props her head in her hand. She pokes her lips out at me as she mocks me in a husky tone. \u201cYou look so serious.\u201d</p><p>I am. Dead serious. \u201cWe may only be together for a few months, but you\u2019re mine while you\u2019re here. I won\u2019t share you with Ben Donavon or any other man.\u201d</p><p>I see the confusion on her face. \u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. I\u2019m going to sound like such a chick. \u201cYou live with him.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s giving me that duh, really? look that my little sister gives me. Women must be born with that special talent. \u201cAnd you knew that when we met. You didn\u2019t just figure that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I have to take you back to him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The realization clicks in her head and she understands. \u201cYou\u2019re not relinquishing custody of me to Ben. You\u2019re taking me to the place where I stay with my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich happens to belong to a man who wants you in his bed.\u201d I didn\u2019t see it before, but it\u2019s become clear to me. Now that I\u2019ve had Paige in my bed, her residency at Ben Donavon\u2019s is going to be a problem for me.</p><p>She shrugs, as if she couldn\u2019t care less. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he wants me or not. I don\u2019t want him.\u201d She gets up and straddles me. \u201cBut I do want you.\u201d</p><p>She is going to use sex to distract me from this conversation. I\u2019ll allow it\u2014this time.</p><p>It\u2019s Christmas Eve morning. When I wake, I see Paige asleep on her stomach again. I\u2019m learning things about her. She\u2019s a stomach sleeper. She doesn\u2019t want to cuddle when it\u2019s time to sleep. And she likes her space in the bed. All these thing are fine by me.</p><p>Instead of getting up to have coffee and read the paper, I stay in bed. I want to be next to her when she wakes because I\u2019m going to have her again before I take her back. I want to be freshly on her skin and inside her when she returns to him.</p><p>My American girl isn\u2019t a morning person. She likes to sleep in, so I get to lie next to her, studying her form for almost an hour before she wakes. I\u2019m on the verge of going back to sleep when I feel her roll in my direction. My eyes spring open and she\u2019s staring at me.</p><p>Hmm. The watcher becomes the watched.</p><p>She laces her fingers together across my chest and props her chin on top of her hands. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>I lift my head and kiss the top of her hair. \u201cGood morning to you, sleepyhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be called the sleepyhead if I\u2019m the one who catches you sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting an hour for you to wake up, lazy bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what kept you in bed instead of getting up to have your morning coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m inside her twice before we leave the vineyard, once in the bed and again in the shower. As I drive her to the apartment, I chastise myself for not being more adventurous and having her throughout the house since all of the staff was gone. It would\u2019ve been the perfect time. It will be difficult to pull that off once they are back.</p><p>I pull up in front of the apartment but keep the Sunset\u2019s engine running. I have to get on the road if I\u2019m going to be on time. Mum hates it when anyone is late, and I\u2019m already going to have hell to pay for not bringing my \u201cgirlfriend\u201d with me.</p><p>I get out of the car and walk her to the apartment entrance. I reach for her hands and give them a gentle squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later tonight. When you hear Bret sing, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat reminds me. You need a personalized ringtone\u2014so you know it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t know she has one. \u201cYou have one. You just don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p><p>She reaches for her phone to call me, but I stop her. \u201cOh, no you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to know what mine is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d I frame her face with my hands and kiss her hard so she\u2019ll be \u201clove drunk\u201d with me on her mind while I\u2019m away.</p><p>\u201cDrive carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Just like the first time he interrupted us, Ben Donavon appears out of thin air. He clears his throat, interrupting our parting kiss.</p><p>He smiles as a look exchanges between us, one that says, \u201cHey. I\u2019m gonna have this girl.\u201d</p><p>I give him a smug smile in return that responds, \u201cHey, guess what. I\u2019ve already had this girl. And she is incredible.\u201d</p><p>The little bastard picks up Paige\u2019s duffle and stands waiting with it thrown over his shoulder. He knows he\u2019s interrupting our last moments together. And he\u2019s loving it.</p><p>Fuck it. If he thinks he\u2019s just ruined this for me, he\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m going to kiss the hell out of her regardless. \u201cExcuse us. We were in the middle of something.\u201d</p><p>I grasp her face and brush my lips across hers, but then I coax her mouth open and she allows me to kiss her like I did when we were alone, as if she has forgotten Ben is there with us.</p><p>I trail my mouth over to her ear and my eyes meet Ben\u2019s as I whisper, \u201cRemember. I won\u2019t share you.\u201d</p><p>She whispers back, \u201cHow could I forget?\u201d</p><p>We say a final goodbye and Ben is waiting to take her from me. When she enters the apartment, he turns back to give me a shit-eating grin as he places his hand on her lower back.</p><p>Dammit! Not her lower back. That\u2019s my spot to touch.</p><p>My only choice is to watch. I feel helpless, like a shepherd seeing his favorite lamb disappear into the forest with a dangerous wolf. She thinks he\u2019s harmless, but he\u2019s not. I know better.</p><p>It\u2019s juvenile, but I text her before I drive away in an effort to steal her attention away from him.</p><p>*Miss me while I\u2019m gone*</p><p>A heartbeat later, I hear the sound of her return text.</p><p>*Can\u2019t miss U till UR gone ;)*</p><p>I pull away from the curb and wait until I\u2019m out of sight to hit send on the next message.</p><p>*Gone. Now U can miss me.*</p><p>*I will but no TWD!*</p><p>She\u2019s concerned for my safety. This makes me smile.</p><p>*K*</p><p>I use the drive to think about a lot of things, but my thoughts mostly revolve around the beautiful new brunette in my life who doesn\u2019t seem to care about the things I can do for her. Knowing how little she cares about the money I could spend, makes me want to buy her the world.</p><p>My mom greets me at the door, which she never does, and peeks toward my car. She\u2019s searching for my \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sees I\u2019m alone and is pissed off. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring her?\u201d</p><p>Why does she do this to herself? \u201cNo, Mum.

You can bring her then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll discuss it with her and we\u2019ll see,\u201d I lie.</p><p>She\u2019s satisfied with that answer and finally lets me in the house.</p><p>We\u2019re sitting at the dining room table when she brings it up again. \u201cI want to hear about your girlfriend.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone around the table stares while they wait on me to answer. I see I\u2019m going to be forced into lying. I\u2019ll try to be as vague as possible. \u201cShe\u2019s American.\u201d</p><p>I see my mum\u2019s face fall. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t live in Australia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s here on an extended visit with a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she won\u2019t be returning to the States soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a while.\u201d</p><p>That makes my mum smile again. \u201cThat\u2019s good. What does she do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a musician\u2014a very good one. That\u2019s how we met ... I heard her sing at a club in Wagga Wagga.\u201d</p><p>I avoid telling them Paige\u2019s name, but the illusion feels real for a moment, and I like it. I take pleasure in the happiness I see on their faces, but then the guilt sets in. Everything I tell them about her is the truth wrapped in a blanket of lies.</p><p>17</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>Addison is out with Zac, and I\u2019m uncomfortable because I see a change in Ben as soon as we get inside the apartment. He\u2019s next to me every time I turn around, brushing against me any chance he gets, sitting next to me on the couch. He\u2019s pursuing me in a much more aggressive manner, and I don\u2019t like it.</p><p>I lie and say I need to go to the store for tampons to get away from him. He insists on driving me, but I decline by telling him the walk will help with cramps. How asinine. I\u2019m a terrible liar, but I think the talk of tampons and menstrual cramps keeps him from insisting.</p><p>I\u2019m walking around in the drugstore a few blocks from the apartment when Bret begins to sing in my purse. I\u2019m standing in front of a mirror in the makeup aisle when I look up and see the goofy grin on my face as I answer. I didn\u2019t even realize I was smiling. \u201cHello, caveman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, American girl. How\u2019s it going back in Wagga Wagga?\u201d</p> <p>He may ask how it\u2019s going, but what he really means is how is it going with Ben, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going there. \u201cEverything\u2019s good. Are you having fun with the fam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I\u2019d be having a lot more fun if I were with you.\u201d No argument here.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have plenty of fun when you get back.\u201d And what was the plan after the holidays? Would he keep making the drive into town to get me?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to pass the time without me?\u201d</p><p>I laugh because it\u2019s so ridiculous. \u201cI\u2019m strolling around a drugstore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d be doing that because?\u201d He doesn\u2019t give me time to answer. \u201cDid that little bastard do something to you?\u201d</p><p>I know the worst thing I can do is tell him about Ben\u2019s behavior, so I lie. \u201cI was bored and wanted to get out for a while, but it\u2019s a bad night to get bored. There\u2019s not much open on Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe for you to be out walking the streets alone after dark.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He sounds mad. \u201cI\u2019m only a few blocks from the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re across the street. I want you to take a cab back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the girl right before she gets nabbed by some crazy-ass psycho. I\u2019ll be quite upset with you if you are kidnapped and murdered, so please take a cab back. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I smile at his concern for my safety, even if he is a little overbearing. \u201cI will if it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it will make me feel much better. Have you changed your mind about going to your friend\u2019s house for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m without plans. I\u2019m going to watch a marathon of Christmas movies and drink lots of eggnog. I\u2019m an only child so I\u2019m used to entertaining me, myself, and I. It\u2019s really not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet and I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s buying my story. I hope it\u2019s not the pity thing again. I can\u2019t stand that. \u201cNot a big deal, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d I lie. It is a big deal. Who wants to be alone on Christmas?</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to check in for a minute before I got tied up. My brother has solicited my help in putting toys together. Yay.\u201d</p><p>He sounds annoyed, but I think it would be fun. \u201cOkay. Well, have fun building dollhouses. Merry Christmas, caveman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, American girl.\u201d</p><p>Addison and Ben have been gone to Zac\u2019s for hours, so it\u2019s just me, Jimmy Stewart, and a half-emptied carton of eggnog. It\u2019s possible I mixed it with some mighty fine bourbon and garnished with a dash of cinnamon. Christmas is on now.</p><p>I hear Bret singing and I\u2019m surprised because Lachlan didn\u2019t mention calling me today. I expected him to be way too busy with his family. \u201cHey, caveman. This is a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you still think that a couple of minutes from now.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d The words aren\u2019t out of my mouth when the door buzzes. \u201cHang on a second. Someone\u2019s buzzing the door.\u201d</p><p>Weird. Who\u2019s here on Christmas Day? I push the intercom button. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a man\u2019s voice, but this is Ben\u2019s apartment. How am I supposed to know who he is? \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Ben isn\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Lachlan.\u201d</p><p>Well, shit. Do I talk to the phone or the intercom? \u201cLachlan! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to have this conversation with me standing downstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Sorry. I\u2019m in apartment 311.\u201d I press the button to allow him into the building and stand at the door waiting.</p><p>Shit, I look a mess. I\u2019m wearing jogging pants with something stupid written across the ass and an equally stupid T-shirt. I\u2019m not even positive my clothes don\u2019t have stains or holes. My hair is piled into a messy bun on top of my head and I\u2019m wearing my glasses. They\u2019re trendy, but I\u2019d still rather be wearing my contacts for Lachlan. Too late now.</p><p>He comes around the corner from the elevator dressed in dark stonewashed jeans and a white button-up. He\u2019s as handsome as I\u2019ve ever seen him and I want to crawl into a deep, deep hole so he can\u2019t see me like this.</p><p>I smile because I can\u2019t see him and not beam. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas. I didn\u2019t want you to be alone. And I wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother was rather annoyed with me when I told her you were alone today. She insisted I come and spend the evening with you.\u201d</p><p>Oh. I feel deflated when I realize this is his mother\u2019s insistence.</p><p>I shrug and stare at my bare feet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t expecting you so I look like hell.\u201d</p><p>He reaches out and grabs the hem of my shirt, giving it a little tug. \u201cYou\u2019re always beautiful. And I love the glasses.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m dazed by his simple touch. He has that kind of power over me.</p><p>It takes a moment, but I finally come to my senses and invite him in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Come in.\u201d</p><p>He prowls through the door and I feel him on my heels as I shut it. He grabs me from behind. I\u2019ve come to accept this as his thing, but I like it.</p><p>He uses his hips to pin me against the door. His hands are pressed on each side of my head, locking me inside his cage of muscular arms. Because my hair is piled in a messy bun, he has easy access to my whole neck, but I realize I miss the glide of his hand pushing my hair over my shoulder. He leans forward and begins kissing the back of my neck, and I evanesce.</p><p>I know what he\u2019s doing. He wants the thrill of screwing me in the rival\u2019s territory. It means he\u2019s won and I\u2019m fine with him taking me as his prize.</p><p>He brings his hands to my hips and navigates me to the couch, but we don\u2019t sit. He steers me to the arm until it hits me across the top of my thighs. I hear the sound of his zipper behind me and then the tearing of a foil wrapper.</p><p>A few seconds later, he pushes my pants and panties to my knees. Shit, I don\u2019t remember which panties I\u2019m wearing. I hope they\u2019re not some of my old ones.</p><p>I feel his hand at my lower back and he pushes me over the arm of the couch. He glides a hand up my spine to my shoulders. I should be mortified at being bent over with my pants to my knees, but I\u2019m not, and the thought dissipates altogether when he slides two fingers inside me. I rock back against his magic hand because I can\u2019t hold still. It feels too good.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always so wet and eager.\u201d I love the things he says to me when we\u2019re like this. I implore him to say something else and he reads my mind. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d I manage to whisper, but I\u2019m not as good at this as he is.</p><p>He takes his fingers out and I feel his hard tip sliding up and down. \u201cTell me where you want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside me.\u201d It comes out a little louder, but still barely more than a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d He\u2019s still teasing me, but uses a little more pressure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d I manage to say a little louder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t hear you, Paige. When did you say you want me?\u201d He\u2019s taunting me.</p><p>\u201cRight now!\u201d I scream as I push back and force him inside me.</p> <p>I hear him hiss through his teeth. \u201cThen right now you shall have me.\u201d</p><p>I feel his hands on my hips and I hear him groan as he sinks deep inside me with more force than I thought possible. I call out from the shock of it. \u201cYou like it this way, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t lie. I love it. \u201cYes.\u201d It\u2019s all I can manage with him pounding into me.</p><p>He slows his pace a little and I feel one of his hands leave my hip to slide down my spine. \u201cI love having you this way.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m like a cat bending to his touch. He holds so much power over me ... I wonder if he knows.</p> <p>I spiral until he takes me to that place, the one where I implode as he drives hard into me one last time. A few moments later, I feel his kiss against my back. \u201cPack a bag. You\u2019re coming home with me. But don\u2019t change. I want you just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t have to ask me twice.</p><p>18</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>Paige is in her room packing when I hear the lock jiggle. Ben Donavon comes through the door to find me in his living room, sitting on the arm of his couch\u2014the same one I just bent Paige over\u2014and I stifle my laughter. He\u2019s not happy with my presence and is about to question it when Paige comes out of her bedroom.</p><p>He sees her bag and reads the situation for what it is. She\u2019s choosing to leave with me, not stay here with him. \u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m staying with Lachlan tonight.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s pissed off and that makes me more eager to get her away from him. \u201cWhen should I tell Addison you\u2019ll be back?\u201d</p><p>She looks to me for an answer, but I don\u2019t have one. I haven\u2019t thought about a plan beyond tonight. \u201cShe\u2019ll call and let her know.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s furious because this isn\u2019t his plan. His involved coming back to the apartment to have some alone time with Paige. Too bad. The only one-on-one she\u2019s getting tonight is in my bed.</p><p>I put my arm around her and take her bag. \u201cReady, baby?\u201d</p><p>Paige glances at me and grins. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>As we walk out the door, I taunt him over my shoulder. \u201cMerry Christmas, Ben.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything back. Sore loser.</p> <p>I see Paige\u2019s gift by the door when we pull up. I called and canceled the delivery to the apartment and instead had it brought to the vineyard the moment my mum convinced me to spend Christmas with my \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d</p><p>My poor mum. She thinks she sent me here to woo her potential daughter-in-law, not indulge in my latest lewd act.</p><p>Paige sees the gift on the porch when we get out of the car. \u201cCheck it out. Someone left a Christmas gift for you by the door.\u201d</p><p>I try not to grin. \u201cHmm, I wonder who would have done that since all of the staff are still gone for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>I unlock the door and grab the gift before she has time to investigate the name on the card. We go into the living room and I put it down on the coffee table. \u201cWant to go ahead and take your bag to the bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I watch her disappear down the hall, and it makes me smile. She\u2019s familiar with all of this\u2014me, my house, the things I want to do to her. She hasn\u2019t been shocked or apprehensive about anything so far. The others were uptight and stuffy, but Paige is different. She\u2019s so much better.</p><p>She comes back into the living room and sits next to me on the couch. I pass her one of the glasses of wine I\u2019ve poured. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She lifts it to her mouth and then makes a guess at the type. \u201cMerlot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, my young apprentice.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, pleased with herself. \u201cI have a great master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d I take the wine from her hand and put our glasses aside. I lift the large gift from the coffee table and hand her the card. \u201cI\u2019m dying to see who this is from. Read the card to me.\u201d</p><p>She smiles as she takes it. \u201cMerry Christmas to Paige, from Lachlan.\u201d Her smile fades when it registers. \u201cYou got me a gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you have time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen isn\u2019t important.\u201d I place the box across her lap and I\u2019m surprised by the joy I\u2019m feeling. I\u2019ve gone from one extreme to the other today. I was discontent when I woke this morning and thought about not being with her when she opened this, but now I\u2019m antsy to see her reaction. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have a gift for you.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Open it already.\u201d</p><p>She tears the paper slowly. I can tell she\u2019s guarded, perhaps thinking of all the things the large box could contain. Of the things running through her mind, I don\u2019t think this one she considers.</p><p>When she opens the box, she sees the case adorned with one word: Martin. She knows what\u2019s inside. I can\u2019t decipher what I see on her face. Is she not happy?</p><p>My other companions were ecstatic to get gifts. Of course, I usually give them something lavish, like jewelry. Maybe she was hoping for something along those lines. Should I have given her diamond earrings instead?</p><p>She swallows hard and pulls the brown case from the box. She places it across her lap and looks at me. She seems sad, and I don\u2019t know why. I wish I knew what she was thinking.</p><p>She pushes the brass drawbolt latch up with her thumb and opens the top of the case. She stares quietly at the Martin D-45 she admired in the window of the music store before she grazes her fingers over it. I\u2019m no closer to knowing what\u2019s going through her mind. It\u2019s frustrating and I begin to wonder if I\u2019ve done something wrong. Perhaps it isn\u2019t the right guitar.</p><p>I can stand it no longer. \u201cYou have to tell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>She blinks several times and I see the tears in her eyes. Shit. That wasn\u2019t what I was going for at all. \u201cI\u2019m thinking it\u2019s beautiful but way too expensive and I can\u2019t accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of how much it cost. I bought it for you because I want you to have it. You\u2019re keeping it. Now, take it out and play something for me.\u201d</p><p>She puts the case on the coffee table and removes the guitar. She slips the strap over her head and hesitates like she\u2019s still thinking it over, but then strums it for the first time. And it\u2019s over. I know there\u2019ll be no more talk of not accepting my gift because she\u2019s in love with it.</p><p>She begins strumming a song and nothing sounds familiar about it, but I like it. \u201cWhat song is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaperweight.\u201d She strums a few more chords and then begins singing. \u201cBeen up all night, staring at you ... wondering what\u2019s on your mind. I\u2019ve been this way with so many before but ... this feels like the first time.\u201d</p><p>Two lines in and I\u2019m completely lost in her. Her voice is uninhibited and I love everything about her when she sings\u2014her song choice, her voice, her facial expressions, but mostly the feeling I get. She\u2019s special and destined for great things when the right person in the music industry discovers her.</p><p>When she finishes playing, she looks over at me and smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect and I love it. It\u2019s the best gift I\u2019ve ever been given. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome.\u201d</p><p>She gets up and puts the guitar in its case before she climbs onto the couch and straddles me. She takes my face in her small, delicate hands. I hadn\u2019t noticed how dainty they are until I saw them strumming the Martin. She\u2019s watching my eyes. \u201cAnd thank you for coming back to me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m taken by surprise because her words sound so intimate, like those that would be whispered between two people in love. She\u2019s very good at our little game. She makes this feel real.</p><p>My first thought is to take her to the bedroom, but then I remember that we are alone and decide I want her right here in the living room. I lift her shirt over her head and unfasten the back of her bra to free her perfect breasts. I suck one of her rosy tips into my mouth and I feel her arch closer as she drops her head back. I roll my tongue around the erect pebble and then scrape my teeth over it.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lachlan,\u201d she quietly moans as she grinds her pelvis against mine.</p><p>My sweet little American girl isn\u2019t much of a talker when we\u2019re like this, but I\u2019m going to work on her a little at a time. \u201cTell me what you want me to do to you, Paige.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might, but I can\u2019t be sure, so I need to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>Her face is red because she\u2019s embarrassed to tell me, but I\u2019ll eventually have her so she isn\u2019t afraid to ask me to do anything. I rub my hands over her breasts. \u201cDo you want me to kiss you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen say it.\u201d</p><p>She swallows hard. \u201cLachlan, I want you to kiss my breasts.\u201d It\u2019s a soft whisper, but I let it count because this is going to take some conditioning.</p><p>I take her other breast in my mouth and suck it hard. I tug lightly on her nipple and it makes a popping sound when the suction breaks.</p><p>She\u2019s still wearing her bottoms so I lift her from my lap and lie her down on the couch. \u201cNow, what do you want me to do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off my pants and panties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d I grin at her as I tug on the waistband of her pants and panties. She lifts her hips and I slide them down for a second time today. I take them all the way down and toss them onto the floor. \u201cNext?\u201d</p><p>She smiles and I think she is starting to relax with our game. \u201cTake off your clothes while I watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want. You only have to ask.\u201d</p><p>I unbutton my shirt and toss it casually over the back of the couch. I take the two foil squares out of my pocket and put them on the coffee table before I unfasten my daks and drop them and my jocks to the floor. \u201cNext?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s licking her lips. \u201cI want your mouth on me.\u201d</p><p>I grin at her vague request. \u201cYou have to tell me where.\u201d</p><p>She points at her piercing through her navel. \u201cStart here.

This is going to be so much fun.</p><p>I kiss her jeweled piercing over her belly button because she\u2019s asked me to, but I know that\u2019s not where she really wants my mouth, so I begin working my way toward the real prize. She relaxes her legs as I go lower, but I stop just before I get to that spot. \u201cIs this low enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me when I get to where you want me.\u201d</p><p>I start again and I hear her direct me. \u201cGo down a little more.\u201d</p> <p>I know when I hit the spot because she arches her back in response. \u201cYes. Right there. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>I lick her center and then use my tongue to circle the stiff nub, but it\u2019s when I slide my fingers inside her below my tongue that she begins to come apart. I feel her hand grab my hair as she squeals out. \u201cDon\u2019t stop doing that, Lachlan.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019s finished coming, I feel her relax and she lets go of my hair. At this rate, I could be snatched bald by the end of our time together.</p><p>I reach for the condom on the table and tear into it. She sits up on the couch and watches me roll it on. When I finish, I crawl up her body and search her face. \u201cNow, tell me what you want me to do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to ... fuck me.\u201d She\u2019s hesitant and soft-spoken.</p><p>Not good enough. I grab her thighs and pull her against me.</p> <p>\u201cSay it like you mean it.\u201d I\u2019m hard against her slick entrance and she\u2019s lifting her hips to rub against me. She wants me to enter her and I will, but not until I hear her say it the way I want.</p><p>She grabs me around the neck and pulls me down until we\u2019re eye to eye and there\u2019s nothing gentle about it. \u201cFuck. Me. Now. Lachlan.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s my girl. \u201cOkay, okay. All you had to do was ask,\u201d I laugh.</p><p>I give her what we both want and sink deeply inside her. She brings her legs up around my hips to coax me on. \u201cHarder, Lachlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it rough, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She tightens her legs around me. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>I drive into her, filling her as deeply as I can when I have no choice but to explode. Her legs are wrapped around me tightly and there\u2019s an unfamiliar feeling deep inside her. What was that?</p><p>It was neither bad nor good. Just something I\u2019d never felt before.</p> <p>\u201cDid you feel something different just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you obviously did by the look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did. I felt something twitch. Or pop.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still inside her, so I pull out to investigate and see if we have an issue. The condom is busted to hell and back. \u201cFuck! The rubber broke.\u201d</p><p>My first response is to panic, but then I remember that Paige is on the pill. \u201cYou\u2019ve been taking your birth control pills, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Condoms are the one thing I have absolute control over in my sexual relationships. I refuse to depend on anyone else to be responsible. The cost of failure is too great, but now I\u2019m forced to relinquish control to Paige and really need to hear her say she\u2019s been doing what she promised she would.</p><p>She sits up and grabs my face. \u201cYes, Lachlan. I take my pill at the same time every day, so relax. I\u2019ve got us covered.\u201d</p><p>She has us covered. Her words work to calm me a little. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I just panicked for a minute. When are you supposed to start your period?\u201d I need to know how long I have to worry about this.</p><p>\u201cProbably Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That means we\u2019ll only have to wait a few days to know everything is all right for sure.\u201d God, just thinking about everything not being okay makes me want to throw up.</p><p>19</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>Wow, meet flustered Lachlan. I didn\u2019t know he existed.</p><p>I work harder to convince him everything is all good. \u201cWe\u2019re fine, Lachlan. Even if I weren\u2019t on the pill, I\u2019m not ovulating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the woman who gets a surprise pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know Lachlan could be anything but cool and collected, but he has shown me a different side of him. Let\u2019s just say he doesn\u2019t deal well with \u201coh, shit\u201d moments.</p><p>He picks up the unused condom from the coffee table and tears the wrapper so he can inspect it for defects. \u201cWe\u2019re not using any more out of that box, just in case it\u2019s a defective batch.\u201d</p><p>When he finishes inspecting it, he flops back on the couch and stares at the ceiling. He\u2019s thinking\u2014and worrying\u2014although I\u2019ve told him I\u2019m taking my birth control pills. Is it because he thinks I sleep around with a lot of men? I admit that I haven\u2019t given him much reason to think otherwise, but it\u2019s the furthest thing from the truth.</p><p>\u201cBefore you, I had only been with one person and I was tested for everything under the sun after we ended things, so you don\u2019t have to worry about catching something from me.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look at me. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about you giving me a sexually transmitted disease. The majority of that stuff can be treated.\u201d</p><p>I see that there won\u2019t be any more sex until we get a new box of condoms, so I get off the couch and begin to dress after I toss him his pants and boxer briefs.</p><p>When I finish dressing, I kneel between his legs and put my chin on one of his knees. I peer up at him and he caresses the side of my face with his hand. I don\u2019t want this night to be ruined by stress and anxiety. \u201cDon\u2019t. Worry. We\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>His worry has taken him somewhere else, and I want him back here with me. \u201cWant me to play something for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that would be nice.\u201d</p><p>I get up from the floor and take my new guitar from its case. I stand in front of him and strum several times. \u201cAny requests from the audience tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pick.\u201d</p><p>I know the perfect song to take his mind off what just happened. I begin to strum a bluegrass version of \u201cGin and Juice,\u201d but I can tell he isn\u2019t catching on. Maybe Australians aren\u2019t fans of Snoop Dogg.</p><p>\u201c\u2018With so much drama in the L.B.C., it\u2019s kinda hard bein\u2019 Snoop D. O. Double-G ... But I ... I somehow, someway ... keep comin\u2019 up with funky-ass shit nearly every single day.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I know the second the song comes to him because he begins to laugh. Hmm. Lachlan thinks I\u2019m funny. It\u2019s feels so strange because Blake never thought anything I did was amusing.</p><p>He picks up and begins to sing the chorus with me. \u201c\u2018Rollin\u2019 down the street ... smokin\u2019 endo ... sippin\u2019 on gin and juice ... Laid back ...With my mind on my money and my money on my mind.\u2019\u201d</p><p>When I finish, he claps and I curtsy. \u201cThat was fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBluegrass \u2018Gin and Juice\u2019 isn\u2019t fantastic; it\u2019s shitastic. There\u2019s a huge difference between the two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t exactly the kind of performance I was expecting when I bought the guitar for you, but I loved it. Do something else shitastic for me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to think about it. I\u2019m going to do \u201cWhatever You Like\u201d by T.I. my way because the song makes me think of us and our bizarro relationship.</p><p>\u201c\u2018I said you can have whatever you like ... I said you can have whatever you like ... Yeah ... Stacks on deck ... Patr\u00f3n on ice ... And we can pop bottles all night and baby, you could have whatever you like ... I said, you could have whatever you like ... Yeah ... baby, I can treat you so special, so nice ... Gas up a jet for you tonight and baby, you can go wherever you like ... I said you can go wherever you like ...Yeah.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He applauds for me when I finish and I curtsy again. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>He thinks that\u2019s amazing? \u201cYou know I was just playing around, right? That\u2019s not the kind of stuff I sing for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so tell me. What does Paige Beckett sing for real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMusic is what feelings sound like out loud. I sing songs that speak from my heart. They tell my story, how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSing one of those. Pick one that tells me your story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know. Come on, tell me your story.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to regret this. I know I will. I decide on \u201cAccording to You\u201d by Orianthi. I strum until I find the desired chord. \u201c\u2018According to you ... I\u2019m stupid, I\u2019m useless ... I can\u2019t do anything right ... According to you ... I\u2019m difficult, hard to please, forever changing my mind ... I\u2019m a mess in a dress, can\u2019t show up on time, even if it would save my life. According to you ... According to you ... But according to him ... I\u2019m beautiful, incredible. He can\u2019t get me out of his head ... According to him ... I\u2019m funny, irresistible ... Everything he ever wanted ...\u2019\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s as far as I make it before I\u2019m choking on my own words. Shit, I knew I\u2019d regret doing this. I\u2019m mortified as I stand in front of Lachlan with my hands over my face so he doesn\u2019t see the ugly cry.</p><p>He gets off the couch and is by my side, arms around me. A moment later, he lifts the guitar over my head and puts it in its case. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is, but he\u2019s wrong. You are beautiful. And incredible. And funny. And irresistible.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s so much that\u2019s happened in my life to make me feel unworthy of ever being beautiful, incredible, funny, or irresistible. But I don\u2019t want to think of those things. Not now. And certainly not in front of Lachlan.</p><p>He lets go of me and takes my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Come to bed with me.\u201d</p><p>I follow him to his bedroom and shuffle through my bag as he pulls the comforter back. \u201cWhat did you bring to sleep in?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take out a satin lavender slip gown and hold it up for him to see. He shakes his head before reaching into his bureau and tossing one of his T-shirts in my direction. \u201cHere. Wear this.\u201d Yep. We are officially on coitus hiatus until we can get our hands on a different batch of condoms.</p><p>He\u2019s seen me naked, but I still turn around to take my clothes off and slip into his shirt. I\u2019m not sure wearing something of his is helping with the coitus hiatus effort because I can\u2019t help but notice how good it smells. Just like Lachlan.</p><p>We go into the bathroom together to do our bedtime rituals. He\u2019s on his side and I\u2019m on the other. I watch him in the mirror as he brushes his teeth. It feels so domestic. He glances over and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because he\u2019s sneaking a peek at me or if he feels my eyes on him.</p> <p>When we\u2019re finished, we climb into bed and he pulls me close. He doesn\u2019t ask me to tell him about the pain I\u2019m hiding. He simply holds me until we fall asleep. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never done. And it\u2019s beautiful.</p><p>I wake the next morning and my hand reaches for a warm body that isn\u2019t there. The early bird is out of the nest already, which makes me the sleepyhead again, except for the fact that it\u2019s only seven in the morning. That does not qualify as sleeping late in any shape or form.</p><p>I don\u2019t find Lachlan in the kitchen, so I walk toward the gym. I hear \u201cWhatever You Like\u201d blaring through the speakers before I reach the door. When I walk in, he\u2019s running on the treadmill and the back of his T-shirt is soaking wet. He\u2019s been in here a while.</p><p>His back is to me, but his eyes meet mine in the mirror. \u201cGood morning, sleepyhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, early bird. Nice song choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think so too, although I like your version better. You just missed Snoop Dogg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate that. Been running long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough.\u201d He stops the treadmill and reaches for a towel to wipe the sweat from his face. His cheeks are rosy and it makes him look younger, like a child playing in the hot sun.</p><p>\u201cI probably need to call Addison to let her know how long I\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you want to stay?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. How long am I welcome?\u201d Listen to me. I\u2019m like Addison now, not wanting to wear out my welcome.</p> <p>He wipes his neck and chest\u2014jeez, I\u2019d love to be that towel. \u201cI\u2019m leaving to go out of town Monday morning. Will you stay with me until then?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to think about it, but I hesitate for a moment so he doesn\u2019t see how elated I am to be with him for the next two days. \u201cSure. That\u2019s doable.\u201d</p><p>He tosses the towel across the treadmill as he gets off and I know what\u2019s he\u2019s about to do. I see the mischief in his grin. He knows I\u2019m about to run and catches me before I can take a second step. I\u2019m no match for a conditioned runner.</p><p>He pulls me against his hot, sweaty body. I wanted to be his towel. Now, I am. Any other sweaty man would be gross, but Lachlan\u2019s not. It\u2019s the ultimate turn-on, but I remember we don\u2019t have condoms since he tossed the whole box of potentially defective ones out last night.</p><p>I pretend to be grossed out as I push away from him. \u201cCaveman, you are in desperate need of a shower.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his sweaty body all over me. \u201cNow you are too.\u201d</p><p>Has he forgotten about our lack of protection? \u201cDo you think that\u2019s the best idea since you threw out all the condoms last night?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s wearing that naughty little grin I\u2019ve come to love so much. \u201cDon\u2019t need \u2019em for what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p> <p>20</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>It\u2019s not even noon when we\u2019re driving into town, and we both know exactly the purpose of our expedition. We have condom shopping to do.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t pack enough clothes to stay until Monday. Do you mind swinging by the apartment so I can pick up some things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Except I do have a problem with it. I\u2019m sure Ben Donavon will be there.</p><p>I park along the curb at the apartment. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m invited up, but I\u2019m not at all crazy about her going to his place without me. \u201cWill you come up and officially meet Addison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Abso-fucking-lutely. It\u2019s probably not the best idea to hem me up with that little bastard in the same room, but I don\u2019t want her going up there without me.</p><p>I follow Paige into the building. She knocks instead of using a key and Addison opens the door. I\u2019m relieved to see it isn\u2019t her brother. Her friend wrinkles her brow. \u201cWhy are you knocking? You live here, silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my apartment. I\u2019m just bunking here.\u201d</p><p>Addison gives me a thorough inspection. \u201cWell, you haven\u2019t been bunking here much, thanks to this guy.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what to make of her comment, but she extends her hand. \u201cAddison Donavon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLachlan Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the man who\u2019s been keeping my best friend so busy.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, we\u2019ve been pretty busy all right. \u201cGuilty as charged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tells me you\u2019re in the wine business. My family has a vineyard in California. It can be brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to grab some things while you bond over the whoas of winemaking.\u201d Paige disappears into the bedroom and leaves me alone with her friend. I\u2019m prepared to share more about my career, but once she\u2019s certain Paige is out of hearing distance, she suddenly changes the subject and is very serious.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a strained moment and I\u2019m not really sure how to respond. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to not hurt Laurelyn. She\u2019s been through a lot. The last guy she dated did a real number on her.\u201d</p><p>Her name is Laurelyn?</p><p>\u201cShe told me about the agreement you have and I\u2019m fine with it. Have a great time together\u2014but don\u2019t make her fall in love with you. She\u2019s been hurt enough.\u201d</p><p>Fall in love? Who said anything about falling in love?</p><p>Paige might have told her friend some things about our agreement, but not everything. Addison doesn\u2019t know that Laurelyn chose to keep her name a secret from me because she\u2019s unknowingly busted her on it. Honestly, it stings a little to discover that.</p><p>\u201cNo worries. Laurelyn and I are on the same page.\u201d I say her name, savoring how it sounds rolling off my tongue. Paige was all right, but Laurelyn fits her better because it\u2019s different. I\u2019ve never known anyone by that name.</p><p>She comes out of the bedroom with a large bag in hand. \u201cAll packed and ready to go.\u201d</p><p>Our first stop after we leave the apartment is the drugstore. I get into the car after my shopping spree and pass her the bag of condoms. \u201cHow many did you buy?\u201d She opens the bag to peek inside and smiles in my direction. \u201cDid you buy their entire inventory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not getting stuck without some backup in case we have another blowout.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s shaking her head at me. \u201cAre you still worried about that?\u201d</p><p>Hell yeah, I\u2019m still worried. Why isn\u2019t she? \u201cYes, and I will be until you start your period. If you don\u2019t get it before I leave, I want you to call me as soon as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d I think she\u2019s miffed.</p><p>I know I sound irrational. I don\u2019t mean to, but a pregnancy under these circumstances would be disastrous. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t mean to rub you the wrong way. I\u2019d much rather rub you the right way.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and I know I\u2019m forgiven. \u201cI need to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I pull out of the parking lot but don\u2019t have a clue where I\u2019m going.</p><p>I\u2019m nervous about bringing it up, but I do because I realize it\u2019s important to me. \u201cI want to call you Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>I stare ahead as I drive, but I still catch a glimpse of Laurelyn whirling her head in my direction. \u201cI see Addison ratted me out. I didn\u2019t tell her about the anonymous part of the agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she ratted you out because I want to call you by your real name. Laurelyn suits you better than Paige.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have the right to know my real name if I don\u2019t know yours.\u201d She\u2019s angry. Or maybe defeated. I\u2019m not really sure.</p><p>\u201cThere are very legitimate reasons for that.\u201d She turns her head away from me. \u201cYou can\u2019t be angry at me about this.\u201d I reach for her hand and bring it to my leg. I give it a gentle squeeze. \u201cI was honest with you about everything.\u201d</p><p>She looks back at me. \u201cExcept why. You haven\u2019t given me any kind of explanation. I\u2019m sure I could accept not knowing if you\u2019d only give me some kind of reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I won\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m stern when I say it because I have to be disciplined for myself. She makes me want to break down and tell her everything. It\u2019s strange\u2014I\u2019ve never wanted to do that before. She makes me want to do lots of new things.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, but I guess there\u2019s no point in pretending to be Paige Beckett when you know I\u2019m not, so I guess you\u2019re getting what you want. Again.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not happy with me, but I still bring her hand to my lips and kiss it. \u201cThank you, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not welcome and you can forget getting my real last name.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s mad because she feels defeated. I don\u2019t want her to feel that way. It makes me want to blurt out that she can call me Jack, but I don\u2019t. Because I can\u2019t.</p><p>Laurelyn. Laurelyn. Laurelyn. It\u2019s a delicate, feminine name and I say it in my head over and over, wrapping my brain around it so it will flow off my tongue when I\u2019m ready to say it again. It\u2019s very easy to forget I ever called her Paige.</p><p>\u201cCan I take you to lunch while we\u2019re in town?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure. What about the fifties diner on the square? Ben says it\u2019s great and I\u2019ve been dying to try it.\u201d</p><p>Ben. I hate the feeling I get when she says his name. I\u2019m really going to hate taking her back to stay at his place again. It pisses me off that he thinks he has a chance with the woman I\u2019ve claimed. Maybe he needs a warning so he\u2019ll back off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you anywhere you want to go.\u201d</p><p>The diner is exactly what it sounds like and Laurelyn is all smiles when we enter. \u201cOh, it\u2019s retro, just like a real fifties diner. Can we sit at the bar?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything you want.\u201d</p><p>The decor is exactly as you would imagine\u2014a black-and-white checkered floor down to red vinyl-covered barstools with lots of chrome. She reaches for a menu on the counter stuck behind a napkin holder and passes one to me. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m even looking. I already know what I want\u2014a cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake.\u201d</p><p>A waitress wearing the classic dress and white apron approaches us. \u201cDo you need a minute to look over the menu?\u201d</p><p>I figure a burger is as good as anything else I\u2019ll find on the menu. \u201cNo. We\u2019ll have two cheeseburgers with fries and a couple of chocolate shakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing right up.\u201d</p> <p>Laurelyn replaces the menus and scans the surroundings. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought of the fifties diner theme as an American thing, but I guess it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d</p><p>I hear an old song playing overhead and I decide to try to stump my little musician. \u201cOkay, musical genius. What song is this?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have to listen because she already knows. \u201c\u2018In the Still of the Night\u2019 by The Five Satins.\u201d</p><p>It amazes me how she knows. Always. \u201cHow can you possibly have all that information in your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift. Oh, wow. A jukebox!\u201d She flies off her stool and stands over the jukebox viewing the song selections. She\u2019s so into the music, I don\u2019t think she realizes she\u2019s keeping time to the music with the shake of her hips. Wow, I love her ass. Especially when she shakes it like that.</p> <p>She digs into her purse and drops several coins into the box. When she returns, she\u2019s grinning. \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask out of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just like this place,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re the one who brought me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d The alternative pisses me off.</p><p>Our lunch arrives and Laurelyn makes no pretenses about enjoying her meal. The girl loves a cheeseburger and a milkshake. I\u2019m not used to it. Mostly because this isn\u2019t the type of restaurant I would take any of my companions to, but also because they always order salads and eat like birds.</p><p>I like watching her eat while she enjoys the music playing overhead. The next song starts and she points up to the ceiling, cueing me to listen as she bites her bottom lip and moves her shoulders with the beat of the song. She waggles her eyebrows. \u201cThis is one of the songs I play. Do you know it?\u201d</p><p>Of course. It\u2019s a classic. \u201c\u2018These Arms of Mine\u2019 by Otis Redding.\u201d</p><p>As we finish eating, she continues my education on the artist and name of every new song. \u201cDo you think, sleep, breathe music all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. I don\u2019t think I could stop if I wanted to. It\u2019s in my blood and I have to have it. When I\u2019m in a writing mode, it\u2019s weird how such simple acts can trigger lyrics in my head.\u201d She peers over her shoulder. \u201cYou see that man and woman over there?\u201d</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t noticed anyone in this diner except her, so I glance at the couple she\u2019s talking about. I see a man and woman sitting across from one another in a booth. They\u2019re probably in their early twenties and having what appears to be an intense conversation.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re breaking up. I see the pain in their eyes and it makes words come into my head. When it hits me, I\u2019ll write it on anything until I can get to my guitar. I see potential song lyrics happening all around me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. This is in her blood. Only someone genetically engineered toward music could come up with the things she does. \u201cAnd what would a song about us sound like?\u201d</p><p>She looks up as she slurps the last drink of her milkshake and shakes her head. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m not touching that one with a ten-foot pole.\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>We\u2019re driving back to Avalon with the top down and Lachlan is exceptionally sexy behind his sunglasses. I can\u2019t resist taking out the phone he gave me and snapping a picture of him. He briefly takes his eyes away from the road as he glances in my direction. I take the opportunity to snap a frontal shot. Oh, my. He is so good-looking.</p><p>\u201cNo pictures with your personal phone. Ever.\u201d His words are rigid and I wonder what the big deal is.</p><p>I innocently hold up the phone he gave me. \u201cIt\u2019s not my personal phone. It\u2019s the booty-call device you sent me and I want your picture on here so I can see your handsome face pop up when you call me.\u201d</p><p>I realize it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve called it that in front of him. \u201cBooty-call device?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If we\u2019re being honest, that\u2019s what it is. You\u2019re the only person who knows the number and when you call, it\u2019s always to make arrangements to get together. We both know what we\u2019re going to do, so that\u2019s what it is.\u201d</p><p>He glances at me again. \u201cLaurelyn, you\u2019re not a booty call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I agreed to this relationship, you told me there would be no pretending. Please don\u2019t go back on your word now and try to act like this is more than it really is. It\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>He pulls the convertible over on the side of the rural road. \u201cI\u2019m not pretending this is anything more than a short-term relationship, but I like being with you even when there\u2019s no sex involved. That means you\u2019re not a booty call.\u201d</p><p>I melt into a puddle in the passenger seat when he says he likes being with me. Damn, I like being with him too, even if I know it\u2019s only temporary. It\u2019s too bad we don\u2019t live closer and I only get three months with him.</p><p>He reaches over and caresses my cheek with his hand. \u201cYou got it, babe?\u201d</p><p>I love to hear him call me that. I don\u2019t say anything, but nod instead. I\u2019m rewarded when he leans over to gently kiss my lips. \u201cGood. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p><p>After he pulls back onto the road, he reaches for my hand and rests it against his thigh. I lean my head back against the seat and let my hair go without trying to keep it wrangled. I savor this time with Lachlan. These moments will eventually come to an end. But not today.</p><p>The ride, however, does come to an end when we\u2019re back at the vineyard. Lachlan takes my hand and places a kiss against it before we get out of the car. It helps makes this arrangement feel more like a relationship. But as sweet as it is, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that all of this will be short-lived.</p><p>I notice a white truck in the drive and I wonder if one of the vineyard employees has returned early or if Lachlan has company. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Mike\u2019s truck. He\u2019s the handyman, so I guess he had a maintenance job. Wait here.\u201d</p><p>Wait here in the car? That\u2019s a little on the weird side, but I do it anyway. A few minutes later I see Lachlan walking out of the house with a man. They shake hands and he gets into his truck to leave.</p><p>Lachlan walks over to the car and opens my door for me, but says nothing about the man or why he\u2019s at the vineyard the day after Christmas when all of the other employees are still off for the holidays. Of course, it\u2019s not my business, so I don\u2019t ask.</p><p>When we\u2019re inside, Lachlan grabs a coldie (his name for beer), and we go into the living room to hang out. \u201cToday is Boxing Day. If we were in Sydney, I\u2019d take you to the harbor to watch the start of the yacht race to Hobart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that before,\u201d I reply.</p><p>It\u2019s a big day for hitting the after-Christmas sales. And there\u2019s a lot of sporting events planned for today. Australia\u2019s National Cricket team had a test match scheduled this morning, which is a big deal around here.\u201d</p><p>He grabs the remote for what he refers to as the idiot box. \u201cI need to see if we won.\u201d</p><p>After he sees the results of the game, he turns the television off. \u201cThat\u2019s enough of that. Will you play something for me?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t resist his request or the urge to play since I haven\u2019t touched it today. I play several of Lachlan\u2019s requests, but he gets that wrinkle in his brow and I know he\u2019s thinking hard about something. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>He watches me a second before he says anything. \u201cI was just wondering if, when you\u2019re back home and you\u2019ve become a huge success, if you\u2019ll write a number-one hit about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He sounds offended. Or disappointed.</p><p>I watch my fingers strum the strings so my eyes don\u2019t have to meet his. I don\u2019t want to see them when I explain. \u201cBecause the best songs are written from the heart and the emotions you feel must be one extreme or the other. I\u2019d have to be desperately in love or devastatingly hurt by you.\u201d</p><p>Lachlan settles back onto the couch and kicks off his shoes, casually propping his feet on the coffee table. \u201cHave you ever experienced either of those things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been desperately in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ve been devastatingly hurt?\u201d</p><p>I think of Blake and the way I felt when I found out he was married. \u201cI\u2019ve been hurt and it felt shattering at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can\u2019t have one without the other, so the two must coincide.\u201d</p><p>He sounds like he knows a little something about love and pain. \u201cIs that your opinion because you\u2019ve experienced both?\u201d</p><p>He laughs loudly and I look up from my guitar. \u201cHell, no. I\u2019ve never been in love, so no one has ever hurt me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How is it possible that someone as beautiful as Lachlan has never had that experience? \u201cYou\u2019ve never even thought you might be in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. What about you?\u201d</p><p>Blake is in my thoughts again, reminding me just how wrong a person can be when it comes to love. \u201cI thought I was in love once, but I was dead wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing he\u2019s the one you were telling me about last night?\u201d</p><p>I almost forgot about that. \u201cYeah, that would be him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever dance for him?\u201d</p><p>That came out of left field. \u201cNo. I never even told him I did it.\u201d</p><p>Lachlan gets up from the couch. He grabs my wrist, pulling me to his side, and sets my guitar in its case. \u201cCome with me. I want to show you something.\u201d</p> <p>He leads me to the gym and stops outside the door. \u201cThis is why Mike was here. He was installing this for you.\u201d He opens the door and I see a shiny new pole toward the back wall. I cross the room and touch it before I look at Lachlan and smile.</p><p>Damn, he wasn\u2019t kidding. He freakin\u2019 installed a pole for me. Or for him.</p><p>\u201cI want you to dance for me.\u201d He opens one of the cabinet doors and takes out a box. \u201cAnd I want you to wear this while you do it.\u201d</p><p>I lift the top to find a black one-piece romper inside. The sides of the waist are cut out, leaving only a thin strip to cover me down the middle between the top and bottom. It\u2019s hot and not like anything I\u2019ve worn while dancing. When I take it out of the box, I have another surprise underneath: a pair of red fuck-me pumps. I hold one up\u2014they look like they\u2019ll fit me perfectly.</p><p>He swallows hard. \u201cWill you do it for me?\u201d</p><p>I know in that moment that I\u2019ll never be able to tell him no to anything. I want to be the woman to make his fantasies real. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p> <p>He leans forward to kiss me and catches my bottom lip between his. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need a minute to get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>I take the box from his hands and go to his bedroom. I quickly line my eyes with black kohl and make them smoky with gray and black eyeshadow before adding a fresh coat of mascara to make my lashes extra lush. My hair is windblown from riding in the convertible, so I brush it out before I flip my head over and fluff it with the hair dryer. I leave it down because I like it to cascade when I\u2019m upside down on the pole.</p><p>I slip into the romper and damn, is it ever skimpy. There\u2019s way less of it covering me once I get into it because it\u2019s stretched so taunt from my shoulders to my crotch. I put the pumps on and give them a test drive as I walk circles in the bathroom. I wouldn\u2019t want to walk too many blocks in these tall-ass things, but they\u2019ll be fine for what I\u2019m going to do.</p><p>I inspect myself in the mirror. I\u2019m hot as hell and it boosts my confidence to an all-time high. I\u2019m about to make Lachlan\u2019s fantasy a reality.</p> <p>I go to the gym and wonder where he is. I ease the door open and see him sitting in a chair facing the pole. He\u2019s waiting for me with all the lights off except the ones over the area where I\u2019ll be dancing. I walk up behind him and lean around to whisper in his ear. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I connect my phone to the receiver in the cabinet by Bluetooth because I need to use my own music. The deep, dark thumping bass of \u201cAngel\u201d by Massive Attack begins and I put it on repeat because I expect this performance to run long.</p><p>I take my place by the pole and inhale deeply before I start my performance. \u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d</p><p>When he sees me, he begins to smile. Big time.</p><p>I turn my back to him and reach over my head to grasp the pole. I slowly bend my knees and slide my bottom down it and then back up again as I peer over my shoulder at him. I circle with slow agility and hold the post with one hand as I step out and whirl around a few times. It\u2019s total amateur stuff until I kick my leg up and over to lock the pole behind my knee and climb the brass staff while swiveling upward.</p><p>I do a series of elaborate spins and stunts that took years to master. When I finish the lengthy routine, I\u2019m upside down. I reach for the floor with my palms and spin several times before dismounting. I look at Lachlan when I stand and I\u2019m not sure he has even blinked since I started.</p><p>The music is still playing and I walk to where he is sitting. The song playing is one of my favorites to dance to because it\u2019s bizarre and almost hypnotic. I love the way it makes me feel, like I want to lose control and do strange things.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019ve fucked my mind without touching my body.\u201d</p><p>I turn my back and smile as I lower my bottom to give him a lap dance. He grabs my hips and I swat his hands away. \u201cYou know the rules. You can\u2019t touch the dancer.\u201d</p><p>He sits all the way back in the chair and I take a seat on his lap with my legs spread on each side of his thighs. I put my hands into my hair and lift it from my neck. I lean against him with my back to his chest and let it fall into his face. I\u2019m torturing him. I know this, but it\u2019s all part of the fantasy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my private dancer.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and spread my legs further apart as I put my hands on his knees. I begin a steady rhythm of stroking my bottom against his groin and I can feel how hard he is beneath me. \u201cOh, I\u2019m much more than that.\u201d</p><p>He groans and I know I\u2019m pushing him to his brink. And I love it.</p><p>I get up from his lap and then lower myself to straddle him. I take his face in my hands and search his intense blue eyes. They\u2019re different, darker. And fixated on me.</p><p>I feel him tremble under me and then his fingers slide into the crotch of my romper. But he doesn't touch me. I feel a sudden jerk downward and I realize he has ripped the bottom of my romper and pushed it up over my hips. \u201cLaurelyn, I need to fuck you right now. Don\u2019t make me beg.\u201d</p><p>I reach for his fly, but my hands miss it because he almost bucks me off trying to get his pants shoved out of the way. He\u2019s feral and demanding and I know there won\u2019t be anything gentle about what\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019d be disappointed if there was.</p><p>When his pants and boxer briefs are out of the way, he jerks me down onto him as he thrusts up into me. I cry out because it\u2019s so much deeper in this position. It feels like he\u2019s pounding against my womb and I can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s pleasure or pain. He continues to thrust upward as he grasps my hips tightly to slam me down against him. There\u2019s no doubt I\u2019ll have bruises on my hips tomorrow from where his fingers are digging into my skin, but I don\u2019t care. I wouldn\u2019t have him stop for anything in the world right now.</p><p>I feel my explosion building and I don\u2019t know how or why, but my mind registers the fact that Lachlan didn\u2019t put a condom on. After all that grief over the busted rubber the night before, I can\u2019t believe he doesn\u2019t wear one tonight.</p><p>Dammit. I\u2019m about to ruin the best sex I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>I lean back to see him and he thrusts deeper than ever. \u201cLachlan, you didn\u2019t put a condom on.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my hips painfully and thrusts deeply one last time as he groans loudly and then hisses through his teeth. \u201cOoh, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He just came inside me, no doubt at the door of my womb since he\u2019s been knocking on it so hard. My immediate instinct is to get off him, but he\u2019s holding me so tightly, there\u2019s no way I can budge an inch.</p><p>When he\u2019s finished, I\u2019m still straddling him. We\u2019re face to face. I fist a handful of hair and bring our foreheads together. I\u2019m staring him directly in the eyes, about to chastise him for the missing rubber, when he grabs me around the neck to pull me down for a kiss.</p><p>When he stops, our foreheads are still touching and we\u2019re both gasping for breath. \u201cYou are fan-fucking-tastic. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that. When you told me you pole danced, that is not what I thought you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think I meant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d hold on to the pole and spin around, maybe climb it a little if I was lucky, but damn, baby ... you\u2019re bewitching on that pole.\u201d</p><p>I kiss him because I\u2019m pleased by his praises, but I\u2019m still going to bring up the absentee condom. \u201cWas it my dancing or the hypnotic music that made you go crazy and forget to put on a condom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t forget. I put it on when you started dancing.\u201d</p><p>Oh. He slipped that one on without me knowing. \u201cI should have known you wouldn\u2019t forget after the huge deal you made about it last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I put it on while you were dancing because there\u2019s no way I could have stopped to do it once you straddled me.\u201d He\u2019s shaking his head like he\u2019s in disbelief and pulls me into a tight hug. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to dance for anyone but me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m confused by that. Does he mean he doesn\u2019t want me to dance for anyone else for the next three months?</p><p>As I\u2019m catching my breath, the thought fades and my mind moves on to other things I don\u2019t understand. I have to know if he felt the same unexplainable energy I did. \u201cDid you feel different?\u201d</p><p>He laughs and it vibrates against my chest. \u201cI swear I\u2019ve never come so hard in my life.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s exactly how I felt. \u201cMe, either, but it was strange. I almost felt hypnotized, like I was being controlled by something else more powerful than myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we were both being controlled by some mighty strong orgasms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you gave it to me. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He kisses my forehead. \u201cThank you for dancing for me. And for giving me sex so spectacular, I\u2019m not sure it can ever be topped.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say it, but I definitely think it\u2014we\u2019ve both just experienced something that can never be topped.</p><p>22</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>We\u2019re finishing dinner and I haven\u2019t been able to look at Laurelyn one second without remembering her on that pole. I\u2019ve been in a lot of strip clubs, but I\u2019ve never seen anything like what she did. No stripper on a pole ever made me feel that way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Putting that aside, there\u2019s much more to her than being sexy, and I can\u2019t wait to peel back all the layers to see what\u2019s underneath. If she\u2019ll let me. I worry she might not when I remember how she was about me learning her real name.</p><p>I\u2019m glad I found her. And grateful she is willing to give us a chance.</p><p>She lifts her eye from her plate and beams. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>I struggle, wondering if I should say anything. She might think I\u2019m being too much like a chickie babe if she knows what I\u2019m thinking, so I keep it simple. \u201cThank you for saying yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo us.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and reaches across the table to touch my hand. \u201cThank you for choosing me. And for running into me at the club. And for moving Ben\u2019s wine so you could steal a dance with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dance that was cut short.\u201d By none other than lover boy Ben. He is good at ruining things for me, but he won\u2019t ruin this now. I get up from the table and offer Laurelyn my hand. \u201cI would very much like to finish our dance.\u201d</p> <p>I take her in my arms and pull her close as we begin to move back and forth.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the song that was playing?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not musical like she is, but I could never forget the song. \u201cIt was \u2018Someone Like You\u2019 by Van Morrison.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cYou remember.\u201d</p><p>We sway to the silence for a while and then Laurelyn takes her head from my chest and asks me to kiss her. So I do. And that\u2019s the end of our dance. For now.</p><p>We\u2019re lying in bed. Laurelyn is so beautiful, I can\u2019t resist.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Lachlan?\u201d</p><p>She knows exactly what I\u2019m doing because she did the same thing to me earlier in the day. Except maybe I was wearing more clothes. \u201cI\u2019m getting pictures of you so I can see your beautiful face every time you call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure you\u2019re taking pictures of my face. It needs to be something presentable if it\u2019s going to pop up when I call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re very presentable right now. Besides, I\u2019ll need some visuals to get me by while I\u2019m out of town next week.\u201d</p><p>She holds her hands in front of her face. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m naked in your bed with sexed-up hair. That\u2019s not presentable by anyone\u2019s standards.\u201d</p><p>I grab both of her wrists in one of my hands and hold them hostage over her head. \u201cIt is very presentable by my standards and happens to be perfect for me to look at while I\u2019m away from you.\u201d I drop down and kiss her mouth. \u201cRelax, baby. No one\u2019s going to see these little beauties except me, so smile.\u201d</p><p>I put the phone on the bed so I have a free hand to tug on the sheet. \u201cWe need to drop this down so I can see a little more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLachlan!\u201d She smiles as she pretends to be shocked by what I\u2019m doing.</p> <p>I\u2019m still holding her wrists as I kiss her neck and whisper into her ear. \u201cCome on, Laurelyn. Please, let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you staying in Wagga Wagga for three months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m responsible for other vineyards and I can\u2019t neglect them. I\u2019ll still be here most of the time, until the middle of March.\u201d</p><p>I can sense her considering it, so I nuzzle my nose down her neck and plant a kiss to convince her. \u201cPlease, baby.\u201d</p><p>She sighs deeply. \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have you for at least three days. It\u2019s going to be torture.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cYou can take a few, but nothing completely nude.\u201d</p><p>I reach for my phone, but she stops me with her hand. \u201cI at least get to brush my hair first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boss.\u201d</p><p>She gets up and walks naked to the bathroom. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to snap a shot of her beautiful behind, but I know she\u2019ll kill me if I do. I remind myself of what she said. Nothing completely nude.</p><p>She comes out of the bathroom a few minutes later with freshly brushed hair, now cascading down her back. She\u2019s wearing thigh-highs with lace toppers. Hey, hey ... is this what she means by nothing completely nude?</p><p>She climbs onto the bed and is on her knees. \u201cHow do you want me?\u201d</p><p>Hearing that come from her is like a fantasy come true. I hold up my phone to take a picture and she puts her hand over it. \u201cI mean it. No nudies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Lie down first.\u201d</p><p>She falls to her back, pulls the sheet under her arms to cover her naked breasts, and waits for directions. \u201cScoop your hair up and let it spill across the pillow.\u201d She does and it falls in all the right places. My eyes roam her smooth, creamy skin against my black sheets and she\u2019s so beautiful, it\u2019s almost painful.</p><p>I take a lot of shots of her like that ... more than she intended, I\u2019m sure. When I\u2019m finished with her in that pose, she sits up. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s sitting with her knees pulled up, ankles crossed. I reach for the sheet and begin to pull it away. \u201cYou can\u2019t see anything. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and rolls her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re such a liar, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m inspecting these pictures when you\u2019re done and any tits, ass, or vagina shots are getting deleted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, yes, we certainly will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie down on your stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds an awfully lot like a command,\u201d she complains, but does it anyway. I pull the sheet low on her hips and caress her lower back. \u201cI love this part of your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love my back? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why. I just know I do.\u201d I take picture after picture of her silhouette with her lying on her stomach, her side, and sitting. When I can, I sneak the sheet down a little at a time until she busts me and lifts it higher again.</p><p>\u201cAre you done? Surely you\u2019ve used up all the phone\u2019s memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have one more pose I want you to do, but I won\u2019t if you\u2019re not comfortable with it.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her brow at me. \u201cThat sounds suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I position you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll agree to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll try it?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes at me again. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie on your back.\u201d She does as I tell her and waits for my direction, but this one won\u2019t be verbal commands. She\u2019ll never do it if she hears me say it.</p><p>I put my hands on her knees and spread them apart. I gather the sheet between her legs and twist it so that only a thin strip of material covers her. I bunch it up between her breasts and then take one of her hands and lay it over both breasts. She\u2019s still covered, so it\u2019s not really a nudie, but damn ... she is so hot.</p><p>Before I take the picture, I ask her. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>She swallows and then lifts her head to see what\u2019s covered. \u201cDon\u2019t move. You\u2019ll mess up your hair. Just let me take it and if you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll delete it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s torn. \u201cI promise everything is covered. No tits, ass, or vagina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She rests her head back on the pillow and I take picture after picture of her. She eventually relaxes and drops her knees further apart and relaxes the arm covering her breasts.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I ask for the hell of it. \u201cJust one nudie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>I can see I\u2019ve pushed my luck as far as I should, so I put the phone on the bed and drop down to kiss her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet. I may not let you keep any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not deleting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to approve. That\u2019s our deal.\u201d</p><p>I start peeling through them at rapid speed before she gets her hands on the phone. \u201cNone of them are nudie, so I get to keep all of them.\u201d</p><p>She holds out her hand. \u201cGimme.\u201d I pass her the phone like a teenage boy in trouble with his mum over a Playboy. I swear I\u2019ll take them all again while she\u2019s asleep if she erases the good ones.</p><p>I sit. I watch. I wait. She hoots and laughs as she goes through the first several and then I almost hear her brakes skid to a stop. \u201cNo way, bro. That one shows my nipples.\u201d She goes through a few more and then scrunches her eyebrows and brings the phone closer to her face. \u201cYou said you couldn\u2019t see anything when I was sitting like that, you liar. You can see my vajayjay in these.\u201d</p><p>Dammit! She\u2019s deleting all the great ones.</p><p>She passes the phone back to me and I go through to see what\u2019s left. It\u2019s not too bad. She only erased a handful. I\u2019m surprised I get to keep all the near nudies with her legs sprawled apart. In fact, it shocks the shit out of me. I wonder if she overlooked those, but I choose to not mention it, just in case.</p><p>She picks up the phone I gave her from the bedside table and then lies next to me on the bed. She holds it at arm\u2019s length to take our picture together. \u201cSay cheese.\u201d</p><p>I smile because she asks me to, knowing I shouldn\u2019t let her take these kinds of pictures of us in bed together. I only give in because she doesn\u2019t know how much money she can make by selling these photographs to the media. She has no idea I\u2019m Jack McLachlan. Even if she knew my name, she still wouldn\u2019t know I\u2019m one of Australia\u2019s richest and most eligible bachelors. I somehow think it wouldn\u2019t matter to her, even if she did know. She\u2019s the daughter of a superstar and his fame doesn\u2019t seem to phase her at all.</p><p>Oh, to hell with it. What\u2019s a few pictures going to hurt? I take the phone out of her hand and hold it out to get one of me kissing the side of her face. Then her mouth. Then her neck.</p><p>After my mouth reaches her breast, I drop her phone to the bed because our photo shoot is forgotten.</p><p>23</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>I wake before Lachlan for the first time, but it\u2019s because I don\u2019t feel well. I try to go back to sleep for an hour, but I\u2019m unsuccessful. My head is pounding at the base of my skull and I\u2019m nauseated as waves of heat flash throughout my body. I kick off the covers in an unsuccessful attempt to gain a little relief from the uncomfortable sensation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Please, don\u2019t puke.</p><p>The urge to vomit becomes more and more pressing. I try to suppress my body\u2019s demand, but my stomach betrays me and wins the battle. I dash from the bed to the bathroom and make it to the toilet right before I spew. I try to keep the noise to a minimum, as if subdued heaving is a possibility.</p><p>I hear a light tap at the bathroom door. Shit. I didn\u2019t lock it in my haste to reach the toilet. \u201cDon\u2019t come in here.\u201d</p> <p>The door opens and Lachlan enters in spite of my warning. I reach up and flush the toilet because I\u2019m uncomfortable with him seeing any of my body\u2019s previous contents. There are some pretenses I wish to maintain. \u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t want to see this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen people chunder before.\u201d Maybe so, but he\u2019s never seen me throw up.</p><p>He wets a washcloth with cold water and places it on the back of my neck. He takes my hair into his large hands and secures it with a clip. I don\u2019t even want to know how he learned to do that. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m embarrassed for him to see me this way. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re seeing me worship the porcelain god. I know how attractive this must be, but in my defense, I told you to not come in here.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s rubbing my shoulders to comfort me. \u201cI\u2019ll survive seeing you chunder. Think you\u2019re finished for now?\u201d</p><p>This has been happening to me for a while and I know the routine. Once I vomit, I\u2019m fine. \u201cI\u2019m better now.\u201d</p><p>Lachlan helps me back to bed. \u201cDo you think you ate something bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This happens to me out of the clear blue sometimes. I get a headache during the night and when I wake up, the pain is so bad, it makes me throw up. It\u2019s weird because once I vomit, I\u2019m fine. The pain goes away and so does the nausea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told your doctor about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve had scans and everything seems normal. My doctor diagnosed me with migraines.\u201d</p> <p>He examines my face like he\u2019s not so sure. \u201cI think you should lie down and rest.\u201d</p><p>I walk to the sink so I can brush my teeth and I argue with his reflection in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Lachlan. It was a migraine and now it\u2019s over. Promise.\u201d</p><p>He lets me finish brushing my teeth before he objects to what I\u2019m saying. \u201cI have to go out and check the grafts today. I want you to lie down while I\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with me, but this is what he wants, so I agree to do it. \u201cI\u2019ll lie down while you\u2019re gone, but let the record show I\u2019m only doing it to make you happy, not because there\u2019s anything wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>He watches me in the mirror as he kisses my cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s ridiculous to go to bed when there\u2019s nothing wrong with me, but I do it because he asks me to. I hear the shower cut on and consider getting up to step inside with him, but I know that won\u2019t go over well.</p><p>Why am I so eager to please this man?</p><p>When he finishes getting ready, he comes out of the bathroom and sits next to me on the bed. He strokes his fingers over my forehead and pushes my hair away from my face. He takes my phone from the nightstand and puts it on the bed for easy accessibility. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone a couple of hours, but I\u2019ll have my phone with me if you need anything. Don\u2019t hesitate to call.\u201d He leans down and kisses my forehead. \u201cFeel better.\u201d</p> <p>I could argue that nothing is wrong with me, but I don\u2019t. \u201cSure thing, boss.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019s gone, I reach for my phone and scroll through the pictures we took last night. He has the seminudes on his phone. I have the sweet ones where he\u2019s kissing my face, my mouth, and my neck. I come across one where he\u2019s looking at me like he adores me. He makes it so easy to forget about our agreement, but then I remember that there\u2019s a very logical reason for why. He\u2019s good at this game because he\u2019s played it before. On twelve prior occasions to be exact.</p><p>I put the phone down and close my eyes. When I open them again, Lachlan is sitting on the bed next to me. I lift my head to see the clock. Shit, it\u2019s almost ten o\u2019clock\u2014I must\u2019ve dozed off.</p><p>He passes a glass of orange juice to me. \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s so thoughtful. I sit up and take a drink. \u201cYes. Can I get out of bed now, Dr. Henry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you may, but I happen to like you in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it too, but it\u2019s no fun in here without you.\u201d</p><p>He grins and kisses the top of my head. \u201cLet me prepare you some breakfast. Would you care for a bagel with cream cheese or some cream cheese on a bagel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm ... I think I\u2019ll take the bagel with cream cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood choice. Come into the kitchen after you get ready and I\u2019ll have it in the toaster waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask Lachlan what we were doing today, so I shower and then dress in denim shorts, a tank, and flip-flops.</p><p>I go into the kitchen and as promised, there\u2019s a bagel in the toaster. Lachlan sees me walk into the kitchen and pops it down.</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s what I call service.\u201d I walk over to where he\u2019s standing and put my arms around his waist. \u201cAm I dressed okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor whatever we\u2019re doing today?\u201d</p><p>He slips his arms around my waist and squeezes me. \u201cI\u2019m going to be busy the next few days. I thought we might hang out here and take it easy. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d But I know why he doesn\u2019t want to get out and about. He\u2019s concerned about what happened morning. About me. I\u2019m fine, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll convince him of that. It\u2019s really too bad I\u2019ll be forced to lie around with him all day. Not.</p><p>24</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>I sit on the edge of the bed and look at Laurelyn lying on her stomach. I don\u2019t want to wake her, but I won\u2019t leave without saying goodbye.</p><p>I lean over and kiss the bare skin on her back and she stirs. I do it again and she makes a seductive moaning sound. It makes my dick twitch, but I don\u2019t have time to satisfy his needs this morning. I have to get on the road.</p><p>I kiss her shoulder. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>She rolls over and smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t go. Stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if I had a choice, but I\u2019d like to keep my job, so I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me one minute.\u201d She hops up and I hear the water running in the bathroom. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s brushing her teeth so she can give me a goodbye kiss I won\u2019t forget anytime soon.</p><p>She comes out, still naked, and pushes me back against the bed until I\u2019m sitting. She climbs up and straddles me. She must love doing that. I know I do. \u201cAt least kiss me before you go.\u201d</p><p>Her lips touch mine and I know this isn\u2019t good for my dick. How am I going to get out of here without rolling her onto her back and burying myself in her?</p><p>I keep it short, but not because it\u2019s what I want. \u201cBaby, I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Call me when you can.\u201d</p><p>I give her one last peck on the mouth. \u201cI will. Daniel will be here around ten, but stay as long as you like.\u201d</p><p>I get in my car and start my drive to Lovedale so I can take care of the problems at Marguerite Vineyard. While I\u2019m there, I have other business I need to tend. It\u2019s personal, and its name is Audrey Bagshaw.</p><p>I use voice command to call the one person I can trust with this issue. \u201cCall Jim Callaghan.\u201d</p><p>There are several rings before he answers. \u201cCallaghan Investigations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim, Jack McLachlan here.\u201d We politely greet each other, but we both know I\u2019m not calling about his well-being, so I cut the shit. \u201cI have a job for you. I understand it\u2019s short notice, but I need you to find someone for me fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mr. McLachlan. You know I\u2019m always glad to help you in any way I can.\u201d</p><p>He means he is always willing to be paid a generous sum, but I don\u2019t mind his motive. He gets the fast results I like and always keeps the work he does for me on the down-low. \u201cPerfect. Her name is Audrey Bagshaw and she lives in Lovedale. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll be for the next three days and I want to see her while I\u2019m in town. There\u2019s an extra thousand in it for you if you can have her located for me by tonight.\u201d</p><p>I fill him in on the information I have and he gives me reassurance that I will be reunited with companion number three within the next twelve hours if he finds her still living in Lovedale.</p><p>It\u2019s late afternoon when I arrive at Marguerite, and everything appears to be business as usual, but I know this isn\u2019t the case at all. There is evil fuckery afoot here.</p><p>First, there was the attempt to burn the crops at Chalice and now someone has poisoned a section of Marguerite. The damage at both vineyards has been minimal, but the intent behind the act is what disturbs me. Is someone trying to ruin me or draw me away from Avalon?</p><p>My head man, Alfredo, greets me in the drive. He\u2019s a plump, round Italian with a talent for the vine that only rivals that of my father.</p><p>As we drive out to the area where the crop is stunted and crinkled, Alfredo briefs me on the problems. He stops the ATV in front of an injured vine and walks toward it. He takes the leaves in his hand. \u201cI tell you, it\u2019s glyphosate poisoning, Mr. McLachlan.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to inspect any further because he\u2019s correct. I\u2019ve seen it before. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Alfredo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t use glyphosate here. This was brought in and done on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who would do it, Mr. McLachlan. None of the help has a grievance with you.\u201d</p><p>He appears nervous, as though I might blame him since he is overseer of the vineyard, but I know he\u2019s not responsible. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t your fault, Alfredo. It\u2019s sabotage, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s by anyone at Marguerite. There\u2019s another party involved and I intend on finding out who it is and what they hope to accomplish.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He drives me around so we can inspect the damaged vines. It\u2019s a much larger area than I expected and I wonder if there\u2019s damage we don\u2019t see yet. By no means is it a ruined crop, but this is a serious attempt at ruining my livelihood. With this second sabotage, I\u2019ll be forced to put the other vineyards on alert. I\u2019ll need additional staff to watch and patrol all of them until harvest time. The extra staff through March will be a huge expense. The responsible party might not have accomplished what they set out to do, but they achieved plenty by targeting my pockets.</p><p>When I finish inspecting the fields, Alfredo takes me back to the house. It feels lonely. I don\u2019t have Daniel or Mrs. Porcelli with me this trip since I\u2019m only staying a few days, but that\u2019s not who I\u2019m missing. I\u2019ve already become accustomed to having Laurelyn with me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t ask her to come since I\u2019m planning a visit with Audrey. Despite the terms regarding our relationship, I wouldn\u2019t expect her to respond well to being left at the house alone while I\u2019m with a previous companion.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t been to the Marguerite vineyard in months, so the house has been vacant and I find the kitchen empty. I don\u2019t see a point in a trip to the market since I don\u2019t have Mrs. Porcelli here to cook, so I\u2019m reduced to eating out alone, which I despise.</p><p>Lovedale restaurants aren\u2019t formal, but I decide to change for dinner. All I find in the closet are trousers and dress shirts. No jeans or T-shirts. That\u2019s the problem with not having a permanent home. I never know what I need where.</p><p>I go to my favorite restaurant in Lovedale and I\u2019m escorted toward the back of the restaurant. I\u2019m seated at one of the tables I\u2019ve shared with Audrey many times during our month-long relationship over three years ago. I\u2019m scanning the wine selection when my phone rings. It\u2019s Jim. Perfect. I hope he has good news for me.</p><p>\u201cJack McLachlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. McLachlan, I\u2019m calling you with some good news. It appears that Miss Bagshaw is still living in Lovedale. I have her current address and phone number. Would you like me to email those to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmail the address but call off her number to me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201c55-7031-3210.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat work. You\u2019ll have your money, along with the extra thousand, in your account tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. McLachlan. As always, it\u2019s been a pleasure doing business with you.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it\u2019s been a five-thousand-dollar pleasure.</p><p>I immediately dial Audrey\u2019s number and it goes to voicemail. I was Drake Connelly to her three years ago, but she discovered my true identity so there\u2019s no reason in pretending to be anyone but myself. \u201cAudrey, it\u2019s Jack McLachlan. I need to see you as soon as possible. Please, call me at this number.\u201d</p> <p>I order a merlot and the lasagna and I\u2019m finishing when my phone rings. I see Audrey\u2019s number and I\u2019m happy she has returned my call so soon. Maybe she\u2019ll agree to meet me tonight. \u201cHello, Audrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Jack. Long time, no see. How have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very good. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better, but I think you know that already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so now you want to see me. Am I supposed to come running because the great and all-mighty Jack McLachlan has changed his mind?\u201d</p><p>I tell her huskily, \u201cDon\u2019t be that way, Audrey.\u201d</p><p>She hesitates but we both already know she\u2019ll agree. \u201cOkay. Where do you want to meet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe usual place. I\u2019ll text you the room number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not far from the hotel, but I want to finish dinner. I\u2019m not that anxious to see her. \u201cAn hour.\u201d</p><p>After I end the call, I flag my server. \u201cI\u2019ll need another merlot.\u201d And then probably another for what I\u2019m about to do.</p><p>Three glasses of wine later, I check into the Hotel Armand and text Audrey with the room number. I\u2019m there less than ten minutes when I hear her knock on the door.</p><p>I open the door and she\u2019s wearing a black trench coat with extremely high heels. She has traded her long, fiery hair for a medium-length cut with blunt bangs. I hate it.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Audrey.\u201d I open the door wider. \u201cPlease, come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She grazes her finger across my chest as she walks through the door.</p><p>\u201cPlease, have a seat.\u201d I walk over to the wet bar. \u201cWould you care for a drink? A bourbon, perhaps? Seems like I recall that being your favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember well.\u201d</p><p>I pour her drink and then take it to her where she is sitting on the bed. She holds it up to me. \u201cA toast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should we toast to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo reunions.\u201d</p><p>I sit next to her and tip the edge of my glass to hers. \u201cTo reunions.\u201d</p><p>We sip the bourbon and then she gets up and places her glass on the table. She unties the waist of her coat and opens it to reveal her naked body underneath. She walks over and stands between my knees. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much, Jack.\u201d</p><p>She leans forward to kiss me and I stop her by placing a finger over her lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you here for that.\u201d</p><p>She tries to climb onto the bed to straddle me and I catch her by her waist. \u201cI can change your mind, Jack. You know I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She drops to her knees in front of me and reaches for my belt buckle. \u201cYou know what I can do for you and you love it. I know you remember how much you love being in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>I try to push her hand away, but her grip is like steel. \u201cNo, Audrey. There\u2019s someone else.\u201d</p><p>She immediately stops, but her grip doesn\u2019t loosen. She\u2019s angry. I see it in her eyes. \u201cThere will never be anyone else for you but me. I\u2019m the only one who knows you, Jack.\u201d She puts emphasis on my name as she says it.</p><p>\u201cYou might know who I am, but you\u2019ll never be the one for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis new woman doesn\u2019t know your name. She\u2019s just another no one to you. You don\u2019t owe her monogamy.\u201d Again, she\u2019s fumbling with my belt. \u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I? She\u2019s no one special. Just another one of your fake relationships.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve had more than enough of this and there\u2019s only one way to make her stop this nonsense. \u201cQuit, Audrey.\u201d I lean forward until we\u2019re eye to eye. She thinks I\u2019m going to kiss her, but she\u2019s dead wrong. \u201cI know you started the fire at Chalice. I also know you poisoned Marguerite and I\u2019m here to give you the courtesy of a warning. Don\u2019t fuck with me, Audrey.\u201d</p><p>She sits back on her heels. \u201cJack ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it. I came here to let you know I\u2019m on to you. Now I\u2019ve done that, so put your coat back on and get the fuck out of my sight. I never want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>She grabs her coat from the floor and cinches the belt. \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret what you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already do.\u201d</p><p>After I leave the hotel and I\u2019m closed up in my car with her scent, the only thing I can smell is that damn sweet, floral fragrance. It\u2019s on my skin and clothes and I despise it. I can\u2019t believe I ever thought it was pleasant, let alone appealing. It\u2019s nauseating and I want it gone. Now.</p><p>As soon as I\u2019m back at the vineyard, I forgo calling Laurelyn and head straight to the shower. I have to wash away the last bit of physical contact I hope to ever have with that crazy bitch.</p><p>I hear Laurelyn\u2019s ringtone, \u201cCrash Into Me\u201d, as I stand in the shower scrubbing my skin, but she\u2019ll have to wait until I erase the last evidence of Audrey\u2019s touch from my body.</p><p>I listen to Laurelyn\u2019s voicemail as soon as I\u2019m out, not even waiting until I\u2019m dressed. \u201cHey, caveman. I just wanted to tell you something before I went to bed. Call me back when you get a chance.\u201d</p><p>I walk toward the bedroom wearing only a towel and call her immediately. I don\u2019t want to wait another minute to hear her voice. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, baby.\u201d</p><p>The tone in her voice elevates. \u201cHey, you. I\u2019m glad you called. Normally, I\u2019m not all that excited about this and needing to share it with anyone, but you wanted to know, so I\u2019m calling to tell you I got my period.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. I\u2019d forgotten about it, so I guess I wasn\u2019t as worried as I thought. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d like that. Have you been very busy today?\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s kept me busy while I\u2019ve been here disgusts me. \u201cI\u2019ve been busier than I wanted to be, but I\u2019ve still thought of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a sweet thing to say. Everything okay at the vineyard?\u201d</p><p>I fully expect it to be now that I\u2019ve told Audrey I\u2019m onto her little game. \u201cThere are some definite issues at Marguerite, but I think I\u2019ll have them under control soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, they just needed the big man to come along and take care of things. Show them how it\u2019s done, right?\u201d</p><p>Yes, the big man is on campus. She has no idea how big the big man really is. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you still be staying until New Year\u2019s Day?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to, but it\u2019s necessary. I wish I could be back to celebrate with Laurelyn. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to. Will you be making plans with Addison for New Year\u2019s Eve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to The Blues Club with Zac and they\u2019ve invited me to go. It\u2019s open mic night again.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m certain that means Ben Donavon is going too and will probably consider Laurelyn his date, but I don\u2019t ask because I don\u2019t want the confirmation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a great time. I wish I could be there to hear you sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll dedicate one to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s hardly fair. I won\u2019t be there to hear it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s very unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>I miss her. \u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want the truth, or shall I describe some terribly sexy lingerie so you can fantasize?\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t help it. I want to know what she\u2019s wearing while Ben Donavon is sleeping only a few feet from her. I need to know what he\u2019ll see if they run into each other on the way to the bathroom. \u201cThe truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing an incredibly unsexy T-shirt and boxer shorts.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve seen her definition of unsexy and I couldn\u2019t agree less. One of her sexiest moments was when she was wearing jogging pants and had her hair piled in a messy bun on top of her head. \u201cBaby, you couldn\u2019t be unsexy if you tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLachlan. You\u2019re wrong, but I thank you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve felt all right today? No more headaches or vomiting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve felt really good today.\u201d</p><p>She scared the shit out of me. \u201cI was worried yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I worried you, but really ... I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Is she really okay? \u201cYou\u2019d tell me if you weren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late and I should probably let you get to sleep. It\u2019s not a bad idea for me to catch up on my slumber since someone has been keeping me up late at night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you might find it easier to get a little sleep if you weren\u2019t instigating late-night activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like my instigating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much, Mr. Henry. I like your late-night instigations. And your morning ones. And your midday ones. Hell, I like all of your instigating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that next time I see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, be sure you do. Now, get some sleep, Mr. Henry. You have a lot of instigating to do when you return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I do.\u201d</p> <p>25</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>I\u2019m applying my makeup to go out for New Year\u2019s Eve and I\u2019m totally bummed. I thought bringing in the new year in Australia would be some kind of spectacular experience, but it won\u2019t be because Lachlan isn\u2019t here to celebrate with me. And he won\u2019t be here to kiss me at midnight.</p><p>I\u2019m smoking up my eyes with black liner while Addison is in the shower talking nonstop about Zac. I really want to tell her to shut up. I know I\u2019m being completely selfish, but if I can\u2019t be with Lachlan, I don\u2019t want to hear about all the things she\u2019s going to do to rock Zac\u2019s world tonight.</p><p>Enough is enough. \u201cI\u2019m going to the bedroom to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time.\u201d I\u2019m wrapped in a towel as I peek out the door to be sure Ben isn\u2019t around before I streak to the bedroom. After I see that the coast is clear, I make a break for it. I\u2019m not four steps down the hall when I run right smack into him. Literally.</p><p>I look up as I grasp my towel tightly. Being so close to him while wearing so little feels wrong. Really wrong. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t make a move or say a word as his eyes roam my body. I dart around him and run for the bedroom door, slamming it behind me. Shit. That was more than just a little unpleasant.</p><p>I stand in front of the closet searching through what has now become community property. There\u2019s no mine or yours. I pull out a black strapless with a wide red waist sash and hold it up to myself as I look in the mirror. It\u2019s Addison\u2019s so of course it\u2019s going to be short on me, but I like it. It\u2019s sexy as hell. I don\u2019t know why I care. I have no one to impress.</p><p>I\u2019m standing in front of the mirror with the dress when Addison comes into the bedroom. \u201cNice choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t going to wear it, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m wearing the electric blue one.\u201d</p><p>I put on the dress and Addison zips it for me. It\u2019s tight but it squeezes me in all the right places. It\u2019s a sexy dress and I\u2019m hot in it, but instead of being proud of the way I look, I\u2019m disappointed Lachlan isn\u2019t here to see me. Maybe I\u2019ll text pictures of myself to show him what he\u2019s missing.</p><p>When we\u2019re finished getting ready, we go into the living room where Zac and Ben are ready and waiting. Zac is up and at Addison\u2019s side immediately, telling her how beautiful she is. Ben is staring at me and I begin to feel really uncomfortable. Even more so than I did when we met in the hallway. Somehow I feel more naked than I did when I was wearing only a towel.</p><p>I wish things weren\u2019t like this between Ben and me. I wish we could talk and laugh like friends instead of constantly being swallowed up by all of this uneasiness.</p><p>The four of us leave the apartment building and catch a cab to the club so everyone can drink. I\u2019m sure to take the seat in the front so I\u2019m not stuck sitting with Ben in the back. Maybe it\u2019s childish, but I don\u2019t care. He doesn\u2019t need the least bit of encouragement.</p><p>Ben holds the door for me as we walk into the club. As I walk past him, he leans close to me. \u201cYou\u2019re exceptionally beautiful tonight, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s sweet the way he says it. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I would\u2019ve been interested in him if there had been no Lachlan. But there is a Lachlan. And he\u2019s the only one I want. \u201cThank you, Ben. You\u2019re very handsome tonight. Every girl in the place is going to swoon over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept the one I want.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Why\u2019d he have to call out the pink elephant in the room?</p><p>I say nothing and walk to the table Zac and Addison have chosen close to the stage. Of course, they\u2019re sitting together so that means Ben and I must sit together.</p><p>Since it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve, I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s going to be some real entertainment. Open mic has already started and there\u2019s a woman doing an Adele song on the karaoke machine. She\u2019s mimicking every note like Adele\u2014I imagine she\u2019s been singing in the mirror all week to get ready for her big performance.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a sign-up sheet if you want to sing. You might want to go ahead and put your name down. I\u2019m sure the list is long since it\u2019s a big night.\u201d</p><p>I grab Addison by the hand and pull her from her chair. \u201cCome on. You didn\u2019t sing last time and you were the one chanting the loudest for me to get up on stage.\u201d</p><p>Ben is right\u2014the list is very long. Addison and I sign up, but I\u2019ll be surprised if we\u2019re called before midnight. I\u2019ll probably be too drunk to remember how to sing.</p><p>Our waitress places a Sauvignon Blanc in front of me. I ordered it because it\u2019s one of the wines I\u2019ve come to enjoy since meeting Lachlan. I take a drink and I\u2019m surprised how a glass of wine can make me feel closer to him, even when he\u2019s seven hours away.</p><p>One after another, people take the stage. Some are decent while many are a disaster, but it\u2019s all for fun and I think everyone in the club claps louder for the ones who suck. It\u2019s called a pity clap.</p><p>About fifteen minutes before midnight, Addison is called to the stage, which means I\u2019m next. She\u2019s pretty drunk and I\u2019m just hoping for her sake that she doesn\u2019t screw this up.</p><p>She takes the guitar from its stand and sits on the stool before she puts the strap over her neck. She strums several times and I get a glimpse of how I must\u2019ve looked on stage, minus the drunk part.</p><p>She begins to sing \u201cYou Were Meant for Me\u201d by Jewel, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because she\u2019s trying to send a not-so-subtle message to Zac or because it\u2019s a song she felt certain she could pull off drunk. Regardless, Zac doesn\u2019t take his eyes off her and I\u2019m envious.</p><p>She finishes and the crowd claps wildly. As they should. She gave a great performance.</p><p>I\u2019m called to the stage next and I take my place at the piano this time. There\u2019s no damn way I\u2019d sing this song if Lachlan were here, but he\u2019s not and it\u2019s my own little private joke with myself.</p><p>I lean into the mic and address the crowd because I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m an entertainer. It\u2019s in my blood. It\u2019s what I do.</p><p>\u201cEverybody ready to bring in the New Year?\u201d The crowd responds loudly, letting me know they\u2019re having a right nice time. \u201cI toyed with this song on a piano the other day and decided I\u2019d do my own rendition. I sort of liked the way it sounded.\u201d I play a few notes as I speak to the crowd. \u201cHell, I loved the way it sounded, but I\u2019m going to let you guys tell me what you think. This is \u2018Private Dancer\u2019 by the lovely Tina Turner.\u201d</p><p>Chills come over me as I begin to sing. I lean toward the mic. \u201c\u2018Well, the men come in these places ... And the men are all the same ... You don\u2019t look at their faces ... And you don\u2019t ask their names.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes as I sing because I don\u2019t want to see the crowd. I want to think of the private dance I did for Lachlan. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m your private dancer ... A dancer for money ... I\u2019ll do what you want me to do ... I\u2019m your private dancer ... A dancer for money ... And any old music will do.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I forget I\u2019m in front of a crowd and become lost in the lyrics. \u201c\u2018Let me loosen up your collar ... Tell me ... Do you want to see me do the shimmy again?\u2019\u201d</p><p>When I\u2019m finished singing, I return from the place I\u2019ve been. I come off stage and they announce that the countdown is only three minutes away.</p><p>Geez, I hope Ben doesn\u2019t try to lay one on me. What would I do about that?</p><p>I prop my chin in my hand and wish for the millionth time I were with Lachlan when my phone vibrates on the table and lights up with a new text message. I smile when I see it\u2019s from Lachlan. He\u2019s probably wishing me a Happy New Year.</p><p>*Yes. I\u2019d like 2 CU do the shimmy again.*</p><p>He\u2019s here. My head pops up and I begin my search in the sea of faces. When I don\u2019t find him in the crowd, I text him. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t find him in time for the countdown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>*Where RU?*</p><p>A moment later I feel his hands around my waist and his mouth against my ear. \u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p>I spin around and look at him in disbelief. \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t be back until tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI busted my ass to get everything done and left Lovedale this afternoon so we could be together for the countdown. I didn\u2019t want anyone else kissing you at midnight.\u201d</p><p>I know how that translates. He doesn\u2019t want Ben to kiss me, but what Lachlan doesn\u2019t realize is that there would\u2019ve been no New Year\u2019s kiss for me if it didn\u2019t come from him.</p><p>\u201cFive. Four. Three. Two. One!\u201d</p><p>He takes my face in his hands and kisses me hard as \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d plays loudly. When he lets me go, he pulls back so he can see my eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome home with me.\u201d</p> <p>26</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>We drive to the apartment and I sit in the car while Laurelyn goes inside to pack a bag. While I\u2019m waiting for her to return, a cab stops at the curb and Ben gets out. He stumbles as he makes his way to the building. He appears drunk. I want to go up to the apartment as I watch him, but I don\u2019t because Laurelyn should be on her way down any second. And I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t get along with drunk Ben any better than I do with sober Ben.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t come down but I wait a little longer and then something doesn\u2019t feel right. To hell with this. I want to know what\u2019s taking her so long, so I get out and stalk toward the building. I press the buzzer and get no answer, so I press it again and then hear Laurelyn\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost finished. Be right down.\u201d I hear Ben shout something in the background, but I can\u2019t make out what it is.</p><p>\u201cBuzz me in, Laurelyn. Now.\u201d</p> <p>I hear the latch on the door release and I don\u2019t wait for the elevator. I take the stairs two at a time until I reach the third-floor apartment. I pound on the door and as soon as Laurelyn opens it, I can see she\u2019s been crying. I glance at him and then back to her. \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She won\u2019t look at me and it\u2019s because something happened. And it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to piss me off.</p><p>\u201cTell me what the hell he did to you, Laurelyn!\u201d</p><p>She picks up her bag. \u201cCan we just go, please?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t feel like going. He did something to her and I\u2019m going to find out what. I step inside the apartment toward Ben. \u201cWhat the hell did you do?\u201d</p><p>Laurelyn steps in front of me, between Ben and me. She can see where this is going. She puts her hands on my chest and shakes her head while she pleads, \u201cPlease don\u2019t, Lachlan. He\u2019s my best friend\u2019s brother. I don\u2019t want this to become a problem between me and Addison.\u201d</p><p>I reach for her bag on the floor as I glare at Ben. I\u2019m going to find out what you did.</p><p>We leave the apartment and I say nothing until we\u2019re in my car and I can\u2019t stand it any longer. I have to know. \u201cTell me, Laurelyn.\u201d</p> <p>Her head is lowered and she\u2019s staring at her hands in her lap. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moving this car until you tell me what he did.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s dark, but the spill from the streetlights shines on her face and I see that she\u2019s crying. \u201cI really just want to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not going to tell me anything while we\u2019re here. She knows I\u2019ll go up there and beat the shit out of him if he hurt her. I start the car and pull away. When we\u2019re on the highway, I reach for her hand and bring it to my lips.</p><p>She sighs deeply. \u201cHe came into my room and saw me packing. He knew I was going to stay with you, so he asked me not to leave. When I told him I was going with you, he grabbed me and started kissing me. I pushed him away and he told me I was nothing more than a whore to you.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s only one word to describe the feeling raging inside me: fury.</p><p>I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t tell me while we were there because I would have flown into a blind rage. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure I wasn\u2019t going to turn around and go back to kick his ass. \u201cYou\u2019re not staying with him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLachlan, don\u2019t be ridiculous. I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I\u2019ll get you your own apartment.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s shaking her head. \u201cNo, Lachlan. I can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the only other option is for you to stay with me at the vineyard because you\u2019re not going back to stay with him.\u201d I\u2019m watching the road, but that doesn\u2019t keep me from feeling her watch me in the dark. \u201cPacking every few days is getting old anyway, right? And you never have all the things you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you have to go out of town sometimes? Where will I stay when you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay at the vineyard without me. Mrs. Porcelli would probably like the company and Daniel can drive you if you need to go anywhere. I don\u2019t know. Maybe you\u2019ll come with me on some of my trips.\u201d</p><p>Is she considering it? \u201cBaby, I don\u2019t want you there with him anymore,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cAddison will be upset with me if I move out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019d be more upset if something happened between you and her brother and it ruined your friendship,\u201d I counter. \u201cBesides, she stays with Zac most nights, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she agrees.</p><p>\u201cTell me you will.\u201d</p><p>She hesitates before answering. \u201cOkay, I will.\u201d</p><p>I bring her hand to my lips again and kiss it. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back for your things in a day or two after I cool down. There\u2019s no way I can be near that little fucker right now without killing him.\u201d</p><p>Okay. It\u2019s a done deal; Laurelyn is moving in with me for the next two and half months. This isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve done before. Hell, I\u2019d never allowed any of my companions to visit one my houses or vineyards. I couldn\u2019t chance the connection afterwards, but it doesn\u2019t matter if Laurelyn makes the connection. She will be nine thousand miles away once we\u2019re over so it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>She\u2019s being unusually quiet and I\u2019m worried about the things spinning through her head. I hope she isn\u2019t putting any merit into Ben telling her I think of her as my whore.</p><p>I give her hand a little squeeze where it rests on my thigh. \u201cBen is wrong. You\u2019re not a whore to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I not? Didn\u2019t I agree to a sexual relationship with a man I didn\u2019t know in exchange for the time of my life? That\u2019s as good as being paid for sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurelyn, we are two consenting adults. We have great sex, but I don\u2019t pay you for it. We have a great time together because we\u2019re friends. We enjoy spending time together and it has absolutely nothing to do with sex. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t sound convinced but the doubt Ben placed in her mind is fresh. She\u2019ll need time to forget about his cruel words. For now, I choose to say nothing else about it and instead change the topic. \u201cYanks have New Year\u2019s traditions, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s a southern tradition of eating black-eyed peas and ham hocks on New Year\u2019s Day. It\u2019s supposed to bring you luck throughout the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I have Mrs. Porcelli cook that for you today?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s laughing now. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t eat ham hock, whatever that is, so that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>At some point in the drive, she becomes quiet and I think she has Ben\u2019s accusation on her mind again until I realize her hand has relaxed. She\u2019s fallen asleep. I pull into the garage and park, but take a moment to watch her sleeping. As I brush her hair from her face, she reminds me of a sleeping angel and I can\u2019t understand how that bastard could hurt her by saying such horrible things.</p><p>I brush my fingers against her cheek. \u201cLaurelyn, we\u2019re home.\u201d She stirs a little and I think about how that came out all wrong. \u201cWe\u2019re at the vineyard.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t wake so I get out and go around to her side of the car. I scoop her out to carry her to bed. I take a few steps toward the door and she tries to focus on me with exhausted eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m carrying you to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been carried to bed since I was three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you can say you haven\u2019t been carried to bed since you were twenty-two.\u201d</p><p>I place her on what I have come to think of as her side of the bed. She seems to have gone back to sleep already. I note the cocktail dress she\u2019s wearing and I\u2019m certain she doesn\u2019t want to sleep in it, so I pull a T-shirt out of my drawers for her.</p><p>I slip off one of her shoes and she inhales heavily as I remove the second one. \u201cThank you, Lachlan.\u201d</p><p>I place her shoes on the floor next to the footboard. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are closed as she says, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean for carrying me to bed. I mean for everything. You treat me like I\u2019m somebody instead of a nobody.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s showing me a new side of herself. It\u2019s childlike and damaged. I know in my gut that this moment has nothing to do with anything Ben said. She carries an old scar and it causes her deep pain.</p><p>I brush my fingers down her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re such a special person. You should always be treated like somebody.\u201d</p><p>She reaches for my hand and holds it against her face, but doesn\u2019t say anything. I want to tell her how her heart belongs to someone she\u2019s yet to meet and she\u2019ll be loved and adored by one bloody lucky man someday. She\u2019ll have his babies just like she told me she wanted to do and he\u2019ll love her in a way like she\u2019s never known.</p><p>But I can\u2019t tell her these things. And I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>27</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>I open my eyes and I\u2019m alone. Waking in Lachlan\u2019s bed without him has become a routine morning for me since I haven\u2019t been spending many nights at Ben\u2019s. And then it hits me. I remember what happened with my host and why I won\u2019t be staying with him anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I dread telling Addison because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to say.

I\u2019ll just tell her what happened and that I can\u2019t stay there anymore. It\u2019s that simple.</p><p>She answers on the first ring. \u201cCall back when I\u2019m not hungover and ready to hurl.\u201d</p><p>She must have drunk a lot more after I left. \u201cRough night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Rough morning. You don\u2019t sound too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d I stopped drinking after Lachlan came to the club.</p> <p>\u201cYou disappeared on us last night. I guess you went home with lover boy.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s just like her to not remember. \u201cI told you I was leaving with him. Your drunk ass just doesn\u2019t remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Here goes nothing. \u201cI need to talk you about something that happened last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>It definitely isn\u2019t okay. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Are you at Ben\u2019s or Zac\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cZac\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Good. At least she finally had the guts to stay all night. \u201cBen and I had an incident last night. He came into our room while I was packing a bag to take to Lachlan\u2019s. He asked me to stay with him instead of leaving. I told him no and he tried to kiss me. When I pushed him away, he called me a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Laurelyn. Ben was really drunk last night. I\u2019m sure he regrets the whole thing this morning.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s his sister, but I didn\u2019t expect her to take his side so completely. \u201cHe may, but I can\u2019t live with someone who calls me a whore. We\u2019re coming for my things and I\u2019m going to stay with Lachlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean until this blows over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s asked me to stay with him until we go home, and I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to. I\u2019ll make arrangements to come to the apartment for my things in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAddison, I know him as well as you know Zac. There\u2019s no difference.\u201d That wasn\u2019t entirely true, but I felt like I knew most of the important things, even if it didn\u2019t include his name.</p> <p>\u201cFair point well made, I guess.\u201d Good. I didn\u2019t feel like arguing with her over this.</p><p>\u201cLachlan works long days, so call me next week when Zac is busy and we\u2019ll get together. Maybe we\u2019ll go shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and think of how differently our stay in Australia is from what I imagined. Addison and I haven\u2019t been apart for more than a day in four years, and now our time together is barely existent. I could tell she didn\u2019t care much for me staying with Lachlan, but she\u2019d get over it. She was spending as much time as she could with Zac and that meant I was going to be stuck alone with Ben, so I didn\u2019t feel a bit guilty about leaving to be with Lachlan.</p><p>I\u2019m still wearing Lachlan\u2019s T-shirt, which barely covers my panties, when I leave the bedroom in search of him. I go into the kitchen first and find the open refrigerator door. I slip over to him with the agility of a lioness and wait for him to close it so I can surprise him, but when the door swings shut, it\u2019s me who gets the shock.</p><p>I\u2019m standing face to face with a woman, not Lachlan.</p><p>She smiles at me while diverting her eyes away from my bare legs. \u201cMiss Beckett?\u201d</p><p>I reach for the bottom of the T-shirt and pull it lower on my legs, as if it\u2019s somehow going to cover my bareness. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I tug harder on the shirt and realize I\u2019m stretching it to the point of almost ripping. \u201cI\u2019m Mrs. Porcelli. It\u2019s very nice to meet you. May I cook you something for brekkie? Do you like omelets?\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit, I\u2019m mortified. I completely forgot that Mrs. Porcelli would be here today. Now, here I stand to greet her wearing my panties and Lachlan\u2019s T-shirt, which I\u2019m sure she recognizes since she does his laundry.</p><p>\u201cUmm, yes. Thank you. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll be back in just a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, dear.\u201d</p><p>I pull the shirt over my panties as I streak toward the bedroom. Once inside, I shut the door and lean against it. I put my finger gun to my head and pull the trigger. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did that.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m bent over rummaging through my bag when I\u2019m startled by hands creeping around my waist and warm breath on the back of my neck. I let out a panicked screech and spin around to give Lachlan a slap across his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t sneak up like that. You scared the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>He thinks it\u2019s hilarious. \u201cSorry. I promise that scaring you wasn\u2019t what I was going for. I had something much more like this on my mind.\u201d</p><p>He brings his lips to mine and I forget my disgruntlement with him. I feel one of his hands slide inside my panties over my bottom. \u201cOh, no you don\u2019t, Mr. Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just met Mrs. Porcelli, while wearing this, I might add, and now she\u2019s cooking breakfast for me. It\u2019ll be rude, not to mention awkward, if I don\u2019t go back out there to eat what she\u2019s cooking for me.\u201d</p><p>He slides his other hand inside my shirt until he reaches my breast and flicks his thumb over my nipple until it\u2019s hard. He lowers his mouth to my ear. \u201cShe\u2019ll never know, babe. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll know and then she\u2019ll see it all over my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she won\u2019t. You\u2019re making too much of it.\u201d He moves his hand from the back of my panties to the front.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already going to know that I\u2019m the latest one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe latest what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompanion or whatever she calls us.\u201d Maybe whore.</p><p>\u201cNo, she won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s confusing me and it has nothing to do with his hand in my panties turning my brain to mush. \u201cHow could she not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about the others. She\u2019s going to think you\u2019re my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>How can she not know about the others if she goes everywhere with him? \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe others never came to the vineyards, so you\u2019re the first one she\u2019s seen.\u201d</p><p>Well, this is a revelation. \u201cWhere did you take the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHotels.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised by this news. And puzzled. Why am I allowed into his private world when none of the others have been?</p><p>I don\u2019t have much time to absorb what he\u2019s told me because I feel his hands on my hips pushing my panties down. \u201cI\u2019ll be a minuteman. Promise.\u201d</p><p>I give into him like I always do and step out of my panties before letting him guide me toward the unmade bed. I fall back and he reaches into the nightstand drawer. I hear those familiar sounds before he grabs my ankles to yank me to the edge of the bed where he\u2019s standing. \u201cPut your legs around me.\u201d</p><p>I do as he says and then he\u2019s inside me. \u201cThis is going to be quick, but only because it\u2019s the way you want it.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t kidding. He\u2019s slamming into me fast and hard. He grasps my thighs tightly to keep from propelling me to the other side of the bed. In one quick motion, I bring my legs from his waist to his shoulders and it does him in. He thrusts deeply one last time and I hear him call my name. \u201cOh, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>I love the way he says my name when he comes.</p><p>My ankles are still hooked over his shoulders and he\u2019s smiling down at me. He kisses the inside of my leg before he helps me to stand. \u201cI\u2019m going out to check the grafts while you have brekkie. I\u2019ll be gone a couple of hours and then we\u2019ll have the rest of the day to do anything you want.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m guessing his vacation from work will be over tomorrow, so I want to take advantage of our last free day together. \u201cCan we hang out by the pool and swim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want, baby.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my panties from the floor and holds them out for me. He kisses the inside of my thigh as I step into them. My hands are on his shoulders for balance as he pulls them up my legs and I can\u2019t resist commenting on it. \u201cYou put my panties back on almost as much as you take them off.\u201d</p><p>He pats my bottom when they\u2019re in place. \u201cI guess I do. Now, get dressed and go enjoy your brekkie. I\u2019ll see you in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll have to shower after breakfast, so I pull my hair into a ponytail and quickly slip into shorts and a T-shirt of my own. The aroma coming from the kitchen is heavenly and I enter just as Mrs. Porcelli is plating a scrumptious-looking omelet. \u201cSmells delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. May I pour you some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much of a coffee drinker. I\u2019ll have juice, but I can get it. You\u2019ve already done so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to get it for you, dear.\u201d I don\u2019t argue and take my seat at the bar where my omelet awaits. She places a tall glass of orange juice in front of me and I feel uneasy about allowing her to serve me.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I begin to eat while she cleans the mess from preparing my breakfast. This makes me feel even guiltier. \u201cI can do that when I\u2019m finished eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Beckett, relax and enjoy your omelet.\u201d</p><p>Miss Beckett isn\u2019t my name. \u201cOkay, but will you please call me Laurelyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you worked for ...?\u201d Oh, shit. I don\u2019t know his name. At least not the one Mrs. Porcelli would use.</p><p>\u201cI call him Mr. McLachlan, dear. He\u2019s my employer and although I\u2019m old enough to be his mother, I wouldn\u2019t feel right calling him by his first name.\u201d</p><p>McLachlan. I laugh to myself because it appears as though we had the same idea when we chose our aliases. I have to wonder. Is this a slip-up in his carefully orchestrated plan or is he relaxing his unbending relationship rules? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Surely, he considered this possibility. He must\u2019ve known Mrs. Porcelli would say his name in front of me at some point since I\u2019m staying here full-time.</p><p>I decide I won\u2019t mention the discovery of my newfound information about Mr. McLachlan. Learning his last name changes nothing for us. I won\u2019t try to find him once I leave Australia. There\u2019s no reason to worry him, so let him continue to believe he still holds this secret from me.</p><p>28</p> <p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>Spending the day with Laurelyn stretched out on a lounge chair by the pool is a perfect way to spend New Year\u2019s Day. The view is mighty fine with her barely there black bikini, but I worry her skin isn\u2019t prepared for the harsh Australian sun.</p><p>\u201cYou should put on sunscreen so you don\u2019t sunbake too much.\u201d</p><p>She rises on her elbows and peers over her sunnies at me. \u201cI thought I might get a little sun before I put it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll sneak up on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess you would know better than I do.\u201d</p><p>She sits up and grabs the bottle of SPF 70 from the table and begins to massage it into her skin. \u201cThis is a new one for me. I\u2019ve never been swimming on New Year\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess lots of things seem backwards to you.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t see her eyes through her sunnies, but she smiles and I wonder what she\u2019s thinking. \u201cYeah, a few things.\u201d She holds the bottle out in my direction. \u201cWould you do my back for me?\u201d</p><p>I cover her in a generous application. When I finish, I return to thumbing through the summer issue of the Winery and Vineyard Journal. I find the article I wrote on vine grafting and I\u2019m in the middle of it when Laurelyn asks, \u201cWhatcha reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in particular.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re working even when you\u2019re not working.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure it appears that way to her. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>I place the magazine on the table and she reaches for it. \u201cMaybe I should read this so I can understand more about what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinemaking interests you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, but you interest me.\u201d</p><p>She thumbs through the magazine and I see her stop on my article. I panic as I pray she doesn\u2019t recognize me in the photograph. \u201cI\u2019m getting into the pool. Why don\u2019t you join me? You can read all the exciting articles on winemaking later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVine grafting.\u201d She glances at me. \u201cIs this the same process you\u2019re doing here at Avalon?\u201d</p><p>I get up to take the journal and place it on the table. \u201cIt is, and you can read all about the thrilling adventures in grafting later. It\u2019s hot. Come into the pool with me to cool off.\u201d</p> <p>She has no idea how close she is to figuring me out, so I tug on her hands. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and gets up from the lounger. \u201cYou always get your way, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Laurelyn follows me into the pool. She takes her hair out of the bun and tosses the elastic band to the sidewalk before she dips her head backwards. She lifts her head out of the pool and pushes the water away from her face.</p><p>She\u2019s a magnet and I\u2019m metal. I can\u2019t resist the pull between us so I move closer and put my hands around her waist. She puts her arms around my shoulders and wraps her legs around me, but not in a sexual way. She\u2019s being playful.</p><p>\u201cSo, Mrs. Porcelli and Daniel travel with you when you\u2019re stationed at different vineyards?\u201d</p><p>Stationed. That\u2019s a good word to describe the way I travel with work. \u201cThey come with me anytime I stay more than a week, and I try to give them several days to be home with their families before we leave again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think Mrs. Porcelli thinks of you never bringing a woman home?\u201d</p><p>I laugh as I picture Laurelyn prancing into the kitchen in nothing but her panties and my T-shirt. \u201cShe probably thought I was gay until you showed up in the kitchen barely wearing enough to cover this.\u201d I glide my hands over the bottom of her bikini.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny, Lachlan.\u201d She pretends to be mad but can\u2019t quite pull it off\u2014not with the underlying grin trying to break through.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry you were embarrassed, but I did tell you she would be here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it slipped my mind because it\u2019s only been the two of us in the house since my first night with you.\u201d</p><p>I like the full-time privacy when we\u2019re the only ones here. Perhaps I should give Daniel and Mrs. Porcelli some additional vacation during our stay at Avalon.</p><p>I haven\u2019t explained my employees\u2019 routines to Laurelyn. \u201cNone of the staff is in the house before eight or after five unless asked to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. They don\u2019t sleep in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they have their own quarters in the guest house. They need their privacy as well.\u201d</p><p>I see the relief on her face. \u201cOf course they do.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Porcelli comes out of the house carrying a serving tray with two plates. \u201cI thought you might be hungry, so I brought some sangers and fruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs. Porcelli. We\u2019ll have lunch at the patio table.\u201d She leaves the food and returns inside the house. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Laurelyn winks at me. \u201cI had a late breakfast, but I could eat again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always have brekkie late, sleepyhead.\u201d She retaliates by splashing water in my face. I lift my hand and make a production of wiping the water from my eyes. Laurelyn lets go of me and begins backing away because she knows what\u2019s coming. \u201cOh, you asked for this. There\u2019s no backing out now.\u201d</p><p>I catch her by the arm and pull her to me. I lock my arms around hers, holding them by her side as I prepare to dunk her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t,\u201d she screams and I hear hysteria in her voice.</p><p>I release my grip so I\u2019m able to turn her around. I\u2019m shocked by the pure terror I see in her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Laurelyn?\u201d</p><p>She drops her face. \u201cNothing.\u201d She pushes away, so I let her go. She gets out of the pool and wraps a towel around her body before sitting at the table where lunch is waiting.</p><p>I get out to join her, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m welcome. Her eyes continue to avoid mine and it\u2019s because something isn\u2019t right with her. \u201cLunch looks good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d That\u2019s all I get.</p><p>I begin to eat while she ignores the food on her plate. \u201cMrs. P. will think you don\u2019t like her food if you don\u2019t eat something.\u201d This isn\u2019t my happy, carefree Laurelyn in front of me. This one is guarded and withdrawn. I want the other one back. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>She has a distant look on her face and I wonder where her mind has taken her. It certainly isn\u2019t here with me. \u201cMy mom was an addict when I was a kid. She was addicted to prescription drugs\u2014painkillers, sedatives, whatever she could get her hands on. When I was eight, I found her passed out and submerged in the bathtub. I tried to pull her out, but she was too heavy. Every time I\u2019d get her face above the water, she\u2019d take a breath and then slip from my grasp. She pulled me into the tub under her and I was drowning. I still remember what it felt like to be held under that water knowing I was about to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you not drown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had pulled the plug in the drain as soon as I found her. It took a while, but the water drained low enough for me to breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost killing both of us was her wake-up call. She got clean and has been for almost fifteen years.\u201d I would hope so if her addiction almost killed her and her eight-year-old daughter.</p><p>She\u2019s watching my face. \u201cI\u2019ve never told anyone that.\u201d</p><p>How could she not tell anyone? \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been our secret all of these years. You\u2019re the only person who knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you almost died. That\u2019s not the kind of thing you keep secret.\u201d</p><p>She pulls the towel tighter around her shoulders. \u201cI learned to keep secrets at a very early age, Lachlan. I would\u2019ve been taken away from her if I had told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should have been taken from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe survived and she went to rehab that night. I stayed with my grandparents while she got clean and I was there for her when she came home.\u201d</p><p>She was only a child. Her mother should\u2019ve been the one there for her, not the other way around. No one protected her and she was robbed of her childhood. She says she learned to keep secrets at a very early age, so I have to wonder what else she\u2019s hiding.</p><p>29</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>I see the look in Lachlan\u2019s eyes and I know what he\u2019s thinking\u2014my mother is sorry and lowdown. And there have been times when she has been; she isn\u2019t perfect. If I\u2019m honest, she has been a shitty mother, but she\u2019s the only parent I have. At least she\u2019s been there\u2014that\u2019s more than I can say for the sperm donor.</p><p>Maybe I should regret telling him this secret I\u2019ve kept for fifteen years, but I don\u2019t. I feel a burden lift from my heart and soul. Only one word describes what I\u2019m experiencing: peace.</p><p>Lachlan\u2019s squatting in front of me, his hands on my knees. I slide to the edge of my seat and he wraps his arms around me. It\u2019s in this moment that I realize something\u2014I can tell Lachlan anything. There is no pretense of perfection between us. I don\u2019t need him to believe I have it all together when I don\u2019t. \u201cThat felt so damn good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m almost giddy by my epiphany. \u201cTelling you what happened with my mom and finally admitting what a shitty job she did as a parent before she got clean. I had no idea how great it would feel to finally tell someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s why therapy is so highly recommended.\u201d</p><p>There he goes with the medical advice again. \u201cYes, Dr. Henry. I believe you could be right on this account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always right on every account.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We go back into the pool after we finish eating and I can tell that Lachlan is nervous. I assure him I\u2019m fine, but he won\u2019t venture past the steps, and we sit staggered in the water with me between his legs. The dam holding all my secrets is breached and I tell him things I thought I would take to my grave.</p><p>Lachlan listens and says little. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t know how to respond or if he\u2019s too disturbed by what he\u2019s hearing. It doesn\u2019t matter because reaction isn\u2019t what I need. Listening is, and it\u2019s one of the things he does very well.</p><p>By the time I finish telling Lachlan my childhood tales, the water has shriveled us like little old people. I hold my hand up to examine it. \u201cI think this is a sign that it\u2019s past time to get out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Once we\u2019re dried off, I wrap my towel around my waist. As I\u2019m tucking it, I see Lachlan studying me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He drops his head to peer over his sunglasses at me. \u201cI hope you haven\u2019t caught too much sun today. You\u2019re a wee bit red.\u201d</p><p>I look at my shoulder and pull the strap of my bikini to the side. I hear Lachlan suck air through his teeth. \u201cDamn, Laurelyn. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s going to sting tonight.\u201d</p><p>Lachlan is not the least bit pink, so I move the top of my bikini down for an inspection. It doesn\u2019t hurt or appear burned to me, but I won\u2019t be able to tell anything until we\u2019re out of the sun.</p> <p>We stop in the kitchen to drop off our lunch plates and Mrs. Porcelli\u2019s eyes grow large when she sees me. \u201cOh, Laurelyn dear. There\u2019s an aloe vera aftersun lotion in the medicine cabinet when you\u2019re ready for it. There\u2019s lidocaine in it and it should help with the pain.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. What have I done?</p><p>We go into the bathroom together and I slip off my towel. Things aren\u2019t so bad when I remove my bikini top. Sure, there\u2019s a distinct contrast between my freshly sun-kissed skin and the white lines of my swimsuit, but it\u2019s not terrible.</p><p>He\u2019s standing behind me surveying the damage. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I should\u2019ve noticed when you started burning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t stay pink for long.\u201d He looks doubtful as he assesses my shoulders. \u201cReally, Lachlan. You\u2019ll see. This will be on its way to turning brown by morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, why don\u2019t you take a cool shower? That should help, and I\u2019ll rub you down with lotion when you\u2019re out.\u201d</p> <p>A rubdown by Lachlan? Being sunburned is sounding better and better. \u201cThat sounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. The cool shower feels really nice. I notice my shoulders are a little tender to the water pelting down on them, but it\u2019s nothing too uncomfortable.</p><p>When I\u2019m finished showering, I pat my skin dry and step out to find Lachlan waiting for me with a bottle of aloe vera lotion. He holds it up and gives it a shake as he grins. \u201cDo you want me to do it in here with you standing, or would you rather I do it with you lying on the bed?\u201d</p><p>Hmm, that sounds dirty. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Both options sound appealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vote for the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, the bed it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Mrs. Porcelli sent these for you.\u201d He holds out two pills in the palm of his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s only ibuprofen to help with the discomfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt will, so please take the medicine. I don\u2019t want you to be in pain.\u201d</p><p>I take the pills and the glass of water he offers. I\u2019m terrible at swallowing pills since I\u2019ve made a habit of avoiding them. These aren\u2019t big, so I manage to get them down, but not without some unattractive sputtering. When I\u2019m done, I pass the glass back to him. \u201cHappy now, Dr. Henry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>I twist my towel around my hair before I crawl up onto the bed to lie on my stomach for my post-sun care. I rest my arms over my head and I feel the bed dip when Lachlan crawls up. \u201cThis may be a little cool, but it\u2019ll feel good.\u201d</p><p>He squirts it directly on my back and I arch. \u201cShit, that\u2019s cold!\u201d I squeal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really. It just feels that way because your skin is feverish.\u201d</p><p>He rubs the cool lotion into my skin and it\u2019s very soothing. My entire body goes lax as I enjoy what feels more like a massage than a post-sunburn lotion application.</p><p>I\u2019m so relaxed, I\u2019m almost asleep when I hear \u201cJolene\u201d playing on my phone. My eyes pop open and I feel Lachlan leave my back. \u201cI\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p><p>He passes my phone to me. \u201cHey, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurie, I\u2019ve been calling you for hours. Have you not checked your phone?\u201d</p><p>She sounds panicked, which panics me, and my first thought is that something has happened to Nanna or Pops. I sit up in the middle of the bed, preparing myself to hear the worst. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t heard. It\u2019s been all over the news.\u201d</p><p>Okay, nothing has happened to my grandparents so I shift to my aggravation mode. \u201cMom, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared Beckett was killed in a skiing accident today.\u201d</p><p>I should\u2019ve known this would somehow involve the sperm donor. \u201cAnd this is emergency news for me because?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s your brother, Laurie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhom I\u2019ve never met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your father\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, whom I\u2019ve never met.\u201d Am I the only one hearing the common denominator here?</p><p>\u201cYou need to come home.\u201d</p><p>Good grief. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a reason for me to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to pay your condolences, Laurie.\u201d Oh, hell. This is about getting me in with the sperm donor. What does she think is going to happen? He\u2019s going to suddenly want me in his life now that he\u2019s lost his only child?</p><p>I realize I\u2019m stark naked and talking to my mom about the death of my sperm donor\u2019s son when Lachlan holds out one of his T-shirts for me. I mouth thank you to him and slip the shirt over my head while my mom chatters nonsense about the need of being with family in times like this.</p><p>\u201cWe share DNA, but I\u2019m no part of their family. They wouldn\u2019t know me if we passed on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father is going to want to know you.\u201d</p><p>I stopped fantasizing about him wanting to know me a long time ago, but she never has. I\u2019m almost twenty-three years old and she\u2019s still holding out for something\u2014I don\u2019t know what. Maybe she thinks he\u2019ll want to meet his daughter and it\u2019ll lead him back to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom. I\u2019m not coming home for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I am, then I\u2019ll be the one who has to live with it.\u201d I\u2019d always been the one to live with both of our mistakes anyway, so I was used to it.</p><p>She isn\u2019t happy with me when I end our call and it leaves me feeling unsettled, although I know I\u2019m making a logical decision. Between the two of us, someone has to be rational and I can\u2019t depend on it to be her. She isn\u2019t well known for making the best choices when it comes to my father.</p><p>\u201cI assume there\u2019s trouble at home.\u201d</p><p>Yes, but only what my mom is making for me. \u201cMy father\u2019s son was killed in a snow-skiing accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a half-brother I\u2019ve never met and my mom is acting like I should be in mourning. Hell, when she said his name, it took a minute for me to realize whom she was talking about. He\u2019s a stranger to me. I\u2019m sorry for his family\u2019s loss, but I don\u2019t feel anything more. Is that wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Laurelyn. You\u2019re not wrong for the way you feel. Please, don\u2019t let your mum make you feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m certain he thinks she is a terrible mother after everything he\u2019s learned about her today. \u201cYou must think even worse of my mom now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t make the top-ten list of my favorites today. You, however, make the number-one position.\u201d He pulls me close to kiss the top of my head. I love the way he makes my worries disappear.</p><p>How can this be? This man, almost a stranger, brings me comfort and makes it easy for me to bare my soul to him. As I ask myself how it\u2019s possible, I know the answer. I don\u2019t have to guard my heart with Lachlan. I\u2019m safe with him. And it\u2019s nice.</p><p>30</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>Laurelyn doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s my birthday or that the only wish I have is to stay home with her. But I can\u2019t. I have to go to my parents\u2019 house for my annual birthday dinner with the whole family. What a ripper day this will be.</p><p>She\u2019s been living with me for two weeks and I\u2019m surprised by the way I feel as I drive away, leaving her at the house. I want to go back for her. I consider whipping the Sunset around, but I remind myself of the rules I have in place and why meeting my family is one that can\u2019t be broken.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen my family in almost three weeks, not since my mother sent me back to Avalon to be with Laurelyn on Christmas Day. Thank you, Mum. It was the best gift you could have given me.</p><p>My mum has made a point to speak to me weekly about my relationship with my \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and I\u2019m not looking forward to showing up without her again. Margaret McLachlan is going to be very put out with me over Laurelyn\u2019s absence. I shouldn\u2019t have told her I\u2019d bring her to my birthday dinner, but I didn\u2019t have a reasonable excuse to give her when we discussed it.</p><p>I walk through the door and Mum flies into the foyer. She\u2019s smiling and her eyes are wide with anticipation, but then I see them fill with disappointment when she notes the emptiness beside me. I feel like a shitty son. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mum. Laurelyn wasn\u2019t feeling well. We think she has the stomach flu. She told me to tell you how sorry she is that she couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gives me a look of disapproval and I know I\u2019ve done all wrong. \u201cAnd you left her alone while she\u2019s sick?\u201d</p><p>Shit. I didn\u2019t think of that. \u201cI\u2019m paying Mrs. Porcelli to take care of her.\u201d</p><p>Now, she\u2019s really giving me her disapproval. \u201cWhat kind of message does that send if you leave her when she\u2019s sick, Jack Henry?\u201d</p> <p>I feel like a cur, although I\u2019m guilty of nothing. Almost. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou boys never do, but it\u2019s not from lack of me trying.\u201d Mum stalks out of the foyer into the kitchen. She\u2019s pissed off and I want her to know her lessons weren\u2019t in vain. She\u2019d be proud of how considerate I am with Laurelyn, but I can\u2019t tell her, so I\u2019m forced to endure her disapproval instead.</p><p>I go into the living room where my dad and brother are, hoping to find neutral ground among them. I have no doubt Mum is in the kitchen telling Chloe and Emma what I did. Soon I\u2019ll have the whole adult female household against me. I\u2019ll be lucky if my nieces, Celia and Mila, aren\u2019t included in the pact.</p><p>Evan is sitting in the floor with his kids and laughs at me when I plop on the couch. \u201cI heard Mum fussing at you all the way in here. What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFussing? That\u2019s your vocabulary now?\u201d</p> <p>My brother points to his three-year-old. \u201cDelicate ears, Jack, and little mouths repeat interesting words. You\u2019ll understand what I mean one day.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, when hell freezes over. \u201cMum is mad because I left Laurelyn while she\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>My dad is shaking his head. This is my mistake, but he\u2019s the one who\u2019ll have to hear about it when I\u2019m gone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cJack, you don\u2019t know how much she\u2019s been looking forward to meeting this woman you\u2019re dating. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve heard since Christmas and now all I\u2019m going to hear is her carrying on about you screwing it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I can\u2019t do anything about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can fix this by telling your mum you\u2019ll bring her for a visit.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t lie to my mum again. \u201cYou know how things pick up this time of year. I might not be able to get away from the vineyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget how well I know the business, son. You\u2019re in charge and you have very capable staff. You can get away for a couple of days to bring that woman here to meet your mum.\u201d</p><p>Dammit! \u201cFine. I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d</p><p>We hear a slamming cabinet in the living room. \u201cTell her now, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Fuck! I don\u2019t want my family interfering in my personal life. I get off the couch and walk into the enemy\u2019s territory. Two new pairs of rebuking eyes, those of my sister and sister-in-law, cast upon me in support of my mum\u2019s grievance. My sister flashes her signature hand gesture in the shape of an \u201cL\u201d in my direction as she mouths loser.</p><p>\u201cMum, I\u2019m sorry. Will you forgive me if I bring Laurelyn for a visit? Maybe sometime next month, depending on how things are going at Avalon?\u201d</p><p>She stops her physical abuse of the poor potatoes. \u201cI will, but do try to bring her sooner if you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will, Mum.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s smiling because she\u2019s hoodwinked and I\u2019m a lying sack of shit. My false promise is a temporary fix for this situation. I\u2019ll soon have to dupe my mum again, and I\u2019m not looking forward to it.</p><p>The conversation at dinner is pleasant, much more so than it would have been had I not made nice with Mum, so I\u2019m glad about that much. My dad is especially interested in hearing about the progress I\u2019m making with my grafts. No one else gives a shit, but they assuage Dad by pretending to listen.</p><p>After dinner, I\u2019m sitting in the living room watching Mila hold the coffee table for support and then she bravely removes her hand. She\u2019s trying to decide if she wants to take a step and I think I\u2019m about to witness her valiant attempt to walk. \u201cBro, I think your kid is about to take her first step.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s standing in the doorway and his head is buried in his phone, as usual. \u201cDid you hear me, Evan? Mila looks like she\u2019s about to walk.\u201d</p><p>He lifts his head for a quick peek at his daughter and is unimpressed. \u201cShe teases us like that all the time\u2014acts likes she\u2019s going to do it, then grabs back onto whatever\u2019s in front of her.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know. She seems pretty serious to me, but I see Evan isn\u2019t interested. I wonder if I should call Emma to watch. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll want to see her daughter\u2019s first steps.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly have you been doing at Avalon, Jack?\u201d Evan asks.</p><p>At dinner, I talked for ten minutes about the grafting and he didn\u2019t listen to a damn thing I said. Now he asks me what I\u2019m doing. What a dick. \u201cI\u2019m not explaining all of it again. You should\u2019ve listened at dinner if you were interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, bro. That\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d He\u2019s holding my phone and it clicks in my mind what he\u2019s talking about. He\u2019s going through my pictures of Laurelyn\u2014the nearly naked ones.</p><p>I dive off the couch and reach to take my phone from him, but he snatches it from my grasp. \u201cWhy the hell are you looking at the pictures on my phone?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s leaning away from me so I can\u2019t reach it, but he continues to scan Laurelyn\u2019s pictures. \u201cWe have the same phone. I thought it was mine when I picked it up. I wanted to show Mum some pictures of the girls. Good thing I didn\u2019t call her over to take a gander at these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me my phone. Now!\u201d I hiss through gritted teeth.</p><p>He twists the phone to see a picture from a different angle. \u201cDamn, Jack, are you screwing her in this picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I don\u2019t know. Maybe. Depends on which picture he\u2019s talking about.</p><p>I jerk it out of his hand and he has this look in his eyes. I think it\u2019s admiration, but I can\u2019t be sure. \u201cYou lucky bastard. Emma would never let me take pictures like that of her. Not even before she had the kids. And there\u2019s no way she\u2019d let me take a picture of her getting screwed. How did you talk her into letting you do that?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m pissed off at my brother for invading my privacy\u2014and Laurelyn\u2019s\u2014but I roll with it rather than start a fight. It wouldn\u2019t go over well to beat his ass in front of his wife and kids. \u201cJust lucky, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to talk about Laurelyn this way with him. She\u2019s my secret\u2014one I don\u2019t want to share\u2014and my family is showing way too much interest in her.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious about this girl?\u201d</p><p>Has my brother lost his mind? I give him my \u201care you fucking kidding me?\u201d face while I laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve known her a month. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>The little shit is laughing at me. \u201cI think you don\u2019t like it that I saw nudie pictures of your girl.\u201d</p><p>That part I can\u2019t deny. It makes me sick that he saw what was supposed to be for my eyes only. \u201cShe\u2019s not naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>Emma comes into the living room and sees the glares passing between us. \u201cWhat are you two fighting about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, my big brother was just showing me some pictures of his American girlfriend. Go ahead, Jack. Show Emma your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>The fucking traitor wants to sell me out? I\u2019ll fix his ass so he doesn\u2019t get any naughty all month. I thumb through the pics until I find one portraying us as the doting couple and hold it up for Emma. \u201cEvan told me she\u2019s a hot piece of ass and he\u2019d do her. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d say that about my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Evan: score zero. Jack: score thirty. As in the number of days my little bro was going to be cock blocked. Hah! Take that you little fucker!</p><p>Emma stares him down. \u201cEm, I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s thirty years old. Am I supposed to just believe he made that up because he has nothing better to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does shit like that to get me in trouble. He doesn\u2019t have a wife so he finds it entertaining to mess with mine.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shoot daggers in his direction. \u201cI\u2019m not discussing this with you now, Evan.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right, little bro. While you\u2019re not screwing your wife, you can spend the next month with your hand around your dick thinking about how to not fuck with me.</p><p>Emma reaches for my phone to take a better look at Laurelyn. \u201cJack, she\u2019s beautiful. May I show Margaret?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s probably safer for me to hold onto the phone so I can ensure there are no more peep shows. \u201cI\u2019ll show her when she\u2019s finished in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Emma isn\u2019t going to let me get away without showing Mum pictures of Laurelyn, so I check the camera roll to see where the sexy ones start. The first twelve are all clear, but I\u2019ll only show her the first ten to be safe.</p><p>Mum comes into the living room when she\u2019s finished in the kitchen and Emma doesn\u2019t let it slide. \u201cMargaret, Jack has some pictures of his girlfriend on his phone.\u201d</p><p>My mum is ecstatic. \u201cWait, I need my eyes.\u201d She scurries to the kitchen and returns wearing reading glasses. She takes the phone from my hand and holds it where she can see it better. \u201cOh, Jack Henry. She\u2019s a lovely girl. She\u2019d have beautiful babies.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. Here we go.</p><p>She thumbs to the second picture and it\u2019s Laurelyn holding her Martin guitar. The third is her playing my piano at Avalon. \u201cAnd she\u2019s a musician. She\u2019d teach your children to play instruments and sing.\u201d</p><p>I can hear the wedding bells in my mum\u2019s head.</p><p>The next several pictures are random candids Laurelyn doesn\u2019t know I took. Some smiling, some solemn, but always beautiful.</p><p>31</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>Mrs. Porcelli kept me company after Lachlan left. She stayed and joined me for dinner, per my request, but now she is gone to her quarters for the evening and I\u2019m alone in the house at night for the first time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m not scared. I\u2019m bored. And lonely. I want Lachlan here with me.</p><p>I call Addison, but don\u2019t get an answer, so I leave a voicemail. \u201cHey, Addie. I thought we might get together for lunch tomorrow. Give me a call if you\u2019re up for it.\u201d</p><p>I turn on the television, but can\u2019t find anything I want to watch. I decide Lachlan\u2019s absence might be the perfect time to use my pole for a workout. I haven\u2019t used it for exercise once since it\u2019s been installed. Every time I try, he puts on some sexy music and my workout becomes a show for his pleasure.</p><p>I put my hair into a bun because I\u2019m going to get hot and sweaty. I change into the two-piece set I bought for practice. It isn\u2019t sexy like the ones Lachlan buys for me. It\u2019s a practical black racer-back top with matching sport shorts, the same type of outfit I would wear if I were going to class.</p> <p>I go into the gym and turn on the receiver. I put \u201cLift Me Up\u201d by Christina Aguilera on repeat. I\u2019ve been thinking about choreographing a slow, graceful routine to that song for months and this is the first opportunity I\u2019ve had to be alone with a pole.</p><p>When I finish stretching, I start by doing the Phoenix pose. I\u2019ve practiced it in my head time and time again. I think I stick it perfectly, but it sucks not having an instructor to tell me if I\u2019m doing it right. All I can do is watch in the mirror and judge it based on memory.</p><p>I do several spins and transitions I\u2019ve mastered to get warmed up before I try a new invert\u2014the Rainbow Marchenko. It\u2019s difficulty level is a 5, and I have no business trying it without an instructor, but this could be my only chance to go for it without Lachlan around to see me drop on my head if I don\u2019t stick it. Hopefully, Mrs. Porcelli won\u2019t find me with a broken neck in the morning.</p><p>I manage to do it without killing myself and now I have a feel for it. I know I can do it more gracefully, but my heart rate needs to return to normal before I give it another go. I lower myself to the floor to catch my breath.</p><p>I\u2019m standing with my hands on my hips when I see motion in the mirror through my peripheral vision. I spin around to see if my eyes are playing tricks on me, which is a real possibility, but they\u2019re not. There\u2019s a woman standing in the middle of the gym floor and she\u2019s staring at me.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know why, but I sense that she\u2019s been there for a while watching me. There\u2019s no initial shock on her face, at least not like what\u2019s on mine right now. Who is this woman, and why is she here?</p><p>I tell myself she could be Lachlan\u2019s sister, or Mrs. Porcelli\u2019s daughter, but I know it\u2019s wishful thinking. My gut tells me I\u2019ve met a pit bull in a dark alley, ready for a fight.</p><p>I reach for the remote to turn off the music and she speaks before I have the chance. \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful song. It goes well with the slow spins, but not that upside-down thing you were doing.\u201d She uses her fingers as she speaks.</p><p>\u201cThe Rainbow Marchenko. It\u2019s an invert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know because I\u2019m not a stripper.\u201d</p><p>I admit she had me for a brief moment with her friendly opening statement, but the stripper comment is her attempt to put me in my place. This is no sister or friend to Lachlan. This is a former girlfriend or companion, and she\u2019s pissed about me being here.</p> <p>She\u2019s tall and slender in an elegant taupe dress with matching heels. Her natural red hair is cut in a medium-length bob with bangs that are too blunt, just like the way she walked in here and called me a stripper.</p><p>I want to tell her Lachlan isn\u2019t here, but I don\u2019t know what to call him, so I go for generic. \u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s laughing. \u201cHoney, you don\u2019t even know his name, do you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know he\u2019s not here because I left him at his parents\u2019 house. I wanted to see you when he wasn\u2019t around so we could get a few things straight.\u201d</p><p>Now, I\u2019m confused. I know he\u2019s at his parents\u2019. How does she know and why does she say she left him there? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m at a bit of a disadvantage here. You seem to know me, but I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>She slinks over to the chair Lachlan uses when he watches me dance. She sits and crosses her legs as though she plans to stay a while. \u201cHow rude of me to not introduce myself. I\u2019m Audrey, his wife.\u201d</p><p>No. This is not happening again.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know, did you?\u201d</p><p>I feel sick. I\u2019m devastated. He could have had any number of women who didn\u2019t mind if he had a wife\u2014except me. I agreed to all of his crazy-ass rules and the only thing I asked of him was to not lie about being married.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurelyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurelyn,\u201d she repeats. \u201cWhat a pretty name. I\u2019ve never heard it before.\u201d She\u2019s smiling at me in a friendly way. It\u2019s confusing. \u201cI\u2019m not angry with you. I can read your face and tell that you didn\u2019t know he was married, but you can understand why I must ask you to stop seeing my husband, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but you don\u2019t have to ask. I\u2019ll gladly leave on my own accord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Laurelyn. I want you to leave tonight and never see him again. I know my husband\u2019s ... tastes. I trust you don\u2019t know his real name and he doesn\u2019t know yours.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no point in telling her I know his last name. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t call him on the phone he gave you? You\u2019ll leave and never come back?\u201d</p><p>She even knows about the phone? \u201cI can\u2019t leave tonight because I have nowhere to go, but I\u2019ll be gone first thing in the morning, before he comes back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being so understanding, Laurelyn. I love my husband very much and he has a problem, but I\u2019m willing to work through it for our children.\u201d</p><p>Children? That\u2019s when I can\u2019t look at her anymore. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I have some packing to do.\u201d</p><p>I go into the extra bedroom to get my luggage. I toss the suitcases onto Lachlan\u2019s bed and go into the closet to strip my clothes from the hangers. I hurl them in without any kind of structure. I know all of my things are never going to fit in there like this, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll leave what I can\u2019t jam in.</p><p>Somehow, I make everything fit. I pull my luggage into the kitchen and park it by the door for my departure first thing in the morning. I remember I\u2019ll need a ride. I call Daniel, the only other contact programmed into the phone given to me by Lachlan.</p><p>\u201cHi, Daniel. It\u2019s Laurelyn. I need you to drive me to town in the morning. Can you be ready at seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, Miss Beckett. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Miss Beckett. I feel a frown form on my face and I sigh. \u201cThank you, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>I survey the pile of luggage and wonder where I\u2019ll go in the morning. I have no idea. I\u2019m short on money so a hotel for longer than one night is out of the question. I can\u2019t ask to come back to Ben\u2019s after the way I left, so I guess I have no choice. I\u2019m forced to go home. Jolie will be happy.</p><p>I decide to shower tonight so there\u2019s no delay in getting away from this place first thing in the morning. Under water that\u2019s as hot as I can stand, I need this torment to be washed away. I\u2019m unsuccessful at ridding myself of the pain, and the water eventually runs cold, much like the feeling I have deep inside.</p><p>I\u2019m lying in bed, but nowhere near sleep, when Lachlan calls for the fourth time. I finally silence the ringer because I don\u2019t want to hear Bret sing anymore. It\u2019s too bad I\u2019ll never hear him sing again without thinking of Lachlan Henry.</p><p>32</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>I can\u2019t stay away from Laurelyn until tomorrow afternoon. I leave my parents\u2019 house early to come home to be with her, but not without hearing a shitload of trash talk from my brother about being pussy-whipped. I may be, but I\u2019m not complaining.</p><p>I come through the garage door and stumble over a pile of luggage. I turn on the light and recognize the bags as Laurelyn\u2019s. What the hell is going on here? First, she wouldn\u2019t answer my calls and now her luggage is by the door?</p><p>I walk to the bedroom, not sure of what I\u2019m going to find. Please don\u2019t be gone, Laurelyn. I hold my breath as I stop in the doorway. It\u2019s pitch black, so I turn on the bathroom light and see her asleep in my bed. I release the breath I was holding.</p><p>It\u2019s three in the morning and I only want to strip down and climb into bed with her, but I don\u2019t because I know something isn\u2019t right. I sit on the bed next to her and brush her soft cheek with the back of my fingers. \u201cLaurelyn.\u201d</p><p>She stirs, but doesn\u2019t wake, so I say her name again. \u201cLaurelyn, baby.\u201d</p><p>She opens her eyes and bolts up in the bed, taking the sheet with her. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t the welcome home I\u2019d imagined. \u201cI live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you wouldn\u2019t be home until this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left early because I wanted to be with you. I\u2019ve sort of developed a habit of doing that.\u201d She doesn\u2019t say anything. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why are your bags by the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>I feel my heart jump into my throat. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife thought it would be the appropriate thing for me to do and I tend to agree with her.\u201d</p><p>What the hell is she talking about? \u201cI don\u2019t have a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudrey paid me a visit, and she says differently. She\u2019s stunning, Lachlan. And I should know because she stunned me.\u201d</p><p>That psycho has traced me to Avalon. She\u2019s getting smarter. And braver. Attempting to destroy two of my vineyards was ballsy, but now she has walked into my house and fucked with my personal life through Laurelyn. \u201cI\u2019m not married to that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear I\u2019ve never been married.\u201d She doesn\u2019t say it again, but I see she doesn\u2019t believe me. I run my hands through my hair. How am I going to prove this to her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s only one way. I reach for my phone in my pocket. \u201cYou can ask my mum. She\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s three o\u2019clock in the morning, but I bring up my contacts and press the one labeled \u201cMum.\u201d I put it on speaker and it rings a few times before she answers the phone.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMum, this is going to sound crazy, but am I married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, son?\u201d My mum has no idea she\u2019s the only one who can save me with Laurelyn right now.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever been married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What\u2019s this all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurelyn and I had a bit of a misunderstanding. She just needs to hear that I\u2019m not married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not married, dear, but I\u2019d sure like for him to be. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. I mute the phone. \u201cTell her you feel much better. I\u2019ll explain later.\u201d</p><p>I unmute the phone and hold out for Laurelyn to answer my mum. \u201cI\u2019m feeling much better, ma\u2019am. Thank you for asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to wake you, Mum. Go back to sleep and we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>After I end the call, I put the phone down on the nightstand. \u201cShe wanted to know why you didn\u2019t come with me, so I told her you had the stomach flu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me what happened with Audrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the gym working out. I stopped to take a break and I thought I saw something in the mirror. When I looked, I saw this redheaded woman in the middle of the floor watching me. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019d been standing there for a while, but I can\u2019t be certain because I didn\u2019t hear her come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she was your wife and she loved you. She wanted to work things out because of the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren?\u201d Wow. She is desperate.</p><p>\u201cShe asked me to stop seeing you and leave without any contact ever again.\u201d</p><p>Huh. \u201cYou were going to leave me without saying goodbye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I believed you were married with children. You know how I feel about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you know I understand how bad it would hurt you if I were married. Why would you doubt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>Wow, that hurt. \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong. Maybe you don\u2019t know my real name, but you know me like no one else does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>Psycho bitch. \u201cNumber three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA previous companion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of the deranged sort. Crazy stuff has gone down with that woman. She found out my real identity after our relationship ended and she\u2019s been stalking me for three years. Because I travel so often, it\u2019s hard for her to keep up with my whereabouts. When she can\u2019t find me, she causes mischief at the vineyards to draw me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has she done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCountless things, but the most recent include the fire at Chalice and the crop poisoning at Marguerite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know about a poisoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the reason I had to leave Avalon after Christmas. She hasn\u2019t been able to find me since I came to Wagga Wagga. I think I evaded her after the fire at Chalice and that\u2019s why she poisoned Marguerite\u2014to bring me onto her turf at Lovedale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where she\u2019s from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but I didn\u2019t give her the opportunity to find me. I had a private investigator locate her first so I\u2019d have the upper hand. I contacted her and told her to meet me in our old spot. She thought she was coming because I wanted to rekindle our relationship. I confronted her about the fire and the poisoning, but of course, she denied doing either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, but not because she didn\u2019t try. I turned her down and told her there was someone else. She didn\u2019t take it well, so we didn\u2019t part on good terms. Convincing you to leave me was her way of proving she could fuck with my personal life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe almost succeeded. I would\u2019ve left last night if I\u2019d had a place to go. I was going to the airport this morning to make arrangements to fly home.\u201d</p><p>I kick off my shoes and crawl into bed next to Laurelyn. I need to feel her against me to prove she isn\u2019t gone. I don\u2019t tell her how glad I am she\u2019s still here or about the fear I had when I thought she was leaving me. Maybe she already knows. If she does, she doesn\u2019t mention it. She lets me pull her close, and I\u2019m content with simply holding her in my arms after almost losing her.</p><p>33</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>I\u2019m almost glad Audrey came. Lachlan is forced to give me insight he would\u2019ve never volunteered. I now understand why he\u2019s so secretive about his life, and I can\u2019t really say I blame him if that\u2019s the kind of bat-shit crazy he\u2019s had to deal with.</p><p>We don\u2019t talk after I tell him about how I was going to leave. He holds onto me like he\u2019s afraid I might get up and sneak away in the night. He was scared when he thought I was leaving him. I heard it in his voice and saw it in his eyes.</p><p>I somehow make it to sleep with him wrapped around me, and he\u2019s still holding on when my phone vibrates on the nightstand at seven o\u2019clock. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s Daniel calling to see if I\u2019m ready to leave.</p><p>Lachlan rolls away from me and grabs it before I\u2019m able to make a move. \u201cDaniel, Miss. Beckett won\u2019t be needing you to drive her this morning after all.\u201d</p><p>After he ends the call, he rolls back to me. \u201cYou\u2019d be leaving me right now if I hadn\u2019t come home early.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right, yet I don\u2019t want to admit it, so I say nothing. He pulls me close again, the same way he held me all night. \u201cWe have two more months together. Please, don\u2019t plan to leave again unless it\u2019s a mutual decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me, Laurelyn. I don\u2019t want to worry about coming in and finding you gone one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d He relaxes with my assurance and I know this is the end of it. He\u2019ll never bring it up again because he believes me.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to do today?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to be here, so I asked Addison to meet me for lunch before the whole Audrey thing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I seem to have fallen down on my office work since you\u2019ve been around, Miss Beckett. My books could stand a little catching up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Henry, you\u2019re blaming your lack of productivity on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly my lack of concentration,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt always seems to be on you these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s probably a good idea for me to get out of your hair today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s call it a girls\u2019 day out. You and your friend can shop or whatever it is you do when you\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>I shrug because I don\u2019t really have any extra money to spend. My budget is super tight after my lingerie spending spree before Christmas. \u201cI don\u2019t really need anything.\u201d</p><p>He gets out of bed and takes his wallet from his pants. He places several hundreds on the nightstand under my phone. Wow, that really makes me feel like a hooker.</p><p>\u201cWhen you buy for yourself, you\u2019re buying for me because I like you in nice things.\u201d He leans down and kisses my mouth. \u201cI\u2019m taking you somewhere next week, so buy some new things for our trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Zealand. It\u2019s a business trip, but we\u2019ll have plenty of time to play while we\u2019re there, so buy some sundresses and a few new swimsuits. I\u2019d like to request skimpy bikinis.\u201d</p><p>No freakin\u2019 way. Addison will be so jealous. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me to New Zealand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have some business at one of the vineyards and my boss has a house on a private beach. He\u2019s letting us stay there a couple of nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLachlan. I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d And I don\u2019t. I\u2019d never get to do anything like this on my own. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to come to Australia if Addison\u2019s parents hadn\u2019t bought my airline ticket.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one word I want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>I hold my arms out and he lets me hop on him with my legs around his waist as I squeal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to New Zealand,\u201d I squeal in excitement.</p><p>I call Addison when I\u2019m almost to the apartment. I don\u2019t plan on going up because I don\u2019t want to run into Ben. \u201cHey, I\u2019m a block away. Are you ready to come down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need five or ten more minutes.\u201d Of course she does. She\u2019s never ready on time. Won\u2019t I ever learn to tell her to be ready thirty minutes earlier?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Come up, please.\u201d</p><p>I know I shouldn\u2019t, but I agree against my better judgment. \u201cOkay. Buzz me in, but please hurry.\u201d</p><p>Daniel stops in front of the apartment. \u201cAddison isn\u2019t ready so I\u2019m going up. I shouldn\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>I reach for the handle, but it doesn\u2019t work. Child safety locks, I guess. They\u2019re probably activated because Daniel knows I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about having a door opened for me. I\u2019m not helpless. I can open my own door, but that\u2019s not the way Lachlan wants it.</p><p>Daniel appears displeased with me as he lets me out the car. I think he doesn\u2019t approve of me going up to the apartment because he knows his employer won\u2019t like it. \u201cI won\u2019t be long, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what to do, but you know he won\u2019t like this.\u201d Daniel knows about my run-in with Ben, maybe not the specifics, but Lachlan has told him something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your phone and call me if you have any problems. Anything at all.\u201d</p><p>Great. I have Lachlan and Daniel wanting to kick Ben\u2019s ass. \u201cI\u2019ll take it, but don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll worry until I see you come out of that building safe and sound.\u201d What did Lachlan tell him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ten minutes max,\u201d I promise.</p><p>\u201cMake it five.\u201d He sounds irritated.</p> <p>I knock on the door and Ben answers. He gives me a crooked grin, but he\u2019s embarrassed. He should be. \u201cHi, Laurelyn. Please, come in.\u201d</p><p>I walk into the apartment and I can\u2019t remember a more uncomfortable moment in my life. I stand there trying to think of polite conversation, but I can\u2019t come up with anything I want to say to the man who called me a whore after he tried to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna walk back and check on Addison.\u201d</p><p>He touches my arm as I walk by and I go stiff. \u201cCan I please have just a minute?\u201d</p><p>I pull my arm from him. I don\u2019t want to do this, but I feel like I have to because he\u2019s my best friend\u2019s brother. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s any kind of excuse for what I did, but I was really drunk New Year\u2019s Eve. I never would\u2019ve acted that way otherwise. I just wanted to tell you that I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted.\u201d That\u2019s all he\u2019s getting from me.</p><p>I walk to the bedroom I once shared with my best friend and she\u2019s sitting on the bed, ready to go. She jolts when she sees me in the doorway. I knew this was a total set-up. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad, Laurie. He wanted to see you so he could apologize and I knew this was the only way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me.\u201d As I accuse her, I think of all the half-truths I\u2019ve told her about Lachlan and decide it might be a good idea if I\u2019m not too quick to call the kettle black. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay. I understand why you did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to, Laurie. He\u2019s been so sick with himself since it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s over now. I told him I accepted his apology.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Laurie.\u201d</p><p>Addison and I haven\u2019t seen each other since I moved out, so we have a lot of catching up to do. We decide it\u2019s best to do it over cheeseburgers and shakes at the fifties diner on the square.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s it going with the suit?\u201d</p><p>That name is all wrong for him now. I\u2019ve rarely seen him in a suit since those first few days. He\u2019s all sexy, rugged wear these days, but I choose to not debate it with her. \u201cHe works a lot of hours, but things are good now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018now\u2019 mean?\u201d</p><p>Do I really want to discuss Audrey with her? Yes, I think I do. She\u2019s my best friend. I need to get this out and tell someone about it. \u201cOne of his bat-shit crazy exes came to see me last night while he was out of town.\u201d</p><p>Addison sits up straighter, ready to hear the juicy details. She loves a good catfight. \u201cWhat happened? Did you have to whip her ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe walked in the house like she owned the place and told me she was his wife and mother of his children.\u201d</p> <p>I suspect she\u2019s seeing the same red flag I saw. Where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. Right? \u201cAnd is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but of course I believed her. You know how I am when it comes to men. I don\u2019t trust them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurie, how do you know she\u2019s not telling the truth?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m playing with the napkin in my lap, tearing off small pieces and rolling them into little balls. \u201cI packed my stuff and had it by the door so I could get out of there first thing this morning. He came home early and then the shit got real when he saw I was leaving. Addison, he called his mother and woke her at three o\u2019clock this morning so she would vouch that he isn\u2019t married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe part about being single is good, but what happened afterwards was unexpected.\u201d I\u2019m not sure this uncomplicated relationship thing is going to stay that way.</p><p>\u201cChillax, Laurie. Sex is sex. Roll with it and have fun. Stop trying to make it complex.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not trying to make sex with Lachlan complicated. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have sex.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes at me. \u201cDid he tell you he loved you or some bullshit like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t talk and you didn\u2019t have sex, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just held me all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsst. That sounds boring as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t. I liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need counseling.\u201d Addison can be such a dude sometimes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend. You\u2019re supposed to counsel me when I lose my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you lost me on this deal back when you said you didn\u2019t have sex.\u201d She shrugs her shoulders. \u201cI got nothing for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taking me to New Zealand next week.\u201d</p><p>She punches me in the shoulder. \u201cShut the hell up. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he is.\u201d I reach into my purse and hold up the money he gave me. \u201cWe\u2019re staying at a house on a private beach and he wants me to buy new clothes and swimsuits for the trip.\u201d</p><p>Addison\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cShit! How much money is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t count it.\u201d</p><p>She reaches over and takes it from my hand to thumb through it. \u201cThe suit gave you a grand to buy bikinis and flip-flops.\u201d</p><p>I remind myself of what Lachlan said. When I buy for myself, I\u2019m buying for him because he wants me in nice things. \u201cI feel guilty taking his money, but I can\u2019t afford to buy the things he wants me to have for the trip.\u201d</p><p>She waves the money in front of me. \u201cHe promised to show you the time of your life. This is one of things he was talking about. You have two months left with him. Have fun while you can.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. I\u2019m making too much of this. We discussed what he wanted from this relationship in the beginning, and he told me he wanted to pamper me and make us feel genuine. This is him following through with his part of the bargain, so I should keep mine too. If he wants us to feel real, I can give him real\u2014every day and twice on Sunday.</p><p>34</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>After takeoff in our small private plane to Auckland, New Zealand, I check my watch to see if we\u2019re on schedule. I notice the date\u2014February 1st\u2014and I\u2019m struck by the memory of a conversation Laurelyn and I had on our second date. She told me she would turn twenty-three on Groundhog\u2019s Day. That\u2019s tomorrow. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t remember until just now.</p><p>She hasn\u2019t mentioned it. I think she would tell me if I asked her, but I decide I want to surprise her with something special. I just don\u2019t know what it will be.</p><p>Our flight lands and I usually have a driver waiting, but not today. Instead, I rent a convertible for the twenty-minute drive to the house so Laurelyn and I can have this experience alone and at our own pace.</p><p>After pulling off the road several times for Laurelyn to admire the coastline, we arrive at the house in Auckland. She hasn\u2019t traveled much outside her small world at home and her eyes are wide with elation. I love seeing her like this. Her expression makes me want to show her the world.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait until you see the beachfront.\u201d</p><p>I carry our bags from the car into the house. I give her the tour, purposely making the bedroom our last stop. I\u2019m proud of this room, even if I can\u2019t take credit for how lovely it is since the house was furnished when I purchased it last year. The previous owner did a fantastic job making this bedroom romantic.</p><p>Laurelyn walks over and runs her fingers down the sheer fabric draped over the canopy. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a word to describe this room. Romantic isn\u2019t enough to do it justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve stayed here before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany times.\u201d I feel the question she doesn\u2019t ask and I answer it. \u201cBut always alone. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve brought here.\u201d I want her to know she\u2019s the first and only.</p><p>She sits on the bed and falls back across the mattress. \u201cYour boss has great taste.\u201d</p><p>I look at the beautiful woman sprawled across my bed. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do first?\u201d</p><p>Now is the only time I have to go into town for Laurelyn\u2019s gift before tomorrow. \u201cI have to go out to the vineyard for a quick visit. I should only be gone a couple of hours.\u201d She frowns at my news. \u201cThis is still a business trip for me, but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have plenty of time for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to hit the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go while I\u2019m gone, but I don\u2019t want you to go into the water while you\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>She pokes her bottom lip out. \u201cBoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re a big girl, but it\u2019s still the ocean. Sometimes unexpected things happen and I\u2019d feel better about you not going in by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>She sits up and I kiss her. \u201cI\u2019ll be back before you know it. Don\u2019t forget to wear sunscreen. I don\u2019t need you burned for what we\u2019re going to be doing while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t find Laurelyn\u2019s gift right away, so I\u2019m gone longer than I anticipate. When I return to the house, I leave her gift in the car\u2019s glove box. I want her to think I\u2019m clueless about her birthday since she hasn\u2019t mentioned it.</p><p>I walk around to the beach and see Laurelyn\u2019s towel on the lounger where she was lying, but no sign of her. I call her name several times without a response. Where is she?</p><p>Deciding she is probably inside, I open the front door and shout her name several times without a reply.</p><p>Would she have gone into the water after I asked her not to? I know the answer. Yes, she would. The moment I answer my own question, I dash toward the beach and shout her name. I hear panic in my voice and feel it in my chest as I search the water. I don\u2019t see a sign of her anywhere.</p><p>I hear my name in the distance and I turn to see her walking along the beach\u2019s edge. She\u2019s wearing a bright red bikini. How did I miss that? I\u2019m flooded with instant relief and that\u2019s when I notice my hands trembling. She lifts her hand to wave and I lift my shaky one to return the greeting. I sit on the lounger to wait on her because my knees are threatening to buckle beneath me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m calmed, or at least appear to be, by the time she reaches me. I hold my arms out for her to come sit across my lap. I pull her close and bury my face in her hair.</p><p>\u201cWow, someone really missed me while he was gone. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is now.\u201d I forgo telling her about my near breakdown when I couldn\u2019t find her.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d She reaches for the buttons on my shirt and begins unfastening them. \u201cYou, sir, are overdressed. Go change into your trunks and swim with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>When I come out of the house, she\u2019s already shoulder deep in the clear blue water so I don\u2019t get to feast my eyes on her in the skimpy red bikini. \u201cYou just couldn\u2019t wait, could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. It\u2019s been calling to me for hours and now I\u2019m not alone, so I didn\u2019t break your rule.\u201d</p><p>I toss my towel next to hers and walk out to meet her in the ocean. She swims over and puts her arms around my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve never been anywhere so beautiful. Thank you for bringing me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s going to bring you some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe eight ball says chances are good.\u201d She kisses my mouth and rests her forehead against mine. \u201cDo you come here often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to make rounds on Aurelia at least once a month during the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you always come alone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been with anyone I wanted to bring. Until you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That\u2019s all she says and doesn\u2019t press it further.</p><p>When we\u2019re tired of swimming, we come out of the water to relax on the loungers. She\u2019s stretched out with one of her long legs bent.</p><p>\u201cI want to take you into town for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe dancing afterwards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, that sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>After dinner at a romantic caf\u00e9, I take Laurelyn to a dance club I noticed when buying her birthday present. Lights flash around us in the dark and it\u2019s packed shoulder to shoulder. It\u2019s not really the relaxed dancing I had in mind, but she seems happy about being here.</p> <p>She grabs my arms and we move toward the dance floor. The music is loud and there\u2019s a fast song playing. Laurelyn moves to it like it\u2019s something she\u2019s done a million times.</p><p>\u201cGo out dancing much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Addison and I hit the dance scene in Nashville a lot.\u201d</p><p>She turns her back to me and grabs my hands. She places them on her hips and backs up until her whole body is rubbing against mine as she dances. She knows what she\u2019s doing to me. She can feel the evidence grinding against her ass.</p><p>We\u2019re packed on the dance floor and everyone is in his or her own little world. No one is paying attention to us, so I slide my hand from her hip to between her legs. She leans her head against my chest. \u201cYou are so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help myself when you\u2019re rubbing on me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Want to get a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I need one. A big one.\u201d</p><p>We get a couple of glasses of wine from the bar and migrate to the corner so we can hear each other over the pounding bass. \u201cHave you been here before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I saw this place today and thought it might be fun. Do you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m having fun.\u201d</p><p>I feel someone bump into me from behind and I spill my wine down the front of my shirt. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>I turn to look at the jerk behind me and he sees the damage he\u2019s caused. \u201cMan, I\u2019m sorry. Please, let me buy you another drink and pay for your dry cleaning.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m afraid dry cleaning isn\u2019t going to save this. \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>He offers his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Chris and this is my wife, Trisha.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not really interested in introductions, but I choose to be friendly instead of telling these people to get lost so I can be alone with my girl. \u201cI\u2019m Lachlan and this is Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking his hand but he\u2019s looking at Laurelyn. And for longer than I like. \u201cIs the missus your wife or girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend.\u201d Laurelyn gazes at me and we both grin.</p><p>The music is loud, so the wife leans closer. \u201cHave you been together long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix weeks,\u201d I answer. That means we\u2019re half-over. I wonder if she\u2019s thinking the same thing.</p><p>Trish is screaming over the music. \u201cWow. Things are still in that new, fun, exciting stage for you.\u201d Exciting is an understatement. I should tell them what kind of relationship we have just to freak their married asses out so they\u2019ll go away.</p><p>We laugh at our shared secret. I put my arm around her and pull her close. \u201cThere\u2019s very little about us or our relationship that\u2019s boring.\u201d</p><p>Laurelyn holds her glass of wine out for me. \u201cWill you hold this for a moment while I step to the restroom?\u201d</p><p>Trisha takes the last gulp and then slides her empty glass toward the bartender. \u201cI need to go too.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. I\u2019m left with my new best friend, Chris. \u201cYour girlfriend is a Yank?\u201d</p><p>I take a drink from Laurelyn\u2019s glass since I\u2019m wearing my wine. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very beautiful. I couldn\u2019t help but notice her when you were dancing. I\u2019d really like to fuck her.\u201d</p><p>What? The music is loud and I decide I misunderstood what he said, so I tilt my head toward him. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>He steps closer and puts his hand on my shoulder. \u201cMy wife is really turned on by you. She wants to give you head while you watch me fuck your girlfriend. I mean, if you\u2019re into watching. Our only rule is no kissing. We save that for each other.\u201d</p><p>Swingers.</p><p>I know I do some weird shit when it comes to women, but this tops the fucking cake. I look like an altar boy next to this joker. I\u2019m so stunned I don\u2019t answer. I don\u2019t know how to.</p><p>Laurelyn and Swinger Trisha come back from the bathroom and rejoin the circle. Laurelyn takes her drink from my hand and I watch her face, wondering if the wifey propositioned her while in the bathroom. Her demeanor seems unchanged, so I assume Trisha left her husband in charge of closing this deal.</p><p>She loops her arm through her husband\u2019s. \u201cSo, did you ask him, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of discussing it.\u201d He grins at me. \u201cSo, what do you think? Are you guys up for it?\u201d</p><p>I think Laurelyn is trying to read my face, but can\u2019t. \u201cAre we up for what?\u201d</p><p>I pass my empty wine glass to Laurelyn. \u201cWill you hold this for me, baby?\u201d</p><p>I guess it can be called a sucker punch since he has no idea it\u2019s coming, but I make a fist and slam Swinger Chris in the jaw, sending him face down onto the dance floor. I want him to get up so I can beat the shit out of him, but he\u2019s smarter than that and stays down. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>Laurelyn stands there in shock staring at me because she has no idea what this freak wants to do to her. \u201cLachlan! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I point to Chris on the floor. \u201cYou want to know what I think? Is that a clear-enough answer for you?\u201d</p><p>Security is stalking in my direction to throw me out, so I put both hands up. \u201cNo need. We\u2019re out of here.\u201d</p><p>I take Laurelyn by the arm and pull her toward the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d I growl at her.</p><p>She follows me outside and comes to a halt. \u201cWhy did you hit him?\u201d</p><p>I keep walking toward the car. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll go back inside and kill him if I don\u2019t get out of there.</p><p>We get into the car and I grip the steering wheel. That\u2019s when I realize how damn bad my hand hurts.</p><p>\u201cLachlan, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than I\u2019m scaring myself.\u201d I just lost my shit over some guy telling me he wanted to fuck her. He made me see red. I wanted to choke the life out of him for what he said.</p><p>She\u2019s staring at me. \u201cI highly doubt that.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t talk to her about this right now. I\u2019m too furious. I start the car and drive to the house in silence. I\u2019m pissed off. She\u2019s scared and confused. Not a great combination.</p><p>Neither of us says anything when we get to the house. She walks inside and goes straight to the bedroom. I go to the kitchen and search the freezer. I don\u2019t find frozen peas, so I wrap ice in a dish towel and put it around my swollen hand. It hurts like hell, but I don\u2019t regret hitting that asshole. I\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat.</p><p>I calm down after I stand in the kitchen for a while. I decide I owe her an explanation, so I go into the bedroom to find her. She\u2019s wearing her nightgown and standing in front of the sink washing her face. She watches me in the mirror as I come up to stand behind her.</p><p>I put the dishcloth-wrapped ice on the counter before I place my hands on her upper arms and kiss one of her bare shoulders. She reaches up to touch my injured hand. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding. You need to clean this so it doesn\u2019t get infected.\u201d</p><p>She takes my hand. \u201cIs there any antiseptic here? Or maybe some triple antibiotic ointment?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m rarely here, so I don\u2019t make a habit of keeping stuff like that around. \u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>She brings it closer for a better inspection. \u201cYou should at least wash it with soap and water.\u201d</p><p>She cuts on the water and soaps a lather onto her fingers. She washes my knuckles until the dried blood is gone and then blots it dry. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to owe your boss some new towels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s still holding my hand when she looks up at me. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>I focus on her eyes as I remember his words, \u201cI\u2019d really like to fuck her.\u201d The thought of anyone else having her makes me crazy.</p><p>I reach out to hold her face. I lean forward and kiss her, not knowing if she will let me or not, but she does. When I finish, I take her hand and pull her into the bedroom toward the bed. I sit on the edge and pull her hips toward me so she\u2019s standing between my legs. Her fingers play in my tousled hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to know.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and blow it out slowly. \u201cThat guy, Chris, told me he wanted something of mine\u2014something I wasn\u2019t willing to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou. He wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? But he\u2019s married.\u201d</p><p>It makes me sick that I can\u2019t say it without picturing it in my head. \u201cHe asked me to watch him fuck you while his wife gave me head.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are wide. \u201cOh?\u201d I see it on her face when it clicks. \u201cOhh. Swingers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou pounded his face in because he wanted to have sex with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI damn sure did and I\u2019d do it ...\u201d She cuts off my words with her mouth as she slams it against mine. Her hands are at my chest working to unfasten the buttons of my wined-stained shirt. Unsatisfied with such slow progress, she reaches for the bottom and pulls it over my head while it\u2019s still buttoned.</p><p>She unfastens my belt buckle and then the button on my pants, this time more successful with the process. She slides my zipper down and puts her hand inside my jocks. Her hand encompasses me as she glides it up and down. Damn, this girl knows how to give a hand job.</p><p>She kisses me hard while her hand pumps me. I\u2019m close to coming, but she doesn\u2019t let me. \u201cWhere are the condoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuter pocket, big suitcase.\u201d</p><p>She kisses my mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Hell, there\u2019s no chance of that. I stand and kick off my daks and jocks while she\u2019s digging for the rubbers.</p><p>She slinks toward me flipping a foil package between two fingers. She uses her palms to push me down on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m putting it on this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo argument here, baby.\u201d</p><p>She opens the packet and I\u2019m such a guy. I lift my head because I want to watch her put it on me. It\u2019s hot watching her hands touch me like that. When she finishes, she shimmies her panties down her legs and steps out of them. She climbs one knee at a time onto the bed and straddles me. My hands are splayed over her hips as she watches my face. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t want Swinger Chris to have me?\u201d</p><p>Ugh, I need that image out of my head. \u201cNo fucking way.\u201d</p><p>My tip is at her wet entrance, but she doesn\u2019t slide down on it. She\u2019s rocking her hips back and forth, teasing me. \u201cCan anyone else have me, or is Swinger Chris the only one who can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else can have you, Laurelyn. I\u2019m the only one.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cThen show me.\u201d</p> <p>35</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>Lachlan comes up from the bed and flips me onto my back. He\u2019s kneeling between my legs and hooks them around his arms so he can push them back. He\u2019s not gentle about it. He drives into me without mercy, but that\u2019s the way I want this. His mouth is against my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I scream partly because it\u2019s my answer, but mostly because what he\u2019s doing feels so good.</p><p>\u201cI want you to say it.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re sideways on the bed and each thrust shoves me farther across the mattress until my head is hanging off the edge. \u201cI\u2019m ... yours ... and ... no ... one ... else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He releases one of my legs and his hand slides down so his fingers can stroke me above our point of fusion. \u201cNo one else touches you here like this.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m panting as I lift my hips against him and his fingers. \u201cOnly you, Lachlan.\u201d</p><p>He hits my sweet spot perfectly and I feel myself contract around him, detonating his orgasm. I feel like screaming at the top of my lungs, so I do because no one\u2019s around to hear me. \u201cAh, ah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Laurelyn.\u201d There\u2019s my name, just like always when he comes.</p><p>He rolls off me and collapses onto the bed. My head is still dangling off the side so I scoot back onto the mattress. I\u2019m on my back and I stare up at the beautiful sheer panels draped over the canopy above us with one thought\u2014this bed was meant for making love, but that isn\u2019t what we just did. It never is.</p><p>The bedroom fills with bright sunlight despite the curtains. I smell breakfast\u2014definitely bacon\u2014maybe pancakes. I\u2019m hungry, but I\u2019m sleepier, so I pull the sheet up over my head. It was a late night.</p><p>I get a few more minutes\u2019 sleep before I feel Lachlan reach under the sheet to tickle my nose. I wiggle it to relieve the need to scratch, but give in and reach under the covers and rake my nails across it. \u201cI thought you got to sleep in on vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t vacation for me. It\u2019s work and I have to leave soon, but I wanted to have brekkie with you for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>How does he know? I lift the covers to see him. He\u2019s grinning because he\u2019s so proud of himself. \u201cHow did you know it\u2019s my birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me on our second date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did, and I remembered, so get up for your birthday breakfast.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he remembered. He has such an eye for detail. Did he tell me when his birthday is? If he did, I forgot.</p><p>I walk into the kitchen and there is a huge breakfast buffet across the counter. There\u2019s no way we could eat all of it. \u201cDid you do all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you think less of it if I didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had it catered from one of the local restaurants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt smells delicious.\u201d</p><p>He passes a plate to me. \u201cBirthday girl goes first.\u201d</p><p>While I\u2019m plating my food, he pours me a glass of juice. He puts it on the dining room table and then joins me with a mile-high stack of pancakes. \u201cHungry much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a famishing night, but I always eat this much in the morning. You\u2019d know that if you were ever awake to join me for breakfast.\u201d He\u2019s never going to stop teasing me about being a late sleeper.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the hand today?\u201d</p><p>He holds it up to make a fist and then releases it. \u201cIt hurts, but I can move it, so it\u2019s not broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever done anything like that for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, babe.\u201d</p><p>When I finish, I slide my plate away because I\u2019m stuffed. \u201cThat was wonderful. Thank you. It was a thoughtful gift to wake up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food isn\u2019t your gift.\u201d He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a black velvet jewelry box. He puts it on the table and slides it to me. \u201cBut this is.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not fool enough to think, or hope, this little box contains a ring. I know it doesn\u2019t because that would be ridiculous, but it definitely contains a piece of jewelry.</p><p>I reach for it and flip the top open. Inside is a star-shaped pendant covered in what I assume are diamonds. \u201cI chose it because you\u2019re going to become a huge superstar after you get home.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the best birthday present ever. And the worst.</p><p>It\u2019s the best because it\u2019s so encouraging and thoughtful. It\u2019s the worst because it means that when he\u2019s telling me I\u2019m his, he leaves off the part about it only being for the next six weeks.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>I force a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect and I love it. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>I take it out of the box and pass it to him. \u201cWill you?\u201d I turn and lift my hair so he can put it on me. After he closes the clasp, he kisses the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could stay with you all day.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and touch the pendant with my fingertip. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>He smiles as he admires his gift around my neck. \u201cI\u2019ll try to get back early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly or late, either way, I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t want you to go into the water without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh! There\u2019s a country song called \u2018Don\u2019t Go Near the Water.\u2019 Now it\u2019s going to be stuck in my head all day and I hate that freakin\u2019 song. Thanks a lot, slick.\u201d</p><p>He kisses the top of my head. \u201cDon\u2019t know it, but you can thank me every time you catch yourself singing it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a suit today. Damn, he\u2019s hot in it\u2014scorching hot. He\u2019s standing over me and I grab the lapels of his jacket to pull him down for a kiss. The peck he gave me on top of my head wasn\u2019t near enough to do me all day. When I let him go, I tell him, \u201cThat\u2019s your incentive to work fast so you can leave early and come back to me.\u201d</p><p>I spend the day reading on the beach, not swimming in the water, although it\u2019s hot as hell. It\u2019s midafternoon and I decide to take a break from the sweltering heat, so I go into the house for a snack and some air conditioning.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting at the dining room table having some leftover fruit from my birthday breakfast when my personal phone rings. It\u2019s my mom, no doubt calling to wish me a happy birthday.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you having a good one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best.\u201d And it is. I\u2019m staying at a house on a private beach in New Zealand with a beautiful man I can\u2019t get enough of. Nothing beats this.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got some news that\u2019s going to make it even better.\u201d</p><p>Her idea of good news and my idea aren\u2019t always the same. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your dad. He came to see me, baby. He wants to meet you.\u201d</p><p>This is a perfect example of when our ideas of good news are on two different spectrums. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re his daughter.\u201d</p><p>I would\u2019ve given anything to hear those words when I was a child. All I wanted was for my rich and famous father to rescue me from her when I was surviving off tap water and moldy bread because she was too strung out to go to the grocery store. I prayed he\u2019d come and save me, but he didn\u2019t. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t wanted me as his daughter for twenty-three years, and he doesn\u2019t get to change his mind now because the only child he claimed is dead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Laurie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is like that, Mom. I\u2019ve been his dirty little secret all these years. At least have the balls to be honest about it.\u201d I don\u2019t know the exact moment the tears start, but I can\u2019t stop them once they begin. The more I try to hold them in, the harder they come. \u201cHe\u2019s pretended I didn\u2019t exist my whole life and the only reason he wants me now is because he has no other children left.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shocked to feel warm arms around me as Lachlan takes the phone from my hand. When did he get back? \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Laurelyn will have to call you back later.\u201d</p> <p>He hangs up on my mother and silences the ringer before he tosses the phone to the couch. He wraps his arms around me and I melt into him. He doesn\u2019t ask what she\u2019s said to upset me, but I think he has a good idea if he heard any part of our conversation.</p><p>This is another one of those moments like the morning I almost left him. He holds me and his embrace speaks without saying a word.</p><p>36</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>I\u2019m pissed off because Laurelyn\u2019s mother would call and upset her this way, especially on her birthday. This isn\u2019t improving my opinion of her at all. She\u2019s a selfish, immature woman.</p> <p>I don\u2019t understand her thought process behind her decision to tell Laurelyn this news about her father on her birthday. She knew it would upset her. Even I know that. I want to be a total caveman and slam the thing against the wall so Laurelyn\u2019s mother can never call her on it again, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>Maybe I don\u2019t understand because it\u2019s a mother/daughter thing, but something feels off to me about their relationship.</p><p>I rub circles on her back. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>I feel her head oscillating from side to side, telling me no. I kiss the top of her head and pull her to the couch. I\u2019m still in my suit so I take off my jacket and toss it across the chair. I sit on the couch and pat the cushion between my legs. \u201cCome sit with me.\u201d</p><p>She sits and leans against my chest. She\u2019s wearing a black string bikini I\u2019ve never seen and she smells like coconut and sweat from being in the sun. I\u2019m twitching in my pants because she\u2019s so close. I can\u2019t help it. Whoa, settle down, boy ... now\u2019s not the right time.</p><p>Laurelyn can be difficult to read at times, but she\u2019s hurting and I want to give her the support she deserves. She damn sure doesn\u2019t get it from anyone else in her life. I think simply holding her is what she wants, so that\u2019s what I do. I\u2019m content to sit here with her for as long as she needs me.</p> <p>We sit together like that for at least a half hour before she stops crying and says anything. She lifts her face to see me over her shoulder. \u201cYou came back early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. I want to be with the birthday girl on her special day.\u201d</p><p>She reaches for my hand and laces her fingers through it. \u201cI don\u2019t think you know how good you are at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I good at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever this is we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>I no longer have any idea what we we\u2019re doing. I only know I like it. \u201cI think you\u2019re pretty good at this too. Whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>She lifts the hand I used on Swinger Chris and inspects it. \u201cYour hand looks a lot better. The swelling is down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It barely hurts anymore.\u201d She brings it to her lips. \u201cYour kiss will make it all better in no time.\u201d</p> <p>She puts her finger on the leg of my daks and draws an imaginary infinity symbol. I remember another time when she did it. It was after our second date when I explained everything to her about what I wanted. She does it when she\u2019s nervous.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to meet me.\u201d</p><p>He. I heard enough of the conversation to know she\u2019s talking about her father, the sperm donor. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve come to think of him after hearing her call him that so many times. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve already met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a memory from my childhood. It\u2019s very vague, but I\u2019m sure I remember meeting him when I was little. My mom dressed me in a navy sailor dress. It had this huge collar on it and she pulled my hair up in pigtails. I was adorable,\u201d she laughs. \u201cShe took me to a place where ducks paddled around in this fountain. They fascinated me, but she wouldn\u2019t let me stay to watch them. She took me to him. I know it was the sperm donor, even if I don\u2019t remember his face. As far as I know, I never saw him again\u2014except on television and in the music department at Walmart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not curious about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere have been times in my life when I was and I\u2019d have given anything to see him, but it ain\u2019t today. And it won\u2019t be tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s late evening and Laurelyn is in the bathroom getting ready to go out for dinner. I\u2019m sitting on the couch and hear the buzzing vibration of her phone, but it stops before I\u2019m able to pick it up. I look at the screen and see a missed call from Blake Phillips. Who the hell is he?</p><p>He could be anyone. A relative. A friend. A boyfriend. I want to know, but I don\u2019t dare ask because I\u2019m afraid to know the answer.</p><p>Laurelyn comes into the living room and I slide her phone into my pocket. I don\u2019t want her to know I saw the call from this man; tonight isn\u2019t the right time to have this conversation.</p><p>She\u2019s caught a lot of sun while we\u2019ve been here and her skin is golden against her cream sundress. I\u2019m happy to see her wearing her birthday gift, and I reach out to touch it where it rests against her neck. \u201cThis is perfect on you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles as she reaches up to touch it. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and I love it. Thank you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more beautiful. And you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>I take her to an Italian restaurant where I\u2019ve eaten before when in town on business. The food is great and it\u2019s the last place I\u2019d expect to be accosted by a set of sexual deviants. At least I hope. My fist isn\u2019t ready to be used again quite so soon. I told Laurelyn it was fine, but I lied. It still hurts like hell.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unusually quiet. What\u2019s going on in that head of yours, Mr. Henry?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m thinking of things better left alone. I know she\u2019s only been with one other man. Is it Blake Phillips? Not knowing is taunting me. Is he the one who hurt her? I can\u2019t get him off my mind, so I decide there are other ways of asking about him without asking.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about how a beautiful woman like you must date a lot.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and the candlelight illuminates her high cheekbones. \u201cI do. I\u2019ve had a date with an extremely handsome man almost every day for the past six weeks.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s deflecting from the real question. \u201cNo, I mean before you came here.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs as she looks down at her plate. \u201cNot so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a serious relationship?\u201d</p><p>Her head oscillates from side to side. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think she\u2019s lying to me, but I find it hard to believe someone so desirable has never been in a relationship. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s fidgeting in her seat. I\u2019m making her uncomfortable, so there\u2019s plenty she isn\u2019t telling me. \u201cI had something one time, but boyfriend doesn\u2019t feel like the right word for what he was to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it serious?\u201d Was it Blake Phillips?</p><p>She\u2019s pushing her food around and I think I\u2019ve upset her. Dammit. \u201cI thought it was at the time, but we had a difference of opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Does that mean he left her? Does she still want him?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just making conversation.\u201d She\u2019s being vague, which causes me to be suspicious. My gut tells me there\u2019s much more to this story. She isn\u2019t a woman who has had a single one-sided serious relationship, but I choose to drop it for now, leaving it open as a topic I may want to revisit. Looks like we both have secrets.</p><p>She\u2019s sitting at the dining room table with her eyes closed when I bring in a cake with twenty-three flaming candles. \u201cYou can open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s a lot of fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait until you\u2019re thirty,\u201d I laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s even more.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkles. \u201cYou told me you were twenty-nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was when we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you turn thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks ago\u2014on the thirteenth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d she whispers and she looks hurt. I see her thumbing through her filed memories from two weeks ago. \u201cIt was when you went to your parents\u2019 house, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I almost left you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the same way you told me today was your birthday?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cRight. I don\u2019t guess I can be too upset with you since I did the exact same thing. I would\u2019ve given you a gift if I\u2019d known.\u201d</p><p>I sit in the chair beside her and take her hands. \u201cBut, you did. Staying with me was the best gift you could\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think she knows what to say to that, so I make it easy for her. \u201cMake a wish and blow out your candles before we catch the house on fire.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and draws a deep breath before she leans forward to extinguish the twenty-three tiny flames.</p><p>I want all of her wishes to come true. Not just this one.</p><p>37</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>After Lachlan finishes his work at the Auckland vineyard, we return to Avalon and fall back into our routines. He works every day while I keep busy at the house, waiting for him to come home.</p><p>Wow. We have routines. How domestic is that? And I called Avalon home? That\u2019s a minuscule detail that doesn\u2019t evade my attention.</p><p>Harvest time for the vineyards is approaching, so Lachlan is working a lot more since our return from New Zealand. I spend time with Addison when she\u2019s not wrapped up with Zac, but I\u2019m still left with a lot of time to keep myself busy, so I do the only thing I can: I throw myself into writing music. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have a career to return to in four weeks. At least, I hope I still have a career. Blake still owns half the rights to my songs from the record we were producing, and he can shove them up his ass. I\u2019m writing new songs. It\u2019s the wrecked affair with him I worry about. I pray word of it doesn\u2019t get out and ruin everything I\u2019ve worked so hard to achieve.</p><p>Wow. I only have four weeks left with Lachlan.</p><p>Our precious time together feels like a candle with wicks burning at both ends. Once the flame meets in the middle, we\u2019re over. I\u2019ll never see him again, or hear his laugh or touch his skin. I\u2019ll never share a bed with him again. Am I prepared for it when that time comes? I don\u2019t think I am, but it doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m not. It\u2019s coming, and I\u2019d better figure out how to get ready.</p> <p>I\u2019m thankful to have the Martin and the baby grand at my disposal because Lachlan\u2019s long hours give me a lot of time to compose. Being here inspires me. Hell, I should at least be honest about it. It\u2019s Lachlan who inspires me. I know the stuff I\u2019m writing is gold, but the inspiration behind the music is bittersweet, and I fear I\u2019ve come to that place I didn\u2019t want to be\u2014writing hits because I\u2019m terribly in love.</p><p>I\u2019m tinkering with a melody on the baby grand when Mrs. Porcelli comes into the living room. \u201cDinner is ready and on the stove, Laurelyn, so I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs. Porcelli. Have a nice evening.\u201d</p><p>I play the chorus again, trying to decide if it\u2019s right. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely song, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been listening?\u201d</p> <p>She nods. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I doubt you\u2019ve had much choice but to listen. You think it\u2019s good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I hope you\u2019re not the only one who thinks so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also think he feels the same about you.\u201d I look up from the piano at her. \u201cThe song is about Mr. McLachlan, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, dear. Have you played it for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I could never do that.\u201d And I especially couldn\u2019t if the song is that transparent.</p><p>\u201cI think you should reconsider. He\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll be choofing off now. Have a good evening.\u201d</p><p>I work on my newest song until Lachlan comes home. Home. There\u2019s that word again. I see him standing in the doorway watching me, and I stop singing the moment his eyes meet mine. How long as he been standing there?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. Don\u2019t stop on my account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been at it all day, so I\u2019m ready to call it quits for the night.\u201d I get up from the bench. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready. Would you like to eat now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re joining me.\u201d</p><p>I walk to the doorway to kiss him. \u201cI\u2019ve joined you every night for two months. I\u2019m not stopping now.\u201d</p><p>I fill our plates with salmon and rice pilaf while Lachlan chooses a vintage, and then we meet at the informal dining table. He pulls my chair out for me and pours my wine. It\u2019s one of the many routines we\u2019ve developed after living together for eight weeks.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember me telling you I wanted to take you to Sydney a while back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you have tickets for the opera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Madama Butterfly. It\u2019s this weekend and I still want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in, but I have to warn you\u2014I\u2019m no fan of opera. I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not a huge fan myself, but these tickets are a gift from one of my customers in Sydney. They\u2019re balcony seats and I\u2019m afraid he has the tickets for the other seats and will know if I don\u2019t show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so considerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being considerate. I\u2019m being business-minded. I don\u2019t want to insult him and lose his account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, you\u2019re being considerate in your business-mindedness.\u201d</p><p>He laughs at me. \u201cBusiness-mindedness. Say that fast ten times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was hard enough to say it once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe trip won\u2019t be a total bust. We\u2019ll do the opera on Friday night and then I have other plans for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you. You\u2019ll have to wait and find out on Saturday, Miss Beckett.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m wearing a fitted black cocktail dress and a stole with a pair of tall heels. Devil shoes. That\u2019s what I call them because they\u2019re going to hurt like hell if I walk much in them. But damn, they make me look great, and that\u2019s what I want\u2014to be beautiful for Lachlan, even if it\u2019s painful. I can stand the hurt.</p><p>I\u2019m in front of the mirror fastening my diamond pendant around my neck when Lachlan comes into the bathroom. \u201cYou\u2019re missing something.\u201d</p><p>I inspect myself and take inventory. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s referring to, but I take the opportunity to mess with him. \u201cHow did you know I wasn\u2019t wearing panties?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen and so does his smile as he reaches for the hem of my dress to assess the situation. \u201cYou\u2019re not? Well, that happens to be very convenient.\u201d</p><p>I swat his hand. \u201cThere\u2019ll be none of that until later. What am I missing?\u201d</p><p>He pulls a black velvet box from the inner pocket of his jacket. \u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>I look at the box sitting on his opened palm. \u201cYou spoil me, Lachlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you love it. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at him. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love being spoiled by Lachlan. I do, but it makes me uncomfortable when he gives me expensive gifts. Anything housed in a jewelry box is going to cost big bucks.</p><p>It clicks as he pops its top and I see a pair of diamond solitaire earrings\u2014big ones. I reach out and touch them. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are, but you\u2019re more beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He always tells me that. I wonder if he said that to the others.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d I hold out my palm, grinning. \u201cGive me my new earrings so I can put them on.\u201d</p><p>He takes them from the box and places them in my hand one at a time. I tilt my head to the side so my hair falls out of the way while I put the first solitaire in. Damn, it\u2019s even bigger in my ear. I wonder how many carats these are? No doubt a lot.</p><p>After I put the second one in, I hold my head upright and Lachlan tucks my hair behind my ears for inspection. \u201cEven if minor, diamonds always have some imperfections, but you make these perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the earrings and the compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. Are you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>We arrive at the Sydney Opera House and Lachlan has made arrangements to park in the concourse section near the entrance since there is no valet. My feet thank him. Otherwise, we\u2019d be doing some trekking from the public parking area.</p><p>We\u2019re walking toward the entrance when a man with a huge camera steps in front of us and begins to snap pictures. The flash of light is almost blinding as I feel Lachlan\u2019s hand at the small of my back, urging me to move along.</p><p>When we are in the building, I look at Lachlan and he doesn\u2019t seem fazed by the bizarre incident at all. \u201cThat was strange. What do you think that was all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was a photographer assigned to cover opening night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe newspaper should teach their staff to be courteous when photographing patrons. That was rude. And ridiculous. He acted like he had to snap as many pictures as possible before you punched him out\u2014like a paparazzi going after a celebrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should probably find our seats so I can speak with Mr. Brees, if he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>In our private balcony section, we\u2019re on the second of two rows. Lachlan leans over once we\u2019re seated and whispers, \u201cThat\u2019s not Mr. Brees sitting in front of us. You want to leave?\u201d</p><p>Is he serious? \u201cNo. We\u2019re here. We\u2019re dressed up. Let\u2019s act like we know something about opera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know all about opera. I\u2019m just not a fan. My mother loves it, so I grew up hearing it. Madama Butterfly is her favorite, so I know it inside and out. We can blow this off and go do something else if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want to stay, especially since I didn\u2019t know I was with an opera expert. You can explain it to me.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cAwesome. That\u2019s just what I wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>The curtain goes up, and after just a few moments, I\u2019m lost. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. It\u2019s 1904 and the man, Pinkerton, is a US Naval officer. He\u2019s about to marry a fifteen-year-old Japanese girl they call Butterfly, but he knows he\u2019s going to divorce her when he finds a proper American wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s pretty shitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me. I didn\u2019t write it. Anyway, Butterfly loves Pinkerton so much, she converts from her Japanese religion to Christianity. Her uncle finds out she converted and comes to the house where they are being wed. He shows his ass, curses Butterfly, and renounces her. The end of this act is them preparing for their wedding night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is like bow-chicka-wow-wow, only opera style?\u201d</p><p>He starts laughing and earns several shushes from the row of people in front of us. He leans closer and I feel a warm rush of breath against my ear as he whispers. \u201cNo, Madama Butterfly isn\u2019t bow-chicka-wow-wow by any means, but I\u2019ll sure show you some when we get back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>His promise sends a flood of need between my legs and I become restless in my seat. Lachlan watches me and smiles. \u201cEverything okay over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really not wearing panties?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not.\u201d There was no way I was ruining this great dress with a panty line.</p><p>He\u2019s trying to read my face, but he can\u2019t tell. He pulls the stole from around my shoulders and spreads it across my lap. \u201cI think your legs are cold.\u201d</p><p>No, sir, I\u2019m anything but cold right now.</p> <p>\u201cMy hand is cold too. I need you to warm it up,\u201d he whispers as he slides it under the fabric across my thighs.</p><p>No way. He is not about to do that here ... oh, oh, yes, he is.</p><p>I feel his fingers spidering between my legs, scaling up my thighs to where I ache for his touch. \u201cHmm, someone isn\u2019t wearing panties. Shameless.\u201d</p><p>I shift back in my seat and he strokes his fingers up and down, spreading the moisture from my center. \u201cI love how you are always so wet.\u201d</p><p>Lucky for me, it\u2019s dark inside the theatre, but I still glance around to make sure no one is watching us. With what he\u2019s doing, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d care if they were.</p> <p>His fingers are frustrating, but amazing. I want to buck hard and ride his hand until I come into a million shards, but I can\u2019t without drawing attention. It\u2019s slow torture. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you more, but you have to behave yourself. Can you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t answer so I nod to show my compliance and then I feel his fingers start to slide. In. Out. In. Out. I almost lose it, right then and there, but I hold it together by biting my bottom lip. His fingers speed and I feel it building. It\u2019s coming. And so am I as Butterfly prepares for her wedding night.</p><p>38</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>I\u2019ve never enjoyed opera so much in my life.</p><p>Laurelyn and I leave the theatre a few moments before the curtain closes. She doesn\u2019t want to face the couple sitting in front of us on the balcony. She\u2019s pretty certain they heard her muffled squeal and knew exactly what was going on. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s right.</p> <p>We walk across the parking lot hand in hand and another photographer steps in front of us to take more pictures. Laurelyn puts her hand up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there are plenty of other people for you to photograph. Find someone else.\u201d</p><p>The photographer lowers his camera to look at Laurelyn. I think she amuses him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I already have what I need.\u201d</p><p>She really has no idea who I am.</p><p>When we\u2019re in my car, I take my phone from my pocket to turn it back on and see almost a dozen missed calls from Mum, Evan, and Chloe. \u201cSomething\u2019s going on because my family has been blowing up my phone for the past two hours.\u201d</p><p>I call Mum first and don\u2019t get an answer, so I try Evan next. He doesn\u2019t even say hello when he answers. \u201cJack, it\u2019s Dad. He\u2019s been taken to the hospital. We don\u2019t know anything for sure yet, but he could be having a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum said they were at home and he started complaining of chest pain. She tried to get him to go to the hospital, but you know Dad. He wanted to see if it would pass, but it got worse so she called an ambulance. They took him back about thirty minutes ago and said they\u2019d give us an update when they know more. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Sydney.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re at St. Vincent\u2019s. How long will it take you to get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll come down and meet you in the lobby.\u201d</p><p>I end my call with my brother and I\u2019m numb. This is my indestructible dad he\u2019s talking about. He just retired so he could finally spend time with Mum. They were going to travel the world together.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my dad. He\u2019s been taken to the hospital. My brother says he might be having a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Laurelyn reaches for my hand. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, Lachlan. Will it take you long to get to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s at St. Vincent\u2019s here in Sydney. It isn\u2019t far.\u201d</p><p>She grabs my hand and kisses it. \u201cYou need to go. Now. I\u2019ll take a taxi back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>She pulls the handle on the door to get out and that\u2019s when I realize I don\u2019t want her to go. I need her, so I touch my hand to her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t leave. I want you to be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have your family.\u201d</p><p>I swallow before I say the words that will change this relationship forever. \u201cYou\u2019re the one I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that would mean meeting your family.\u201d</p><p>It does, and I\u2019m okay with that if it means she\u2019s by my side. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I need you to be with me.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and cradles my face with her hands. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll come if it\u2019s what you want, but this is going to change everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>I race toward the hospital and we\u2019re there in five minutes. We enter the lobby and I see Evan waiting for us by the elevators. \u201cAny news?\u201d</p><p>He takes a look at Laurelyn. I know he\u2019s putting it all together and remembering the photographs, but now isn\u2019t the time to tell him to stop picturing her naked. \u201cI walked down right after I talked to you, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know if it\u2019s a bad one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It could be something else, but the tests they\u2019re doing now will tell us how extensive the damage is if it\u2019s a heart attack. When he comes out, he might have to be in the intensive care unit.\u201d</p><p>Shit, that doesn\u2019t sound good.</p><p>Laurelyn squeezes my hand. \u201cI know intensive care sounds scary, but I think being monitored there after a heart attack would be standard care, regardless of the severity.\u201d</p><p>This is why I need her here. She\u2019s my anchor. She calms me.</p><p>\u201cThis is my brother, Evan.\u201d Who better not be picturing you naked right now.</p><p>\u201cLaurelyn, it\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019ve heard some great things about you from my brother.\u201d Evan keeps it tame, but I\u2019m positive he would jack with me if he were meeting her under other circumstances.</p><p>We follow him onto the elevator and then he ushers us to where the rest of the family is waiting. My mum is out of her seat the second she sees us and has me in her arms. \u201cI thought we\u2019d never get you, Jack Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. My phone was off because Laurelyn and I were at the Opera House.\u201d</p><p>My mum lets me go and gives her full attention to the girl by my side. This is it. This is where it\u2019s all going to change. She\u2019s going to know my name. \u201cLaurelyn, this is my mother, Margaret McLachlan.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the circumstances with my dad or the end of her wait to meet the woman she perceives as my girlfriend, but my mother pulls Laurelyn into a tight embrace. I almost think she\u2019s going to cry, but she keeps it together. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I would ever get to meet you. Jack Henry has promised me more than once he would bring you to the house, but something always comes up. I was beginning to wonder if you existed, but I see now that you do, and you\u2019re even more beautiful than the pictures he showed me.\u201d</p><p>And there it is. She knows I\u2019m Jack Henry McLachlan and from the look on her face, it doesn\u2019t mean jack shit to her. I want to bust out laughing. All of this secrecy about who I am has been for nothing.</p><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s very nice to meet you, Mrs. McLachlan. Jack Henry has told me wonderful things about you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell! Laurelyn doesn't know that my mum is the only person on earth who calls me Jack Henry. I see Mum\u2019s face and know the shit just got real. \u201cYou call him Jack Henry?\u201d</p><p>Laurelyn is unaware of this blunder. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>My mum takes Laurelyn\u2019s face in her hands and leans forward to whisper something in her ear. God, help me. She\u2019s so determined to marry me off, there\u2019s no telling what she told her. She may have proposed marriage for me.</p><p>Mum recovers from meeting the woman she thinks is her potential daughter-in-law and we join the rest of the family in the waiting room. I introduce Laurelyn to Chloe, and then Emma and the girls. It\u2019s an awkward introduction for her to meet my family for the first time under these circumstances, but she handles it well.</p><p>We\u2019re all antsy because it\u2019s been almost two hours since my dad went back, but his doctor finally comes out with an update. \u201cAre you Henry McLachlan\u2019s family?\u201d</p><p>My mum is the one to answer. \u201cYes. I\u2019m his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. McLachlan is doing well. It wasn\u2019t a heart attack as we suspected, but he had two very significant blockages. One was ninety percent blocked, the other about ninety-five. That\u2019s where the pain was coming from. We\u2019ve stented both of them and I expect him to make a full recovery. We\u2019ll watch him overnight and he should be able to go home tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>My mum holds her head with her hand, her face flooded with relief. \u201cThank you so much. When can we see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be coming out of recovery any minute. He\u2019s going to a step-down cardiac unit instead of the intensive care. His nurse will come for you when he\u2019s settled into a room.\u201d</p><p>I see Evan huddled with his wife and children while Mum and Chloe are hugging, and I know bringing Laurelyn with me was the right decision, even if my dad\u2019s condition ended up being less than life-threatening.</p><p>She hugs me and our foreheads touch. \u201cYour dad is going to be fine.\u201d She smiles as she adds, \u201cJack Henry.\u201d</p><p>I whisper so my family can\u2019t hear. \u201cIt\u2019s weird hearing it come out of your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels weird to say it.\u201d And that\u2019s the end of our name conversation. This isn\u2019t the time or place to discuss it.</p><p>We don\u2019t wait long until the nurse comes for us. \u201cI can take five of you, but children aren\u2019t allowed.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s holding Mila and looks up at Evan. \u201cHe\u2019s your dad. You go and I\u2019ll stay with them.\u201d</p><p>Laurelyn peers up at me. \u201cI don\u2019t know your father. Emma should go.\u201d She turns to my sister-in-law. \u201cI can stay with the girls, if you don\u2019t mind leaving them with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I see the relief on Emma\u2019s face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Laurelyn takes a slumbering Mila from Emma and carries her over to where Celia is sleeping in a chair. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p><p>We enter Henry McLachlan\u2019s hospital room in a cluster. None of us say it, but it\u2019s frightening to see this strong man so frail and weak. He\u2019s pale against the white hospital sheets\u2014almost white on white.</p> <p>He hears us enter and opens his eyes. He looks groggy. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the anesthetic wearing off.</p><p>He looks at my mum first. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been between them. She\u2019s always his number one.</p><p>And that\u2019s what my mum wants me to have. My very own number one.</p><p>She sits in the chair at his bedside while we observe as spectators. My dad reaches for her hand and she places it inside his. \u201cI should have listened to you, Margaret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been saying that for years, Henry.\u201d</p> <p>The dismal mood in the room is lifted by my mum\u2019s humor. She speaks her mind. I get that from her, but she also has a gift for easing the discomfort and tension of those around her.</p><p>\u201cHenry, I might ought to thank you for trying to die because you\u2019ll never guess who Jack Henry brought to the hospital with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, love, judging by the happiness on your face, it can only be the woman he\u2019s been dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and she\u2019s lovely. Just beautiful. And she calls him Jack Henry.\u201d</p><p>The whole family stares at me because they missed that conversation between Laurelyn and Mum. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>As always, my sister is the first to argue. \u201cYou\u2019re full of it. That\u2019s a huge deal.\u201d</p> <p>I needed to change the subject, and fast. \u201cWe\u2019re not here about Laurelyn and me. We\u2019re here for Dad.\u201d</p><p>Visiting hours end and my dad\u2019s nurse assures us his condition is good. She convinces us it would be best for everyone, including my mum, to go home for the night. The waiting room doesn\u2019t make for a good night\u2019s rest.</p><p>I\u2019m the first one in the waiting room with Mum not far behind. Laurelyn has Celia tucked under her arm like a mother hen and baby Mila draped over her shoulder, sucking her thumb as she looks around.</p><p>Her soft voice carries across the waiting room and I hear her singing Brahms\u2019 lullaby. \u201c\u2018Close your eyes ... Now and rest ... May these hours be blessed.\u2019\u201d</p><p>My mum stands beside me listening to Laurelyn sing to my brother\u2019s ankle-biters. \u201cJack Henry, she\u2019s a special one.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have to tell me things I already know. \u201cThat she is,\u201d I sigh.</p><p>She bumps her shoulder into mine. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been a little shit for not bringing her to meet me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m amused, but not surprised by Margaret McLachlan\u2019s choice of words. She\u2019s the only mother I know who will tell her thirty-year-old son he is a little shit. If the circumstances were as she believes, she\u2019d be right. Because I can\u2019t tell her differently, I have no defense, so I don\u2019t argue. \u201cI guess I have been.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d</p><p>Where is she going with this? \u201cThe Marx.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cGo get your things. I want you and Laurelyn to stay at the house.\u201d</p><p>Now I see. She\u2019s so transparent. \u201cThe Marx is much closer to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>She takes that tone with me. That motherly do as I say tone. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had a very close call with your father. The family should be together.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she does want the family together, but that isn\u2019t what this is about. \u201cYou want Laurelyn at your house so you can have access to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t dated anyone in years. Is it wrong for me to want to spend time with her?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s unnecessary for her to get to know Laurelyn\u2014she\u2019s leaving in a month. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong as long as you don\u2019t have far-fetched ideas about us. She\u2019s only here for four more weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not written in stone, is it?\u201d</p><p>Geez, this woman is bound and determined. \u201cNo, but it\u2019s written on her airline ticket.\u201d</p><p>She huffs. \u201cI swear, McLachlan men don\u2019t have a romantic or creative bone in their bodies.\u201d</p><p>I hate that my mum has the wrong impression. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think it is between us. Laurelyn and I knew we\u2019d only have three months together when we started seeing each other. We agreed to date for fun, not for love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the heart wants what the heart wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yours wants another daughter-in-law and mother for more grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy heart wants you to be happy, and I believe that girl is the one to do it. You have four weeks to convince her to stay.\u201d She lifts her brows at me. \u201cI suggest you get on that right away, son.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re driving to my parents\u2019 house after we get our things from the hotel and I remember my mum whispering something to Laurelyn. \u201cWhat did my mum tell you at the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do you mean after the incident where I freaked her out by calling you Jack Henry?\u201d She reaches over and frogs my bicep with her knuckle. Damn, it sort of hurt. \u201cThanks for the heads-up, by the way. Not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me. I was a little preoccupied with the uncertainty of my dad\u2019s survival. What did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat she told me is our little secret, not for you to know.\u201d</p><p>Great. My mum and the woman I\u2019m having an affair with are sharing secrets behind my back. That\u2019s not awkward at all.</p><p>Now, I\u2019m more curious than ever. \u201cTell me. I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She would have told you if she wanted you to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks we\u2019re in love. Or at least have the potential to be.\u201d I throw the words out like bait on a hook to see if I can get a nibble.</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Dammit. I can\u2019t tell by her tone if she\u2019s asking my opinion or if she\u2019s being facetious.</p><p>She isn\u2019t budging, but I have my ways. I might not get what I want out of her by asking, but I have other methods of making this little bird sing.</p><p>39</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>Margaret McLachlan\u2019s words echo in my head as we drive toward her house. \u201cThe only way he\u2019d let you call him Jack Henry was if he was in love with you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a nice theory if he\u2019d asked me to call him that, but he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019s dying to know the secret I share with his mother. He\u2019s going to try to persuade me to tell him later. He thinks he\u2019s smooth, but I\u2019ve learned his ways during our time together. It\u2019ll be fun letting him try, but he won\u2019t succeed. My lips are sealed.</p><p>Lachlan navigates up a long drive leading to a huge house on top of a hill. Maybe a mountain. I\u2019m not sure because it isn\u2019t nearly as impressive as the mansion sitting on it. \u201cIs this where you grew up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d It beat the hell out of the tiny apartments and rental houses I bounced through during my early years.</p><p>Lachlan takes our bags from the car and carries them inside. There\u2019s no his or mine. Our things are packed together in his expensive luggage so at least I don\u2019t have to be embarrassed by my worn, mismatched set.</p><p>We enter through the foyer and I can\u2019t help but stare at the beautiful spiraling staircase leading to the upper floor.</p><p>I hear his mother call out, but I can\u2019t see her. \u201cJack Henry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mum. We\u2019re here. I\u2019m going to put our things away and we\u2019ll be down in a minute.\u201d</p><p>I follow him up the stairs and he takes me into his large bedroom. I\u2019m a little surprised to see a four-poster bed. It\u2019s very romantic and doesn\u2019t fit what I\u2019d expect to see in a man\u2019s room. I walk over and run my hand down one of the thick pillars. We need this bed at Avalon. I could definitely do some interesting things with it.</p><p>We go downstairs to the living room to join Lachlan\u2019s family and I remind myself the whole way that he\u2019s not Lachlan. He\u2019s Jack Henry. \u201cJack Henry.\u201d</p><p>He turns at the sound of his name. His real name. The name only his mother calls him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>This is going to take some getting used to. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m saying your name so I can get used to it. I\u2019m afraid of slipping up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If you have a slip of the tongue, we\u2019ll tell them Lachlan is your pet name for me. Not caveman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that will work. It is part of your last name. Is that why you chose it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked it because I wanted to hear you say some semblance of who I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just with you.\u201d</p><p>Damn. The conversation ends as we enter the living room. I\u2019d really like to know his rationale behind the things he does. I\u2019m hopeful that this conversation is only postponed until a later time.</p><p>After spending the evening with the McLachlan family, I\u2019m in the bathroom getting ready for bed. I thought meeting them would help me understand why Jack Henry is the way he is, but it only makes things feel more out of sorts. They\u2019re all so normal. And loving. Theirs isn\u2019t the kind of family I would expect for a man who propositions women for meaningless sexual relationships.</p><p>I search through my sleepwear, if that\u2019s what we\u2019re calling it, and choose the least desirable thing I packed, but who am I kidding? This is the same man I\u2019ve been living with for the past two months. He isn\u2019t going to perceive a short, black satin nightgown as anything but a prelude to sex.</p><p>I stop in the doorway of the bathroom before entering his bedroom. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s okay for us to sleep together in your parents\u2019 house? It doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s lying shirtless in bed with his hands folded behind his head. I sigh with pure pleasure as I behold the sight of him. \u201cTrust me. Mum would have it no other way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I come to the bed but stop to run my hand down the large post. I love this bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to give me a private dance on one of these poles tonight?\u201d</p><p>Even after all this time together, his forwardness is shocking\u2014he wants to get frisky in his childhood home with his family across the hall? \u201cNo way, not in your parents\u2019 house. It would be disrespectful.\u201d</p> <p>He gets out of bed and catches me before I climb in. He reaches around me from behind and puts my hands around the bedpost. He locks his hands on top of mine to hold them in place so I can\u2019t move. His breath is warm on the back of my neck and chills erupt all over my body. He doesn\u2019t play fair. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be mortified if your family heard us.\u201d</p><p>His mouth is on my earlobe and he sucks it into his mouth before nipping it with his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t care. Let them hear us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It comes out more like a weak plea than the stern command I intended.</p><p>He groans against my ear. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when you tell me no.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s whining but it\u2019s adorable. \u201cI know you don\u2019t hear it often, but \u2018no\u2019 can be a very good answer for you to hear from time to time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me one time when it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I look at him over my shoulder, \u201cAsk me if I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>His body becomes rigid before he backs away from me. He releases my hands and I turn around to look at him. \u201cAsk me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d It comes out as a whisper.</p><p>I lift a brow at him. \u201cDo you want my answer to be yes or no?\u201d</p> <p>I smile, waiting for him to catch on to the point I\u2019m making, but he stares blankly at me. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>I smile as I answer. \u201cNo. See? Perfect example of when \u2018no\u2019 is exactly what you need to hear.\u201d</p><p>He runs his hands through his dark hair and fists it. \u201cDon\u2019t ever fuck with me like that, Laurelyn!\u201d he yells. \u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>I flinch, startled by the loud outburst I\u2019m certain his family must have heard. Shit, he\u2019s mad\u2014like, really mad. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I thought you knew I was only making a point.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve screwed up big time. I feel the pooling in my eyes and I look toward the ceiling, pleading with my sockets to drink the tears. I hold my breath and cup my hands over my mouth to hold back the sob in my chest.</p><p>In my confusion over what has just happened, I go for the wrong door in an attempt to get away from him. \u201cThat\u2019s the closet.\u201d</p><p>Shit if I care. I walk into the small pitch-black room where Lachlan\u2019s clothes hang and close the door behind me. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a light switch in here somewhere, but I don\u2019t try to find it. I\u2019m too numb.</p><p>Several minutes pass and I hear a few light taps on the door, but I don\u2019t say anything. I need to absorb all these emotions swirling around in my head right now. I try to put a name to the shock I\u2019m feeling, but there\u2019s not a single word that will fit. I\u2019m hurt and belittled because he yelled at me and maybe even a little frightened by the fury in his voice.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure his family heard the commotion and it mortifies me to think of facing them. The worst part is the shame I feel. How can I be sleeping with a man who would become so furious by a possible pregnancy?</p><p>You know what? Fuck him.</p><p>I hear the light raps again. \u201cI sort of know you\u2019re in there unless there\u2019s a hidden passage to a dungeon I don\u2019t know about.\u201d He\u2019s trying to be humorous, but nothing in the world could be funny to me right now.</p><p>He opens the door and comes inside to stand with me in the dark. I feel him reach for me, but I step away. I can\u2019t bear the touch that once set me on fire because in this moment, it only makes me feel cheap.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And there it is again. The word that started all of this. Now I hate it and don\u2019t want to hear it, either.</p><p>I\u2019m mad as hell, but I can\u2019t control the sob in my chest. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, please, don\u2019t say that. I need to explain.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m overcome by the what-if. What if I got pregnant? He\u2019d hate me. \u201cNo. Every time we have sex, we risk making a baby together even if we use birth control. Unplanned pregnancies happen to real people every day. Look at me\u2014I\u2019m the result of one and see how shitty that ended up for everyone involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is and I can\u2019t do this anymore. I won\u2019t risk making a baby with someone who would react the way you did just now. I couldn\u2019t bear to ever see you look at me like that again.\u201d</p><p>I feel him reaching for me in the dark and I try to push him away. His arms entwine me and he squeezes, almost too tight. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Laurelyn. I thought you were playing a trick on me about a baby because you thought it was funny. I should\u2019ve known that wasn\u2019t what you were doing. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I feel his hands move to my face. \u201cI would never be angry because you were pregnant.\u201d</p><p>This conversation is too much for me. I don\u2019t want to talk about how a baby would make him feel because then I might be forced to think about how it would make me feel. \u201cCan we agree that this was a misunderstanding and talk about something else?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He hugs me in the darkness and kisses my head. \u201cI think that\u2019s a great idea, but can we leave the closet?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYou know I thought I was going into the bathroom, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>We leave the closet and climb into bed. I scoot close so I can put my head on his chest. I\u2019m reeling from tonight\u2019s events. I told him I wanted to end things with him and now, two seconds later, I\u2019m curled around him like a kitten desperate for his touch. Yeah, I really showed him who\u2019s boss.</p><p>Was I really going to walk away from him? I think I was, but there\u2019s no use in speculating. He didn\u2019t let me go.</p><p>This game has changed. The rules are no longer the same, but I don\u2019t have the manual. He does, and I need guidance on where to go from here.</p><p>He caresses my arm. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>I decide to go for it because I need to know where his head is. \u201cI\u2019m wondering where we go from here.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips continue to glide up and down my arm as he answers. \u201cTonight changed everything for us, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The word change seems like such an understatement for what has happened between us. \u201cYeah, just a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest with you, I don\u2019t really know where we go from here. I don\u2019t know how to do this new us.\u201d</p><p>He has lines and I don\u2019t dare cross them. \u201cWhat do you need from me to make this work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the new us needs to start with a first kiss.\u201d He\u2019s playful, not panicked, about this new place we are venturing. This feels like my Lachlan Henry, only better.</p><p>He sits up, rolling me to my back. His mouth comes down on mine and he pushes his tongue inside. Every motion is deliberate. He\u2019s slow and gentle. This is a new kind of kiss for the couple we are becoming.</p><p>When he stops kissing me, I search his face and see a deep wrinkle across his brow. I\u2019ve seen it before. It\u2019s only there when he\u2019s in deep concentration about something, and it frightens me. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s thinking this isn\u2019t going to work. Or maybe he doesn\u2019t want to try.</p><p>I reach up and place my thumb on top of the contracted muscle to smooth it. \u201cI only see this when you\u2019re thinking hard about something. What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m scared of what he\u2019s going to say, but he gives me a crooked grin and I\u2019m relieved before the first word leaves his mouth. \u201cSay my name.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know which one to go with. He hasn\u2019t asked me to call him anything but Lachlan and I don\u2019t want to overstep his boundaries. \u201cLachlan.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head as if to say tsk tsk, wrong answer. \u201cSay my real name.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cJack.\u201d</p><p>His face becomes serious. \u201cBoth of them.\u201d</p><p>My heart is pounding. This is huge, according to his mother. He would only ask me to do this if he loved me. \u201cJack Henry.\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes as though he\u2019s savoring the sound of it coming from my mouth. \u201cSay it again, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>I hesitate and he opens his eyes to look at me. That\u2019s when I choose to say it again, at the moment his eyes meet mine. \u201cJack Henry.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me and I feel his mouth move into the shape of a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s who I am to you from now on. No more Lachlan. No more pretending.\u201d</p><p>40</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>I\u2019ve shut the door on Lachlan Henry forever. He no longer exists. Only Jack Henry McLachlan resides here, and I like it. For the first time in more than four years, it feels good to be me with a woman. And not just any woman. Laurelyn.</p><p>\u201cNow that I know your real name, which I think you\u2019ll agree is the single-most important piece of identifying information, do I get to know everything else?\u201d</p><p>She wants the rest of my story.</p><p>\u201cYou know my name. You\u2019ve met my family. What else would you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re as close as two people can be, so I want to know everything.\u201d</p><p>Things feel really good between us the way they are. Am I ready to tell her more?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, Jack Henry. I\u2019m not going to stalk you the way Audrey does.\u201d</p><p>I hear her say my name and I\u2019m a goner. I\u2019ll tell her anything she wants to know. \u201cI have a condo here in Sydney. It\u2019s home when I\u2019m not traveling, which isn\u2019t very often, because I own too many vineyards to stay home for long.\u201d</p><p>She takes a minute to process this information. \u201cYou own them all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Avalon is my latest purchase.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t expecting that. \u201cHow many total?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo damn many.\u201d And that was the truth. I was stretched too thin across New South Wales and New Zealand. I was following in my father\u2019s footsteps and also making steps of my own. I shouldn\u2019t have purchased Avalon. I don\u2019t have the time it requires to make it successful, but I can\u2019t regret it. It\u2019s what led me to Laurelyn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo does that mean you\u2019re rich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I told you I was when we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve told me a lot of things but I\u2019ve assumed most all of it lies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of it has been, but it\u2019s all part of our game, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now our game has changed.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Indeed, it has. In more than one way.</p><p>I\u2019m rubbing my hand over the satin gown covering Laurelyn\u2019s belly and I feel the metal piercing through her navel. I really want to push her gown up and kiss her there, but I don\u2019t. She\u2019s not comfortable being intimate in my parents\u2019 house and has already told me no once tonight. I don\u2019t want an encore or a reminder of our earlier quarrel.</p><p>Since we aren\u2019t pretending anymore, I might as well warn her about Margaret McLachlan and what she\u2019s up to. \u201cMy mum wants you here so she can work on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWork on me? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants me to have a wife, and you\u2019re the closest thing she\u2019s seen. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if her surprise is at Mum\u2019s intentions or because I bring it up. \u201cI guess she didn\u2019t get the memo about our agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d shit if she knew what I\u2019d been up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t you tell her I was leaving permanently next month?\u201d</p><p>Permanently. What a shitty word. I hate it as much as no. \u201cShe knows but doesn\u2019t care. She\u2019s determined.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we should roll with it. You know, make her happy.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. It isn\u2019t a terrible idea and getting her to back off for a while would be nice. \u201cI\u2019ll do it if you\u2019re sure you\u2019re up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuh-lease, like you and I don\u2019t know how to pretend.\u201d</p><p>Of course, I wake before Miss Sleeping Beauty. She\u2019s so peaceful, I want to let her sleep longer. Besides, she\u2019ll need her rest for what\u2019s ahead of her today. Margaret McLachlan can be exhausting.</p><p>I\u2019m wearing sleep pants only, so I put on a T-shirt before going downstairs. I\u2019m the first one up, as always. I\u2019m even awake before baby Mila.</p><p>I make a cup of coffee, but opt to wait on breakfast until Chloe\u2019s up. I\u2019m certain she\u2019ll have some new dish she wants to try out on us.</p><p>I fetch the newspaper and sit at the bar. I start at the back\u2014because it\u2019s my routine\u2014and resist the temptation to thumb through for the photo I\u2019m certain will be there. I turn the page a second time and there it is, just as I knew it would be. We made the news, baby.</p><p>We\u2019re in the \u201cMy Sydney\u201d section. Laurelyn is beautiful in the photo, even if it\u2019s only newspaper quality. I scan the small caption beneath and laugh. \u201cMultimillionaire bachelor Jack McLachlan at the Sydney Opera House with mystery woman.\u201d</p> <p>Mystery woman. She\u2019s definitely that. I really can\u2019t believe anyone cares about this kind of shit. Except Audrey. She thinks she successfully sent Laurelyn on her way, so she\u2019s going to flip out if she sees this. It might be wise to have Jim tail her for a few days so I know her whereabouts. I\u2019ll need to call him later today.</p><p>I hear someone come into the kitchen and I know it\u2019s Mum without looking. She\u2019s the only other early riser in the family. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Mum.\u201d</p><p>She waits for her cup of coffee to finish brewing. \u201cHave a good night?\u201d</p><p>Damn, I think the old girl is asking if I had a naughty with Laurelyn last night? I lower the newspaper and glance at her over the top. \u201cI slept fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Laurelyn?\u201d</p><p>This is too bloody much. \u201cShe\u2019s still sleeping.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not done, not even close. \u201cI thought I heard something come from your bedroom last night\u2014like maybe you raising your voice to Laurelyn.\u201d She\u2019s giving me that look, the same one she gave me the night of my birthday party when she thought I left a sick Laurelyn home alone. It tells me I better not have screwed this up with her.</p><p>I\u2019m in a shitload of trouble. I feel like a toddler about to be disciplined. I lift the paper up so I don\u2019t have to look at her and return to reading. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all I give her because that\u2019s all she needs to know.</p><p>\u201cJack Henry, you shouldn\u2019t have shouted at that sweet girl like that. I didn\u2019t teach you to disrespect women like that.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue with her because she was right. I hate that I yelled at Laurelyn. \u201cI knew it was wrong the minute it came out of my mouth. I told her how sorry I was and she forgave me. We\u2019re fine, so stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen hold grudges. She might have told you that you were forgiven last night, but now she\u2019s had time to think on it. You\u2019ll be lucky if she speaks to you today.\u201d</p><p>I hope Laurelyn gets up soon, but judging on the time, it will be another couple of hours. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t play games like other women. If she says she forgives me, then I\u2019m confident she does. You\u2019ll see when she gets up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ll see, son.\u201d</p><p>Luck is on my side. Laurelyn gets up early. I\u2019m still reading the paper when she comes into the kitchen. She walks up behind me and puts her hands on my shoulders. I peer at her over my shoulder. \u201cGood morning, love.\u201d Is she going to think the endearment is too much?</p><p>She leans around and kisses the side of my face. \u201cGood morning, darling.\u201d No, she\u2019s good with it. My mum is all detective-eyed, analyzing Laurelyn\u2019s interaction with me following the lovers\u2019 spat.</p><p>She sits on the stool next to me at the bar. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you up so early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep after I woke and you weren\u2019t there.\u201d Oh, she\u2019s laying it on thick for dear ol\u2019 Mum.</p><p>I turn to the social page to show Laurelyn our picture since I don\u2019t have to keep her in the dark anymore. \u201cLook, we made the news. You\u2019re a mystery woman.\u201d</p><p>She leans over my shoulder for a better view. \u201cHmm, at least it\u2019s a good picture and I\u2019m not making some kind of goofy face.\u201d She bumps my shoulder with hers. \u201cWhich was a real possibility since I wasn\u2019t expecting a total stranger to shove a camera in my face.\u201d</p><p>I sense Mum\u2019s scrutiny. \u201cThis is new for Laurelyn. We don\u2019t attract this kind of attention in Wagga Wagga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve enjoyed being innominate in a small town. I know how you love your privacy.\u201d She has no idea. Laurelyn\u2019s eyes meet mine and we smile at our private joke.</p><p>Dad does well, so he is discharged home and we spend the next two days with my family. Laurelyn and I play the part of being in love for my mum, at times making a game of it to see who can be more convincing. It\u2019s fun and I\u2019m surprised by how natural it comes for me. Sometimes it\u2019s unintentional and I wonder if it comes as easy for her.</p><p>It\u2019s her second day with my family and she has already found a comfortable place among them. She and Chloe are almost the same age and have a lot in common, but she connects most with Emma. I think it\u2019s because she plays with the girls and they have taken a special liking to her, which is unusual. Mila doesn\u2019t like anyone. Especially me.</p><p>She\u2019s on the floor with the girls and I see the way my mum watches her. Her natural ease with my brother\u2019s children doesn\u2019t escape her attention.</p><p>My mum is sitting next to me on the couch. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she won Mila over. That kid doesn\u2019t like anyone.\u201d I think I could be a little jealous. \u201cShe likes Laurelyn better than me and I\u2019m her uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurelyn\u2019s mother material. Mila senses that about her.\u201d We watch them play a few more minutes and Mum leans over to whisper in my ear. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do something about it, she\u2019s going to make a wonderful mother for some other man\u2019s children.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve watched the way my family has interacted with her for two days and realize my mistake. I shouldn\u2019t have brought her here. They\u2019re all falling in love with her.</p><p>41</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>We\u2019re driving back to Avalon and I\u2019m thinking how I\u2019ve enjoyed the last three days with Jack Henry\u2019s family. We\u2019ve spent the last seventy-two hours pretending to be head over heels in love. It was so easy to play the part, I have to ask myself if I was pretending at all.</p><p>I\u2019m curious to see if we revert back to our former selves now that we\u2019re away from his family or if we\u2019ll continue our romantic fa\u00e7ade. I\u2019m too afraid to ask because the answer\u2014either one\u2014scares me.</p><p>He reaches for my hand and rubs his thumb across the top of my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell him what I\u2019m thinking. He would freak out. I think. \u201cYou have a great family. I\u2019m glad I got to meet them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think you\u2019re pretty great too. Especially Mum. She was in heaven seeing us together.\u201d He squeezes my hand. \u201cThank you for helping me make her happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d And it was my absolute pleasure.</p><p>I go to sleep in the car and it\u2019s late when we get to the vineyard. Mrs. Porcelli is already gone for the evening, but we find she has left us a welcome-home dinner on the stove. I\u2019ve never minded cooking or cleaning, but I must admit that walking in to find a home-cooked meal after a five-hour drive is a definite perk of living with Jack Henry.</p><p>He brings our bags in from the car and drops them in the laundry room before he joins me in the kitchen. I lift the top of the casserole dish to see what we have. Hmm, maybe it\u2019s some kind of chicken casserole? \u201cSmells good. Are you ready for dinner now?\u201d</p><p>I feel him behind me and his hands are creeping under my cotton dress. \u201cI\u2019m ready for dessert now.\u201d</p><p>Mmm ... I love me some him.</p><p>He goes straight for the kill, sliding his hand down the front of my panties. \u201cJack Henry, we just walked through the door.\u201d I check the clock on the stove. It\u2019s only a quarter past five. What if Mrs. Porcelli is still hanging around? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a week,\u201d he groans in my ear as he teases me with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three days,\u201d I correct him as I drop my head back against his chest. But it could be three minutes and I think I\u2019d want him again.</p><p>He slips a finger inside me and then another. \u201cI can\u2019t help myself. It feels like forever since I\u2019ve been inside you.\u201d</p> <p>I feel his rock-hard erection grinding against my bottom while he slides his fingers in and out of me. The way his hand is positioned, his fingers are rubbing my sweet spot and each stroke brings me closer to orgasm.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Laurelyn, and say my name when you do.\u201d</p><p>Now, I\u2019m grinding down on his hand and I\u2019m saying his name in my head over and over until I fall over the edge into pure oblivion. \u201cJack Henry,\u201d I cry out with the familiar spasms I\u2019ve come to love so much.</p><p>I recognize the sound of a tearing wrapper so I know what\u2019s he\u2019s doing. I feel his fingers loop around the waistband of my panties and he drags them down my legs until I step out of them. \u201cHold on to the countertop. We\u2019re not going to make it to the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my hands around the edge of the solid granite in front of me and he uses his knee to push my legs apart. One of his arms loops around my waist and yanks me so that I\u2019m bent just the way he wants me. I feel him there, against my wet core, and then he pushes inside me with a force reflecting that of his pent-up sexual frustration.</p> <p>I cry out at the surprise of the sudden intrusion and he stills. \u201cToo rough?\u201d</p><p>It only takes a moment for me to adjust to this position and then I\u2019m rocking against him wanting more. \u201cNo, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>We synchronize our rhythms and he pounds into me over and over until I hear my name. That\u2019s when I know he\u2019s slipped over the edge. So I follow him.</p><p>Two Weeks Later</p><p>I wake at four in the morning with lyrics racing through my head. I almost leave the bed to go to the piano, but I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t stand the thought of losing one minute of lying next to Jack Henry.</p><p>After he\u2019s gone to work, I scramble to the piano to play the tune that danced in my head all morning and struggle to remember the exact words I was sure I couldn\u2019t forget.</p> <p>I jot down lyrics telling my story\u2014how I wonder who will take my place after I\u2019m gone and how I am secretly desperate for him to ask me to stay because I love him so much. I struggle because my hand isn\u2019t fast enough to get the lyrics down as they flow from my head.</p><p>I put the words to music and sing them aloud, adjusting the melody for the best sound. I raise the key to test the tone of the chorus.</p><p>As I sing, I have that feeling you get when you\u2019re being watched. Since Mrs. Porcelli often listens to me play, I look toward the doorway expecting to see her, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s Margaret McLachlan.</p><p>My heart jumps into my throat. I immediately think something terrible has happened to Henry and she sees the fear in my eyes. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>I bring my hand to my chest, as if to calm my erratic heart. I get up from the piano and she meets me halfway for a hug. \u201cJack Henry is out on the vineyard. Should I call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t come to see him.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m confused by this and I gesture toward the couch. \u201cCome sit with me. Would you care for some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine, thank you.\u201d She takes a seat on the sofa and I sit on the edge of the chair across from her. It seems the appropriate place for me to be\u2014on the edge of my seat\u2014because I\u2019m dying to know what has brought her to Avalon.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I would have called, but I had no way of getting your number unless I asked Jack Henry, and I don\u2019t want him to know I\u2019m here to see you.\u201d</p><p>This is news I wasn\u2019t expecting. \u201cYou\u2019re here to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laurelyn. I know you\u2019re only here for two more weeks and I have something I want to say to you.\u201d</p><p>I clutch the cushion of the chair to hold on so my ass doesn\u2019t fall off into the floor. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my son very well, and Jack Henry loves you. I see it in his eyes every time he looks at you.\u201d Is it love she saw or was it the fa\u00e7ade? \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have brought you to meet us or into our home if he didn\u2019t. Trust me. That\u2019s not something he does lightly.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s smiling. \u201cSo now, I\u2019m going to be a very forward and meddling mother. Do you love my son?\u201d</p><p>Wow. I\u2019m taken back by her question, but I know the answer without thinking about it. I should be guarded and not willing to confess it so easily, but I want nothing more than to scream it from the rooftop. \u201cYes. I love Jack Henry very much.\u201d</p><p>She smiles even bigger and pats the cushion next to her. \u201cCome sit next to me.\u201d</p><p>I get up from the chair and do as she asks. She faces me and takes my hands. \u201cBelieve me, he\u2019s going to be a stubborn jackass when it\u2019s time for you to leave in a couple of weeks. He isn\u2019t going to want to put his heart on the line and ask you to stay, but he will be sick with himself if he lets you go. Because you love him, you have to spend the rest of your time together showing him why he should ask you to stay.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. I\u2019m not sure, but I think Margaret McLachlan is advising me to get it on with her son. Does she think I haven\u2019t already been doing that?</p><p>How do I make her understand about our agreement without telling her? \u201cWe knew we\u2019d only be together for three months, so we agreed from the start that our relationship wouldn\u2019t become serious. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s changed his mind about that.\u201d</p><p>She squeezes my hands. \u201cHon, it doesn\u2019t matter what you agreed to. If you love each other, that changes everything. Trust me. Nothing else matters. And a little nookie to change his mind never hurts, either.\u201d</p><p>Yep. That\u2019s exactly what I thought she was suggesting.</p><p>42</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>It\u2019s only one week until Laurelyn leaves. It\u2019s too soon and I want more time with her.</p><p>I\u2019m neglecting my work at Avalon because I\u2019m desperate to spend every minute with her. I can\u2019t get enough of her and this morning is no different. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come back to the house to see her after being gone for only an hour.</p><p>I open the bedroom door expecting her to still be asleep, but she\u2019s not, and I hear the shower running. Maybe I\u2019ll slip in and join her.</p><p>As I\u2019m thinking it over, I hear a smothered version of \u201cSex on Fire\u201d by Kings of Leon playing somewhere in the bedroom. I follow the sound until I find a ringing phone inside Laurelyn\u2019s purse. I reach in and take it out to see the caller ID in case it\u2019s an emergency from home. At least that\u2019s why I tell myself I do it.</p><p>It\u2019s Blake Phillips. Again.</p><p>This time it\u2019s not a missed call notification I see. It\u2019s a photo of Laurelyn with her lips pressed against a man\u2019s cheek. They look like a happy couple. Maybe even in love.</p><p>I contemplate what to do\u2014answer or let it go to voicemail\u2014and my curiosity wins out. I slide the bar over and have no idea what to say because I\u2019m in the dark about who this man is. I put Laurelyn\u2019s phone to my ear and listen without saying a word. A moment later, I hear his voice. He\u2019s a Yank\u2014of course. I would expect him to be. \u201cLaurelyn. I know you\u2019re there. I hear you breathing.\u201d</p><p>I continue silent, waiting to hear some clue as to what kind of relationship she has with this man.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not ready to talk, please listen.\u201d I wait and hear nothing. I think we\u2019ve been disconnected, but then he continues, \u201cI miss you, Laurie. We had a great thing going and I know we can get it back. Baby, no one knows about us. I convinced Mitch and the guys you just needed a little time to deal with the stress of the music industry, but they\u2019re not going to wait forever. You need to come back to Nashville so we can push this record deal through. You need to come home to me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still not positive who Blake Phillips is, but I\u2019m getting a much clearer picture. He\u2019s the one before me, the one who hurt Laurelyn.</p><p>\u201cLaurie, I know you miss me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve heard enough. \u201cLaurelyn can\u2019t come to the phone right now.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence before he asks, \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack McLachlan. I\u2019m Laurelyn\u2019s boyfriend, her Australian boyfriend. Because that\u2019s where she is\u2014in Australia with me. Not in Nashville with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with Laurie as soon as possible. Please, tell her to call Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to talk to you and you\u2019re out of your fucking mind if you think I\u2019m telling my girlfriend to call her ex-hole. I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d I press the end button because we\u2019re done here.</p><p>Laurelyn is mine. Not his.</p><p>After I end the call, I thumb through photo after photo of Laurelyn with this guy and see the proof of her happy life before me. It\u2019s unsettling, even painful to see.</p><p>I hear the shower cut off and try to decide what my approach will be to asking Laurelyn about her relationship with this guy. I\u2019m sitting on the side of the bed when she comes out of the bathroom wearing a towel wrapped turban style around her hair. She\u2019s as naked as the day she was born.</p><p>She\u2019s startled to see me and lets out a girlish squeal as she uses her hands to cover herself. She realizes it\u2019s me and grins as she drops her hands from her naked body. \u201cShit, you scared me. I thought you were gone for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, but I came back for something.\u201d I wish I hadn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want these feelings I have.</p><p>Laurelyn grins as she walks over to her lingerie drawer. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You\u2019re acting weird.\u201d</p><p>I watch her step into a pair of white lace panties and pull them up. She reaches for the matching bra and slips her arms through it before fastening the clasp between her breasts.</p><p>I decide I\u2019m done wondering. \u201cTell me who Blake Phillips is.\u201d</p><p>She pales as she freezes in place. Her words come out as a whisper. \u201cWhy would you ask me that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t like the way she\u2019s affected by a question about him. \u201cBecause he called while you were in the shower.\u201d</p><p>She busies herself with adjusting her bra to avoid looking at me. \u201cYou answered my phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018Sex on Fire\u2019 ringtone sort of caught my attention. I answered it because I want to know who the hell Blake Phillips is and what he wants with you.\u201d</p> <p>She stares blankly at me. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want to tell me who he is or because I\u2019m acting like a possessive Neanderthal. \u201cI\u2019m not used to this, Laurelyn. You know everything about my previous relationships. Everything! Including what a stretch this is for me, and I know so little about yours. I want to know who he is to you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m almost certain she\u2019s going to tell me and then I feel a pang of fear. Maybe this isn\u2019t something I want to hear, but it\u2019s too late. \u201cHe was my record producer.\u201d</p><p>I toss her phone toward her onto the bed so it lands screen side up featuring an affectionate picture of them together. \u201cDoes everyone kiss their record producer like that?\u201d</p><p>She shuts her eyes and turns away from the phone. \u201cBlake and I were spending a lot of time together while we were working on my album. One thing led to another and we started seeing each other. He told me it wouldn\u2019t look good for him to be in a relationship with someone he was representing, and I believed him. It sounded like a legit reason to me, so we agreed to keep our relationship secret to protect our careers. I later found out he wanted to keep us secret because he was married with three kids. I was devastated. And I walked away from all of it. Him. The record deal. The music career I\u2019d worked so hard for. Everything.\u201d</p><p>Now, I really hate the motherfucker. \u201cWhen did it end?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEarly December.\u201d That was only a couple of weeks before she came here\u2014not near long enough for her to be over him if she was in love with him.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months.\u201d Almost the same amount of time she\u2019s been with me.</p><p>I lean over with my elbows on my knees and my head in my hands. \u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer right away and my throat tries to eat my heart. \u201cThere was a time I thought I did, but that was before I knew the truth.\u201d I want her to reach out and touch me as a sign of reassurance, but she doesn\u2019t. \u201cI loved a lie, and the truth shattered anything I felt for him.\u201d</p><p>I want to look up at her, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m afraid of what I\u2019ll see. \u201cSo, you feel nothing for him now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t love a lie and that\u2019s all we were.\u201d Her words are sobering. Hadn\u2019t I asked her for a relationship based on a lie? He tricked her into being his dirty little secret, and I outright asked her to volunteer as mine.</p><p>I lift my face to see her standing in front of me, but her eyes avoid mine. That\u2019s when I know it. I\u2019m a motherfucker just like Blake Phillips.</p><p>I slide off the bed to my knees in front of her and wrap my arms around her legs. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for not treating you the way I should have, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>She strokes her hands across the top of my hair. \u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019ve never treated me poorly. You spoil me rotten.\u201d</p><p>I gaze up at her from where I\u2019m on my knees. \u201cI asked you for a relationship based on lies. I kept you as my secret from the world until I decided I needed you when Dad got sick. I\u2019m no better than he is.\u201d</p><p>43</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>Jack Henry is in front of me on his knees, talking about things that aren\u2019t true. He presses his face against my stomach and I twirl my fingers in his hair. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true at all. Don\u2019t ever compare yourself to him.\u201d</p> <p>I take his hands and tug on them. \u201cGet up from there.\u201d</p><p>He stands and reaches for my face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand what he means. \u201cStop this. You\u2019ve never hurt me the way he did.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s stroking his thumbs over my cheekbones. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for all the secrecy, for making you feel like you weren\u2019t important enough to know the real me. But I\u2019m most sorry because I have fucked you\u2014I don\u2019t know how many times\u2014and never made love to you.\u201d</p><p>I realize I\u2019m crying when he uses his thumbs to catch tears as they roll down my face. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t cry. I never want to be the one to cause you tears.\u201d</p><p>He leans down and tenderly presses his lips to mine. I open my mouth and he slips his tongue inside to meet mine for a familiar yet new sensual waltz.</p><p>We\u2019ve shared countless kisses. They were almost always heated and demanding, but this one is entirely different. It tells me things he can\u2019t or won\u2019t say because it goes against everything he intends for our relationship.</p><p>Jack Henry cares for me. If his kisses don\u2019t tell me, his touch does. His caress is so tender. He handles me as if I\u2019m a precious, delicate treasure.</p><p>We move onto the bed and his mouth feathers kisses lightly down my chin and throat. His mouth continues traveling lower as he puts his fingers inside one of the cups and finds my nipple. He rubs and rolls it, causing it to stand at attention for his touch before he pulls my bra down and takes it in his mouth.</p><p>I love the feel of his tongue against my sensitive nipple and something between a moan and the sound of his name escapes my mouth as I lace my fingers through his hair.</p><p>When his mouth leaves my breast, he unfastens the bra clasp and frees me from my lace entrapment. I grasp his shirt over his stomach and push it up because I want to feel his flesh against mine. He grabs it by the neck and pulls it over his head in one swift motion before he lowers his head and takes my other nipple in his mouth.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter where he makes contact with my body. Each touch sends a wave of sensation directly between my legs, and I grow wet for him.</p><p>His mouth glides lower down my belly and then to my hipbones. He kisses each of them and everything in between before he pulls back on the waistband of my panties to bury his nose inside. I hear him inhale deeply. \u201cMmm, you smell so good.\u201d</p><p>Kneeling between my legs, he grabs the waistband of my panties and pulls downward as I raise my hips. He lifts my feet off the bed to free the lace from my ankles and then tosses them to the floor next to his shirt. I sit up to slip my loose bra from my shoulders and add it to the growing pile of clothes.</p><p>I\u2019m naked as he kneels between my bent knees beholding my bareness. He puts his palm on my chest between my breasts and slowly glides it down. \u201cYou are so perfect. So beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s being so sweet, but I can\u2019t stop my thoughts from jumping to what he said. He thinks he\u2019s no better than Blake.</p><p>The notion invites my ex into my head. I don\u2019t want him there so I put my hand over my eyes, as if that will help block him out.</p><p>Jack Henry knows I\u2019ve gone somewhere else and reaches for my hand. \u201cLook at me, Laurelyn. Leave him out of this. Only think of me.\u201d I open my eyes for him. He kisses the inside of my right knee as he looks up. \u201cSee me.\u201d He kisses higher inside my thigh. \u201cBe here with me.\u201d</p><p>I throw my head back against the pillow and groan because I know what he is about to do.</p><p>He flattens his tongue against me and licks straight up my center. \u201cAhh!\u201d I groan. Nothing feels better than his mouth on me. He licks several more times and I already feel the onset of my orgasm starting. It isn\u2019t going to take long for him to push me over the edge. I bite my bottom lip as my breathing increases and I feel the waves quickly rising to the surface as he maintains the slow, torturous rhythm of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I love the way you taste.\u201d His words vibrate against me and then he stiffens his tongue and pushes it in and out of me against my upper wall, hitting that sensitive spot. I lift my head from the bed to see him buried between my legs and the sight makes my orgasm come on fast and furious. I have no control as I pant and fist his hair in my hand, pulling harder than I should. \u201cAhh, Jack Henry!\u201d</p><p>I lift my hips to bring myself closer to his mouth. I feel the shudder of contractions building deep in my womb and I pull his hair. I go stiff and arch my back from the bed as Jack Henry makes me come undone.</p><p>When it\u2019s over, I fall back against the pillow to catch my breath and feel the tiny post-orgasmic quivers again. He scales my body and kisses his way up until he hovers above me. I feel the roughness of his jeans against my skin and remember he\u2019s still dressed from the waist down.</p><p>I reach for the button on his jeans and give it a jerk before I slide his zipper down. I put my hand inside his boxer briefs to stroke him. \u201cI want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than I want to be inside you.\u201d He rolls off the bed and my eyes never leave his glorious body. I watch as he kicks off his shoes and pushes his jeans and boxer briefs down at the same time, causing his erection to spring free.</p><p>He bypasses his usual stop at the nightstand drawer and crawls back onto the bed. He lowers his body between my legs and stares into my eyes. Everything between us is different. Our eyes share a silent conversation our mouths don\u2019t dare interrupt. I understand what he\u2019s asking without words. He wants to be closer. Skin on skin, nothing between us.</p><p>I tell myself it isn\u2019t irresponsible to forgo a condom because it\u2019s what we both want. We\u2019re both clean and the risk of getting pregnant is almost zilch since I\u2019m on reliable birth control.</p><p>He swallows hard as he gently presses himself against my slick opening and waits for my answer. It\u2019s his way of asking before he enters my body, and I give him permission by pushing my hips against him. He slides inside my slickness and squeezes his eyes shut as he hisses, \u201cLaurelyn, you feel incredible.\u201d</p><p>I tighten my walls around him as he moves in and out with methodical slowness. I savor the full sensation of Jack Henry inside me unsheathed for the first time. I watch his beautiful face dancing over me and I\u2019ve never felt closer to anyone in my life. Ever.</p><p>He is gentle with me, as if I\u2019m a virgin. The affection I have for him is overwhelming, and hot tears roll down the sides of my face as I own the feelings I have for this man. I love Jack Henry McLachlan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019re heart to heart and he fades into me until I don\u2019t know where I end and he begins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting close and I want to come inside you.\u201d He keeps moving as he talks and I wrap my legs around his waist, my head spinning with the ecstasy of his words. I forget who he is, who I am, and what we are to each other.</p><p>I want him to mark me, to make me his. I lock my legs around him and squeeze. He couldn\u2019t free himself from my tight hold if he tried. \u201cI want you to.\u201d</p> <p>He pushes harder inside me. I can\u2019t see his face because it\u2019s buried against my neck, but he\u2019s close. I know he is about to fill me with a part of him.</p><p>It\u2019s in this moment I know without a doubt that Blake is my past. Jack Henry is my present, and as much as that pleases me, I want him as my future. The feelings and emotions he stirs inside me make it impossible to contain the way I feel about him. I lock my arms around him and squeeze my legs tighter as he groans and spasms inside me.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jack Henry,\u201d I whisper against his ear as he empties himself into me.</p><p>I love Jack Henry McLachlan. And now I\u2019ve told him. And I regret saying it the moment the words leave my mouth. Words of love aren\u2019t what he wants to hear from me. He doesn\u2019t feel the same. This isn\u2019t what he signed up for, and I\u2019ve probably just ruined the little bit of time I have left with him.</p><p>I am a foolish, foolish woman.</p> <p>His face is still buried against my neck so I can\u2019t see his reaction. And I don\u2019t want to. I feel him breathing heavily against my hair. I think he\u2019s contemplating his next move, so I give him the easy out I owe him.</p><p>\u201cLet me up.\u201d I push him off me without meeting his eyes and dart into the bathroom so he can dress and leave without feeling obligated to talk about what I said.</p><p>I wonder if he\u2019ll ask me to leave when he comes home from work. My back is against the door, my tear-streaked face in my hands. Maybe I should save him the trouble and just leave on my own.</p><p>44</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>I lie on my back and look at the ceiling. Well, fuck me running. Laurelyn loves me. I wasn\u2019t expecting to hear that. I\u2019m not really sure how I feel about it.</p> <p>Our days are winding down and I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how I\u2019m going to feel when she\u2019s gone. I admit I\u2019m confused by the emotions I have. I\u2019ve never grown attached to any of my companions in the past, but I\u2019ve known from the beginning that everything about Laurelyn is different. She means something to me\u2014more than any of the others ever did\u2014but does it equal love? I have no idea.</p><p>A part of me wants Laurelyn to leave so I can go back to my life before her, but then there\u2019s another part that wants to beg her to stay forever. As hard as I try, I can\u2019t decide which is stronger.</p><p>I feel a terrible ache in my chest when I think of her leaving. Is that what love feels like? I hadn\u2019t thought so, but then I hear her say she loves me and I feel more confused than ever.</p><p>I sit up on the edge of the bed and ponder what to say when she comes out of the bathroom. Several minutes pass and I realize she has no intention of coming out while I\u2019m still here.</p><p>I knock on the door. \u201cLaurelyn, will you come out so we can talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to. Please, don\u2019t make me.\u201d She sounds nasally, so I know she\u2019s crying. It\u2019s almost more than I can stand because I want to be the one to wipe away her tears, not the one to cause them.</p><p>\u201cI really think we should.\u201d I reach to twist the knob but already know it will be locked. \u201cPlease come out.\u201d</p><p>Another minute passes before I hear her unlock the door. She opens it and stands wrapped in a towel, her eyes downcast refusing to meet mine. I reach out and tilt her chin upward so I can see her eyes, but she closes them and locks me out.</p> <p>I asked her to come out so we could talk, but now I don\u2019t have a damn clue as to what I should say. I feel something genuine for her, but I don\u2019t know what it is. I can\u2019t say I love her, so I do the only thing I can to show her how I feel.</p><p>I untuck the towel from under her arms and it falls to the floor. I put her arms around my shoulders and pick her up. \u201cWrap your legs around me.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands under her thighs and carry her back to the bed. I lay her across the mattress side to side and creep over her on all fours. I take her chin in my hand. \u201cLook at me, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>She hesitates and then opens her eyes and stares at me. Tears roll down her temples and I lean forward to kiss them away. I wish I could say I love you.</p><p>I can\u2019t give her my heart, but there\u2019s one thing I can give her.</p><p>I lower my hand and feel that she\u2019s drenched with my body fluid all the way down the insides of her thighs. I run my fingers through it and rub it into her skin as if to mark my territory. I\u2019m shocked to find how much I like having that part of myself on her. And in her.</p><p>She is mine, at least for a little while longer.</p><p>I enter her slowly and within seconds, her hips are meeting me stroke for stroke. I want to be gentle because making love to her is new and I like the way it feels, but she has other ideas in mind. Using her thighs, she coaxes me to move faster as I slide in and out of her. She reaches for my neck to pull me down against her and whispers in my ear. \u201cHarder!\u201d I give her what she asks for and when I feel her contract around me, it pushes me over the edge. I push deep inside her one last time as I erupt.</p><p>What is it about coming inside her?</p><p>I push her hair from her face and she watches my eyes. I see fear as she asks, \u201cAre we okay?\u201d</p><p>I lower my mouth and softly kiss her lips. \u201cWe\u2019re so much better than okay.\u201d I give her an Eskimo kiss and then sit up to check the time. Shit! I really need to get back to work.</p><p>I get dressed while she watches. I sit on the edge of the bed to put on my shoes and she crawls behind me to slide her arms around my waist. I lean my head back against hers. \u201cI\u2019m never going to make it back to work at this rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to let you go in a minute. I just need to savor this moment for a little while longer.\u201d</p><p>Why would she need to savor the moment? Is she going to leave me because I didn\u2019t tell her I loved her?</p><p>I spin around and push her down on the bed. I imprison her with the weight of my body and pin her arms over her head. I watch her eyes when I ask, \u201cAre you going to leave me?\u201d She swallows hard and doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cDon\u2019t you even think about not being here when I come home this afternoon. I\u2019ll come for you and drag you back by your hair like a caveman.\u201d</p><p>This brings a smile to her face and I can\u2019t resist kissing her one last time before I leave. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be late getting in tonight since I need to make up the work I\u2019ve missed this morning. Be here when I come home tonight.\u201d</p><p>I still have her hands pinned over her head. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me.\u201d I don\u2019t know what good I think a pledge will do. If she wants to leave, she will.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>My guts tells me she was about to run, so it doesn\u2019t matter if she promises me or not. She will run if the notion strikes her, so being away from her today won\u2019t be easy for me. I won\u2019t rest until I get home and find her still here.</p><p>I send my fifteenth text to Laurelyn today and await her response. I\u2019m probably annoying her, but she needs to understand how much I want her to stay with me until she goes home next week. I\u2019m not ready to say goodbye. At least not today.</p><p>My phone beeps with a response.</p><p>*Here waiting 4U*</p><p>I\u2019m able to relax because that doesn\u2019t sound like a response from a woman who has run away.</p><p>When I get back to the house, I almost race through the door to get to her. I\u2019m eager to see proof she isn\u2019t gone. \u201cLaurelyn, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the kitchen.\u201d Relief. That\u2019s the only word to describe how I feel at the moment. I can breathe again.</p><p>I go into the kitchen and find her standing in front of the stove. \u201cI let Mrs. Porcelli go early because I wanted to cook for you. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>I come up behind her and put my arms around her waist. I kiss her neck and peer over her shoulder to see what she\u2019s cooked. Hmm. Lasagna? My favorite. I wonder if she knows that. I\u2019m reminded of the night we ate at the Italian restaurant in Auckland for her birthday. \u201cSmells delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lasagna has been known to bring men to their knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, it doesn\u2019t take food for you to bring me to my knees.\u201d</p><p>She faces me and puts her arms around my shoulders. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I like you on your knees.\u201d</p><p>The second the words leave her mouth, I see her remembering our morning. After the touchy incident following the Blake Phillips conversation, I decide it\u2019s best to change the subject. \u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d</p><p>We both know what I\u2019m doing, but she rolls with it. \u201cAs if you\u2019d know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not totally helpless in the kitchen. I think I recall cooking brekkie for you one morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure a bagel with cream cheese counts as cooking breakfast, but regardless\u2014I\u2019m good. Why don\u2019t you go choose a wine for us?\u201d</p><p>I kiss the side of her face. \u201cThat I can definitely do.\u201d</p><p>I go into the cellar and choose a merlot. As I walk back to the house, I hear myself whistling \u201cPrivate Dancer\u201d without thinking about. Damn, she\u2019s always on my mind, even if it\u2019s my subconscious.</p><p>I hear Laurelyn talking to someone when I return from the wine cellar. I walk into the kitchen and she turns to see me standing behind her. She\u2019s upset and that\u2019s when I know it\u2019s him. He\u2019s called again.</p><p>I take the phone from her hand and hit the end button. \u201cDon\u2019t take his calls again. He upsets you and I don\u2019t want to spend what little time we have left with him on your mind. I want to be the only one you think about. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>I want her to forget his call, his face, his name, so I pull her close for a kiss. \u201cNow, do you think you can make it through dinner without him in your head, or do I need to take you to bed and give you a reason to forget all about him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlthough I love the idea of you taking me to bed, he\u2019s already out of my head.

God, I\u2019m going to miss her when she\u2019s gone.</p> <p>She notices me watching her and a smile spreads across her face. \u201cA penny for thoughts?\u201d</p><p>I reach for her hand and squeeze it. \u201cI was just thinking about what I\u2019m going to do after you go home. Damn, I\u2019m going to miss you.\u201d</p><p>She pulls her hand from mine and begins to clear the table. Her eyes are dodging mine. \u201cYou\u2019ll do exactly as you\u2019ve done all the other times. You\u2019ll move on to the next town and find number fourteen.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine there being anyone beyond number thirteen.</p><p>45</p> <p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>The time has come. I\u2019m leaving today, but Jack Henry has no idea. He believes we have twenty-four more hours together. Why have I lied to him? Because I can\u2019t bear to see him be all right with watching me walk away forever when I\u2019m not at all prepared to do so.</p><p>He\u2019s sleeping next to me. He takes a slow, deep breath and like clockwork, I hear a quiet snore every other breath. It\u2019s his breathing cycle and after sleeping next to him for three months, I\u2019ve come to predict it. To expect it. To love it. I don\u2019t want to know what it\u2019s going to be like not hearing it once I\u2019m in my bed at home, so I decide I won\u2019t. I go to my purse and take out my phone to record his sounds. It\u2019s silly, but at least I can have this part of him with me after I\u2019m gone.</p><p>When I finish, I sit in the chair in the corner of the room and scan through the pictures of us on my phone. I have come to love these images of us together. I decide I won\u2019t give them up, either, so I silence both phones and go through the photos texting each one to my personal phone. He\u2019ll never know I did this and even if he figures it out, what\u2019s he going to do about it? I\u2019ll be over nine thousand miles away.</p><p>When I finish transferring all the photos to my phone, I sit and watch this man I\u2019ve come to love. I have no idea how long I sit staring at him. I only know I won\u2019t get to do it again after tonight.</p><p>I curse the glowing time on the clock\u20144:36. I realize the time I thought would never come has. The flames burning from both ends of our candle are meeting in the middle this morning. My three months with Jack Henry has dwindled to less than three hours and is about to be snuffed out.</p> <p>I pull my legs up and cradle them as I begin to cry. I\u2019m forced to cup my hands over my mouth to muffle the uncontrollable sobbing. I hear him toss in the bed and I cup my hands tightly so he won\u2019t hear me, but he does anyway. \u201cHey, what are you doing over there?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and my chest vibrates. The light from the cracked bathroom door is minimal in the corner where I\u2019m sitting so he can\u2019t see my face. I work to disguise the nasally sound I\u2019m certain my tears have caused. \u201cI\u2019m memorizing everything I don\u2019t want to forget after I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>There. I said it. It\u2019s the reality we\u2019ve been ignoring. This is me giving him the opportunity to talk about me leaving. Say something. Anything. Please.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t. \u201cCome back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I just need a minute in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>I splash my face with cold water and then hold a cool cloth over my eyes knowing it won\u2019t help with the swelling by the time he gets up for work. He\u2019s going to know I\u2019ve been crying and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.</p><p>When I get into bed with him, I slide over and put my head on his chest. He wraps his arm around me and rubs it up and down from my shoulder to my elbow. \u201cEverything okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel okay.\u201d</p><p>I agree. Nothing about this feels okay. I can\u2019t tell him that, so I do the only thing that will. I roll to my stomach and rise to my knees. I hitch one leg over him until I\u2019m straddling him and then my body covers his as I drop my mouth to kiss him.</p><p>We\u2019re both still naked from our earlier romp. I feel him grow hard below me as I slide back and forth over his growing erection. My intention is only to tease him and myself, but then I feel him angled perfectly to slide inside me. I push him inside just a little, dying to slide his full length all the way in.</p><p>We\u2019ve only gone without using a condom the one time last week when I told him I loved him and it was the best ever. I felt so close to him and I want that again before I leave. I need it one last time.</p><p>His hands are on my hips and he doesn\u2019t push me away so I slide his length inside me a little more. \u201cLaurelyn ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer me immediately. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want you to ever stop.\u201d</p><p>I lace my fingers through his and use them as leverage as I sink his remaining length inside me until I\u2019m completely full. I love you so much, Jack Henry.</p><p>I hear a deep groan from him and the sound alone is such a turn-on. Knowing I\u2019m the one who makes him come undone gives me a kind of pleasure I\u2019ve never known.</p><p>He flexes his hips up every time I slide down. \u201cOh, that feels so damn amazing, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>I would do this everyday if it were up to me, but it\u2019s not my choice. It\u2019s his. And he\u2019s choosing to let me go.</p><p>Now his hands are on my hips and he encourages me to move up and down faster under his splayed hands. \u201cI\u2019m close, Laurelyn.\u201d His fingertips are digging into my skin. \u201cIs it okay to come inside you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips close around each of my hipbones and he pulls me down hard against him. He makes his come sound that I love so much because it always has my name behind it. \u201cOoh, Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>I feel him twitch inside me and I know he has just filled me with a part of him.</p><p>When he releases my hips, I collapse against his chest and his arms wrap around me. \u201cGod, I\u2019m going to miss you.\u201d</p><p>And there they are. My walking papers. I no longer hold out hope he will ask me to stay, and I feel the tears. Thank God I turned off the bathroom light when I came out so it\u2019s dark and he can\u2019t see me. And I won\u2019t see the love he doesn\u2019t feel when he\u2019s holding me.</p><p>I feel the stream slide down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d He slides his hand between us and feels the wetness. \u201cAre you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes.</p><p>\u201cYou are crying. What\u2019s wrong? Did I hurt you?\u201d He slides up in the bed, although I\u2019m on top of him. I feel him reach for the lamp on the nightstand, but I grab his hand to stop him.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not hurt. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Yes, I\u2019m hurt but not the way you think.</p><p>I lace my fingers through his so he won\u2019t try again to turn on the lamp. I don\u2019t want to attempt to explain this.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything else about it and neither do I. I spend the next two hours lying next to Jack Henry with my head against his chest. I\u2019m listening to his heartbeat\u2014another thing I\u2019ll never hear again.</p><p>He kisses the top of my head. \u201cMmm. I\u2019m going to be late if I don\u2019t get ready for work. I\u2019d hate to get fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a mean ol\u2019 mister you work for,\u201d I laugh, but even I hear how phony I sound.</p><p>The sun is up and I watch Jack Henry walk naked to the bathroom. Damn, I\u2019m definitely going to miss seeing that every morning.</p><p>When he\u2019s ready for work, he comes over to kiss me like he has every morning that I\u2019ve been in his bed, but this time is different. \u201cI\u2019ll see you this afternoon, baby.\u201d</p><p>I kiss him like it will be the last time I ever see him. Because it is. I clutch him in my arms. This is our last kiss. Our last embrace. Our last everything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re squeezing me like this is it.\u201d Can he read my mind? Sometimes I wonder. He kisses my forehead. \u201cAre you sure everything is okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod because I\u2019m so unstable. I\u2019m about to burst into tears and I have to keep it together just a little bit longer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to come in early so we can do something special tonight.\u201d</p><p>This is it. Here it comes.</p><p>I watch Jack walk out of my life forever as he leaves the bedroom. And that\u2019s when it all sinks in. We\u2019re over. Forever.</p><p>46</p><p>Jack McLachlan</p><p>At twelve o\u2019clock, I decide to call it a day because I\u2019m getting nothing accomplished. All I can think about is Laurelyn and how she\u2019s going to walk out of my life tomorrow. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve thought of for a week since I heard her say that she loved me.</p><p>This has been the shortest three months of my life. My chest quite literally aches with the thought of never seeing her again. We agreed on three months, and our time together is up. I promised her the time of her life, but I\u2019ll be damned if she didn\u2019t turn it around on me. I\u2019m the one who had the best three months of my life, and there\u2019s no hope for ever topping it.</p><p>I love her too much to let her leave and I need to tell her right this minute.</p><p>\u201cHarold, I\u2019m taking the rest of the day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Have a good afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Within minutes, I\u2019m at the house and Mrs. Porcelli greets me in the kitchen. \u201cMr. McLachlan, would you care for some lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Laurelyn had lunch yet?\u201d</p><p>She looks peculiar. \u201cShe left this morning not long after you went to work.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything about needing to go into town. \u201cDid she say where she was going?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Porcelli hesitates. \u201cShe told me she was going home. I thought it was strange you weren\u2019t going to the airport with her, but I didn\u2019t think it was my place to question it.\u201d</p><p>No. She\u2019s wrong. That can\u2019t be right.</p><p>\u201cLaurelyn!\u201d I run toward the bedroom and nothing seems out of place, but it\u2019s too clean and in order. Laurelyn isn\u2019t this organized. Something of hers is always tossed on the chair in the corner, but it\u2019s free of clutter. I open the top drawer of the chest where she keeps her intimates and find it empty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Please, don\u2019t let her have left me.</p><p>I go to the closet and everything hanging there belongs to me.</p><p>Why have you done this, Laurelyn?</p> <p>I take my phone out of my pocket and dial her number. I hear my personalized ringtone and I follow the sound. I find her phone next to her Martin on the coffee table in the living room. There\u2019s an envelope lying next to it with my name written in her handwriting.</p><p>This is bad. Very bad.</p><p>I hold the envelope without breaking the seal. She\u2019s gone and she left this ink on paper here in her place. These are her final words to me. I open it and remove the folded paper.</p><p>My beautiful Jack Henry,</p><p>This has been coming for three months and I\u2019m no better prepared for it today than I was when we met. If anything, I\u2019m less prepared. I didn\u2019t love you the day I met you, or even a month later. But somewhere between hello and the goodbye I\u2019m unable to bear, I fell desperately in love with you.</p> <p>I know you don\u2019t feel the same. That\u2019s why I told you I was leaving tomorrow instead of today. I couldn\u2019t bear to say goodbye and see how little you were affected by watching me walk out of your life forever. Because it is forever. I promised I wouldn\u2019t contact you and I won\u2019t.</p><p>You kept your promise to me. This has been the best three months of my life and I\u2019ll never be able to top it. You made my every fantasy come true and that includes finding the love of my life. Now, it\u2019s my turn to keep my promise.</p><p>I love you, Jack Henry, with every fiber of my being. Forever.</p><p>Laurelyn</p><p>Your American girl</p><p>No! I thought I had more time to tell her, but she\u2019s gone. She\u2019s really gone.</p> <p>And then it strikes me that she might not be. Her plane might not have left. When she wrote the letter, she expected me to find it hours later.</p><p>I race toward the garage. I get into the Sunset and drive faster than what\u2019s deemed safe toward the Wagga Wagga Airport.</p><p>I arrive in record time and don\u2019t attempt to find a parking spot. I abandon my car at the front entrance. To hell with it. They can tow it.</p><p>I race toward the first open counter. \u201cI need help. I need to find out if a plane leaving for ...\u201d I stop to think. Damn. Would she fly home from here? No, Wagga Wagga is too small to have a flight to LAX. She would have to connect in Sydney. \u201cSydney.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s clearly annoyed by me. \u201cSir, we have several flights to Sydney every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency. Can you check to see if all of them have left?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll check for you, sir. Any particular carrier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s in no hurry as she clicks her mouse, and I think she\u2019s doing it to piss me off. \u201cThey\u2019ve all left for today, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about returning flights to LAX out of Sydney?\u201d</p><p>She sighs heavier. \u201cI\u2019ll have to check, sir.\u201d</p><p>She clicks several times. \u201cThere are two flights to LAX today. One left at seven this morning and the other is scheduled to leave at three o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>Damn! That\u2019s in two and a half hours. Even driving wide open in the Sunset, there\u2019s no way I can make it to Sydney in that short amount of time.</p><p>I find my car still parked at the front where I left it. There\u2019s a security guard standing behind it jotting down the plate number. He sees me coming his way. \u201cIs this your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave it parked at the entrance, sir.\u201d</p><p>I wave him off. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing you came when you did. I was about to have it towed.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t give a roo\u2019s ass and I almost told him as much. Any other time I would, but right now I didn\u2019t care enough to tell him anything.</p><p>I get into my car and drive away from the airport. I don\u2019t make it two miles before I\u2019m on the side of the road thinking of anything I can do to get to Laurelyn, but I\u2019m totally blank.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop this from happening.</p><p>Think. Think. Think. Okay, as much as I hate to admit it, Ben Donavon is my only answer. He might not know how to get in touch with Laurelyn, but he can put me in touch with his sister.</p><p>I grind my teeth as I drive toward his apartment. It\u2019s going to hurt like hell to ask for his help, but I\u2019m willing to walk through fire to get to Laurelyn.</p><p>After I use the intercom to let him know I\u2019m here, he buzzes me into the building. I knock on his door and wait. When he opens it and sees it\u2019s me, he cocks his head to the side and shifts his jaw. He is going to enjoy the hell out of this and that pisses me off.</p><p>\u201cYou already know she\u2019s not here, so what do you want?\u201d</p><p>It kills me to depend on him as my only link to Laurelyn. Literally, I\u2019m having chest pain because I\u2019m lowered to this level. \u201cI need to know how to reach Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>He narrows his eyes at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d He\u2019s smirking and shrugs. \u201cI wish I could help you out, bro.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s enjoying this way too much. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s not pretend like you\u2019re not loving this.\u201d</p><p>The little fucker laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not pretending. I am loving this shit, but I still can\u2019t help you out because I don\u2019t have her number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I need Addison\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s smirking bigger now. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m not giving you my sister\u2019s number.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019ll be a miracle if I don\u2019t choke this little bastard. \u201cYou know I only want it so I can contact Laurelyn.\u201d</p><p>He crosses his arms to let me know he doesn\u2019t plan on giving in. \u201cIf Laurelyn wanted contact with you, she would have given you her number, so I think that means she\u2019s dropped you.\u201d</p><p>I feel panic coming on. If he won\u2019t give me her number, how am I going to find her when I don\u2019t even know her last name? I debate asking him and decide to eat shit if it means I find out. \u201cWhat\u2019s her last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurelyn\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s shaking his head at me, judging me. \u201cDude! You just fucked her for three months and you don\u2019t know her last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was part of an agreement we had,\u201d I spit out through a clenched jaw.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the two of you agreed on, but apparently she left here keeping her end of it, so I suggest you respect her enough to keep yours.\u201d</p><p>I watch the door slam in my face before I kick the hell out of it. Fuck! What do I do now?</p><p>I walk like a zombie to my car. I get inside, but I don\u2019t drive away. I sit there. Thinking.</p><p>Shit, I\u2019m so stupid.</p><p>She tried to tell me she loved me and I wouldn\u2019t listen. I refused to see I might love her in return because I was too unbending. I thought I had something to prove by not falling in love with anyone. Ever.</p><p>But I did fall in love with her, and now she\u2019s gone.</p><p>47</p><p>Laurelyn Prescott</p><p>I feel Addison shake my arm. \u201cWake up, Laurelyn. You\u2019re freaking me out.\u201d</p><p>I feel myself snubbing. At least that\u2019s what my mom calls it when you\u2019re crying so hard that your chest forcefully heaves so you can catch your breath.</p><p>I open my eyes and she\u2019s staring at me. \u201cYou were crying in your sleep. Hard.\u201d</p><p>I sit up in the uncomfortable airplane seat and warm tears roll out of the corners of my eyes. I suck back the snot threatening to drip from my nose. Then I remember. I was dreaming of Jack Henry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>She gives me her I know better than that look. \u201cYou\u2019re a damn liar. I know you\u2019re torn up about leaving him.\u201d</p><p>I stare out the window. I don\u2019t want this. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Him. I want to forget the whole thing ever happened.</p><p>\u201cI thought fucking Lachlan would get Blake out of your system. I wouldn\u2019t have encouraged you to go for it if I\u2019d known you were going to fall in love with him.\u201d His name isn\u2019t Lachlan. It\u2019s Jack Henry.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fall in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of shit and it\u2019s not an attractive look for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve swallowed your vocal cords because you\u2019re talking out of your ass.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cAt least I can admit I love Zac and it\u2019s killing me to leave him.\u201d</p><p>I should be a friend and offer to talk to her about the man she loves, but I don\u2019t. \u201cThis is a long flight and I\u2019m not doing this with you.\u201d</p><p>I get up from my seat and walk toward the back of the plane so I can get away from her. I go into the tiny bathroom and lock the door. I look like shit so I splash my face with water, but it doesn\u2019t help. Water won\u2019t wash this away.</p><p>I\u2019ve known pain my whole life, but this is a new kind for me. It isn\u2019t born of something wrong or ugly. This pain is conceived out of beauty\u2014my love for Jack Henry McLachlan. I embrace it. I clutch it as tightly as I can with both fists because I never want to forget the love I have for him. Loving him will forever be my Beauty from Pain. </p> </body></html>"]
