But I couldn\u2019t wait for summer vacation to end. I couldn\u2019t wait for footbal . Footbal , dominator of fal \u2014footbal , love of my life.</p><p>\u201cBlue forty-two! Blue forty-two! Red seventeen!\u201d I yel . The cue is red seventeen. JJ hikes me the bal . The defense is blitzing. JJ slams into a freshman safety, knocking him to the ground. The rest of my offensive line destroys the defense. Nice. The field\u2019s wide open, but my wide receiver isn\u2019t where he\u2019s supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel , Higgins?\u201d I mutter to myself.</p> <p>Dancing on my tiptoes, I scan the end zone and find Sam Henry instead and hurl the bal . It flies through the air, a perfect spiral, heading right where I wanted it to go. He catches the bal , spikes it, and does this real y stupid dance. Henry looks like a freaking bal erina. With his thin frame and girly blond hair, he actual y could be the star of the New York Bal et.</p><p>I\u2019m gonna give him hel for his dance.</p><p>This is my senior year at Hundred Oaks High, and I\u2019m captain, so I\u2019m al owed to keep my players in line. Even though he\u2019s my best friend, Henry has always been a showoff. His antics get us penalties.</p><p>Through the speaker in my helmet, I hear Coach Mil er say, \u201cNice throw. This is your year, Woods. You\u2019re going to lead us to the state championship. I can feel it...Hit the showers.\u201d What the coach actual y means? I know you\u2019re not going to blow it in the final seconds of the championship game like you did last year.</p><p>And he\u2019s right. I can\u2019t.</p> <p>The University of Alabama cal ed last week\u2014on the first day of school\u2014to tel me a recruiter is coming to watch me play on Friday night. And then a very fancylooking letter arrived, inviting me to visit campus in September. An official visit. If they like what they see, they\u2019l sign me in February.</p><p>I can\u2019t screw this season up.</p><p>I pul my helmet off and grab a bottle of Gatorade and my playbook. Most of the guys are already goofing off and heading over to watch cheerleading practice across the field, but I ignore them and look up into the stands.</p><p>I spot Mom sitting with Carter\u2019s dad, a former NFL player. My dad isn\u2019t here, of course. Asshole.</p><p>Lots of parents come to watch our practices because footbal is the big thing to do around here. Here being Franklin, Tennessee, home of the Hundred Oaks Red Raiders, eight-time state champions.</p><p>Mom always comes to practice\u2014she\u2019s been supporting me ever since Pop Warner youth footbal days, but sometimes she worries I\u2019l get hurt, even though the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened was a concussion. Sophomore year, when JJ took a breather, the coach brought in this idiot to play center, the idiot didn\u2019t cover me, and I got slammed hard. Otherwise, I\u2019m a rock. No knee problems, no broken limbs.</p> <p>Dad never comes to my practices and rarely comes to games. People think it\u2019s because he\u2019s busy, because he\u2019s Donovan Woods, the starting quarterback for the Tennessee Titans. But the truth is he doesn\u2019t want me playing footbal . Why wouldn\u2019t a famous quarterback want his kid to fol ow in the family footsteps? Wel , he does. He loves that my brother, Mike, a junior in col ege, plays for the University of Tennessee and led his team to a win at the Sugar Bowl last year. So what the hel is Dad\u2019s problem with Bowl last year. So what the hel is Dad\u2019s problem with my playing bal ?</p><p>I\u2019m a girl.</p><p>After chugging a bunch of Gatorade, I go find Higgins, who\u2019s already attempting to flirt with Kristen Markum, the most idiotic of cheerleaders. I take Higgins aside, avoiding her Darth Vader stare, and say, \u201cNext time try finishing your route instead of staring at Kristen, wil you?\u201d</p><p>His face goes al red before he nods. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Then I go pul a sophomore cornerback aside to speak privately. Duckett\u2019s a couple inches shorter than me, so I put a hand on his shoulder and walk him down the sideline.</p><p>\u201cOn that last play, where I threw the long pass to Henry, you left him wide open. And I know how fast he is, but you can\u2019t let that happen in the game. You were total y out of position.\u201d</p><p>Duckett drops his head and nods at me. \u201cGot it, Woods.\u201d</p> <p>I pat his back with my playbook as I take another sip of Gatorade, and wipe the dribble from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re counting on you Friday night. I\u2019m sure Coach is going to start you.\u201d</p><p>Duckett smiles as he puts his helmet under an arm and heads toward the locker room.</p><p>\u201cAwesome job today, guys,\u201d I say to a couple of my offensive linemen, then jog over to Henry and look up at him.</p><p>He says, \u201cWhat\u2019s good, Woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice move faking out Duckett on that last play.\u201d</p><p>Henry laughs. \u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you quit it with the dancing?\u201d</p><p>He grins at me, his green eyes lighting up as he drags a hand through his blond curls. \u201cYou know you love it.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I shove his chest. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>He shoves me back. \u201cWant to come out to eat with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and JJ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, let\u2019s see...Samantha and Marie and Lacey and Kristen.\u201d</p><p>I stick my tongue out before saying, \u201cShit, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Pete\u2019s Roadhouse,\u201d he says, wiggling his eyebrows.</p><p>Damn it. I love going there. It\u2019s one of those restaurants where they let you throw peanut shel s al over the floor. Stil , I reply, \u201cCan\u2019t. My brother said he\u2019d watch film with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>Henry gets this hurt look on his face. \u201cCome on, Woods. You know I want to go to Michigan more than anything, and I\u2019m working hard, but you\u2019ve been holed up every night since you heard that Alabama is coming to opening game.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a breath. \u201cRight\u2014I\u2019ve only got three days left to get perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already, like, one hundred times the quarterback your brother was in high school, you know.\u201d</p><p>I grin at Henry. \u201cThanks,\u201d I say, even though it\u2019s not true.</p><p>He wipes sweat off his forehead with his red and black jersey. \u201cHow about I come over and watch film with you instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Samantha and Marie and Lacey and Kristen?\u201d</p><p>He glances over at the cheerleaders. \u201cThey\u2019d wait a year for me.\u201d</p><p>I shove him again, and he laughs. \u201cNah, it\u2019s okay,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re going out with girls again, even if Kristen is Satan\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never fool around with Kristen\u2014I have standards,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never fool around with Kristen\u2014I have standards, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBul shit,\u201d I say as JJ and Carter walk up.</p><p>With his helmet in hand, JJ drapes an arm around Henry\u2019s shoulders. I\u2019m surprised Henry\u2019s skinny knees don\u2019t buckle under JJ\u2019s 275 pounds. \u201cYou in trouble again, man?\u201d JJ asks in his deep voice.</p><p>\u201cWoods doesn\u2019t appreciate my dancing skil s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one likes your dancing skills,\u201d JJ replies. He nods at me. \u201cYou in for the Roadhouse, Woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. Gotta study,\u201d I say, holding up the playbook.</p><p>\u201cTake a break,\u201d JJ says.</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019d go if they\u2019d picked a place that makes real food, like Michel\u2019s Bistro or Julien L\u2019Auberge in Nashvil e,\u201d Carter says in a ridiculous French accent, and JJ, Henry, and I burst out laughing at him.</p><p>\u201cHel no,\u201d I say. \u201cAl I need is a big slab of meat and a bunch of peanut shel s to throw al over the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlasphemy,\u201d Carter replies.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going either?\u201d I ask Carter.</p><p>He focuses on his cleats before saying, \u201cCan\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a practice night, remember?\u201d He\u2019s, like, the only person I know whose parents never say anything about school nights\u2014it\u2019s always about footbal practice and games in the Carter household.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Woods,\u201d Henry whines. \u201cJust for an hour or two.\u201d</p><p>I hate saying no to him. \u201cIf I get through four hours of Alabama film tonight, I\u2019l come out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Henry says, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t bring your harem.\u201d I jerk my head at the group of cheerleaders hovering ten yards away near a goal post, making googly eyes at the guys.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re a package deal,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause al you ever think about is your package,\u201d JJ replies.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d I snap and JJ punches my shoulder, causing me to stumble backward. We al crack up again.</p><p>And then two cheerleaders come up and start fawning over Henry and JJ. What took them so long?</p><p>JJ and Lacey start kissing as if winning the state championship depends on it, and Samantha</p><p>intertwines her fingers with Henry\u2019s and smiles up at him. Then Kristen and Marie come over, because cheerleaders travel in packs.</p><p>\u201cNice practice today, Jordan,\u201d Marie says, giving me a smile. \u201cThat quarterback sneak of yours is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Henry tel you to say that?\u201d I ask, staring down at her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she mutters, looking at her pompoms as she ruffles them.</p><p>JJ and Lacey break apart, much like unsnapping Velcro, as Kristen says, \u201cDon\u2019t get Jordan started, Marie. We\u2019l be here al night listening to stats and pointers on pitching footbal s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re cal ed passes, Kristen,\u201d I reply. \u201cDon\u2019t think too hard. I hear it makes your hair frizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha,\u201d Kristen replies, but she subconsciously smooths her brown hair with a hand. It takes everything I\u2019ve got not to burst out laughing when I see Samantha and Lacey patting their hair too. I sneak a peek at Henry, JJ, and Carter, and they start snickering again. So does Marie.</p><p>\u201cCal if you change your mind about getting food,\u201d</p><p>Henry says to me and Carter, and we al knock fists before Henry and JJ trudge off with their fan club toward the locker rooms.</p><p>I clutch my playbook to my chest and for a moment, I feel a pang of loneliness and wish that I had asked Henry to come over. He\u2019s been sad since his girlfriend dumped him a couple months ago, so he\u2019d probably appreciate the company. Especial y since he\u2019s been spending time with girls who think a Hail Mary is a spending time with girls who think a Hail Mary is a prayer to Jesus\u2019s mom.</p><p>But he\u2019d just distract me\u2014and I need to concentrate on performing wel for Alabama.</p><p>\u201cCarter, let\u2019s go home,\u201d I hear his dad cal out from the first row of the metal bleachers. \u201cYour mom\u2019s keeping dinner warm until we\u2019re done working out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun watching film,\u201d Carter says. \u201cI\u2019l be wishing I\u2019m you as I do sit-ups with Dad tonight.\u201d</p><p>Carter jogs over to his dad, who immediately starts talking and gesturing with his hands, probably giving a play-by-play critique of how practice went.</p><p>I wish Dad would talk with me like that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Back at home, I take a seat at the kitchen table and open my playbook. I peel a banana as I study the formation for Red Rabbit, this crazy cool flea-flicker play Coach wants us to try tomorrow. It\u2019l be hard, but Henry and I can pul it off.</p><p>Mom comes in, lays her pruning shears and gardening gloves on the counter, and then pours a glass of water. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go out with your friends tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready for opening game,\u201d I reply, training my eyes on the X s and O s scrawled across the paper.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen at practice, you\u2019re definitely ready. I don\u2019t want you to burn out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need a massage. A spa day...so you\u2019l</p><p>be al fresh and relaxed for Friday. We could go on Thursday after I\u2019m done volunteering at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>I slowly lift my head to stare at Mom. Yeah, I\u2019m sure the guys would take me seriously if I show up with pink fingernails on Friday night. \u201cNo, but thanks.\u201d I give her a smile so I won\u2019t hurt her feelings.</p><p>She smiles back. \u201cWhat are you planning to wear on your trip to Alabama?\u201d</p> <p>I shrug. \u201cI dunno. Cleats? And my Hundred Oaks sweats?\u201d</p><p>Mom sips her water. \u201cI was thinking maybe we could go shopping for a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, but thanks.\u201d</p><p>God, if I wore a dress, the Alabama guys would laugh me right out of Tuscaloosa, right back to some pitiful Division I school. \u201cThe Alabama head coach is a big Baltimore fan. Maybe I\u2019l wear a Ravens jersey.\u201d</p><p>Mom laughs. \u201cDad would kick you out of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I kicking my daughter out of the house?\u201d the great Donovan Woods asks as he comes into the kitchen and gives Mom a kiss and a hug.</p> <p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d I mutter and flip a page in my playbook. Dad grabs a bottle of Gatorade, the strawberry-plum shit he does advertising for, and takes a gulp. He\u2019s stil buff as ever, but his black hair has started to turn saltand-peppery. At forty-three years old, Dad has tried to retire after each of the five previous seasons, but he always comes back for some reason or another. Over the years, this has become a joke to sportscasters, so unless we want to get yel ed at, we never ask when he\u2019s actual y going to retire.</p><p>He stares down at my playbook and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cYou coming to my game on Friday?\u201d I ask Dad.</p><p>He looks at Mom when he replies, \u201cMaybe. I\u2019l think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I take you and Henry fishing on Saturday morning before we go to your brother\u2019s game?\u201d Dad smiles at me expectantly.</p><p>What total bul shit. He\u2019l go to Mike\u2019s game, but won\u2019t come to mine? And he tries to suck up by asking me to go fishing?</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I say.</p> <p>The grin dissolves from Dad\u2019s face. \u201cMaybe next The grin dissolves from Dad\u2019s face. \u201cMaybe next weekend then,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe you could come to my game on Friday,\u201d</p><p>I mumble to myself. \u201cMom, where\u2019s Mike?\u201d I\u2019m anxious to start watching more Alabama film. Even though I\u2019ve watched hundreds of col ege and pro games, I love getting an expert opinion and, wel , Dad\u2019s never wil ing to give it.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Mom replies. \u201cHis coach cal ed a team meeting. Mike said to tel you he\u2019s sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>Mom starts tel ing Dad al about her roses and sunflowers, gesturing out the kitchen window toward the garden. \u201cThe sunflowers have almost reached a state of Zen, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Dad wraps his arms around Mom, and I swear I hear him murmur, \u201cI\u2019m in a state of Zen right now too.\u201d</p><p>Before I reach a state of upchuck, I grab my playbook and a package of chocolate-chip cookies and head downstairs to our basement, where I turn on the TV and put in a DVD of last year\u2019s national championship game\u2014Alabama vs. Texas.</p><p>I flip off the lights, settle down on one of the leather sofas, and dig into the cookies as I push the play button on the remote.</p><p>So. My friends are off hooking up with cheerleaders. My dad cares more about sunflowers reaching a state of Zen than my feelings.</p><p>At least I\u2019ve got footbal .</p><p>It\u2019s been my life since I was seven, but sometimes Henry says I need to spend less time focusing and start \u201cliving life like I\u2019m going to hel tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>But I feel like a normal teenager. Wel , as normal as I can be. I mean, obviously I think Justin Timberlake is a mega-hunk, but I\u2019m also over six feet tal and can launch a footbal fifty yards.</p><p>Other ways I\u2019m not normal?</p><p>A girl who hangs with an entire footbal team must hook up al the time, right?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend. Hel , I\u2019ve never even kissed a guy. The closest I\u2019ve ever come to a kiss happened just this past summer, but it was a joke. At a party, one of those cheerleaders suggested we al play a game of seven minutes in heaven, you know, the game where you go into a closet and kiss? Somehow Henry and I got sent into the closet together, and of course we didn\u2019t kiss, but we ended up in a mad thumb-wrestling match. Which turned into a shoving match. Which turned into everyone thinking we\u2019d hooked up in the closet. Yeah, right. He\u2019s like my brother.</p><p>It\u2019s not that guys aren\u2019t interested in me, because they are, it\u2019s that most of the guys I know are either: 1. Shorter than me;</p><p>2. Pansies;</p><p>3. On my team;</p><p>4. Al of the above.</p><p>I would never let myself date guys on my team. And I\u2019m not interested in any of them anyway. Riding buses to and from games for years has turned me off to al of them \u2019cause one bus ride with my team produces more gas than a landfil .</p><p>Besides, I don\u2019t have time for guys, and if I suddenly were to start acting like a girl, the team might not take me seriously. And I can\u2019t afford to lose my confidence</p><p>\u2014because I\u2019m the star of the Hundred Oaks Red Raiders.</p><p>The star Alabama wil love on Friday night.</p><p>knee problems</p><p>the count? 20 days until alabama</p><p>\u201cTake five,\u201d Coach cal s out.</p><p>Wednesday afternoon. Two days until our opening game.</p><p>I rip my helmet off, jog over to the bench, take a seat, and open my playbook.</p><p>\u201cWoods,\u201d Henry says, sliding up next to me on the bench. \u201cTake a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t get the timing for the screen pass right.\u201d</p><p>He leans over onto his knees and spits between his cleats. \u201cYou saved the play by handing off to Bates. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so calm?\u201d</p><p>Looking over at me, his blond curls fal into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared for you. You\u2019re the best player in Tennessee.\u201d He laughs. \u201cBut me, I should be learning how to drive a semi like my dad or practicing how to say, \u2018Attention Wal-Mart shoppers, do not, I repeat, do not go in the men\u2019s restroom until further notice. We\u2019ve had an atomic disaster.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cStop. You\u2019re the fastest person I know\u2014if you can\u2019t get a scholarship to play bal in col ege, no one can. You\u2019re a kickass wide receiver, and you\u2019re smart.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he leans back and folds his hands on top of his stomach. \u201cAre we stil on to do something after practice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should watch more film...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoods, you promised!\u201d He scrunches up his face at me.</p><p>\u201cI doubt Liz Heaston and Ashley Martin partied much in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about partying. I\u2019m talking about you and me hanging out\u2014same ole, same ole. Besides, they were kickers. It doesn\u2019t take a lot to kick an extra point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd look at them! Liz Heaston? Two extra points in her whole col ege career! And that was just Division II. And Ashley? Wel , sure. She kicked three in a game. And that was Division I\u2014Jacksonvil e State, but stil .\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI wanna play for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve barely seen each other in a week,\u201d he says quietly, and I think about how much it would suck to achieve my dream of playing for Alabama but have no one to share it with, \u2019cause my best friend has found better stuff to do.</p><p>\u201cForget the film\u2014we\u2019l go out. Just us, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He leans over onto his knees and says,</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think of Marie Baird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s better than Kristen, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of asking Marie out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Samantha?\u201d</p><p>Henry focuses on the ground and kicks a rock. \u201cI dunno...the sex is okay...but I don\u2019t real y like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep sleeping with girls you aren\u2019t dating? Isn\u2019t this, like, three girls since Carrie Myer dumped you? Why don\u2019t you just get back together with her?\u201d</p><p>Henry\u2019s face grows pink, pinker than those ridiculous bras Mom recently left on my bed when she decided I needed something more feminine than a sports bra.</p><p>\u201cMarie seems real y cool...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean for actual dating, not just fooling around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Carrie.\u201d Of al the girls I know, she\u2019s the only one I consider a friend. When we started ninth grade, the first day in the locker room after practice was a true nightmare. I made the mistake of changing out of my uniform in front of the cheerleading captain, who proceeded to make fun of my flat chest in front of twenty other girls. And Carrie, a brand-new freshman twenty other girls. And Carrie, a brand-new freshman cheerleader, walked up to the captain and told her to knock it off, which took mucho guts.</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019d like Marie too if you\u2019d give her a chance.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, thinking I\u2019m not hanging out with anyone who\u2019s friends with Kristen Markum. \u201cWhy did Carrie dump you anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, Woods. It\u2019s private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve never kept secrets from each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you tel me why you hate Kristen so much?\u201d He smiles, and I punch him in the arm. \u201cTruce!\u201d</p><p>he says, rubbing his bicep. \u201cSo do you wanna go to the Fun Tunnel and play skee-bal ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Then dinner at my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHel , yeah. It\u2019s fried chicken night, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better believe it.\u201d</p><p>Henry usual y eats at our house a few nights a week, and sometimes he sleeps over. Technical y, he\u2019s supposed to stay in the guest room, but he\u2019s been sneaking into my room since we were eight. When Mom found out, she started forcing him to sleep headto-toe with me. To make me laugh, he always has excuses as to why we should be al owed to sleep head-to-head, like it\u2019l be easier for him to protect me if an attacker were to come in, or because my feet reek.</p><p>\u201cBreak\u2019s over!\u201d Coach shouts. \u201cWoods!\u201d</p><p>Jumping to my feet, I sweep my long blond hair back up into my helmet and jog over to the fifty-yard line.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Sup, Coach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry out the hook and lateral play we talked about.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d This is not an easy play, but Henry and I can handle it. I\u2019m supposed to throw a short pass to Henry and as the defense moves in to tackle him, he pitches it to a running back who plows up the middle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I jog to the center of the field and huddle with the guys.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the play?\u201d JJ asks.</p><p>\u201cRed Rabbit,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cOh hel , yeah,\u201d Henry says, clapping his hands together once.</p> <p>We al get into position and as JJ hikes the bal to me, I only hear silence. Coach Mil er always talks to me through the speaker in my helmet, so when he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m surprised. What the hel is he doing? Glancing out of the corner of my eye, I spot the principal walking toward Coach with this incredible-looking guy in tow. Suddenly I have the first knee problems of my life: They turn to rubber.</p><p>I keep staring, and I\u2019m knocked off my feet by a linebacker\u2014Carter and his 250 pounds. I fly backward, slamming to the ground, my head rattling around inside my helmet. Ow.</p><p>Where the hel is JJ? Why didn\u2019t he protect me? This is the first time I\u2019ve been tackled in forever. With my footwork and JJ\u2019s muscular, continent-sized body, it should never happen.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d I hear Mom shout from the stands.</p><p>Henry comes running up, ripping off his helmet and kneeling down next to me. Biting his lip, he puts a hand on my arm. Then Carter fal s down next to me too. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Woods. I tried to stop. Why the hel were you just standing there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWoods!\u201d Coach yel s, running over. \u201cYou okay?</p><p>What the hel happened, JJ? Carter\u2014how could you be dumb enough to hit our quarterback two days before the opening of the season?\u201d Coach throws his clipboard onto the ground. How cheesy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Coach,\u201d I say. I\u2019m not hurt, but I don\u2019t want to stand, because I\u2019m just as embarrassed now as the time my bathing suit top fel off on that waterslide in Florida.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I just got sacked. Dad wil be furious when he finds out I got blindsided during a practice...</p><p>great. Just what I need two days before opening game. More damned stress.</p><p>\u201cMy fault, Coach,\u201d JJ says. He holds out a hand and quickly pul s me to a standing position.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let that happen on Friday night!\u201d Coach shouts, pointing a finger in JJ\u2019s face.</p><p>Under my helmet, I breathe deeply. JJ didn\u2019t have to take the blame\u2014it wasn\u2019t his fault. But he did owe me. Last Saturday, I covered for him when he was late for practice\u2014he\u2019d been making out with Lacey and had lost track of time.</p><p>Speaking of making out, I see Chace Crawford\u2019s twin standing with the principal, looking concerned. Crap. So he saw my spil too. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m wearing my helmet, because my face feels hotter than a potato on a gril .</p><p>He has this sandy blond hair that stands up in places and sweeps across his forehead. His blue eyes remind me of a Crayola crayon, the truest blue there is, and his worn-out polo shirt and faded jeans just hang off him.</p><p>You can\u2019t buy jeans that look like that\u2014you have to wear them out for years to make them so perfect. I wonder if I could buy them off him. Wait\u2014why would I do that? Nothing else he\u2019d wear could compare with those jeans. I\u2019m also glad to see he\u2019s tal er than me by a few inches and has a great tan. And, oh the heavens, his body. What does he do? Work out for a living?</p><p>Wait. What the hell is this guy doing on my field?</p><p>I feel like I could simultaneously fly and barf. I need to get my head back into practice.</p><p>Luckily, the principal starts speaking, distracting me.</p> <p>\u201cCoach Mil er, I\u2019d like you to meet Tyler Green. His high school footbal team won the Texas state</p><p>championship last year. I know it\u2019s a bit late for a tryout, but his family just moved here and I hope you\u2019l consider him for the team. I can explain more later.\u201d</p><p>Coach nods. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The principal disappears back into the school, to the comfort of air conditioning.</p><p>Wait. Did the principal just say something about Tyler and footbal ? And trying out for my team? I need to stop staring and figure out what\u2019s going on here. Tyler, with his hands stuffed deep in his pockets, toes the yard line, then glances around at the team. Why\u2019s he so nervous? For someone who won a state championship, you\u2019d think he\u2019d be this pompous asshole strutting around like he\u2019s fucking Tom Brady.</p><p>\u201cSo, Tyler,\u201d Coach says.</p><p>\u201cSo, Tyler,\u201d Coach says.</p><p>\u201cCal me Ty, Coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So Ty, what position do you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuarterback, sir.\u201d</p><p>I take a step back, and everyone else on the team laughs.</p><p>The position is mine.</p><p>It\u2019s been mine for two years and this new kid isn\u2019t going to take it away.</p><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d Coach yel s. He gives the team a scary look and we al stop talking and laughing. One of those looks means: if you don\u2019t behave, you\u2019re gonna run five miles while wearing pads. \u201cTy\u2014we already have a starting quarterback. An al -state quarterback.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes seem to fil with pain, and he looks down at the ground. I\u2019ve never seen a QB act like this before. Most are cocky, ful of attitude. Leaders. I can\u2019t imagine fol owing a guy whose eyes give so much away. But he\u2019s buff, and obviously good if he played for a Texas championship team. Texans take their footbal seriously. It\u2019s practical y a religion down there. So what\u2019s wrong?</p><p>Wait. What\u2019s al this sympathy? Jordan Woods isn\u2019t sympathetic. I\u2019m a rock.</p><p>\u201cBut we could always use another good backup,\u201d</p><p>Coach says. \u201cOur captain wil run you through some dril s. Woods!\u201d</p><p>Though my knees are stil wobbling, somehow I run over to Coach. Ty stretches out his hand to shake mine. When I grasp his hand, I squeeze as hard as possible. Gotta show him that I\u2019m captain, that I\u2019m in charge.</p><p>Ty eyes my hand in his, then quickly releases it.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d he says, smiling. The sight of his smile makes my body melt like the Wicked Witch of the West.</p><p>\u201cWoods\u2014run some dril s with him,\u201d Coach says. \u201cDo a few quick passes, some intermediate. Hit Henry on a five-yard slant. Do a post route with Higgins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Coach,\u201d I say, glancing at the cheerleaders. They\u2019ve stopped doing their pyramids and jumps. They\u2019re al mesmerized by Ty, just like me.</p><p>\u201cWoods?\u201d Coach says. \u201cYou paying attention? Take off your helmet\u2014I want to check your eyes. You took a pretty hard hit there.\u201d</p><p>I slowly take off my helmet. I pass the helmet to Henry and start running my hands through my hair, pushing it away from my face so Coach can look in my eyes. Henry watches me, his mouth fal ing open.</p><p>Ty gasps. Then smirks and laughs. He obviously had no idea I\u2019m a girl.</p><p>\u201cDude, you\u2019d better watch it,\u201d Henry says, taking a step toward Ty.</p><p>When JJ slaps a hand on Ty\u2019s shoulder, my mind flashes back to last year when JJ punched a guy from Northgate High for grabbing my butt after a game.</p><p>\u201cShow Woods some respect! Or I\u2019l kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo disrespect intended,\u201d Ty says, holding a hand up to JJ\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019m surprised...and impressed. That\u2019s al .\u201d</p><p>After taking a look in my eyes and confirming al \u2019s okay with me\u2014I mean, besides the fact Ty is completely throwing me off my game\u2014Coach says,</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ve wasted enough practice time.\u201d</p><p>I take my helmet from Henry and stuff it on my head, then pick up the bal and yel , \u201cHenry! Go long!\u201d</p><p>He takes off running down the field and changes directions a few times. I launch a thirty-five-yard deep pass that drops right into his hands. Thank God. I\u2019m back. I\u2019m myself again.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Ty says, nodding. He has this deep, sexy Texas accent.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d I say, grabbing another bal and tossing it to Ty. \u201cHiggins\u2014post route!\u201d</p><p>Higgins jets down the field, then takes a quick left. Ty bombs the bal right into Higgins\u2019s arms. I\u2019m bombs the bal right into Higgins\u2019s arms. I\u2019m impressed\u2014I couldn\u2019t have done it any better, and Ty doesn\u2019t even know how Higgins moves. We run a few more dril s and Ty makes them al look effortless. We\u2019re equals.</p><p>And I\u2019m scared.</p><p>Ty\u2019s bigger, obviously stronger, and, unlike me, he probably didn\u2019t screw up in the final two minutes of a state championship game. Johnson City beat us 13\u201310 because I threw an interception and they returned it for a touchdown.</p><p>What if Coach gives my position to him? I try to shake this thought from my mind\u2014I\u2019ve worked years for this. I\u2019ve earned it. For the coach to give away my position, I\u2019d have to mess up in a spectacular way. Like five interceptions fol owed by a fumble.</p><p>Final y, Coach Mil er comes back over. \u201cWoods, Ty</p><p>\u2014let\u2019s talk,\u201d he says, gesturing for us to walk away from the rest of the players. Henry glances at me as we move toward Coach.</p><p>\u201cTy\u2014that\u2019s quite an arm you\u2019ve got there. And you\u2019ve got highly developed instincts as wel ,\u201d Coach says.</p><p>\u201cThanks, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a senior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you started for your team in Texas when you won the championship last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Now it\u2019s my turn to stare at the grass.</p><p>Thanks to our boosters, mostly wives of former Titans players who stil cal Franklin home, Hundred Oaks has the best high school footbal program in Tennessee. We have shitloads of money to put toward buying state-of-the-art equipment and paying first-rate staff. Coach Mil er used to coach col ege bal , but gave it up for a slower pace of life when his wife got sick. His expertise has led several players to get ful rides to col ege.</p><p>I bet that\u2019s why Ty wants to play for Hundred Oaks. It\u2019s like we\u2019re in the same league, but he\u2019s one step higher. Tears sting my eyes. I need to focus. I can\u2019t cry in front of my team.</p><p>Damned estrogen.</p><p>Coach narrows his eyes. \u201cWhy would you give al that up? Your parents couldn\u2019t stay in Texas one more year to ensure you got your choice of col eges? And why Franklin? If you had to move to Tennessee, I\u2019m surprised your parents didn\u2019t search for a school district lacking a star quarterback.\u201d</p><p>The pain returns to Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cI did what I had to do, sir. I just moved here with my mother and sister.\u201d</p><p>Mussing his sandy hair, Ty peeks at me. \u201cSome things are more important than footbal .\u201d</p><p>What? A Texas footbal player who doesn\u2019t kneel down and pray to the Cowboys every Sunday?</p><p>Epic.</p><p>Coach nods. \u201cI see. Wel , you\u2019re on the team, but I don\u2019t know how much playing time I can guarantee you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir. Being on the team is good enough for me,\u201d Ty says with a hint of a smile. He stuffs his hands into the pockets of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019l get you a uniform\u2014wear your jersey on Friday for the pep ral y,\u201d Coach says. \u201cThat\u2019s enough for today, Woods. No practice tomorrow\u2014the team needs to rest before the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it, Coach.\u201d I walk back to my team and yel , \u201cNo practice tomorrow. Don\u2019t do anything stupid on your day off.\u201d</p><p>I pul my helmet off and head to the girls\u2019 locker room as quickly as I can\u2014I need to get in and out before cheerleading practice ends or they\u2019l quiz me for information about their crushes, aka my teammates. They don\u2019t seem to understand that the guys don\u2019t spend al their time talking about girls. Only about, I\u2019d spend al their time talking about girls. Only about, I\u2019d say, ninety percent of their time is devoted to that. And even then, it\u2019s only about who\u2019s hooking up with who, and who wants to hook up with who.

Henry throws an arm around my shoulders as he pul s off his helmet, shaking his curly blond hair loose. He wipes a few curls off his forehead and whispers, \u201cSo Coach is letting that Ty dude on the team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I reply, straightening my jersey.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bul shit,\u201d JJ replies, cracking his knuckles.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his story?\u201d Carter asks.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d I say, but I\u2019m dying to know. I start wiping the dust from my hands and off my footbal pants. Henry looks at me and whispers, \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotal y.\u201d I hear my voice wobble.</p><p>\u201cThat guy\u2019s got nothing on you,\u201d JJ adds, looking over his shoulder at Ty, who\u2019s talking to Coach.</p><p>\u201cWe both know that\u2019s not true. Did you see his footwork? Ty\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah...incredible,\u201d Henry says, closing his eyes, pul ing me in closer to him as we approach the girls\u2019</p><p>locker room.</p><p>Yanking the door open, I say, \u201c\u2019Kay, Henry\u2014see you in a few,\u201d leaving him outside. He swings his helmet back and forth like a pendulum, staring at me as I let the door slam.</p><p>I walk through the white concrete locker room, which is covered with old red and black checkered carpet. I take a seat on a bench, then yank off my practice jersey and pads and walk into the showers. The cold water feels great, and final y, I cool down. When I\u2019m finished, I pul on a pair of mesh shorts and a T-shirt before walking back into the locker room. Parading around in my plain white underwear in front of cheerleaders isn\u2019t my idea of fun.</p><p>I hear the giggling when I\u2019m stil ten yards away from the other girls. Shuddering, I head to my locker, open it, and yank my bag out.</p><p>\u201cI think JJ wil tel me he loves me soon,\u201d Lacey says to Kristen.</p> <p>\u201cHe definitely wil ,\u201d Kristen says. \u201cI can tel by the way he looks at you.\u201d</p><p>I force myself to cough so I won\u2019t laugh. JJ stares at Lacey the way he stares at every single one of the Titans\u2019 cheerleaders. It\u2019s the same way he stares at cheese fries, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jordan,\u201d Lacey says, brushing her brown hair. Must she stand around in skimpy black underwear?</p><p>She\u2019d get more coverage wearing a spool of thread than those things.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, focusing on packing my bag and getting the hel out of here. I ignore my wet hair; brushing it wil take too much time.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you shaved your legs?\u201d Lacey asks.</p><p>I bite the inside of my cheek. Sometimes Lacey makes me feel so shitty. I mean, what if Ty notices I haven\u2019t shaved in, like, a week?</p><p>\u201cSo, um, has JJ mentioned me lately?\u201d Lacey says. You mean, besides to tell me you guys slept together in the back of your mom\u2019s car last night? I\u2019m stil trying to figure out how JJ could fit horizontal y inside the back of a Ford Taurus, but I\u2019l take his word that it actual y happened.</p> <p>\u201cNope,\u201d I say. \u201cHasn\u2019t said a word.\u201d</p><p>Lacey slams her hairbrush into her bag.</p><p>I try to cobble together a sympathetic look, but it\u2019s harder than I thought it would be.</p><p>I\u2019ve never told anyone this, not even Henry, but one time I overheard Lacey and Kristen talking bad about time I overheard Lacey and Kristen talking bad about me in the bathroom...</p><p>I remember hearing Lacey whine, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why JJ hangs out with her so much. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s cute\u2014she\u2019s huge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Kristen had replied. \u201cSam Henry fawns over her too, even though she\u2019s a dyke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJJ promises me that he\u2019s not sleeping with her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s sleeping with both him and Henry.\u201d</p><p>And that wasn\u2019t a one-time diss. Kristen\u2019s a repeat offender.</p><p>Right then, Marie and Carrie, Henry\u2019s ex, come in through the locker room door.</p><p>\u201cSam Henry asked me out,\u201d Marie is saying to Carrie, who purses her lips, biting them. \u201cDo you mind if I say yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I\u2019m glad,\u201d Carrie says, focusing on me, and then she motions for Marie to fol ow her.</p><p>They head straight over to my locker. \u201cWho\u2019s the new guy?\u201d Carrie asks me.</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Ty Green,\u201d I reply. \u201cHe just moved here from Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looked pretty good out there,\u201d Lacey says. \u201cI mean, in terms of footbal obviously.\u201d</p><p>I snort. Like Lacey knows anything about footbal .</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d Kristen asks. \u201cHe seems just as good as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m glad to have a great backup,\u201d I respond, grabbing my bag. \u201cHe plays quarterback like me\u2014you know, it\u2019s a position in this game cal ed footbal .\u201d</p><p>Kristen rol s her eyes and goes back to staring at herself in the mirror. \u201cWhy\u2019s your face al red?\u201d</p><p>I jet for the door.</p><p>the great donovan woods</p><p>I walk back across the field toward my truck, and on the way, I spot Coach Mil er talking to Ty. Coach is frowning and scratching his chin, his glance alternating between Ty and the ground. They stop talking and, like me, Ty heads toward the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he cal s out, jogging toward me. My hands fly to my wet hair, and I try to smooth it and get some of the tangles out, but I\u2019m sure it looks like knotted yarn. God, I\u2019m as bad as the cheerleaders.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I reply. Suddenly we\u2019re walking right next to one another.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re a great quarterback. I haven\u2019t seen any guys our age as good as you.\u201d</p><p>I nod as I approach my truck, my Dodge Ram, a sixteenth birthday gift from my dad. I throw my bag into the truck\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cHot ride,\u201d Ty says, smiling and patting the side of my truck.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I turn away from him. His smile is a virus. A virus sweeping through my body, rendering it useless.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you drive?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNothing. No car,\u201d he says. But he doesn\u2019t seem embarrassed. Crossing his arms, he leans up against my truck. \u201cSo what\u2019s your first name?\u201d he asks. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not Woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou related to Donovan Woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I mutter. \u201cHe\u2019s my dad.\u201d I start peeling the label off my Gatorade bottle.</p><p>\u201cThat explains your style and mechanics.\u201d</p><p>Damn, he must\u2019ve been watching me pretty closely.</p><p>\u201cYou a Tennessee fan?\u201d I ask. Maybe he was into the Oilers before they moved from Houston to Nashvil e. He laughs. \u201cOf course not. Cowboys al the way, man. I remember watching your dad play for my team back when I was a little kid.\u201d</p><p>My dad is the last thing I want to talk about right now. When people meet me, that\u2019s al they think of\u2014the great Donovan Woods, two-time MVP of the NFL Twotime Heisman Trophy winner. The great Donovan Woods, surely a first-round Hal of Fame selection. The great Donovan Woods who doesn\u2019t believe in me or my dreams of playing bal at the col egiate level.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get going, Ty. Nice work today. I\u2019m glad you made the team.\u201d I\u2019m keeping it smooth and professional. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a car, how\u2019re you getting home?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cWalking, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I gasp. \u201cNo one in Tennessee walks\u2014sidewalks barely exist here. You\u2019re not walking.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s a teammate now, and teammates take care of each other.</p><p>I scan the parking lot. Henry is the only guy out of the locker room so far\u2014he\u2019s talking to Kristen and Marie. What the hel do the guys do in there anyway? How could it possibly take me less time to get ready than them? \u201cHenry,\u201d I cal out.</p><p>Henry abandons the cheerleaders and jogs over, then steals the Gatorade bottle from my hand, takes a swig, and hands it back to me while staring Ty down.</p><p>\u201cMake sure Ty gets home okay,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhat about our plans?\u201d Henry asks. He cradles the back of his neck with a hand and smirks at Ty.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel wel ,\u201d I reply, touching my stomach. I just need to be alone right now, so I can think about what\u2019s need to be alone right now, so I can think about what\u2019s happened today\u2014how this guy swooped in to steal both my position and my cool.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s al right,\u201d Henry says, but he looks hurt.</p><p>\u201cKristen and Marie just invited me to study anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you take Ty home first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you take him home?\u201d</p><p>Um, because he\u2019s driving me nuts? \u201cTake him on your study date. It\u2019l be good for him to meet some of the local bimbos.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiles.</p><p>\u201cFine, but I get Marie. Give me just a sec, Ty.\u201d Henry puts his arm around me and leads me away from Ty.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you aren\u2019t feeling wel ? Was it the hit you took?\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m not coming over for dinner then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go have a nice time with Marie, okay? I want you to date someone who makes you happy again.\u201d</p><p>Henry nods and rubs his chin, looking up at me, staring right in my eyes. Ever since Carrie dumped him, he\u2019s seemed so sad.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Woods. Maybe we\u2019l catch up sometime soon,\u201d he says, giving my shoulder a squeeze before he walks off. \u201cReady to go, Ty? I think you\u2019l like Kristen.\u201d</p><p>Ugh. Kristen has the same IQ as a tree stump. I\u2019ve gotta get out of here before I punch her or something. I climb into my truck, lean my head out the window, and smile. \u201cSee you tomorrow, guys.\u201d Through my rearview mirror, I see Ty staring at me as I drive away. Why didn\u2019t I just offer him a ride?</p><p>I know why.</p><p>I have to focus. I can\u2019t risk my season. I can\u2019t blow it again this year. I need to get a footbal scholarship. And to do that, I have to win the state championship.</p><p>Walking in the back door of my house, I drop my bag on the floor. I have a date with my bed: hiding beneath my pil ow and listening to some Guns N\u2019 Roses. That\u2019l make me feel better.</p><p>I go through the kitchen, grabbing a banana and Gatorade on the way to my room, and run into my brother, Mike, and his friend Jake, who\u2019s an awesome wide receiver. Like my bro, Jake also plays for the University of Tennessee at Knoxvil e. Jake is original y from California, so he\u2019s spent most of his summer living here so he can be closer to school for footbal practice.</p><p>\u201cHey, sis,\u201d Mike says, giving me a side hug. \u201cMom said you took a bad spil at practice. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019, Jordan?\u201d Jake says, eyeing me up and down. Remember how I said that guys are interested in me? Yeah, he\u2019s one of them. I think Mike would kil him if he tried something, though, and I wouldn\u2019t want Jake to go after me anyway. He\u2019s hot, but he seems like one of those guys who\u2019s been with about a hundred girls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say.</p><p>Jake slips an arm around my waist. \u201cMike says you\u2019re having problems with algebra?

I used to have this blue checkered bedspread that looked like graph paper. One day this past summer when Henry was over, he said that graph paper bedding turns guys off and that if I ever want to get laid, I can\u2019t bring a guy home to a room that reminds them of algebra and the nerdy girls on the math team. Not that I care what guys think of my bedding, but the math team is the last thing I want to be associated with, so I got rid of the old spread for something neutral.</p><p>Grabbing my stereo remote, I flip on the classic eighties station and stare out my window into our backyard, which ends at the banks of a lake. My lake actual y\u2014Lake Jordan. Having a dad who plays pro means we aren\u2019t lacking in amenities. Our house is huge, with hardwood floors everywhere and giant windows overlooking the woods and trails. The best thing about our house? My parents\u2019 room is on the other side of it, so it\u2019s like Mike and I have our own private wing. Dad never comes up here.</p><p>Sometimes I\u2019m embarrassed about how lavishly we live, because a lot of families around here don\u2019t have much. Tennessee\u2019s a weird place\u2014it\u2019s like you\u2019re real y rich, like me, or you\u2019re real y poor, like Henry. There\u2019s not much in between. If Dad wanted to, he could be making fifteen or twenty mil ion bucks a year. But with the NFL salary cap rules being what they are, But with the NFL salary cap rules being what they are, he chose to take a pay cut so the Titans could pay other players more money. He\u2019d rather have a kil er offensive line protecting him than a bit more cash. Lying on my bed, I try to drown myself in the ancient rock music, and try to forget that I got sacked today. Try to forget about Ty\u2019s body.</p> <p>I bury my face in a pil ow and hit it with a fist. Rol ing over, I jump out of bed and pace back and forth across the hardwood floors, biting my knuckle. Then I flop back down and grab my Gatorade from the bedside table and start slapping the bottle against my palm. I squeeze the bottle to see if I\u2019m strong enough to bust it. I dig my fingertips into it, but it doesn\u2019t budge, so I hurl the damned thing across the room at my dresser, knocking a bunch of the lotions and perfumes and other shit Mom buys me to the floor.</p><p>I go pick the girly stuff up and put it back on my dresser, and the birthday gift from Mom peeks out from behind my sophomore MVP trophy, taunting me. For my seventeenth, she bought me this lame journal.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d she said, \u201cwriting al ows me to blah, blah, blah, think deeply about karma, blah, blah, blah, and helps me figure out my problems.\u201d</p><p>Mom should get a job creating lame-ass mantras for the bottoms of juice-bottle lids.</p><p>But was she right?</p><p>I pick up the Moleskine and thumb through the blank, crisp pages.</p> <p>Sitting back down on my bed, I open the journal. It\u2019s not like the paper wil judge me, or question my sanity, or doubt my ability to lead a footbal team. No one could know about it\u2014the guys would make fun of me for eons if they found out.</p><p>At least by writing stuff down, it\u2019s out of my head, out of my body.</p><p>I reach over to my bedside table and push a stack of Sports Illustrated magazines aside to find a pen, then I write:</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen anyone so freaking gorgeous. No one\u2019s ever distracted me like this...But I\u2019m so far behind everyone else\u2014</p><p>I\u2019ve never even seen a guy naked...Well, I guess I\u2019ve seen Henry in his boxers bunches of times, and his body is hot\u2014</p><p>scalding hot wings hot, so Ty must be gorgeous.

Where the hel was JJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault. I wasn\u2019t paying attention,\u201d I say, groaning into my pil ow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to believe. When you\u2019re in the zone, you\u2019re in the zone. I mean, I\u2019ve never seen you lose concentration.\u201d</p><p>I turn over and stare up at Mike. \u201cUm...a new quarterback tried out for the team today. He just transferred here from Texas. And he\u2019s good. Damned good. Better than me.\u201d</p><p>Mike whistles and runs his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cThe coach would be pretty stupid to make a QB</p><p>change two days before the opening game.

Are you threatened by him?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, sit up, and lean back against my pil ows. I can tel my bro about Ty\u2014Mike won\u2019t mention him to anyone else. I just can\u2019t tel him about wanting to tackle Ty in the guys\u2019 locker room.</p><p>\u201cI think I like him.\u201d</p><p>Mike starts coughing, then smiles. \u201cYou? Jordan Woods? Has a crush? Yeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to make fun of me.\u201d I shove him off my bed.</p><p>Grinning, Mike stretches out on the hardwood floor and puts his hands behind his head. \u201cI\u2019m not making fun. I think it\u2019s great. It\u2019s about time you started noticing guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up. I notice guys. It\u2019s just...this was so weird, when he walked onto the field, I just lost it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo whatcha gonna do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Try to keep my head on straight for practices and games. I can\u2019t date a guy who\u2019s on my team. Especial y not a rival for my position.\u201d</p><p>Mike nods. \u201cGood luck. Just keep your head in the game and you\u2019l be fine. And don\u2019t look at the sidelines too much. You might get hungry for this hunk of man too much. You might get hungry for this hunk of man meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude! Shut up!\u201d I yel , throwing my pil ows at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful.\u201d I cover my face with my hands. God. Why couldn\u2019t Ty have moved here after the season was over?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler Green. Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell , Ty\u2019s a lucky guy if my sister is interested in him. I can\u2019t wait to meet him at the game Friday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t heading back to school before then?</p><p>Don\u2019t you have a game Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoach says it\u2019l be okay if I drive back on Saturday morning. Besides, this\u2019l probably be the only game of yours I\u2019l get to see this year. I wanna see which schools have recruiters checking you out besides Alabama. I\u2019l chat them up a bit.\u201d</p><p>I smile at Mike. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have your pick of scholarships. Imagine it. You\u2019l be the first girl to ever play QB at the col egiate level.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI wanna go to Alabama so bad. I just wish Dad would support me. Doesn\u2019t he think I\u2019m good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows you\u2019re good,\u201d Mike says, ruffling his hair, avoiding my eyes. \u201cDad\u2019s just...scared. He knows you can take al these fools at the high school level, but col ege is a different beast.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly, then smile at him. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for your game on Saturday. You\u2019re gonna kil the Gators.\u201d</p><p>Mike waves a hand, but he looks pleased. \u201cThanks. We\u2019ve got it. As long as we play good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, Jordan, Jake! Dinnertime,\u201d Mom yel s from downstairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tel Mom and Dad about Ty,\u201d I warn Mike.</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019l be so glad to hear you aren\u2019t gay!\u201d</p><p>You know those scenes on the news where people from \u201cFood for Peace\u201d take big bags of wheat to starving children in Somalia? Hundreds of people crowd around the trucks and knock each other down to get one bag of corn.</p><p>That\u2019s what dinnertime is like at my house. When I sit down at the table, I\u2019m like a stealth bomber as I secure four pieces of bread, because if I don\u2019t do it now, I won\u2019t get any later. Mike and Jake spoon big globs of mashed potatoes onto their plates, and I take three chicken legs. We won\u2019t start eating until Dad gets his ass in here, but we\u2019re al poised to dig in.</p><p>Mom brings in a pitcher of lemonade and pours me a glass. She looks at al of us and sees Henry\u2019s empty chair. \u201cWhere\u2019s Sam?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>\u201cHe had a study date,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cA date date?\u201d Mike asks, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno...some cheerleader. Marie Baird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured he\u2019d get back together with Carrie,\u201d Mom says. \u201cThe other day, he told me he was going to ask her out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. He didn\u2019t mention it to me when I suggested that,\u201d I say, focusing on my chicken leg. I can\u2019t wait to eat this thing. Mike glances at Mom, who shrugs. Why are they so interested in Henry\u2019s love life? Or should I say sex life?</p><p>In more important news, I\u2019m dying to dig into dinner. Al this thinking about Ty has made me ravenous. I didn\u2019t know crushing on a guy would require me to up my caloric intake.</p><p>The great Donovan Woods final y comes in and sits down at the head of the table. He plops a bottle of Gatorade next to his plate and grabs his napkin. I can tel from the scowl on his face that Dad\u2019s in a horrible mood, so I wonder if Titans practice sucked or something. When he final y picks up a fork and starts eating his salad, the rest of us start shoveling food into our mouths as if we actual y are those poor starving Somali children. A minute later, Dad drops his fork onto his plate. Everyone looks over at him.</p><p>\u201cDon?\u201d Mom says.</p><p>Dad ignores Mom and focuses on me. \u201cJordan, I seriously think it\u2019s time for you to consider quitting footbal .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, come on,\u201d Mike says. Jake picks up his silverware and napkin and sits on the edge of his chair and stares at Dad, almost as if he doesn\u2019t want to witness this, but can\u2019t help but stay and watch.</p><p>\u201cMike, keep out of this,\u201d Dad says, focusing on me again. \u201cJoe Carter cal ed to tel me his son hit you hard today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was no big deal,\u201d I say, pushing my salad around on my plate with a fork. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it could\u2019ve been a big deal, Jordan.

No women have ever been in the NFL, \u2019cause they\u2019d get kil ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Dad. Right now, al I want is to play in col ege, and see what happens there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could seriously get hurt.

Jake lets out a low whistle, and I think he\u2019s about to take off, when Dad suddenly stands up and throws his napkin down on the table. He shoots Mike a look\u2014the look of death, which I haven\u2019t seen since Henry and I accidental y drove Dad\u2019s ATV into the lake.</p><p>\u201cThanks for dinner, Julie,\u201d Dad says, bending over and kissing Mom\u2019s cheek. He picks up his plate, puts the bottle of Gatorade under his arm, and leaves the room. A few seconds later, I hear the door to his study slam shut.</p><p>My appetite gone, I pick up my plate and hold it out for Mike and Jake. My brother grabs the bread and chicken and Jake scoops the mashed potatoes onto his plate.</p><p>Mike rips into his second chicken breast, then wipes the grease from his lips with a napkin. \u201cDad\u2019s such a jerk.\u201d</p><p>Grinning at my brother, I stand up and take my plate to the sink. Before heading upstairs, I pause outside the dining room because I hear Mom speaking quietly.</p> <p>\u201cMike, I know you\u2019re mad, but you wil show your father more respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Mike replies softly.</p><p>I wish Henry was here to make me laugh right now, because I feel like shit. To get my mind off Dad\u2019s assholishness, I run upstairs to my room and grab the stupid journal. Then I go outside into the backyard, through the gardens to Mom\u2019s potting shed, this rickety oak shack that\u2019s covered in ivy and moss. It\u2019s total y Scotland.</p><p>Looking over my shoulder to make sure no one\u2019s watching me, I slip inside and shut the door and take a seat next to the shovels in the corner, where streams of light from our deck shoot through the window and the cracks in the siding, il uminating the dirt floor. I love hiding in the shed when I need alone time. When we were little, Henry and I used to play house in here. We\u2019d make long-winded announcements about how we would never get married to anyone, and I liked to pretend we had a bowling al ey, and Henry would talk about having a helipad, and I\u2019d trump that by pretending to have a transporter like on Star Trek. I find my flashlight. And holding it using my chin, I open the Moleskine to a blank page and try to think of something to write, besides fantasies of seeing Ty\u2019s...</p><p>\u201cJesus, Woods,\u201d I mutter. \u201cGet a hold of yourself.\u201d</p><p>I doodle. A few pictures of footbal s, some pinwheels, the Alabama Rol Tide logo about thirty times. I draw a bunch of X s and O s, which aren\u2019t hugs and kisses, but offensive plays from the team playbook, and\u2014okay, okay\u2014I write J.W. + T.G., which I scribble over immediately.</p><p>I rip out the page of doodles and wad it up.</p><p>Ode to Ty...I love your three-step drop and that quick release.</p> <p>I laugh as I rip that page out too.</p><p>evolution</p><p>(aka second attempt at tackling a</p><p>poem)</p><p>I\u2019ll admit it</p><p>When I first saw Jake Reynolds</p><p>I thought I\u2019d died and gone to the Super Bowl</p><p>(as starting QB)</p><p>That blond surfer-boy hair</p><p>That tan body that won\u2019t stop</p><p>That bottom lip: upturned, a sexy invite</p><p>And then he spoke</p><p>\u201cDamn, Jordan.

Mike, Jake, and I run five miles together and then we lift weights before I hop in the shower. When I shave my legs for the first time in a week, I actual y try to hit al the tricky spots\u2014around the ankles, behind the knees. It\u2019s like when Mom spends hours making sure each weed has been plucked from her vegetable garden.</p><p>I also mess around with the assorted lotions, body washes, and conditioners that Mom puts in my bathroom. I hope Ty likes shea butter.</p><p>Ugh. Al I\u2019ve done since yesterday is think about him. I only got two hours of sleep last night. Imagine that\u2014</p><p>me losing tomorrow\u2019s game against Lynchburg High School, the worst team in our district\u2014because I\u2019m worn out from thinking about a guy al night long. Yeah, I know. I make myself sick too.</p><p>Yet here I am at 7:00 a.m., actual y trying to decide what I\u2019m going to wear to school today. I spend two minutes brushing my hair, which is about two minutes longer than usual, then I pick out a nice pair of jeans, and since I don\u2019t have practice today, I try on a pushup bra and matching underwear that have infiltrated my underwear drawer. The lacy blue underwear barely covers anything and offers virtual y no support. Mom must real y want me to get a boyfriend.</p><p>As uncomfortable as I feel, I keep the girly underwear on anyway. Who knows? Provided they stay the hel out of my butt crack, they might make me feel sexier later on today.</p><p>And instead of my usual ratty \u201cTitans\u201d and \u201cBel Buckle Moon Pie Ten-Mile Race\u201d T-shirts, I pick out a plain black fitted tee. I know, I know\u2014I\u2019m wild. But seriously? For me, this fitted tee is total y dressing up, and it shows off my boobs. I don\u2019t think too many people even realize I have boobs. Not even Jake, the total horndog, knows I have a chest.</p><p>I top off the outfit with flip-flops and chapstick. Ty better appreciate how hard I\u2019ve worked to make myself attractive for him this morning, because I am fucking spent.</p><p>At lunchtime I head to the cafeteria, which always smel s like a mixture of meatloaf and salad dressing, like those odors have seeped into the concrete wal s and tile floor. I grab a slice of pizza, a salad, and a couple cartons of chocolate milk. I know I\u2019m seventeen and that those little milk cartons are for kids, but I love them.</p><p>Today, I\u2019m the first person to sit down at the footbal team\u2019s table, and when I look up at the lunch line to see where the rest of the guys are, there he is. Ty. He stares at me, smiling. From across the cafeteria, he mouths the words, \u201cCan I sit with you?\u201d</p><p>I take a bite of pizza and point at the table. He grins again. Suddenly I seem to lose the ability to chew. He drops his tray down and slides in beside me. Our elbows touch. \u201cHey, Woods.\u201d</p><p>I nod once. \u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>I scan the cafeteria for the rest of the guys, hoping they\u2019l be here soon. JJ and Carter are talking to a tableful of freshman girls. From a few tables away, Lacey is glaring at JJ, but he doesn\u2019t even notice because some redhead is feeding him French fries. Carter is listening to a girl with long brown hair, gazing at her as if she\u2019s saying very important things, like giving a play-by-play account of Super Bowl XXXVII. In al actuality, she\u2019s probably giving him a play-by-play account of some romance novel where some chick is in love with a boy who\u2019s real y a werewolf, and a vampire who\u2019s real y a dragon with enormous wings, and a handsome king who\u2019s real y a vampire.</p><p>Henry is standing over by the windows talking to Carrie Myer. He\u2019s leaning against the glass and frowning at her. Is Mom right? Are they going to get back together? Carrie says something, and they both turn and look at me. She stares at me for a sec, then turns back to Henry and says something.</p><p>What\u2019s that about? I wish I could read lips. Then he drags a hand through his curls and focuses on the ceiling tiles. Carrie wipes a tear off her face, turns, and walks toward the doors. Her eyes are al puffy and red. Henry fol ows her out into the hal way, frowning. Even though she said she\u2019s glad, maybe Carrie is actual y pissed that Marie went out with Henry yesterday, thus breaking the cardinal rule of cheerleading. JJ once told me that if a guy dates one cheerleader, the rest of the cheerleaders wil never, ever date him because of squad loyalty. Yeah, JJ didn\u2019t understand it either. It\u2019s not like anyone is getting married. But when it comes to Henry, the rule doesn\u2019t apply: the girls disregard it and mess around with him anyway.</p><p>Too much drama for me.</p><p>Too much drama for me.</p><p>Speaking of fooling around, Ty\u2019s sitting so close I can smel him. The scent of soap and detergent wafts up to my nose.</p><p>Ty leans over and whispers in my ear, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to thank you or hate you for sending me home with Henry yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hel ,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>He stuffs a few French fries in his mouth, but keeps talking. \u201cFirst he takes us to this diner. Those friends of his, Kristen and Marie, are al over us. Which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but Kristen doesn\u2019t seem to have anything between her ears.\u201d</p><p>I snort and chocolate milk comes out my nose. Yeah, I know, I\u2019m the sexiest creature on the planet. Ty grins at me.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d I say, wiping up my chocolate snot.</p><p>\u201cSo we stay at the diner for a couple hours, talking about absolutely nothing. And I mean nothing. Oh yeah</p><p>\u2014there was no studying going on either. Henry and Marie made out for, like, an hour.\u201d</p><p>I start cracking my knuckles as Ty goes on. \u201cThen we go out to his truck, and I\u2019m thinking, great\u2014final y, I get to go home. My grandfather\u2019s probably worried sick about me. But no, Henry doesn\u2019t take me home. He drives us way out into the country into this field. It\u2019s basical y a giant mud puddle.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cHenry took you mudding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. So we\u2019re in the field, and Henry drives his truck around in circles at about eighty miles an hour. I think I\u2019m gonna die. Everybody\u2019s screaming. He rol s down the windows and mud\u2019s flying al over the place, al inside the cab of the truck. I\u2019m covered in muck. Final y he stops the truck and we al fal out into the giant mud puddle.\u201d He looks down at his cheeseburger, picks it up, and takes a bite. With food in his mouth, he says,</p><p>\u201cPretty soon I\u2019m the only person stil wearing clothes. And then Kristen\u2014\u201d Ty suddenly grabs some fries and eats them, his face growing pink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m jealous out of my mind, but I\u2019m stil laughing hysterical y. Only Henry would do this to the new guy on his first day at a new school.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s funny, do you?\u201d Ty says, grinning. \u201cI didn\u2019t get home until after midnight. I showed up covered in mud and now I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHel yeah, it\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that Kristen chick has been stalking me al day.\u201d</p> <p>I glance over at the cheerleader table, where Lacey continues to glare at JJ and the redheaded French fry slave. I locate Kristen, who is gazing over at us. She waves at Ty and blows him a kiss. I\u2019m tempted to catch the kiss and pretend to crumple it up with my hand, throw it on the ground, and stomp on it.</p><p>Instead, I sip my chocolate milk and say, \u201cSucks to be you, man.\u201d</p><p>He elbows me. \u201cI think you planned the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid not.\u201d What is this? Third grade?</p><p>\u201cMake it up to me.\u201d He stares straight into my eyes. Breathe, Jordan, breathe. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong, so I\u2019m not making anything up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing after school today?\u201d</p><p>JJ and I are going out to eat after school. I could invite Ty to get grub with us. I want to, but I just can\u2019t\u2014if he comes, I won\u2019t be able to relax at al , and I need to freaking relax before tomorrow night\u2019s game.</p><p>JJ and Carter final y come sit down at our table. The minute JJ\u2019s back is turned and he\u2019s facing me, I see Lacey stand up and go over to the redheaded freshman. I don\u2019t need to read lips to know what Lacey\u2019s saying. I\u2019m pretty sure she just cal ed the girl a whore. The redheaded freshman gets up and rushes her tray to the dishwashing window, then bolts out of the cafeteria as tears fil her eyes.</p><p>the cafeteria as tears fil her eyes.</p> <p>Ty leans over to me. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it she\u2019s a bitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. I\u2019l go make sure that freshman\u2019s okay once I\u2019m done eating.\u201d Gotta keep my energy up for the game tomorrow.</p><p>He stuffs more fries in his mouth. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s no more dangerous creature on Earth than the teenage girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019m a girl.\u201d I punch him in the arm.</p><p>\u201cOw...\u201d he says, rubbing his bicep, but then he smiles. \u201cSo about this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I have plans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, okay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s the redhead?\u201d I ask JJ.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d he says, shrugging. \u201cCute though, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what comes over me when I grab some of Ty\u2019s French fries and say, \u201cHey, Ty, guess who I am?\u201d and lean across the table toward Carter and start trying to feed him.</p><p>JJ and Ty laugh.</p><p>\u201cNasty,\u201d Carter says, batting my hand away. \u201cYou know I hate school food, Woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I ask, sitting back down in my chair. \u201cThese are the best steak fries in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Ty says. Smiling, he opens his mouth, like he wants me to give him a fry. So I pop one in his mouth.</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>Did I just feed Ty a fry?</p><p>I should probably take my temperature.</p><p>stupid fitted tee</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel \u2019s wrong with you, Henry?\u201d I say, shoving him up against a locker.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, shoving me back.</p><p>\u201cI told you to take Ty home, not let him get molested by Kristen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t complaining last night! I think he had a great time.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care what he does, Woods?\u201d Smiling, he raises his eyebrows at me and looks down at my black tee.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Henry keeps grinning. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s bul shit. Since when do you wear shirts like that? We never get to see your boobs.\u201d I shove him again. \u201cFuck, Woods, do you like this guy or something?\u201d he whispers, shoving me back.</p><p>I move to shove him yet again, but he jumps out of the way. Damned bal erina reflexes. \u201cI care about my team. Ty told me you didn\u2019t drop him off until late. You shouldn\u2019t be out past midnight two days before our first game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he made it home then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let me take him al the way home. He had me let him out on the highway. It was weird, but I could tel he was serious. He didn\u2019t want me anywhere near his house.\u201d</p><p>How bad could his house be? Half the guys on my team live in trailers\u2014it can\u2019t be worse than that. I stare into Henry\u2019s eyes and tan face, which has broken out recently. He never used to have acne, but now he\u2019s got a smattering of it.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d I say, grabbing his hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he says, burying his other hand in his crazy hair.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m wondering if everything\u2019s okay with you. Are you stressed out or anything?\u201d</p><p>He sighs and leans against the lockers. \u201cYeah\u2014</p><p>maybe a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Carrie?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He brushes the curls off his forehead and stares at his flip-flops. \u201cI dunno...a lot\u2019s up...Dad\u2019s never home and Mom\u2019s sadder than ever...I\u2019m worried about col ege. I want to go so bad and I think a footbal scholarship is the only way my family wil be able to afford it.\u201d</p><p>Judging by his eyes darting around and that familiar twitch of his mouth, I can tel he\u2019s hiding something. But I rub his arm anyway and play along. \u201cI know. But you\u2019re great\u2014just keep playing hard and you\u2019l be fine. And I\u2019m sure you can get some money since you have great grades.\u201d</p><p>He stares at flyers tacked al over the bul etin board on the other side of the hal way. \u201cI hope so. My future\u2019s riding on footbal .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d I say, and looking away from Henry, I notice Ty coming down the hal . He stops for a sec when he sees me with Henry, but just passes right by us and doesn\u2019t say anything as he goes into the art room. Henry smiles, shaking his head. \u201cListen, I won\u2019t say anything to anyone about your liking Ty. Promise.\u201d</p><p>I wince.</p><p>He bumps his fist into mine, then puts an arm around me and walks me down the hal toward music appreciation class. Now that we\u2019re seniors and only appreciation class. Now that we\u2019re seniors and only concentrate on footbal , I swear, we are taking some of the stupidest classes ever. Today we\u2019re learning how to play the xylophone.</p><p>\u201cJust keep wearing those shirts,\u201d he says with a wink.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019l notice those boobs for sure.\u201d</p><p>Before music appreciation/xylophone class starts, Henry and I are huddled over a piece of scrap paper, playing Hangman. I jot down _ _ _ / _ _ _ _ _ _.</p><p>\u201cCategory is famous footbal players.\u201d</p><p>Henry says E, and I draw a head hanging from a noose. \u201cA,\u201d he says, and I fil in the second letter of both words. Then Marie walks up behind us, looks over Henry\u2019s shoulder at Hangman, and says, \u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>I snort, and Henry elbows my side and gives me a look. He pul s her onto his lap and wraps an arm around her waist. I sit up straight when he gives her a peck on the lips.</p><p>\u201cI wish you could\u2019ve come out with us yesterday, Jordan,\u201d Marie says, and I shrug. \u201cTy was asking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Sizing up his competition?\u201d I ask Henry, who starts staring at the idiots trying to smash each other with cymbals on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Marie says, smiling. \u201cHe wanted to know what you\u2019re interested in. He wished you had come out too.\u201d</p><p>I sit up even straighter. \u201cI had stuff to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s getting ready for Alabama going?\u201d Marie asks me as she drapes an arm around Henry\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s important to you,\u201d she mutters. Then she climbs off Henry\u2019s lap and walks back toward her desk.</p><p>\u201cDan Marino,\u201d she cal s out over her shoulder.</p><p>How the hel did she know the answer?</p><p>I start fil ing in the other letters, and Henry whispers in my ear, \u201cNot every girl is bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know, \u2019cause they fawn over you al the time. You don\u2019t see how Kristen and Lacey treat other girls, how they treat me in the locker room and bathroom, and back in\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shut up, not wanting to talk about what happened in seventh grade, and start drawing Alabama Rol Tide logos.</p><p>Henry whispers, \u201cI real y doubt Marie\u2019s ever said anything bad to you.\u201d</p><p>I shrug again.</p><p>\u201cGive her a chance,\u201d Henry says, \u201cI bet you\u2019l like her.\u201d</p><p>He takes the pen from my fingers, pul s the scrap paper closer to him, and writes _ _ _ _ _ _/_ _ _ _ _.</p><p>\u201cDan Marino,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cI knew it the second you wrote out the blanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBul shit,\u201d I say, and he punches my thigh and we laugh.</p><p>\u201cA,\u201d I say, and Henry draws a head. He looks over at Marie.</p><p>Staring at him, I cal , \u201cYo, Marie. Come help me figure out Henry\u2019s puzzle.\u201d</p><p>After school, JJ and I jump out of my truck and head into Joe\u2019s Al -You-Can-Eat Pasta Shack. I don\u2019t know why Joe decided to cal his place a shack, considering shacks don\u2019t make anyone think of Italy, but the food is amazing. Before every game, JJ and I come here and load up on carbs for hours. We\u2019ve been doing this for just about forever. Not only does this give us the opportunity to de-stress, but we get to eat tons of food while talking strategy.</p><p>I grab our usual spot, and JJ squeezes into the other side of the booth. I have to pul the table back toward me so he\u2019l fit comfortably. Joe comes over and we order water and our first plates of spaghetti.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say to JJ, \u201cready for tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014nothing to worry about. It\u2019s just Lynchburg,\u201d</p><p>JJ replies, taking a sip of water. He pul s a pen and a book of crossword puzzles out of his bag. He clicks the pen and shuffles through the book. This is how he destresses. \u201cYou worried at al ?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cHel s no, I\u2019m not worried about Lynchburg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried about anything else?\u201d He glances up from his book and looks at my face, then down at my shirt. Why in the hel did I wear this fitted tee?</p><p>I shake my head and drink some water. Then I start playing with the salt and pepper shakers. I do that game where you put one shaker on top of the other, then pul the bottom shaker out quickly so the top one fal s straight down onto the table. But you can\u2019t let it fal over. Or you lose.</p><p>\u201cYou sure, Woods? I hope you\u2019re not upset about Ty Green. I can\u2019t believe Coach let him on the team.\u201d JJ</p><p>clenches his fists and starts clicking the pen repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019m not sure what the story is, but apparently Ty just had to move here with his family and didn\u2019t have a choice. I think he just wants to play bal .\u201d I cough, then take another sip of water, which I proceed to choke on. I hit myself in the chest with my fist. JJ focuses on his crossword puzzle. \u201cLet me know if he\u2019s a problem.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hiding behind my glass of water, I smile. How does he keep his \u201clove\u201d life with Lacey separate from bal ?</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s different for him since he\u2019s a guy.</p><p>But I\u2019m practical y a guy. I mean, except for these fucking hormones that make me want to jump Ty and Justin Timberlake. I don\u2019t obsess over things that other girls care about, like clothes, movie stars, hair, painting nails, knitting, or whatever shit they\u2019re into. I just want to eat a bunch of hot wings, sleep, play bal , and maybe, someday, make out with Ty.</p><p>\u201cJJ? Um, how do you feel about Lacey? Like, do you love her...or anything like that?\u201d</p> <p>JJ drops the pen on the table and looks up at me. He narrows his eyes. \u201cWhy? Has she been asking about me or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, once...but I don\u2019t real y care what she feels about you, I\u2019m more wondering what you think of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good lay,\u201d he says, picking his pen back up. He chews on the end of it and focuses on his book.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a four-letter word for a past Russian leader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hel should I know, man? Anyhow...how do you manage to keep your, uh, thoughts of Lacey you manage to keep your, uh, thoughts of Lacey separate from footbal ?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook, Woods, I hate talking about this shit, but if you must know, I don\u2019t real y think about it. I enjoy sleeping with her and that\u2019s al . It helps me relax, which helps me play footbal better.\u201d</p><p>I chew on my lip. A \u201cstress reliever\u201d is the last thing I want to be. Is Ty the kind of guy who would only care if I\u2019m a good lay?</p><p>Are these the kinds of things cheerleaders discuss at slumber parties?</p><p>JJ continues, \u201cNow shut up about Lacey and feelings and shit and tel me the capital of Yemen. Five letters.\u201d</p><p>Last year, in biology, we dissected frogs, and when I cut the frog\u2019s stomach open, it was just ful of flies. The teacher said he\u2019d never seen a frog with such a ful stomach. If some higher being were to dissect me right now, I can\u2019t imagine how grossed out he\u2019d be by the inside of my stomach. I\u2019m stuffed with spaghetti. Now I\u2019m super-glad I didn\u2019t invite Ty to Joe\u2019s Al -You-CanEat Pasta Shack, because he\u2019d probably never want to look at me again. I\u2019m a blimp.</p><p>Opening the back door, I walk into my kitchen and hear Mike and Dad yel ing. The noise is coming from the dining room so I jog in there to find Henry armwrestling with Jake Reynolds. Both of their faces are red and Jake is clenching his teeth.</p> <p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d I whisper to Mike.</p><p>\u201cForty seconds!\u201d</p><p>I gasp. It\u2019s not every day a high school senior holds his own against a sure-to-be-first-round draft pick. Henry glances up at me, so I yel , \u201cGo, Henry! Kick this pretty boy\u2019s ass!\u201d Smiling, Henry bites into his bottom lip and starts to force Jake\u2019s arm down. Jake seems to grip Henry\u2019s hand harder. With one swift movement, Henry slams Jake\u2019s hand down to the table.</p><p>\u201cGood God!\u201d Dad says.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Mike exclaims, whacking Henry on the back.</p><p>Jake\u2019s face is al puffy. \u201cDamn it,\u201d he mutters. Dad squeezes Henry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI can tel how hard you\u2019ve been working out, Sam. Keep it up, and you\u2019l get into a great col ege program. I\u2019m real y proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Henry\u2019s eyes find mine, and he doesn\u2019t look away. My dad is such an asshole. The great Donovan Woods would never stoop so low as to compliment his own daughter\u2014a daughter who has just as much of a chance at getting into a great program as Henry.</p><p>A few minutes later, Dad takes Henry, Mike, and Jake out into the backyard to throw a bal around for awhile. When I start to head outside with them, Dad tel s me to help Mom with dinner. What a sexist pig. I carry the lasagna to the table, I carry the bread to the table, I carry the water pitcher to the table. I\u2019m tempted to spit on my dad\u2019s plate, but decide to act mature, unlike the great Donovan Woods. I\u2019m slamming plates and glasses on the table when Henry comes up and shakes my shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d suck as a waitress, Woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should tel Dad that.\u201d I drop a fork onto a plate, causing a clanking sound.</p><p>\u201cTel me what?\u201d Dad says as he walks into the dining room. He sees Henry standing there with his hands on my shoulders, and instead of acting al pissy, Dad actual y smiles at us.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say quickly. I wiggle away from Henry, shrugging him off me. I finish setting the table, taking care to put al the forks and knives in the wrong places. And even though I just ate about a hundred pounds of spaghetti, I start shoveling lasagna onto my plate. Henry sits down next to me, and Jake takes a spot across the table. There\u2019s a mad scramble for garlic bread, but I manage to come out victorious with five pieces. I\u2019m not hungry; I just don\u2019t want my family to think I\u2019m getting soft.</p><p>Mike frowns at me because he\u2019s only managed to wrangle three pieces. Since I\u2019m stil stuffed from Joe\u2019s Al -You-Can-Eat Pasta Shack, I donate two pieces of garlic bread to Mike\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dad says, looking from Henry to me as he pul s a piece of bread apart. \u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Henry replies. \u201cJordan and I are rebuilding a school bus engine in auto mechanics this semester.\u201d</p><p>Dad smiles at me. \u201cHow\u2019s that going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay so far,\u201d I say, sipping lemonade. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve rebuilt it, our class is gonna put it in an old brokendown bus we\u2019re refurbishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do with the bus?\u201d Dad asks. Henry sets his fork down and wipes his mouth.</p><p>\u201cJordan suggested we donate it to the Haskel Youth Center. You know, the orphanage? The kids like coming to watch our games, but they don\u2019t have an easy way to get to them.\u201d</p><p>Dad says, \u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea. When do you think it\u2019l be ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely by the end of the semester, so we\u2019l give it to them for next year,\u201d Henry replies.</p><p>I add, \u201cWe\u2019re missing a few parts, but we\u2019l take a look through Murphy\u2019s Junkyard next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know if I can help,\u201d Dad says before drinking more Gatorade. \u201cSome guys on my team might want to donate money for parts. Hel , I bet they\u2019d buy them a bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mr. Woods,\u201d Henry says. \u201cIf we screw it up, we\u2019l definitely take you up on the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we won\u2019t screw up,\u201d I say. Henry and I grin at one another.</p><p>For a few seconds, I only hear forks and knives clinking against plates, but then, as usual, Dad speaks up\u2014silence makes him uncomfortable or something.</p><p>\u201cYou look nice today, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>How lame. He wants to fil the lul by discussing my fashion choices? We\u2019d have a lot more to talk about if he\u2019d just discuss bal with me. Like that\u2019ll ever happen. So I ignore Dad and crunch on my salad. Sipping my lemonade, I look up and see that Jake\u2019s staring at my chest.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014you look nice,\u201d Jake says. Beneath the table,</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014you look nice,\u201d Jake says. Beneath the table, I kick him in the knee. Hard. His eyes clench shut and he coughs. I grin.</p><p>\u201cI think we al agree that you look nice,\u201d Dad says, taking another bite of lasagna. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re starting to act like a lady.\u201d</p><p>I drop my fork onto my plate. \u201cJust out of clean Tshirts, Dad,\u201d I say. \u201cMom? May I be excused? I ate too much at Joe\u2019s today.\u201d</p><p>Mom nods and reaches out for me, so I walk over and bend down so she can kiss my cheek.</p><p>After taking my plate to the kitchen sink, I run up to my room. I\u2019ve gotta get rid of this stress, or I\u2019l be a wreck at tomorrow night\u2019s game, so I pul on workout clothes and trainers.</p><p>Outside, I run up and down the little country roads near my house. The streets haven\u2019t been paved in forever, so it takes a lot of concentration to make sure I don\u2019t trip on bumps or fal in holes and hurt myself. As I run, I let daydreams of playing for Alabama total y absorb the part of my brain that isn\u2019t focused on running.</p><p>I pretend I\u2019m carrying the bal for a touchdown. I dart left, then right, dodging an imaginary cornerback, and run even faster.</p><p>Then I hear footsteps behind me, so I peek over my shoulder and see Henry trying to catch up to me. His curls are bouncing al over the place. \u201cWoods,\u201d he cal s out. \u201cYour dad was al trying to talk about col ege with me, and I told him to shove it!\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I speed up. Soon I\u2019m sprinting as fast as I can go, but Henry catches up anyway. He\u2019s so damned fast. He might as wel be Forrest Gump. Passing by me, Henry runs to the end of the block, where he turns around and does this stupid victory dance. It looks like he\u2019s roping a bul at a rodeo.</p><p>I\u2019m stil running at ful speed, so I crash into him, catapulting him into a ditch. \u201cShow off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d he shouts, laughing as he picks himself up. He wipes grass and dirt off his shirt and dusts his hands.</p><p>\u201cHow did Dad react when you told him to shove it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe laughed in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he says, looking into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you say that anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not going to support you, then there\u2019s no way in hel I\u2019d ever let him support me.\u201d</p><p>I smile at Henry. My best friend believes in me. What else does a girl need?</p><p>Still , I should be happy for him, because Dad\u2019s comments about footbal must mean a whole hel of a lot to Henry, whose own dad is never home and never talks to him about his future. Henry\u2019s father probably expects him to become some kind of a bum, working in a factory, or hel , driving a truck too.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you destroyed Jake at arm-wrestling,\u201d</p><p>I say.</p><p>Henry grins. \u201cYeah, I\u2019l never forget that.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cI was thinking. Maybe you should talk to Dad about Michigan. Maybe you could ask him to come watch you at one of our games. He might be able to help.\u201d</p><p>Henry\u2019s eyes find mine, but he stays quiet.</p><p>\u201cWant to race back?\u201d he asks final y.</p><p>\u201cDoes the winner get the necklace?\u201d I put my hand on the plastic footbal charm hanging from a cheap silver chain that Henry always wears.</p><p>\u201cHel , no,\u201d he says, fingering the Cracker Jack prize we\u2019ve been fighting over since we were nine. I\u2019l never forget how we were sitting out in Henry\u2019s front yard playing rock, paper, scissors while eating a big box of Cracker Jacks. I pul ed the prize out, and we both desperately wanted it. Since we were at Henry\u2019s house and they were his Cracker Jacks, he thought he deserved the plastic footbal . But since I\u2019m the one who deserved the plastic footbal . But since I\u2019m the one who pul ed the footbal out of the box, I thought it should be mine.</p><p>So we rock, paper, scissors-ed for it. I made scissors with my hand. He made rock.</p><p>He\u2019s worn the charm around his neck ever since.</p><p>\u201cHow about we race for an ice cream?\u201d Henry says.</p><p>\u201cFirst person back has to make the other a hot fudge sundae.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sprint off, passing a tractor chugging down the road.

But I barely feel it</p><p>\u2014I can only concentrate on the game and the Alabama recruiter. I ignore the dozens of reporters taking pictures of me from behind the fence.</p><p>I\u2019m desperate for air. I try to suck in as much oxygen as possible through my face mask, but it\u2019s not working. I pick up a footbal and twirl and flip it over and over again.</p><p>A hand comes down on my shoulder, and I turn and find Mike. His blond hair is plastered to his face, and his polo shirt and jeans are soaked. My bro is about the only person Coach al ows on the sidelines during a game.</p><p>\u201cHey, sis.\u201d He leans in close and whispers, \u201cSo where\u2019s Ty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m trying to concentrate. And you need an umbrel a\u2014you\u2019l get sick before your game tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, then rubs my arm. \u201cYou need to loosen up, or you\u2019re gonna be stiff as Grandpa Woods.\u201d</p><p>I flash him a withering look. Doesn\u2019t he know how important this game is?</p><p>\u201cYes, I know how important this game is,\u201d Mike says.</p><p>\u201cYo, Woods.\u201d</p><p>I see JJ walking up. \u201cYeah?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you, I was talking to your bro,\u201d JJ</p><p>replies, shaking Mike\u2019s hand. \u201cNice to see you, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, JJ. So where\u2019s this hot new quarterback, Ty?\u201d Mike asks. JJ glances at me. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m wearing my helmet, \u2019cause I can feel my face heating up again.</p><p>\u201cNumber fifteen,\u201d JJ mutters.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Mike says, slapping JJ on the back and wandering away.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that al about?\u201d JJ asks.</p><p>\u201cI dunno. I told him how good Ty is. He\u2019s interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell , Ty better not try to take the spotlight away from you, or I\u2019l kick his ass. I can\u2019t believe he fucking tried to come in here and take your position,\u201d JJ growls.</p><p>\u201cTake it out on Lynchburg, okay?\u201d I say, laughing. I watch as Mike goes up to Ty, shakes his hand, and claps him on the back. Ty yanks off his helmet and smiles at Mike, and they begin to talk animatedly. Mike points at the field, probably describing how crappy Lynchburg\u2019s field is, pointing out al the divots in the ground.</p><p>I feel fingers poke me in my sides, and I whirl around to find Henry carrying an umbrel a under his arm. He whips it out and opens it up, holding it above me.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d I hiss. \u201cYou\u2019re making me look like a pansy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Henry replies. I can see him smiling behind his face mask. He takes two giant steps away from me, but keeps the umbrel a out and stands under it alone. Henry jerks his head toward Mike and Ty. \u201cSo what\u2019s going on down there?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. Al my guy friends are way too protective and nosy. \u201cHe wanted to meet Ty. I told him how good he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow good he is, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Henry. I\u2019m trying to get in the zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, we\u2019re playing Lynchburg! We might as wel be playing a Pop Warner team.\u201d Henry moves closer to me again and hands the umbrel a to a freshman. Squeezing my hand, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna rock tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d I reply as Mike and Ty walk up.</p><p>Henry sees Mike leaning in close to me and quickly moves over to listen. Mike whispers, \u201cThe Alabama coach is here.\u201d</p><p>coach is here.\u201d</p><p>Henry and I twirl around to face the fence where boosters and alumni usual y stand and take notes. Sure enough, a man wearing a red Alabama Rol Tide windbreaker is there.</p><p>Mike continues, \u201cRecruiters from Ohio State are here too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey must be here for Carter.\u201d I feel awful that recruiters from Michigan aren\u2019t here. Henry\u2019s wanted to go to school there for as long as I can remember.</p><p>\u201cKnock \u2019em dead, Woods,\u201d Henry says. He slaps my back as the referee motions for captains to take the field for the coin toss. I jog toward the fifty-yard line with JJ and Carter and soon I\u2019m standing in the center of the field with Carter on my right and JJ on my left. The ref tel s me to cal it.</p><p>\u201cHeads,\u201d I say. The ref flips the quarter up into the air, and it hits the ground and lands on tails. The Lynchburg captain says they\u2019l kick off. Looking at the field, I say we want to defend the less muddy side. I don\u2019t want our defense slipping and fal ing al over the place. I\u2019d rather run through the mud on the other side. JJ, Carter, and I jog back over to the sidelines, where I knock fists with Henry before he heads out to return the punt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool that Ohio State\u2019s here,\u201d I say to Carter. He shrugs, which surprises me. I figured he\u2019d be ecstatic. Joe Carter Sr. was a starting linebacker for Ohio State, not to mention the Miami Dolphins and the Titans!</p><p>As the other team kicks off, Ty joins me. Together, we watch as Henry catches the bal and takes off down the field. He\u2019s at our twenty, then our thirty...he zigs and zags past a couple cornerbacks, who trip and fal into the mud. Then Henry drives straight down, and he\u2019s past the other team\u2019s twenty, then the ten. And touchdown!</p><p>Our cheerleaders cheer like crazy; our marching band plays a fight song. We are awesome.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Ty says. \u201cHe made that look easy.\u201d</p><p>Screaming, I jump up and down. I shove a freshman, who stumbles and fal s onto the bench. I shove JJ, who doesn\u2019t budge of course, but it\u2019s the principle of the shove that matters. I knock fists and give high-fives to other guys on the sidelines, including Ty. When our hands high-five each other, I feel this, like, bolt of electricity between us.</p><p>Henry spikes the bal and starts to do a dance, but then stops. I guess he realizes a dance isn\u2019t worth a penalty in this weather. After our kicker makes the extra point, our defense hustles out and doesn\u2019t al ow Lynchburg even one first down.</p><p>Showtime.</p><p>Jogging out onto the field, I take my position behind JJ.</p><p>Lynchburg\u2019s nose tackle says, \u201cHey, dyke. Your ass looks better than it did last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth, asshole,\u201d JJ says, slapping the tackle\u2019s face mask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say to JJ, loud enough for the tackle to hear me, \u201cThe only girlfriend he\u2019l ever have is his right hand.\u201d</p><p>Coach talks to me through the speaker in my helmet.</p><p>\u201cOnly carries tonight, Woods. No flashy passes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed fifty!\u201d I yel . \u201cRed fifty! Blue twenty-five!\u201d The cue is blue twenty-five, meaning JJ hikes the bal to me, I hand it off to our starting running back, Drew Bates, and he drives it up the middle. We get the first down easily.</p><p>JJ slammed the hel out of the nose tackle, who\u2019s now lying on the ground, clutching his stomach. \u201cNice,\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>The weather is causing Lynchburg to play even worse than usual, which is pretty damned bad, so we keep driving down the field.</p><p>After I hand the bal off for the second touchdown, I After I hand the bal off for the second touchdown, I hear Mom screaming for me from the bleachers. She\u2019s sitting with Carter\u2019s mom, Henry\u2019s mom, and JJ\u2019s parents.</p><p>I didn\u2019t figure Dad would come, but my head droops when I see he\u2019s not here.</p><p>Sopping wet with rain, Mom grins as she screams my name. I can\u2019t wait to tel her how much I love her. By halftime, the score is 28\u20130. I\u2019m embarrassed for Lynchburg, but I\u2019m playing an amazing game even if I\u2019m only handing the bal off and not throwing any long passes. I did run for a touchdown, though, just because I need to show off for the Alabama guy. Normal y I don\u2019t do things like that, but if I can\u2019t throw any long bombs in this weather, I\u2019ve gotta do something to make myself stand out.</p><p>Now we\u2019re in the guys\u2019 locker room, and since we\u2019re winning, Coach doesn\u2019t have to yel at us about what we\u2019re doing wrong, so I drink some Gatorade and dry off. My hands are so soaked they look like raisins. Henry squeezes in on one side of me on the bench, and Ty squeezes in on the other. Because we\u2019re slaughtering Lynchburg, I feel like I can relax a bit, so I leave the footbal zone and start thinking of Ty again. His elbow is touching mine. Breathe, Jordan, breathe. Don\u2019t think about his bicep. Don\u2019t think about that swatch of tan skin, peeking out from under his uniform, right above his hip. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we were the only two people in here right now? We could rip our uniforms off and\u2014</p><p>\u201cWoods!\u201d Coach says.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you out of the game for the second half.\u201d</p><p>JJ, Carter, and Henry jump up. They al start yel ing,</p><p>\u201cAre you serious, Coach?\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s rocking this game!\u201d and \u201cAn Alabama coach is out there!\u201d</p><p>Coach holds up a hand. \u201cWoods has shown she\u2019s perfectly capable of running a footbal field. But the weather is getting worse out there, and I don\u2019t want her to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like my dad.\u201d</p><p>Coach yanks off his hat and rubs his head, frowning at me. \u201cI bet your dad would agree with me. I\u2019m putting Ty in for the second half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d I say, standing and marching out of the locker room. When I\u2019m out in the hal way, I take a long, deep breath and run my hands through my wet hair. How could Coach do this to me? Alabama\u2019s here to see me. Me. Jordan Woods.</p><p>Not Ty.</p><p>It\u2019s like everyone on the freaking planet is out to stop me from playing bal and achieving my dreams. Everyone except the guys on my team.</p><p>My team...</p><p>No one respects a captain who acts like that, no matter if Coach is just plain idiotic tonight, so I go back into the locker room. \u201cSorry, Coach,\u201d I say. \u201cWon\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Coach smiles, tossing a bal to me. \u201cGreat. Help Ty warm up.\u201d</p><p>Thank the Lord that Coach isn\u2019t a meteorologist,</p><p>\u2019cause his predictions suck.</p><p>The weather\u2019s getting worse, my ass. By the time Ty is warmed up, bright stars fil the clear sky.</p><p>I\u2019m yel ing instructions at the defensive players on the field when Mike comes and stands next to me. \u201cYou played a hel of a game, sis.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mutter. \u201cCan\u2019t believe Coach pul ed me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.

Even though Ty\u2019s only had one practice with our team, a practice that lasted about twenty minutes, he wil destroy Lynchburg.</p><p>JJ hikes the bal to Ty. He takes a five-step drop and scans the field. JJ lets a defenseman get past him. On purpose, obviously. JJ would never let a Lynchburg linebacker get anywhere near me. It doesn\u2019t matter, though, because Ty sidesteps the linebacker and launches a deep pass to Henry, who\u2019s vying with a cornerback in the end zone. The bal sails right into Henry\u2019s open arms.</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>Ty just threw a forty-yard pass! God, I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve done that.</p><p>I turn to find Mike and the col ege recruiters. The coaches are speaking quickly to a gaping Mike, who says something to them.

I quickly shake his hand off.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Woods,\u201d Ty says in his thick Texas drawl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I mutter. \u201cNice pass.\u201d After JJ hikes the bal so our kicker can take the extra point, I pul him aside. \u201cJJ, don\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet a linebacker go after a player like that. Ty could\u2019ve gotten clobbered. Thank God it\u2019s only Lynchburg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel do you care? The dude stole your position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJJ, I don\u2019t care if he threatens to kil my unborn children. Ty is stil part of the team. We take care of each other. Understand?\u201d I smack JJ\u2019s helmet hard enough to make his head hurt, to make a point.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p> <p>Then I see Ty talking to Duckett, who\u2019s wearing his</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m freaked out of my mind\u201d face, so I go see what\u2019s happening there. I hear Ty say, \u201cYou can\u2019t interfere with a receiver like that\u2014you just cost us fifteen yards!\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s advice is right on, but he\u2019s not the coach, and he\u2019s certainly not captain. \u201cDuckett,\u201d I say, \u201cYou\u2019re playing a fantastic game, but Ty\u2019s right. Don\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it, Woods.\u201d Duckett glares at Ty and walks away.</p><p>\u201cYou were too nice to him,\u201d Ty tel s me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the captain here. There\u2019s a big difference between being brutal y honest and tel ing people what they need to hear. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Ty stares at me like he\u2019s never taken directions from anyone before.</p><p>I grab him by the jersey and pul him closer. \u201cYou got a problem with one of the players, you bring it to me. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mutters. He rubs the back of his neck, furrowing his eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cI run the field for Hundred Oaks. Not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Ty shoves his helmet back onto his head and runs out for our next play. Henry and JJ fol ow Ty, but once they\u2019re gone, Carter comes over to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this one bit, Woods,\u201d Carter says.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s off about that guy\u2014he assumes way too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s under control,\u201d I reply in a tone that tel s Carter to go away, which he does. But I can\u2019t help but wonder if Carter\u2019s right. This is my team. It\u2019s only our first game, and Coach has already taken me out and put in our farbetter quarterback, a quarterback who\u2019s used to cal ing the shots and getting his way.</p><p>But I won\u2019t be control ed by anyone. No matter how cute he is.</p><p>As usual, I\u2019m the first one out of the locker room and seated on the bus. I pul out my iPod and stretch across the last row. JJ and I always sit in the last two bus benches\u2014it\u2019s one of those senior perks. Closing my eyes, I listen to some rap music and hope the beats wil relax me. I can\u2019t wait to get home and hear what the recruiter said to Mike about me. Of course, he might have already forgotten about me\u2014considering I\u2019m only the second-best high school QB in Tennessee now. We won 42\u20130. Ty was nice enough to take it easy on Lynchburg, only throwing two long passes, both to Henry. Three touchdowns for Henry in one game is awesome\u2014the col ege coaches definitely must\u2019ve noticed that. I find myself smiling at the memory of Henry\u2019s dance at the end of the game. In the end zone, after his third touchdown, he did this one move cal ed</p><p>\u201cThe Lawn Mower,\u201d where he pretends to start a lawn mower. Then he did \u201cThe Sprinkler.\u201d</p><p>That one got us an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and then we had to kick off from fifteen yards back. Coach got angry about Henry\u2019s showboating, but I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Suddenly, the rest of the team gets on the bus, and the bus starts bouncing and shaking, and the other players\u2019 yel ing distracts me from the music and my thoughts. I close my eyes again. I feel a tap on my foot, and expecting to see JJ, I look up and find Ty standing in front of me. He pushes my legs, causing me to sit up and my feet to fal to the floor, and starts to squeeze in next to me on the bench.</p><p>\u201cWoods likes to sit alone,\u201d Carter cal s out. \u201cGet your ass to your own seat.\u201d</p><p>Ty turns and glares. \u201cMind your business, Carter. I need to talk to Woods about the game.\u201d He slides in, hip-checking me up against the window.</p><p>Crap. I must smel awful, like a mixture of sweat, wet dog, and the odor of diesel gas that has seeped into the vinyl bus seats. But it doesn\u2019t matter what I smel like. I can\u2019t let my guard down with this guy, or he won\u2019t just take over my position. He\u2019l take over the entire team.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, patting my knee. \u201cGreat game tonight. You\u2019re real y good.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms across my stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re good too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad I got to play\u2014I love footbal so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too...\u201d I pause for a beat before adding, \u201cI\u2019ve loved it ever since I was five, when Dad took me to my first pro game\u2014Super Bowl XXXI.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiles. \u201cBroncos-Packers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome game\u2014my man John Elway destroyed</p><p>Brett Favre.\u201d</p><p>I say, \u201cFavre sucks,\u201d and Ty says, \u201cI can\u2019t stand Brett Favre,\u201d at the same time, and then we both say, \u201cJinx.\u201d I pinch his forearm as he pinches my thigh.</p><p>We laugh, and he leans into my shoulder, and then we smile at each other. His eyes are so blue...</p><p>\u201cSo what did you want to talk about?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Ty grins that wicked smile of his again. He whispers, Ty grins that wicked smile of his again. He whispers,</p><p>\u201cI lied. I just wanted an excuse to sit with you.\u201d</p><p>Right then, Henry grabs the seat directly in front of us, quickly glances into my eyes, and then sits down and faces forward. Normal y, he hangs over the back of his seat and chats with me, but he slouches so far down in his seat that I can\u2019t even see him.</p><p>I put my headphones back on and recline against the vinyl seat, and Ty nestles his arm up against mine\u2014it feels warm.</p><p>When we get back to the school parking lot, I say goodbye to the team, knock fists with everybody, then head to my truck.</p><p>\u201cYo, Woods,\u201d Henry says as he jogs up. \u201cWant to come to Higgins\u2019s party with me?\u201d He rubs his palms together, then drops his thumbs into the pockets of his jeans.</p><p>I hurl my bag into the bed of my truck. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m gonna head home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna let Ty go home with you too?\u201d he snaps.</p><p>\u201cHe was just sitting with me,\u201d I mumble. What the hel is Henry\u2019s problem?</p><p>Henry heads toward his rusty maroon truck and turns around to face me as he walks backward. After glancing over at Ty, he locks eyes with me and says,</p><p>\u201cWell , you know where the real party is if you decide you don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d Then he shouts to the masses, \u201cParty at Higgins\u2019s! Who\u2019s with me?\u201d</p><p>The team erupts, and five members of Henry\u2019s harem miraculously appear and drape themselves al over him.</p><p>Ty comes over to me, shaking his head at Henry.</p><p>\u201cYou going to the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I respond. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hit the sack. I\u2019m going to my brother\u2019s game tomorrow in Knoxvil e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds cool. I\u2019d love to see him play sometime. I enjoyed meeting him tonight\u2014he\u2019s nice people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014I love my bro.\u201d</p><p>Ty brushes his hair off his forehead. \u201cSo, um, want some company tomorrow at Mike\u2019s game?\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. What an offer. But Knoxvil e is an hour and a half away. That\u2019s way too long to be alone with Ty and my parents.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m riding to the game with my parents, Ty. Trust me, you\u2019d rather go clothes shopping for al eternity than spend three hours in a car with them. Maybe some other time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind riding with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good idea.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowns and stuffs his hands in his pockets. \u201cDid I do something to make you mad? I\u2019m sorry Coach put me in tonight, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s any reason for you to be pissed at me. You were slaughtering that team.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d he blurts. He throws his head back and closes his eyes.</p><p>Shit. So maybe I haven\u2019t been the nicest person. But I can\u2019t tel him why he\u2019s distracting the hel out of me. Ty turns, starts to walk away, and waves over his shoulder. \u201cI guess I\u2019l see you around then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Ty\u2014how are you getting home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself. I don\u2019t need you to arrange rides for me.\u201d</p><p>Tears rush to my eyes. \u201cUm, I was going to offer to take you home. And, to ask if maybe you, I mean, if you aren\u2019t doing anything on Sunday...\u201d</p><p>He stops, turns, and raises his eyebrows. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, would you want to go to my dad\u2019s preseason game with me? In Nashvil e? He\u2019s playing the Patriots. I always go when he plays New England because Tom Brady\u2019s awesome, but don\u2019t tel my dad I said that.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiles. \u201cA Titans game? An actual NFL game?</p><p>I\u2019ve never been to one before.\u201d</p><p>That surprises me. It\u2019s strange that someone as good as Ty has never been to a pro game. \u201cYeah,\u201d I good as Ty has never been to a pro game. \u201cYeah,\u201d I say, \u201cJJ, Carter, and I are going together. And maybe Henry, if he can drag himself out of bed in time. That\u2019s doubtful, though.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo I need to get a ticket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not\u2014we\u2019l sit in the owner\u2019s box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.

Girls like you.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My. God. I quickly say, \u201cHave fun. I\u2019l cal you tomorrow. Bye!\u201d I jump into my truck and drive away. I don\u2019t bother looking in the rearview mirror this time. I know he\u2019s watching me.</p><p>At home, I run upstairs to Mike\u2019s room and pound on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d I open the door to find Mike lounging on the floor playing a footbal video game. I sit down next to him, and he passes me the second control er. \u201cWhat are you doing home so early?\u201d he asks. \u201cNo parties or anything? No hot date with Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to play bal tomorrow, you\u2019d better shut your mouth, because I\u2019l kick your ass, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Mike laughs as he immediately scores a touchdown. Man, do I suck at video games.</p> <p>\u201cSo tel me what the Alabama coach said about me already!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about Ty first. He\u2019s real y cool, Jordan. And even though he\u2019s not starting this year, he\u2019l have his pick of col eges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say, throwing the control er down. I stand and shuffle across the room and fal onto Mike\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cTel me what the Alabama guy said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell , on the down low, since I stretched the rules a bit by talking to him about you, if you keep playing like you did tonight, they\u2019l offer you a ful ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Mike says. \u201cKeep up the good work and you\u2019re a shoo-in for Alabama. Just don\u2019t get distracted, don\u2019t get hurt, and don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t it kinda weird that they\u2019re wil ing to give me the ful ride even though I didn\u2019t make any big passes tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHel , don\u2019t question it,\u201d Mike says, laughing. \u201cJust rol with it. I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be awesome if I went to Alabama\u2014we\u2019d be rivals!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTennessee would total y kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, keep tel ing yourself that.\u201d</p><p>Mike rubs his jaw. \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t think either of us has considered. The coaches of any school you go to are going to use you as a recruitment tool. Alabama wil be showcasing you al the time, and they\u2019l want you to help with advertising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d I say. \u201cLike that time Sports Illustrated wanted to do an article on me? Thank God Dad stepped in and said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Mike says. \u201cI don\u2019t think your life wil be so private anymore. Everyone\u2019s going to know everything about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I can play col ege bal , I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Now, on to more important issues\u2014tel me what\u2019s up with Ty. I like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I invited him to Dad\u2019s game on Sunday. Are you going?\u201d</p><p>you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can if you want me to. Don\u2019t you want some alone time with Ty?\u201d Mike asks, grinning.</p><p>\u201cPlease come. Please help me act normal. I real y like Ty and want to be his friend, but I keep pushing him away. He sat next to me on the bus tonight and I ignored him most of the time.\u201d</p><p>Mike suddenly drops the control er. \u201cHe sat next to you on the bus? In the back row? In front of al those guys? Oh sis, he total y wants you bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I say with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine having the guts to sit with a girl in front of al those guys. Henry and JJ wil kick Ty\u2019s ass if he hurts you. And even if they don\u2019t kick his ass, they\u2019l make fun of him for it in the locker room. Hel , I\u2019d never stop mentioning it,\u201d Mike laughs.</p><p>Enough about Ty. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. Thanks for the help with the coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob. Wait\u2014Jordan,\u201d Mike says, standing and putting a hand on my shoulder. \u201cGive Ty a shot. I don\u2019t want you to go through life never taking a chance on a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to kiss or anything like that.\u201d</p><p>Mike chuckles. \u201cSis, if he kisses you, you\u2019l figure out how to kiss back pretty quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we get together, and then he breaks up with me? That would suck. And then we\u2019d be stuck on a team together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t risk anything if he wasn\u2019t serious. Trust me. I can tel he\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>But is a good guy worth the risk of losing sight of my goals? My dreams?</p><p>only father</p><p>Watching my favorite sport</p><p>Watching my favorite brother</p><p>(okay, my only brother)</p><p>Watching my only father cheer for Mike</p><p>Smiling</p><p>Laughing</p><p>Shouting</p><p>Telling Mom how proud he is</p><p>Saying no father could have a better son</p><p>And I\u2019m sitting right there</p><p>Ready to drown myself in nacho cheese</p><p>\u2019Cause all I have is football</p><p>And the person I want to share it with,</p><p>more than anything</p><p>Hasn\u2019t even asked if I won last night...</p><p>henry</p><p>the count? 17 days until alabama</p><p>In his game, Mike total y kicked the Florida Gators\u2019</p><p>asses, 21\u201310. I screamed so much for my brother that I got hoarse.</p><p>Now I\u2019m back at home, sitting in the kitchen, texting with Henry.</p><p>I text: How did party go?</p><p>Henry texts back: Carter got trashed &amp; made out with freshman from lunch.</p><p>WTF! Carter really got drunk? He never drinks. I hope nothing\u2019s wrong.</p><p>Yeah, it was crazy. I was counting on him to give me a ride &amp; I ended up lugging him home. He\u2019s a heavy SOB. LOL. I know. He killed me with that sack on Wed. JJ?</p><p>After crazy fight, JJ &amp; Lacey went upstairs to bedroom. Shocker. Was Carrie there?</p><p>Yup.</p><p>And?</p><p>I hung with Marie again.</p><p>Was Ty there?</p><p>Kristen spent entire time throwing herself @ Ty When I read that text, I throw up in my mouth. I text Henry back: Does Ty like Kristen?</p><p>Don\u2019t think so. Carter, JJ &amp; I will be at su casa in hour 4 fantasy Don\u2019t think so. Carter, JJ &amp; I will be at su casa in hour 4 fantasy draft</p><p>K</p><p>Mom comes into the kitchen, carrying a bundle of sunflowers, and arranges them in a vase. \u201cWhat are you doing tonight, Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guys are coming over. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>Mom nods, pul ing a bottled water from the fridge, and takes a seat.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming to my game last night, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cWouldn\u2019t have missed it. So...tel me about Ty Green. I haven\u2019t seen a high school quarterback like him in years. Maybe ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better than your brother was at seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we can\u2019t tel Mike that!\u201d</p><p>Mom laughs lightly. \u201cWere you upset with Coach Mil er for taking you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hel yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Ty coming over tonight?\u201d Mom asks. Glancing up at me, she starts peeling the label off her bottled water.</p><p>\u201cNah. But I invited him to Dad\u2019s game tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, wel I can\u2019t wait to meet him. He looks like a cute young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I say before thinking.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Mom\u2019s grinning now. \u201cDo you like him as more than a teammate?\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>Mom folds her hands together and lifts them to her chin, and her smile brightens even brighter, like how the sky gets when the sun starts dribbling over the horizon during early morning runs.</p><p>Before I embarrass myself even more, and before Mom can start talking about feelings and shit, I dart out of the kitchen and run downstairs.</p><p>Later that evening, the guys and I are finishing up our fantasy draft while eating enough Chinese food to feed al of China itself.</p><p>Henry lies down on the rug and clutches his stomach.</p><p>\u201cRemind me not to eat two orders of General Tso\u2019s chicken ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Henry,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he replies with a grin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t eat two orders of General Tso\u2019s chicken ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis egg drop soup is complete crap,\u201d Carter says, kicking the egg snot stuff around with a spoon. \u201cNot enough salt. And the eggs are rancid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I turn eighteen, I\u2019m getting a tattoo,\u201d JJ</p><p>announces.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d Henry asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of getting a Chinese character, like right above my butt,\u201d he says, pointing at his lower back.</p><p>\u201cYou would get a tramp stamp,\u201d I say, biting into a fortune cookie as Henry and Carter start laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat would it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking thunder,</p><p>or ripple, you know,</p><p>something deep like that.\u201d</p><p>Henry hoists himself up onto an elbow and leans over to whisper in my ear. \u201cMaybe we could pay the tattoo artist off, and get him to write the Chinese word for exit.\u201d</p><p>I crack up. \u201cTotal y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d JJ demands.</p><p>\u201cWe think you should go with thunder,\u201d Henry says, biting his lips together.</p><p>JJ thinks for a moment. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Thunder, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l get a tattoo too,\u201d Henry says, flexing his left arm.</p><p>\u201cOf a hula girl, on my bicep.\u201d</p><p>I grin before asking, \u201cWhat are you gonna get, Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, maybe, like, flames? What about you, Woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the Alabama logo?\u201d I point at my hip bone and say, \u201cRight here?\u201d</p><p>Henry coughs into a fist as JJ\u2019s cel rings.</p><p>\u201cYo, how\u2019s my favorite girl?\u201d JJ says, grinning lazily and reclining against the couch as if he\u2019s the Greek god in charge of pleasuring the women of Hundred Oaks High School. Hel , he\u2019s probably waiting on some girls to jump out of the closet and start fanning him with palm leaves while feeding him potato chips. \u201cI\u2019l be there in ten minutes,\u201d JJ continues, standing up.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Henry asks. \u201cThe redheaded chick from the cafeteria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Lacey wants me to come over.\u201d JJ winks. \u201cShe needs me.\u201d</p><p>Henry laughs. \u201cHave fun, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGag me,\u201d I mutter as I start cleaning up trash, picking up used chopsticks and fortune cookie wrappers.</p><p>JJ says, \u201cLater,\u201d and runs up the stairs and out the basement door.</p><p>Carter stands up and throws a few take-out cartons away. \u201cI\u2019m gonna jet too, Woods. I need to get home before my dad freaks out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy would he?\u201d I ask, throwing Diet Coke cans into the recycling bin.</p><p>the recycling bin.</p><p>Carter shrugs, but he looks sad. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m not getting enough sleep.\u201d</p><p>I nod, understanding completely. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to live in casa de Carter, where protein shakes and stomach crunches start the day, and pushups and being in bed by 10:00 p.m. end it.</p> <p>Is that why Carter got drunk last night? Did he need a release or something?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d I say, not wanting to push Carter into talking if he doesn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not secretly meeting up with that hot freshman from last night?\u201d Henry says, a smile stretching across his face.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carter blurts out. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have done that...I mean, I\u2019m not even into Stacey.\u201d He seems seriously torn up. \u201cShe\u2019s a nice girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Henry says, slapping a hand on Carter\u2019s back. \u201cAfter practice on Monday, let\u2019s go to the batting cages, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCool,\u201d Carter says, knocking fists with Henry and me before heading upstairs.</p><p>So now it\u2019s just me and Henry. I flop down on the couch and grab the remote, ful y expecting him to leave in a few seconds. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got gobs of nameless chicks waiting for him.</p><p>Flipping through the channels, I stop on ESPN as Henry sits down on the sofa cushion next to me. He slumps down and closes his eyes, and even though he was acting normal a couple of minutes ago, I can feel sadness radiating off him like steam rising from hot asphalt in summertime.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay over?\u201d Henry asks final y.</p><p>\u201cSure. You\u2019re not going out?\u201d I\u2019m surprised, and glad, when he says he\u2019d rather stay in than go out with the cheerleader du jour. I feel better when I know he\u2019s safe and not out doing anything crazy or reckless, like driving his truck at eighty miles an hour through a mud pit.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d He looks over at me and runs a hand through his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not going out either?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cWhat could I possibly have to do? JJ and Carter just ditched us. You\u2019re al I have left,\u201d I say, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ty?\u201d</p><p>I feel myself blushing, my face ripening up like a strawberry. \u201cEh...I dunno. He\u2019s coming to the game with us tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh real y?\u201d He sighs, picks up the remote, and starts flipping through the channels.</p><p>\u201cHenry\u2014what\u2019s up? Please talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we go to sleep now? I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p> <p>I have nothing better to do, so I might as wel get a good night\u2019s sleep. I\u2019ve gotta try to make myself pretty for Ty tomorrow, and if I only get a couple hours of sleep, I\u2019m sure I\u2019l look like a gremlin. So I stand, put out both hands, and pul Henry up from the couch, and we go upstairs to my room. He takes off his shirt and jeans and puts on a pair of my mesh shorts as I change into sweatpants and a T-shirt. In my bathroom, we brush our teeth together, then drop our toothbrushes into the holder.</p><p>Just as I head to bed, he picks up the tiny canister of shea butter from the counter and flips the lid off. Takes a whiff of it. \u201cYum. So that\u2019s why you\u2019ve been smel ing better lately,\u201d he says, his chest fil ing with laughter. Ripping it out of his hand, I say, \u201cGive me that,\u201d but he snatches it away again. He takes some of the shea butter and slathers it on his hands and arms, smiling and smel ing himself. I rol my eyes and head to bed. I yank the covers back and crawl in, and Henry lies down next to me, reeking of shea butter. \u201cUgh. You smel ,\u201d I say. \u201cTurn around. We have to sleep head-totoe. Mom\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>toe. Mom\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t tonight. I heard a rumor that you have athlete\u2019s foot, and I can\u2019t risk getting it in my nose.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I hit him with a pil ow. \u201cIf you don\u2019t behave, you\u2019l have to go sleep in Mike\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Henry blurts. He quickly scoots around and moves to the other end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you stil scared of Mike\u2019s room?\u201d I say, giggling. He fal s face first onto the pil ow I just threw at him. In a muffled voice he replies, \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather just stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re stil scared of his room because of your whale dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about that spooky whale. That haunted house thing was so fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude\u2014it wasn\u2019t a haunted house. It was a church Hal oween bazaar.\u201d</p><p>Henry laughs. \u201cWhatever it was, it was fucked up.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s been nine years since Carter invited us to that Hal oween bazaar at his church. Instead of creepy people in Freddy Krueger masks chasing us with chain saws, or people reenacting Blair Witch shit, al the booths were Bible-themed. The church had converted this long dark hal way into a replica of the inside of a whale\u2019s stomach, so people could experience what it was like for Jonah after he was swal owed.</p><p>Walking down that almost pitch-black hal way, I felt the wal s and found they had hung plastic bags covered in Jel -O and Spam to simulate whale innards. A soundtrack of whale songs and crashing waves played over a cheap stereo, and pudding-fil ed water bal oons littered the floor. Miniature internal organs?</p><p>I thought it was the lamest thing ever.</p><p>Henry? Wel , Henry freaked out. He must have some deep fear of whales or something because he clutched my elbow and whimpered. Whimpered. I didn\u2019t make fun of him\u2014I just covered his hand with mine and pul ed him through the whale\u2019s stomach. Instead of three days, we were in there for about thirty seconds. Later that night, Henry slept over at our house. He had always stayed in Mike\u2019s room, but in the middle of the night, Henry sneaked into my bed because he\u2019d had a horrible dream he\u2019d been eaten by a whale. He\u2019s stayed in my room ever since. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely stil scared of Mike\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>He looks up from the pil ow and grins. \u201cPlease let me stay. I promise I\u2019l behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, but as soon as we\u2019re lying down headto-toe, he shoves his socked feet right in my face.</p><p>My alarm clock wakes me up at 9:00 a.m. I move to turn it off and realize that Henry\u2019s arm is draped across my stomach. How did he get turned around in my bed?</p><p>\u201cHenry, getoffame,\u201d I mutter, pushing him away so I can hit the snooze button. Then I rol back over onto my pil ow, and he moves back in closer and drapes an arm across me again. He nuzzles up against my neck. I\u2019m starting to get more and more worried about him. I run my hand through his curls for a few minutes until I absolutely have to get up. Climbing out of bed, I pul the covers up over him. It\u2019s obvious he\u2019s too down and out to go to the game today, so I don\u2019t even bother trying to rouse him.</p><p>After a quick shower, I pul on some black underwear I found in my dresser, courtesy of Mom. Walking out of the bathroom, I spend about thirty seconds in my closet. Though I hate wearing anything involving a skirt, I have to dress up if I want to sit in the owner\u2019s box, so I put on a simple black dress and slip on some silver flats.</p><p>Before I leave, I sit down on my bed and pat Henry\u2019s head. He barely opens his eyes, gives me a slight smile and buries his face in the pil ow again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l cal you after the game,\u201d I say. \u201cStay as long as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Woods. Have fun with Ty,\u201d he says into the pil ow. \u201cShow him that underwear you\u2019re wearing\u2014it\u2019l make him wild.\u201d</p><p>I smack Henry on the shoulder. Considering we\u2019ve been hanging out since we were seven, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s seen me in my underwear a bunch of times, but he\u2019s never mentioned them before. \u201cWhy were you watching me change?\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cUh, \u2019cause I\u2019m a guy?\u201d He flips the pil ow and slaps it, fluffing it. Then he rol s over and closes his eyes again.</p><p>nachos grande</p><p>the count? 16 days until alabama</p><p>When I get to JJ\u2019s trailer, I honk my horn about ten times. I told Ty to meet me at JJ\u2019s because I don\u2019t want him to see where I live yet. Judging by the fact that Ty doesn\u2019t have a car and doesn\u2019t want Henry to see where he lives, I don\u2019t want him to see my house and think I\u2019m some stuck-up snob.</p><p>JJ comes running down the rotting wooden steps, his extra weight flopping al over the place underneath a white, button-down shirt and tie. \u201cWe\u2019re coming. Stop your honking.\u201d</p><p>Walking behind JJ, Ty looks cute in his own buttondown shirt, tie, and khaki pants. He cleans up wel . He hops into the backseat and JJ sits up front next to me.</p><p>\u201cYou know, some people have manners and ring the doorbel ,\u201d JJ says.</p><p>Ignoring JJ, I say, \u201cHey, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he replies. Through the rearview mirror, I watch as he looks at me and takes a deep breath. He pushes his sandy hair off his forehead.</p><p>\u201cCarter?\u201d JJ asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his grandmother\u2019s 70th birthday,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cHenry?\u201d JJ asks.</p><p>\u201cAsleep in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty exclaims.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, dude,\u201d JJ says. \u201cHe sleeps there more than he does at his own place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ty says as he fiddles with the buttons that open my truck\u2019s sunroof, opening it up and closing it a few times.</p><p>Somehow I\u2019m able to drive my truck to Nashvil e without crashing it. Every time I glance at Ty in the mirror, I get distracted and start thinking about how great he looks in a tie.</p><p>An hour later, we walk into the owner\u2019s box. Mom\u2019s already here, boozing and schmoozing with the Titans\u2019</p><p>owner, but when she sees me come in with Ty and JJ, she comes over.</p><p>\u201cHel o, sweetie,\u201d she says, giving me a kiss on the cheek. Then she turns to JJ and kisses him too. Grinning broadly, JJ says, \u201cHey, Mrs. Woods. You\u2019re looking beautiful, as usual.\u201d I rol my eyes. JJ\u2019s such a flirt. No wonder al those sil y cheerleaders swoon over him regardless of the fact that he\u2019s as big as a sumo wrestler.</p><p>\u201cThank you, JJ,\u201d Mom replies. \u201cAnd who\u2019s this?\u201d she asks, gesturing at Ty.</p><p>Ty stretches out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Ty Green. Nice to meet you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Ty,\u201d Mom says, smiling at me and Ty. My face must be as red as a stop sign.</p><p>\u201cGreat job in the game on Friday night. It was like Jordan was the opening act and you were the headliner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks Mom,\u201d I say, laughing. I\u2019m not mad\u2014</p><p>she\u2019s just trying to make Ty feel comfortable here at Titan rich-people central.</p><p>Mom winks at me and continues, \u201cTy, I can tel you have a great future ahead of you. Come on, you should meet Mr. Taylor, the owner.\u201d She puts a hand on Ty\u2019s back and leads him away.</p><p>Over his shoulder, he glances back at me and gulps. I take the opportunity to breathe and grab a bottled water. It\u2019s official: I\u2019m into him.</p><p>JJ pul s me aside. \u201cWhat the hel \u2019s up with you, Woods?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, what\u2019s going on with you and Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>JJ sniggers. \u201cLike I believe that. He can\u2019t keep his eyes off you.\u201d</p> <p>eyes off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cDuh. Look, Jordan, you\u2019re my best friend. I don\u2019t know how much I trust this guy,\u201d JJ says, jerking his head at Ty, across the room. \u201cI don\u2019t want him stealing your position away from you or using your family to get ahead. And Carter told me what he said to Duckett on Friday. That\u2019s not cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get what you\u2019re saying, but let\u2019s give him a chance, okay? Unless I have, like, ten interceptions in one game, Coach isn\u2019t giving away my position. And if he tried to use me, you and Mike and Henry and Carter would al kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue...so, uh, do you like him?\u201d</p> <p>Wow, I can\u2019t believe JJ just asked me about my feelings. Since this is such a momentous occasion, I can\u2019t lie, so I nod once.</p><p>\u201cHot damn! I thought you\u2019d be single for life. Figured you\u2019d run off and join a convent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an ass,\u201d I say, laughing. \u201cYou know, Lacey\u2019s head over heels for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, I\u2019m never speaking to you again,\u201d JJ says, darting away. I watch as he builds the biggest plate of nachos ever, big enough to feed Rhode Island.</p><p>So JJ would stil take me seriously, as a teammate and as captain, if I had a boyfriend?</p><p>I decide now\u2019s a good time to rescue Ty from my mom and Mr. Taylor. When I approach the group, Mr. Taylor smiles and says, \u201cI hear you have some competition for your position, Jordan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir. Thanks for inviting us today,\u201d I say. I always flatter him because I need to stay in Mr. Taylor\u2019s good graces. They serve these amazing ice cream sundaes, and JJ lives for that nachos grande bar.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always welcome,\u201d Mr. Taylor says. \u201cYour mom and brother tel me that Ty wil easily be snatched up by a big Division I team.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowns and rubs the back of his neck.</p><p>I ask Mr. Taylor and Mom to excuse us, then I rescue Ty, grabbing his hand and pul ing him to my favorite seat, this cushy leather couch on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says as we flop down on the sofa. \u201cI was dying over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. JJ distracted me with the nacho bar,\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>A waiter walks up and says, \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask Ty.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re having, I guess,\u201d he responds, shrugging. He coughs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l take two Cokes, two of those awesome hot fudge sundaes, hot wings\u2014not the mild sauce, I mean the 911 sauce, the stuff that tastes like you\u2019re eating lava, and a large cheese pizza,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Ty says. \u201cAre you real y a girl?\u201d</p><p>I freeze. I want him to think of me as a girl, not one of those people in a professional eating contest, like Joey Chestnut\u2014the guy who ate sixty-eight hot dogs in twelve minutes. \u201cThe food\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s the only reason I sit in the owner\u2019s box instead of at field level.\u201d</p><p>Ty chuckles and pats my thigh. He lets his hand linger there for about two seconds, but then pul s it away and folds his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Ty says, focusing on the massive Titans scoreboard, not meeting my eyes, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to come to Hundred Oaks, and I was worried about being on a team with guys I don\u2019t know, but you\u2019ve made me feel like I\u2019m part of something. So, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I wipe my sweaty palms on my dress.</p><p>\u201cNo, real y. You\u2019re a good leader. I like that you\u2019re serious. I like that you\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I reply, grinning at him as he continues staring at the scoreboard, keeping his strong, tan hands clasped together.</p><p>hands clasped together.</p><p>Just as Ty turns to smile at me, Mike\u2019s friend Jake comes over and sits on the other side of me. Of al days, why did Mike have to bring his horndog friend to the game?</p><p>Jake puts his arm around me. \u201cHey, Jor. Who\u2019s your friend? I hope he\u2019s not your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Ty is staring at the field, but I can tel he\u2019s listening to Jake because he\u2019s leaning closer to me and because the game hasn\u2019t started yet. Players are stretching and doing final dril s. I spot Dad swinging his arms around and bouncing up and down. He looks pumped.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something, Jake?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to sit with the prettiest girl in the room,\u201d</p><p>Jake says. He leans over and plants this wet sloppy kiss on my cheek.</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d I exclaim, wiping slobber off my face.</p><p>Luckily, Mike comes over to rescue me. He grabs Jake\u2019s arm and pul s him away from us. \u201cSorry, Ty, there\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t let this guy out much.\u201d</p><p>When Mike and Jake are gone, Ty whispers, \u201cWho</p><p>the hel was that tool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat tool wil probably be a first-round pick in the NFL draft next year,\u201d I say, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Jake Reynolds?\u201d he says, turning to stare. His eyes are opened so wide, he looks like one of those poison dart frogs. \u201cHoly shit. He\u2019s so awesome.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cTrust me, he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like he likes you. Don\u2019t you want to date a first-rounder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me while I go vomit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not interested in him?\u201d Ty asks, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHel s no. I\u2019d rather date O. J. Simpson.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughs. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that...I think.\u201d</p><p>God, this is awkward. Lucky for me, the game starts and Ty goes nuts. I love that he\u2019s having a great time. We total y pig out on al the food I ordered, and I can already feel my dress getting tighter. I hope Ty won\u2019t think I\u2019m fat.</p><p>I\u2019m so focused on Ty that I don\u2019t pay any attention to my mom, my brother, or JJ. That\u2019s okay, though, because JJ only has eyes for the Titans\u2019 cheerleaders and his nachos. I also haven\u2019t paid attention to the game, which I don\u2019t realize until Ty tel s me how cool it was when Dad ran for a touchdown from the ten-yard line right before halftime. I can\u2019t believe I missed that. Dad\u2019s almost too old to scramble for a touchdown. At halftime, Mike comes over and squeezes in between me and Ty. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d he says, putting an arm around each of us.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you acting so weird, bro?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m acting weird because I have an incredible piece of gossip,\u201d Mike says in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cMike, I think you should forget an NFL career and become my agent. You shouldn\u2019t waste your schmoozing skil s.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughs. \u201cThe thought\u2019s crossed my mind. So aren\u2019t you interested to hear my news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou know who Mr. Taylor\u2019s brother-in-law is, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the head coach of Notre Dame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Taylor asked if you might be interested, sis, but I told him that Alabama\u2019s your first choice. But I said that it would be worth it for his brother-in-law to come take a look at Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks so much, Mike,\u201d I say, hugging my brother.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Ty says. His eyes are darting around from the field to Mike to me to his ice cream sundae. Why\u2019s he so nervous?</p><p>\u201cCool\u2014wel , I\u2019l leave you guys alone. I\u2019ve got some more chatting to do,\u201d Mike says as he stands up and shuffles back to the bar.</p><p>Ty rubs the back of his neck again and stares down Ty rubs the back of his neck again and stares down at the field. \u201cThis has been a weird couple of days, Woods,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cTel me about it,\u201d I reply before thinking. Why the hel did I say that?</p><p>\u201cAfter the game today, can we go somewhere to talk? Alone?\u201d</p><p>Me and Ty alone?</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I reply, calm and professional.</p><p>But inside?</p><p>My heart and stomach are bouncing around like yoyos. ty\u2019s place</p><p>It\u2019s not destitute.</p><p>It\u2019s not Trump Plaza.</p><p>It\u2019s a cute house</p><p>white paint chipping off its sides</p><p>the lawn overgrown but</p><p>nothing a lawn mower couldn\u2019t cure.</p><p>Wildflowers litter the yard</p><p>morning glory and goldenrod exploding like Skittles, but white clover in spring is my favorite</p><p>(when I was little, Henry made me necklaces out of it). All in all,</p><p>JJ and Henry live in squalor compared to Ty.</p><p>But the look on Ty\u2019s face</p><p>tells me something is very, very wrong here.</p><p>he knew...?</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d I ask as I put my truck in park. He grabs my hand and in silence, we sit here holding hands for a few minutes. He keeps opening his mouth as if he\u2019s about to say something, then shuts it again.</p><p>\u201cMy dad died six months ago,\u201d he says final y.</p><p>Surprising myself, I reach over and draw him into a hug. He lets his forehead rest on my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwful car wreck. Drunk driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you moved here?\u201d</p><p>He pul s his body away, but keeps his arms around me. \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you live with your mom and sister? And grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014you should come in and meet Papa. He\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I get to meet your mom and sister too?\u201d</p><p>He shifts in his seat and starts playing with my sunroof again. \u201cMy mom was in the car too.\u201d</p><p>But if she was in the car...and didn\u2019t die...? \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, wel , she\u2019s, um, paralyzed?\u201d Ty buries his eyes in the heels of his hands. \u201cAnd I mean, I real y tried my best to take care of everything so my sister and I could stay in Texas...but I couldn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you tel ing me this?\u201d</p><p>He drops his hands and turns to stare into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, right? I hope we are...I left everything in Texas.\u201d</p><p>I grab his hand. \u201cOf course we\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell , my dad didn\u2019t have as much life insurance as I thought he would...wel , we didn\u2019t have much money to begin with. But Mom needs a lot of care...like, care I can\u2019t give her? She needs a nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you moved here so your grandfather could help out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...I had to sel our house in Texas...so we could afford Mom\u2019s care. Plus my grandfather already had a job here working in a pajama factory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pajama factory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know that Tennessee is, like, the pajama capital of the world?\u201d Ty grins slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I don\u2019t wear pajamas,\u201d I say without thinking. Ty coughs. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I meant I wear, like, workout clothes to bed\u2014you know, T-shirts and mesh shorts and shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight...\u201d Ty says, smirking. Ty\u2019s signature smirk is about the sexiest thing on the planet.</p><p>\u201cI wear clothes to bed!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>I slap Ty\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSo...your grandfather is taking care of everything then?\u201d</p><p>Ty rubs the back of his neck, sneaking a peek at me.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not exactly. He can\u2019t afford it either \u2019cause he doesn\u2019t get good health insurance, and it\u2019s not like his insurance could cover Mom\u2019s care anyway. My mom\u2019s parents died real y young, so my dad\u2019s father was nice enough to take us in. I mean, he doesn\u2019t have to help take care of Mom at al .</p> <p>\u201cSo...um, we\u2019re living off the money from sel ing our house right now. And yesterday, I found a job doing dishes for a restaurant on Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. They were nice enough to work around our footbal schedule, but I don\u2019t know what the hel I\u2019m gonna do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I get a job after high school, I\u2019m not going to</p><p>\u201cEven if I get a job after high school, I\u2019m not going to be making enough money to support my sister and get Mom the care she needs at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJob? What about col ege?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWoods...I can\u2019t go to col ege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go to col ege. What about Notre Dame?</p><p>You\u2019re NFL material!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I know that?\u201d Ty says quickly. Then he jerks his head, as if he\u2019s mad at himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry...I didn\u2019t mean to say it like that. What I meant to say is that I want to go to col ege, and I want to play bal more than anything, but I can\u2019t just take four years off and leave my sister and mom to fend for themselves. Papa doesn\u2019t make much money at al ...he\u2019s already taking on more than he can handle by feeding my sister and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s gotta be something. You\u2019l get a scholarship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScholarships don\u2019t put food on the table.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why are you playing bal now? Why aren\u2019t you working more than three days a week?\u201d</p><p>He takes my hand again, caressing it. \u201cI love footbal . When I was a kid, my dad and I would throw a bal around for hours. We did that almost every day...up until, wel , you know, the wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just want to play bal ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis season is kind of like my last hurrah, because after this, I have to get a real job and stop dreaming.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze his hand. \u201cYou know what I think about dreams?\u201d</p><p>Ty smiles slightly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat if you spend too much time dreaming, you\u2019l stop actual y doing. And when you actual y do stuff, there\u2019s a good chance things wil work out. We make things happen by attacking, not by sitting around dreaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is gonna make me sound like a jerk, but what exactly would you have to dream about anyway? Your life is, like, perfect.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh loudly. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>Ty shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, wel my problems are nothing compared to yours, but my dad doesn\u2019t believe in me at al and hates the fact that I play footbal .\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y? But your dad seems so cool on</p><p>SportsCenter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very cool...as long as you don\u2019t bring up my playing footbal .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s wrong.\u201d He goes back to caressing my hand.</p><p>My body feels so hot. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you come in for a few?\u201d Using his thumb, Ty points over his shoulder at the house.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say with a smile.</p><p>Hel , I\u2019l come in for the rest of my life.</p><p>Wil I get to sit on his bed? Does he have graph paper bedding?</p><p>We hop out of my truck and go up to the porch, and as I approach the door, I start to freak a bit. How could I be so self-absorbed to obsess about being in his bed when his mom is here, paralyzed?</p><p>When Ty opens the door, he reaches back and grabs my hand, leading me inside. Everything seems meticulously clean. Would I find any dust in this house?</p><p>The living room is total y 1970s, complete with a brown plaid couch. I love it. Maybe I can buy the couch off them and then they\u2019l have more money. But from what I know of Ty already, he would never accept handouts. A beautiful girl who could only be Ty\u2019s sister is sitting on the couch reading a magazine and watching television. She must be thirteen or fourteen and must be breaking al the boys\u2019 hearts at her new school. When she sees Ty, she jumps up from the couch and hugs him.</p><p>\u201cHow was the game?\u201d asks his sister, a tal girl with</p><p>\u201cHow was the game?\u201d asks his sister, a tal girl with sandy blond hair. She\u2019s wearing makeup and a cute top with a skirt. Yup, definitely breaking hearts.</p><p>\u201cGreat! Did you watch it on TV?\u201d Ty replies.</p><p>\u201cUhh...no.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughs, then says to me, \u201cVanessa hates footbal . Vanessa\u2014this is Jordan Woods, and Woods, this is my sister, Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>We shake hands and his sister beams at me. \u201cTy\u2019s told me so much about you! I love that dress\u2014can I borrow it sometime?\u201d</p><p>Ty groans. But which statement freaks him out more</p><p>\u2014the fact that his sister asked if she can borrow this lame dress? Or the fact that I know he\u2019s been talking about me?</p><p>\u201cVanessa, that\u2019s rude,\u201d Ty says.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou can have it if you have something else I can wear home. I hate dresses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod! I\u2019l go find something right now,\u201d she says, darting out of the room.</p><p>Ty rol s his eyes but smiles. He puts a hand under my elbow, leading me out of the living room toward the kitchen, where an older man is sitting at a table with his feet propped up, reading the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cPapa, I\u2019d like you to meet Jordan Woods,\u201d Ty says, glancing from his grandfather\u2019s face to mine.</p><p>The man stands up, extending a hand. \u201cJim Green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a pleasure, Jordan. I\u2019ve been reading about you in the papers for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d I say, not surprised. My name is constantly in the papers during footbal season, as footbal is the only thing to do around here.</p><p>\u201cYeah, before he moved here, I even sent Ty some of the articles in the mail,\u201d Mr. Green says, patting Ty\u2019s back. \u201cI told him it would be hard to get on the team at Hundred Oaks, what with you there and al , so I was thril ed the coach let him on the team. Bob Mil er is a good guy.\u201d</p><p>Wait, so Ty knew about me? He knew I was a girl?</p><p>Then why the hel did he act so surprised when I pul ed off my helmet?</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019re back, I\u2019ve gotta get to the factory. Lucky break\u2014I got a Sunday overtime shift,\u201d Mr. Green says to Ty. \u201cNice to meet you, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d I reply as he leaves. I\u2019m total y confused. Ty knew about me? My thoughts are interrupted by Vanessa\u2019s reappearance with a bunch of outfits. Ty starts digging through al the clothes, which include miniskirts, a leather jacket, and a pair of camouflage pants. Smirking, he lays a hot pink miniskirt, a jean jacket, and a tube top out on the table.</p><p>\u201cNo. Hel no.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughs, handing me a pair of mesh shorts and a Nike T-shirt. \u201cJust kidding. You can change in the bathroom.\u201d Ty points to a door, and I go in, change into the workout clothes, and walk back to the kitchen barefoot. After handing the dress over to a squealing Vanessa, I notice that Ty\u2019s frowning, so I decide to make an exit. I haven\u2019t asked where his mom is, but I figure if he wants me to meet her, he would introduce us. Can she even talk? Or is she paralyzed to the point where she\u2019s, like, this is horrible of me, a vegetable?</p><p>I\u2019d never ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get going,\u201d I tel Ty. \u201cI need to check on Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Ty replies, raising an eyebrow. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>Henry\u2019s breakup with Carrie is very public knowledge, like the whole Jennifer Aniston\u2013Brad Pitt\u2013Angelina Jolie thing, so I\u2019m not betraying him by saying, \u201cHe\u2019s been sort of a wreck since Carrie Myer dumped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Wel , I\u2019l walk you out.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa throws her arms around me. \u201cIt was so great to meet you. And thank you so much for the great to meet you. And thank you so much for the dress! You have a great fashion sense! Can we go shopping sometime?\u201d</p><p>Ty chuckles. \u201cI don\u2019t get the feeling Jordan likes shopping.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Al girls love shopping.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNah, not me. But my mom would take you shopping. Lord knows I won\u2019t go with her. I bet she\u2019d love the company.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa smiles and bites her lip. \u201cI\u2019d love that. Thanks, Jordan. I can tel we\u2019re going to be, like, great friends.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I force a smile. I\u2019m sure Vanessa feels desperate for a mother figure of any kind, even a sixfoot-tal , footbal -playing tomboy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be back inside in a bit,\u201d Ty tel s Vanessa, and he starts to fol ow me to the front door when Vanessa says, \u201cBy the way, Nate cal ed\u2014\u201d and Ty stops.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d he says, furrowing his eyebrows, \u201ccan you wait in the living room for a minute?\u201d</p><p>I nod, walk into the other room, and stare up at a picture of Ty and his mom, dad, and sister hanging next to the front door. I\u2019m thinking how beautiful his mother is and how handsome his father was, when I hear Vanessa exclaim, \u201cNothing bad is going to happen to me!\u201d</p><p>Ty speaks in a hushed tone. \u201cNo. You are never going to any guy\u2019s house. He can come here, but you\u2019re not going anywhere. And that homework had better get finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod! It\u2019s like being in prison!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, Vanessa. You\u2019re not going out.\u201d</p><p>Then Ty comes into the living room and sighs.</p><p>\u201cWoods...let me walk you out.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s his deal? He must be terrified something wil happen to her, like his parents. But you can\u2019t confine a teenage girl\u2014that wil just make her rebel. On the other hand, I can\u2019t imagine how Ty feels, knowing that his sister is his responsibility. She\u2019s al he has left. I head outside in the borrowed workout clothes and my silver flats. It\u2019s like a late-afternoon walk of shame. Ty fol ows me out to my truck, loosening his tie. I hop in, and Ty surprises me when he climbs back into the passenger seat.</p><p>I stick my keys in the ignition, but I don\u2019t turn the engine over. I find Ty\u2019s eyes and ask, \u201cSo if you knew about me already, why did you act so surprised when I took my helmet off the other day?\u201d</p><p>Ty pul s his tie the rest of the way off. \u201cUm...I admit I knew you were a girl...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh, just wasn\u2019t expecting you to be...so...not butch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Ty leans toward me and runs a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cIt means...I didn\u2019t expect you\u2019d be so gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>still in the truck</p><p>He leans across the center console</p><p>brushes my cheek with a hand</p><p>glances down at my lips</p><p>runs a finger along my jaw</p><p>presses his forehead to mine.</p><p>He starts to move in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is too much.</p><p>I\u2019m too scared to kiss.</p><p>What if he thinks I\u2019m awful?</p><p>I don\u2019t want to get rejected.</p> <p>He\u2019s on my team!</p><p>So I tell Ty I need to go.</p><p>Other than seven minutes in heaven with Henry</p><p>this is the closest I\u2019ve ever come to a kiss</p><p>and I tell him I need to go.</p> <p>What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>Ty pulls away</p><p>glares at me</p><p>and begins to get out of the truck.</p><p>\u201cSee you at school tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He slams the door</p> <p>heading toward the house</p><p>he doesn\u2019t wave or even turn to look.</p><p>Now it\u2019s me staring as he walks away.</p><p>FROM: Tucker, Mark (Athletics, University of Alabama) TO: Woods, Jordan</p><p>DATE: Monday, August 30, 12:46 p.m.</p><p>SUBJECT: Opportunity</p><p>Dear Jordan:</p><p>We are so pleased you are considering joining our athletic community at the University of Alabama. Coffee Calendars, a company affiliated with our booster program, produces an athletic calendar that our boosters sell every year. While a certain portion of the proceeds go to support our sports programs, most of the proceeds go to charity.</p> <p>Coffee Calendars is in the process of taking photographs for next year\u2019s calendar, and our boosters would like you to consider posing for the September picture. Members of the volleyball, softball, and swim teams have agreed to be featured.</p><p>If you plan to join our program, which we most sincerely hope you do, we\u2019d like to schedule a photo shoot before your home game this Friday evening. Production schedules require us to begin this process as soon as possible.</p><p>Please let me know if you\u2019re available for a photo session.

Along with music appreciation and auto mechanics, this is another one of the stupid, easy classes Henry and I are taking together.</p><p>\u201cOkay, everyone,\u201d Ms. Bonner says, \u201cPair off into groups of two\u2014husbands and wives.\u201d</p><p>Henry\u2019s the only guy in the class, so al the girls automatical y turn to him. He puffs out his chest and grins broadly, looking around the room at al the girls he has to choose from. A sophomore sitting in front of us gives him a little wave and a smile.</p><p>Henry raises his hand. \u201cMs. Bonner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sam?\u201d the teacher says with a sigh. She taps a forefinger on a textbook.</p><p>After slipping a pencil behind his ear, Henry folds his hands in front of him and gets this extremely serious look on his face like he\u2019s about to negotiate a peace treaty. \u201cBefore we can choose partners, I think we need a few more details on what we\u2019re going to be doing in these husband-wife pairs. Is, um...\u201d Henry lowers his voice to a mere whisper, \u201c...sex involved?\u201d</p><p>Al the other girls start giggling as Ms. Bonner shakes her head. \u201cNo, Sam. Sex is not involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t understand how we can be husbandwife pairs,\u201d he exclaims. \u201cThat\u2019s what husbands and wives do.\u201d</p><p>The girls giggle even more.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just going to be pretending,\u201d Ms. Bonner says. \u201cNow, everyone, find partners.\u201d</p><p>The smiling, waving sophomore comes slinking up and touches Henry\u2019s arm. \u201cWant to be partners, Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m already married to Woods.\u201d</p><p>The sophomore glares at me. What the hel is her problem? Like Henry and I would commit to doing a school project with someone else in this class. Honestly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ms. Bonner says, going to a closet at the back of the room, \u201cNow that we al have partners, al husbands should come pick up their projects.\u201d</p><p>Pick up our project? Shrugging, I stand up and stretch my arms. Henry also stands. \u201cNo way, dude,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m the man in this relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, absolutely,\u201d he says, grinning. He sits back down as I walk to the closet to see this project, which turns out to be one of those fake electronic babies. Oh good God. Ms. Bonner hands me a fake baby boy. The dol has these creepy glass eyes that look like they\u2019re staring straight into my soul. I hold the dol out in front of me like it\u2019s a flaming bag of poo and carry it back to Henry.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Mommy,\u201d I say, dropping the dol into his hands. \u201cYou could\u2019ve told me I knocked you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bad. I thought you\u2019d force me to get an abortion,\u201d</p><p>Henry replies, taking the baby and cradling it as if it\u2019s real. \u201cHe has your eyes, Woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your hair.\u201d The dol is bald. \u201cCan we name him Joe Montana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHel s no, his name is Jerry Rice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, his name is Joe Montana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in labor with him for fourteen hours!\u201d Henry exclaims as he rocks the baby back and forth. \u201cHis name is Jerry Rice.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Then the teacher gives us al this shit, like blankies and strol ers and toys and other things that babies need. First, Ms. Bonner says we have to carry this crap around al week! But then she explains the real assignment. Apparently these babies have computer assignment. Apparently these babies have computer chips that make them cry at random times, and it\u2019s up to us to feed them and change their diapers. Feeding them involves putting a metal rod in their fake mouths, which shuts off the crying. If we take out the metal rod before the fake baby is done eating, it wil start crying again. We have to keep our babies happy and alive until Friday\u2014for five entire days! So even if the baby cries in the middle of the night, we have to get up and feed the baby or change it. And cheating isn\u2019t an option, because the memory chip inside the baby takes readings that the teacher wil check at the end of the week.</p><p>This assignment is so stupid. Like I\u2019m ever going to have children. Like I\u2019m ever going to get laid. I bet I could get my chiropractor to write a note saying the electronic pulses from these babies have been known to cause cancer, which would eat away at my bones, which would make me useless on the footbal field. Wait...</p><p>\u201cBut Ms. Bonner,\u201d I cal out, \u201cWhat are Henry and I supposed to do during footbal practice?\u201d</p><p>Henry puts a hand on my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, dear. That\u2019s what grandparents and the junior varsity players are for.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Bonner throws her hands up in the air. Lucky for her, the bel rings. Henry spends an inordinate amount of time getting Jerry Rice situated in our strol er. Then we leave the room, carrying our diaper bags down the hal toward the locker rooms. On the way, we run into Carter and JJ, who both just about die laughing.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Henry says, \u201cYou\u2019re going to wake up Jerry Rice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry Rice?\u201d Carter says, covering his mouth with a hand. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Carter laugh so hard.</p><p>\u201cCarter, would you like to be the godfather?\u201d Henry asks. \u201cYou know, in case anything happens to me and Woods this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming,\u201d Carter says. \u201cI\u2019d be honored. Does JJ</p><p>get to be godmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cCan I hold Jerry Rice?\u201d JJ asks. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, man,\u201d I reply. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wake that thing up before practice. We\u2019l be late if we have to feed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it eat?\u201d Carter asks.</p><p>\u201cI have to breast-feed, \u2019cause I\u2019m the mom,\u201d Henry says, continuing to push the strol er toward the locker room.</p><p>\u201cActual y,\u201d I say, \u201cIt eats a metal rod, made out of, like, lead. So basical y, we\u2019re learning how to poison babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRadical,\u201d JJ says as we approach the gym, where we find Ty standing with Kristen, talking and leaning against the wal . When Ty sees me, he pushes away from the wal and comes over, leaving Kristen standing alone. What were they talking about? God, why didn\u2019t I just kiss him yesterday? Then I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about why he was talking to the floozy that is Kristen Markum.</p><p>\u201cYo, guys,\u201d Ty says, peering down into the strol er.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel is that thing? Satan\u2019s spawn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better watch it!\u201d Henry says. He puts on a serious face, throws an arm around my shoulders, and pul s me in close. \u201cThat\u2019s our child you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiles, then looks at Jerry Rice. \u201cIts eyes are seriously creeping me out. And I knew something was going on between you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Henry says. \u201cWoods is my husband, and I\u2019m her wife.\u201d</p><p>Carter and JJ start laughing again, and then walk off through the gym to the locker room, leaving just me, Ty, Henry, and Jerry Rice. Oh, and the awful Kristen Markum, who barely qualifies as a human being.</p><p>\u201cWoods? Do you have a sec?\u201d Ty asks.</p><p>\u201cWoods? Do you have a sec?\u201d Ty asks.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d Ty eyes Henry and Jerry Rice, and I jerk my head at Henry.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Henry says, rol ing his eyes. \u201cDivorce me if you must, Woods. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve only been married half an hour and I\u2019m already a single parent.\u201d Ty holds the door to the gym open so Henry can get the strol er through. I giggle at the sight of him carrying those diaper bags across the gym. Kristen is stil standing there glaring at me with crossed arms, looking megajealous.</p><p>\u201cKristen\u2014I\u2019l talk to you later,\u201d Ty says, brushing his hair off his forehead. \u201cWoods and I need to talk footbal .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d she says, suddenly smiling and bobbing up and down on her toes. \u201cBye, Ty!\u201d She gives him a hug and takes off down the hal way.</p><p>Trying not to barf, I ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about yesterday...how I just slammed the door of your truck and al . And I didn\u2019t even thank you for taking me to the game. It was one of the best days of my life.\u201d</p><p>Stuffing my hands into the back pockets of my jeans, I nod a single nod. \u201cNo prob. Ready for practice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d he says, putting a hand up to my shoulder, stopping me. Is he going to try to kiss me again? \u201cUm, are you and Henry, um...you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. We\u2019ve been best friends for, like, ten years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...got it. Sometimes it just seems like you\u2019re more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be bad if Henry and I were more?\u201d</p><p>He brushes his hair away again, then rubs his neck. Motioning for me to fol ow him into the gym, he takes off toward the left, toward the guys\u2019 locker room, and I move right, toward the girls\u2019. He cal s out, \u201cYeah, it would be very bad.\u201d</p><p>After throwing on al my pads, practice uniform, and cleats, I grab my helmet and jog out to the field, looking for Henry and our fake baby, Jerry Rice. I spot Henry up in the stands, talking to Mom. He\u2019s holding the fake baby out to her. She starts laughing and takes the dol from his hands and holds it by an arm. I see him waving his arms at her, as if he\u2019s freaking out over how she\u2019s holding the fake baby. He takes the baby back from her and then motions for her to make a cradle with her arms. She laughs again, then makes a fake cradle, and Henry sets the dol down in her arms. She shakes her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As idiotic as this assignment is, I can\u2019t help but smile at their exchange. Henry is the funniest guy I know, the funniest person I\u2019ve ever met. Only he would pretend to take this assignment so seriously. I jog up into the metal bleachers, taking two steps at a time until I reach Mom and Henry.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Jordan, you didn\u2019t tel me I was going to be a grandmother,\u201d Mom says, flashing a smile at Henry.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know either,\u201d I say. \u201cHenry hid the pregnancy from me. Do you mind watching that creepy thing during practice, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Henry grabs his chest. \u201cThat creepy thing is our son, Woods.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Mom says. She nods at something over my shoulder. \u201cLooks like Coach Mil er wants you two down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom!\u201d Henry says. It seems that Jerry Rice has put Henry back in a good mood again. He throws an arm around me as we walk back toward the field.</p><p>\u201cSo, what did Ty want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo thank me for taking him to the game yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he whispers.</p> <p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your wife, you can talk to me, Woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday, when I dropped him off at home, he, like, um, leaned in for a kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I, uh, told him I had to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kiss?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Henry grabs my elbow, stopping us from going farther. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do that? Don\u2019t you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...I was scared, I guess. I dunno.\u201d I stare down at a piece of gum that\u2019s melted onto the metal bleachers.</p><p>\u201cDe-nied,\u201d Henry says. \u201cGod, I can\u2019t even imagine leaning in for a kiss and getting rejected. Ty must feel like shit today.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, I grunt.</p><p>\u201cSo did he try to kiss you again just now? Or talk to you about the non-kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014he wanted to know if we\u2019re together,\u201d I say, laughing loudly and using my thumb to point from Henry back to me.</p><p>\u201cYou and me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he wanted to know if you and I are dating. I told him we\u2019re best friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he definitely wants you.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Henry sideways. His face is blank, like no smile or anything. \u201cYou think?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Henry looks from my face back to the field, and his eyes pop open wide. I turn to see why he\u2019s gaping: JJ</p><p>and Carter are messing around, trying to shove a scrawny wide receiver into Jerry Rice\u2019s strol er.</p><p>\u201cJJ!\u201d Henry yel s, \u201cYou can\u2019t fit a freshman in that strol er.\u201d</p><p>Later that night, after a couple hours at the batting cages with Carter and JJ, Henry and I are in my basement having a mad foosbal tournament. It\u2019s best three out of five games. I\u2019ve won two; he\u2019s won one. In the current game, game four, I\u2019m kicking his ass. Jerry Rice, with his creepy eyes wide open, is sleeping quietly in his strol er. Monday Night Football is blaring on the big-screen television in the corner. We\u2019re watching the Jets/Dolphins game and rooting for the Dolphins, of course.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay over tonight?\u201d Henry asks. Light from the television bathes his blond curls, making them shimmer.</p><p>\u201cCourse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure it\u2019l be easier for us to take care of Jerry Rice that way,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can alternate the middle of the night feedings.\u201d He twirls the bar, hitting the tiny white bal into my goal.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you taking this so seriously? We could leave Jerry Rice in my truck overnight so we wouldn\u2019t have to hear him cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a good grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did total y botch that corn bread assignment.\u201d I hit the bal toward Henry\u2019s goal, and his little wooden goalie blocks it. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got an F in corn bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people can make it through life without having to be good at making corn bread. Being a parent is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, knowing how much my dad can suck sometimes. Henry and I are both lucky to have such great moms. At least Henry\u2019s dad isn\u2019t an asshole\u2014</p><p>he\u2019s just never home. Like my dad, Mr. Henry hasn\u2019t been to one of our footbal games in forever.</p><p>I slam the bal into Henry\u2019s goal, winning the game. I throw my hands above my head and strut around the room, victorious. Cupping my hands around my mouth, I make fake crowd noises. \u201cAnd Woods wins it al !\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet! You\u2019re going to wake the baby,\u201d Henry says with a laugh. He flops down on one of the leather sofas and picks up his glass of lemonade. I pour myself another glass, then grab a few chocolate-chip cookies, sit down, and prop myself up against him. He wraps an arm around me, leans over, and grabs a cookie from my hand with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cThief!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPig!\u201d</p><p>The middle of the night rols around, and Jerry Rice is screaming. Henry\u2019s bare feet are in my face, so I knock them out of the way as I sit up. Jumping out of bed, I grab the stupid dol from its strol er and force the lead rod into its mouth. Then I plop back down on the bed. It turns out that you can\u2019t just leave the key in its mouth. You have to, like, hold the fake baby at the same time or it wil keep crying.</p><p>I sit back against my headboard and hold the dol in my arms. If I didn\u2019t have the fake baby right now, I\u2019d total y be writing in my journal about Henry.</p><p>He\u2019s fast asleep, curled up at the other end of my bed, looking peaceful. The expression on his face says he\u2019s not real y sad, and he\u2019s not overcompensating for his sadness by acting al crazy or sil y, he\u2019s just...</p><p>content. And that makes me glad, because more than anything else, I want him to be happy. Part of me doesn\u2019t even want him to wake up, because I know he\u2019l eventual y go back to being depressed about Carrie, or whatever the hel he\u2019s depressed about. If only he\u2019d talk to me...maybe I could help.</p><p>My head droops down, and I accidental y drop the metal rod and Jerry Rice starts crying again. Henry stirs. Sitting up, the bedcovers fal down to reveal the plastic footbal charm and his six-pack.</p><p>Is Ty\u2019s body that perfect? I wonder how many times Kristen has already seen his abs...</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Woods?\u201d Henry says, rubbing his eyes with fists.</p><p>\u201cI dropped the metal rod, that\u2019s al .\u201d I cradle the stupid dol again.</p><p>Henry crawls up and throws an arm around me, pul ing me in tight. Closing my eyes as I lean against his shoulder, it occurs to me that Henry is going to be a great dad one day. Not unsupportive like my dad or nonexistent like his.</p><p>Just a real y great dad.</p><p>opportunity</p><p>the count? 12 days until alabama</p><p>It\u2019s Thursday, and as is tradition, JJ and I are sitting at Joe\u2019s Al -You-Can-Eat Pasta Shack. I\u2019m playing the salt-and-pepper-shaker game and JJ is scribbling in his crossword-puzzle book.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re already doing a photo shoot for Alabama,\u201d JJ says. \u201cCrazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>JJ jots on the puzzle and asks, \u201cReady for the game?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, yawning. \u201cI\u2019m tired from dealing with stupid Jerry Rice al week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is that baby of yours?\u201d JJ asks, looking under the table, as if I\u2019d actual y put a baby down there.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with his mother, who\u2019s probably sleeping with Marie Baird right now.\u201d I rol my eyes as I stack the pepper on top of the salt.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a damn nice piece of ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a pig, JJ.\u201d I pul salt out from under pepper, which fal s to the table perfectly.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he says, before burying his nose in the crossword puzzle again.</p><p>I\u2019m so sick of Henry\u2019s mood swings and his sleeping around, but I won\u2019t mention that to JJ. Two nights this week, Henry showed up at my house past midnight and crawled into my bed. I told him that I\u2019l kick his ass if we play like shit tomorrow night, because I haven\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in over a week, thanks to Jerry Rice\u2019s constant crying and my being stressed out by both Ty and Henry.</p><p>It\u2019s like JJ knows what I\u2019m thinking, because he looks up from his crossword-puzzle book, smiles wickedly, and says, \u201cYou hooking up with Ty Green yet?\u201d</p><p>Stacking pepper on top of salt, I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>JJ furrows his eyebrows. \u201cWel , why the hel not? I thought you guys were gonna start going at it in the owner\u2019s box on Sunday. You couldn\u2019t keep your hands off each other.\u201d</p><p>Shit. It was that obvious?</p><p>Honestly, I\u2019ve been avoiding Ty since Monday, and he\u2019s backed off. Hasn\u2019t approached me in days, which is kinda good, but kinda sucks ass at the same time. I sit up straight and say, \u201cTy\u2019s already hooked up with Kristen, and he can get whatever he wants from 99.9</p><p>percent of the girls at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why should I be any different? I don\u2019t wanna be another random girl to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with just fooling around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of al , we\u2019re on the same team, and second, unlike you and Henry, I\u2019m not a man-whore and wouldn\u2019t want to be a one-night stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019l kick his ass if he does that to you,\u201d JJ</p><p>growls, clutching his pen.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d I say, putting my hands up in the air as if I\u2019m being arrested. \u201cLook, I\u2019m just going to focus on playing bal . Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, Woods...\u201d JJ grins slightly and shakes his head.</p><p>I fold my arms across my chest. \u201cGetting a col ege scholarship should be my number one priority, not hooking up.\u201d</p><p>JJ keeps smiling at his crossword book, obviously trying not to laugh at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s a four-letter word for a soothing plant?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, I say, \u201cI dunno...weed?\u201d</p><p>He points the pen at me. \u201cRight on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d I ask, staring at myself in the mirror.</p><p>One of the Coffee Calendar makeup artists has completely straightened my hair\u2014it fal s down my back like a stream of water from a faucet. And now the lady\u2019s dabbing foundation al over my face. Another woman brushes some pink shit onto my lips.</p><p>\u201cPerfectly sure,\u201d the woman replies. \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?

Or in the case of these clothes, dressing down, meaning barely wearing anything.</p><p>But if this is what the Alabama athletic director wants, this is what he\u2019l get.</p><p>I walk into the bathroom and put on the jersey and short shorts, and then walk back out into the locker room, where I find Carrie and Marie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They both take a step back when they see me.</p><p>\u201cWow, Jordan,\u201d Carrie says. \u201cYour face looks real y pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d Marie asks, staring at my thighs.</p><p>I shrug, feeling my face burn.

I spot Ty looking at my legs.</p><p>\u201cYou look smoking hot, Woods!\u201d a junior varsity guy shouts, and then another JV guy echoes that horrific sentiment before Carter and JJ step in front of them.

I\u2019m happy to do this for my future team.\u201d</p><p>Henry nods slowly and pats my shoulder. \u201cOkay...\u201d</p><p>He looks kinda down, so I say, \u201cYou look tal er without a Baby Bj\u00f6rn strapped to your chest, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss that Jerry Rice. He made me into a chick magnet,\u201d Henry says, grinning. \u201cAnd Ms. Bonner told me that you and I made the highest grade in the whole class. We were excel ent parents.\u201d He nods seriously, and I shove his chest, shaking my head and laughing.</p><p>\u201cPicture time,\u201d I say, nodding my head at the photographer.</p><p>He starts to walk back to the team, but then turns and says, \u201cYour hair looks great.\u201d</p> <p>says, \u201cYour hair looks great.\u201d</p><p>I smile at him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with,\u201d I say to the photographer.

I\u2019l do whatever I have to do to play bal for Alabama...but this feels so wrong.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe the guys are stil whistling and disrespecting me like this.</p><p>But when I glance over at the team, I find JJ has taken his jersey off and is modeling for the guys. His extra weight flops around as he struts up and down the sideline with his jersey thrown over his shoulder.

It\u2019s the Saturday night after our game versus Stones River and my parents are out of town for my dad\u2019s game in Jacksonvil e on Sunday, so I invited JJ, Carter, and Henry over to hang out, and they freaking showed up with Lacey, Kristen, Marie, Carrie...and Ty.</p><p>JJ and Carter stuff their hands in the pockets of their jeans and turn to stare at Henry.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are such great friends,\u201d Henry says. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you threw me under the bus that is Jordan Woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cal me a bus! That makes me sound fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you care if you\u2019re fat?\u201d Henry asks. He smiles and glances from me to Ty and back to me again. \u201cYou know, Woods, I\u2019l keep saying it until you believe it\u2014you\u2019d like Marie if you\u2019d just give her a chance.\u201d</p><p>A little embarrassed at being cal ed out by Henry, I shrug. \u201cYeah, she does seem pretty cool in music appreciation.\u201d</p><p>Henry moves close to my ear and whispers, \u201cWhy does it matter if the cheerleaders are here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe giggling gets on my nerves,\u201d I reply, but the truth is, I don\u2019t want Kristen around Ty.</p><p>\u201cIf I ask them not to giggle, can they stay?\u201d</p><p>JJ gives me a pathetic puppy dog face that\u2019s just screaming, \u201cI need to get laid, please let them stay.\u201d</p><p>Carter mimics JJ\u2019s \u201cI want to get laid\u201d face even though he\u2019s not dating any of these girls, has never gotten laid, and has never once actual y mentioned that he wants to get laid.</p><p>Ty looks at me and shrugs.</p><p>I don\u2019t want the guys to leave, especial y Ty. \u201cFine. They can stay. But under no circumstances wil anyone make out on my bed or touch any of my personal possessions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShucks,\u201d JJ says. \u201cI only came \u2019cause I thought I\u2019d get to fool around on your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an ass,\u201d I say, grabbing a soda from the fridge as Carrie comes into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d she says, \u201cDo you have any Tylenol? I\u2019ve got a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I reply, gesturing for her to fol ow me upstairs.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Carter asks as he cups her elbow with a hand. \u201cNeed a ride home or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cool, but thanks,\u201d she says to Carter, grinning as she fol ows me. As soon as we\u2019re in the bathroom and I\u2019m rooting around in the medicine cabinet, Carrie shuts the door and whispers, \u201cI don\u2019t need any Tylenol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to talk to you alone. What\u2019s going on with Ty?\u201d she squeals.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, come on. You like him, right?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and nod, averting my eyes.</p><p>She looks up at me and rubs my forearm. \u201cSo what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Why is everyone so interested in what happens with me and Ty? I feel like I\u2019m on one of those shitty reality shows like The Bachelorette or something. Unknotting my hair, I let it fal down my back. I grab a hairbrush, untangle my hair, and then pul it back up again as I decide what to tel Carrie.</p><p>\u201cUh, he tried to kiss me last week, and I didn\u2019t let him. What if he never tries again?\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s kind blue eyes shine as she smiles. \u201cHe wil .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, um, if he does, what do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Carrie asks, raising an</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Carrie asks, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>I purse my lips, incredibly embarrassed at having to ask. \u201cHow do I kiss him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pauses. \u201cWel , sit here,\u201d she says, pul ing the toilet seat down and patting it, tel ing me to sit. I take a seat and look up at Carrie. \u201cPretend I\u2019m Ty...so when he leans in, just sort of wrap your fingers around his neck like this.\u201d She takes my hand and puts it on the back of her neck. Jesus, this must be the weirdest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.</p><p>She leans in as if she\u2019s going to kiss me. \u201cWhen his lips touch yours, just start touching him everywhere. His back, his jaw, his neck, his cheeks, his hips. Move your hands slowly, but keep him guessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d I say, taking my hand off her neck.</p><p>\u201cAnd then use lots of lip, not so much tongue.\u201d She kisses the back of her hand, demonstrating for me.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d I say, but skip the part where I make out with my hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d I exclaim. It seems so much more complicated on TV.</p><p>\u201cYup, now go get \u2019em,\u201d she says, sounding just like Coach when he gives us pep talks before games. I\u2019m surprised she doesn\u2019t slap my ass too.</p><p>Carrie and I walk back into the family room, where I sit down in my dad\u2019s favorite armchair and pop open my Diet Coke.</p><p>\u201cI love your house, Jordan,\u201d Marie says, looking around. \u201cThanks so much for inviting us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m getting to see your dad\u2019s Heismans,\u201d she says, gawking at the trophies on the shelf. She walks over and peers up at them. \u201cMy dad and brother wil be so jealous.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows at Henry, who shrugs and smiles. Al right, Marie does seem nice and sweet. Henry sits down on the floor and pul s her onto his lap. He whispers in her ear and kisses her cheek, and she giggles. He seems happy tonight, so that makes me happy. Carrie smiles at them, but I can tel she\u2019s stil hurt. I\u2019m dying to know why they broke up.</p><p>JJ sits with Lacey, and Carter sits with Carrie, probably because she\u2019s the only option left besides Kristen, who\u2019s stil eyeing Ty with a shitload of interest. When Ty picks a seat, I notice he sits as far away from Kristen as possible, but she crawls over next to him anyway.</p><p>With everyone else paired off into couples, I feel like a ninth wheel.</p><p>\u201cWho wants a drink?\u201d Lacey asks, pul ing these lame pi\u00f1a colada wine coolers out of her bag and passing them out to the other girls.</p><p>JJ moves to grab one, but I shake my head at him. I don\u2019t care if my team drinks, but they\u2019re not drinking on my watch.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have brought something good?\u201d Carter asks Lacey. \u201cLike a nice Pinot Grigio or a Chianti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Pinot Grigio,\u201d Carrie replies.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel are you talking about?\u201d I ask Carter.</p><p>\u201cChianti? How could that possibly compare with a Slurpee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear, hear,\u201d Marie says, and we grin at each other before she takes a sip of her wine cooler. I laugh when she grimaces.</p><p>Ty\u2019s leaning up against a leather sofa with Kristen nestled up next to him. She\u2019s beaming, but he\u2019s staring at his fingernails. Then he peers over at me and I turn away as fast as I can and focus on the clown fish in our tank.</p><p>JJ and Henry are looking at me with eyes wide open, shaking their heads. Carrie whispers something in Carter\u2019s ear, and he starts nodding and laughing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTruth or dare time,\u201d Carrie says.

He sticks his tongue out and pretends to gag, then smiles.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty blurts, looking from Henry\u2019s face to mine and back again.</p><p>\u201cIt was awful, man,\u201d Henry says, cracking up. \u201cWoods beat the shit out of me in the closet. She gave me a black eye.\u201d</p><p>Ty starts laughing and grins at the carpet.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Lacey says, holding up her hands trying to calm us down. \u201cCarter\u2014truth or dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare.\u201d</p> <p>Staring at the ceiling, Lacey cocks her head. \u201cI dare you to hump the Heisman Trophy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacrilege!\u201d Henry yel s.</p><p>\u201cThat trophy is not on the table!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body!\u201d JJ exclaims, glaring at Lacey as if she\u2019s just kil ed Peyton Manning.</p><p>\u201cGeez, sorry, guys,\u201d Lacey replies. She scoots away from JJ, putting a good foot between them. \u201cIt\u2019s just a trophy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is not just a trophy,\u201d Ty says, glancing up at my face.</p> <p>\u201cPick a different dare, honey,\u201d JJ says. Grinning, she unscoots and moves to sit on JJ\u2019s lap. He gives Lacey\u2019s hip a quick squeeze.</p><p>Honey?</p><p>Obviously he knows he\u2019s not getting any tonight unless he\u2019s nice and supportive, but honestly? So what if her waist is the size of a green bean and her breasts are like cantaloupes? Her brain is the size of an M&amp;M.</p><p>\u201cHump the Heisman Trophy, my ass,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lacey says, tapping her lip with a finger.</p><p>\u201cCarter, I dare you to make out with Carrie.\u201d</p><p>Carter raises his eyebrows at Henry, who shrugs. This surprises me, because even though he says he\u2019s not upset about Carrie, I total y thought he was depressed because she broke up with him. So why would he be okay with her kissing one of his best friends?</p><p>Then Carter turns to face Carrie. She smiles and lets out a short burst of laughter, then leans back on her hands and crosses her ankles in front of her. Carter coughs into a fist and kisses her quickly on the lips. When he pul s away, they smile at each other for a few seconds. It\u2019s actual y kind of cute, and I wonder if Ty would smile at me like that after a kiss. If I had just let him kiss me last week, maybe I\u2019d know.</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t making out!\u201d Lacey squeals.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Carter says, ignoring Lacey. \u201cJJ\u2014truth or dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your favorite NFL team?\u201d</p><p>Lacey snorts. \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>JJ strokes his chin and pretends to take a long time choosing an answer. A minute later, he folds his hands.</p><p>\u201cUh, I guess I\u2019l have to go with the Titans.\u201d</p><p>Lacey throws a pil ow at Carter, who puts his hands up in a gesture that says, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKristen\u2014truth or dare?\u201d JJ asks.</p><p>\u201cDare,\u201d Kristen replies, gazing at Ty.</p><p>\u201cI dare you to go in the kitchen and make me a steak and mashed potatoes, woman. Medium-wel , please. Steak\u2019s in the freezer!\u201d</p><p>Henry dies laughing, rol ing over onto the floor, clutching his stomach.</p><p>\u201cJerks,\u201d Marie and Carrie say, shaking their heads.</p><p>\u201cYou chauvinist pig,\u201d I say to JJ, who starts laughing just as hard as Henry, which makes me laugh, which makes Ty laugh.</p><p>Then he and I stare at each other, laughing.</p><p>Kristen clearly sees this and sighs loudly. She glares Kristen clearly sees this and sighs loudly. She glares at me and then stands up, puts her hands on her hips and stalks toward the kitchen. I hear her banging around in there, rattling pans and opening and shutting the fridge.</p><p>\u201cJordan\u2014truth or dare?\u201d Kristen cal s out from the kitchen. I hear her slamming a pan down on the stove. Then I hear drawers and cabinets opening and slamming shut.</p><p>Truth is always God-awful, but what if she dares me to spend the rest of the night alone in my room, or dares me to leave my own house so she and Ty can be al alone? Shit.</p><p>\u201cDare,\u201d I reply.</p><p>Kristen, now wearing an apron, pokes her head back in the family room. \u201cI dare you to jump into the lake.\u201d</p><p>I stand up. This dare is a cinch.</p><p>\u201cIn your underwear,\u201d Kristen adds, pointing at my body with a spatula.</p><p>Crap. Which underwear am I wearing? Do they even match my bra? Do they look...gross? I think I\u2019m wearing plain white underwear. God, I don\u2019t want Ty to see me in ugly underwear. I cover my face with my hands. I just need to get this over with, so I sprint out my back door to the dock.</p><p>I jump into the freezing water, which reeks of algae and fish. I love it. The cool water lowers my temperature and makes my racing heart slow down.</p><p>I look down at my plain white tank and boy shorts, which are sticking to me like a wet paper towel clinging to spilt Coke on a kitchen floor. Why can\u2019t I just wear pretty underwear like the cheerleaders? It\u2019s not like the team would ever have to know...</p><p>I submerge my body in the water up to my neck so no one can see me. Hopeful y everyone wil take my clothes lying on the docks as proof that I\u2019m in my underwear. A minute goes by, but no one comes out. Then, il uminated by light from my house, darting through the trees, I see him walking toward me. Just him. Just Ty.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cHow\u2019s the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreezing. Where\u2019s everybody else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them that if they want to keep their arms, they wouldn\u2019t come out here.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYou told them you\u2019d pul their arms from their sockets?\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you, Mr. Measly Quarterback, expect to do anything to JJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine I could do some damage if I were mad enough.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cKeep tel ing yourself that. Thanks for scaring them off. Turn around so I can get out and get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stares straight into my eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t scare them off for you. I did it for me. I\u2019m coming in with you.\u201d</p><p>He pul s off his shirt and kicks off his flip-flops. His body is perfect, chiseled like a statue. He begins to unbuckle his belt and unzip his jeans, and I twirl around in the water. I gaze across the lake at the distant shore, trying to focus on the trees, the sand, the rocks, anything.</p><p>I hear a splash. The water moves toward me.</p><p>Suddenly I feel his hands wrap around me from behind. He rests his forehead on my back. \u201cGod, it\u2019s cold,\u201d he says. \u201cWarm me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy have you been avoiding me?\u201d</p><p>Trembling, I take a rattled breath. \u201cTy, I need to stay focused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I causing you to lose focus?\u201d He laughs.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you I\u2019ve already lost al focus because of you?\u201d He rests his chin on my shoulder and glances at my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re screwing with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Being around you is like drinking a shot of whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel drunk when you\u2019re around me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an understatement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto.\u201d</p><p>He drags his hands across my stomach, dipping a fingertip into my bel y button, and I feel his mouth on my shoulder. My brain tel s me to run\u2014to forget about this. But my body tel s my brain to shut the hel up.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He turns me around, causing ripples in the water, and then his mouth is on mine. Our first kiss explodes like mixing soda and pop rocks. His soft lips feel better than I ever imagined. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing with my lips or my tongue, so I try to fol ow his lead and let him do the work. I hope my lips don\u2019t feel like limp spaghetti.</p><p>Soon, I\u2019m figuring out how to kiss\u2014he runs his tongue along my lips, so I bite his lower lip in response. tongue along my lips, so I bite his lower lip in response. He laughs. I inch my fingertips across his shoulders and elbows as I move my mouth to his throat.</p><p>He whispers, \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I\u2019m not so scared anymore. If he likes me for who I am, it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of underwear I\u2019m wearing. Or that I\u2019m not wearing makeup. Or that I\u2019m over six feet tal . \u201cYou\u2019re real y cute too,\u201d I say, giving him another kiss on the lips, digging my fingertips into his abs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted anyone so much in my life.\u201d</p><p>I moan softly as he kisses my neck, right beneath my ear, in return. \u201cYou want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery bit of you,\u201d he mumbles. Taking my hands in his, his eyes find mine. He caresses the tops of my hands with his thumbs. He says, \u201cRace me across the lake?\u201d</p><p>Al I want is to feel his body against mine, but I can\u2019t resist a chal enge. \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d I take off swimming, having done this a hundred times in my life. I know I can swim the length of the lake in about two minutes. I easily beat him, pul myself onto the banks, and lie down on a soft mossy patch, so green it\u2019s almost like lying on Astroturf, only without the rug burns.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve told me you\u2019re a female Michael Phelps before I made an ass of myself,\u201d he says, smiling as he drags himself out of the lake. He shakes the water out of his hair.</p><p>He lies down next to me, leaning on an elbow, his eyes scanning my body. He doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with my soggy underwear. Has a teenage girl ever felt less sexy than I do now?</p><p>I shiver when he runs a finger across my bare stomach, right above the elastic of my boy shorts, before exploring my body with his lips. I weave my hands through his hair, then pul him up so he\u2019s facing me, and he smiles. He nudges my nose with his. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>We kiss some more, and while gasping for breath, I reply, \u201cI\u2019m al yours.\u201d</p><p>rumors</p><p>the count? 8 days until alabama</p><p>I\u2019m hiding out in a bathroom stal at school on Monday morning. Except for Ty, I haven\u2019t seen anyone since Saturday night, and I\u2019m not looking forward to al the questions that are undoubtedly coming. Like, where did Ty and I disappear to? And what\u2019s going on between us? I don\u2019t even know the answer to that one. Do \u201cI want you,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m al yours,\u201d mean we\u2019re official y dating now? Or was I just a random hook up?</p><p>Right as I\u2019m about to stand up and leave the bathroom, I hear the door opening and shutting.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Kris,\u201d says a girl.</p><p>I peer through the crack in the stal and see Lacey and Kristen staring in the mirror as they start to apply lip gloss and fluff their hair.</p><p>\u201cHow can I not worry about it? Of al girls, he ditched me for Jordan Woods. Wel , if you consider her a girl. Gross,\u201d Kristen says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he likes her,\u201d Lacey replies. \u201cHe just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he just wants to screw her because she\u2019s a virgin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah...maybe.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. Kristen\u2019s going to tel the whole school that I disappeared with Ty on Saturday. It\u2019s seventh grade al over again.</p><p>Wait, what if they\u2019re right? What if Ty only wants to devirginize me? But how would he even know? It\u2019s not like Lacey and Kristen know everything. I could\u2019ve screwed Mike\u2019s friend Jake Reynolds, and they\u2019d never know.</p><p>\u201cSo what do I do?\u201d Kristen says.</p> <p>\u201cPlay it cool. I don\u2019t think he\u2019l stay interested in Jordan for too long\u2014especial y not when he sees how much time she spends with Sam Henry. JJ told me that Sam stays over at her house al the time. Like in the same bed!\u201d</p><p>Kristen gasps. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s so weird. Maybe she\u2019s not a virgin, after al . Maybe she\u2019s a slut.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, Henry\u2019s like my brother\u2014don\u2019t they know that? Rather than deal with these awful girls face-toface, I decide to stay in the stal until they leave. And then I\u2019m getting the hel out of here. I\u2019d rather skip school than deal with the aftermath of Saturday night. When they\u2019re gone, I tiptoe out of the bathroom and head for the front doors of the school. Halfway there, I see Marie, who rushes up to me, smiling. \u201cJordan! Oh my God\u2014you and Ty? You\u2019re so lucky.\u201d</p><p>I feel bad for ignoring her because she\u2019s actual y nice, but I can\u2019t deal. Seriously.</p><p>Other girls in the hal way stop moving when they see me, giggling and whispering to each other.</p> <p>Bates and Higgins walk up. \u201cYo, Woods,\u201d they say.</p><p>\u201cGreat game Friday,\u201d Bates adds, knocking fists with me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a shoo-in for Alabama,\u201d Higgins says, resting his arm on my shoulder. \u201cI hope you\u2019l put in a good word for me.\u201d</p><p>Thank God\u2014they don\u2019t mention the hideous photo shoot either. Then a few other guys pass me and say hi, acting normal. But al the girls stare.</p><p>Then I see JJ, who walks right up and grabs my elbow. \u201cAre you okay? Because if you aren\u2019t, I\u2019m gonna kick that pretty boy\u2019s ass. Right now.\u201d</p><p>What? JJ, Mr. \u201cIf You Share Your Feelings with Me I\u2019l Snap Your Head Off,\u201d is concerned about my love life?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I tel JJ, \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel good. I\u2019m gonna go home.\u201d I take off again, and then I see him. Ty. Coming toward me and smiling. He waves. And I sprint for the front door.</p><p>Now I\u2019m hiding in the potting shed, alternating between writing in my journal and repeatedly tossing a footbal up in the air and catching it. I like it in here. Makes me feel like a kid again, without any of these problems. After throwing the bal up and catching it for the thousandth time, I wedge the flashlight under my chin and begin to write:</p><p>The whole school knows about Saturday night</p><p>Saturday, disappearing with Ty was the right decision Right as eating peanuts at a baseball game</p><p>Right as the sound of coffee grinding on Saturday morning Today? Confused as hell</p><p>I can\u2019t believe how much I\u2019m beginning to love writing. Not just getting thoughts out of my head, but the chal enge of finding creative words and rhythms and fun descriptions.</p><p>Right as the smell of smoke following fireworks Stil , writing\u2019s a weak thing to be doing. At least compared to playing quarterback. Or eating those scalding 911 wings that made me and Ty cry at the Titans game.</p><p>The door to the shed suddenly slams open and Henry crawls in next to me, watching as I hide my journal behind a watering can.</p> <p>Running a hand through his curly blond hair, Henry hip-checks me and presses his shoulder against mine.</p><p>\u201cYo, Woods\u2014how could you miss practice? You have the plague or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I do, you\u2019ve got it now too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you skip school?\u201d</p><p>We lean back against the shed wal , and I curl up under his arm and drop the footbal onto his lap. Faint sunlight shimmers through the grimy window.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause people were talking about me in the hal way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s never happened to me before.\u201d</p><p>Henry pul s me in closer and rubs my arm as I go on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose the team\u2019s respect. If I lose my confidence, I\u2019m going to play like shit, and shitty players don\u2019t get offered spots on Division I teams like Alabama.\u201d</p><p>His eyes focus on mine and we stare at each other for a while. With his tan skin and emerald eyes, Henry is an extremely cute guy, and it occurs to me how many girls at school would love to find themselves in a potting shed with him. Then he says, \u201cWant to play the hand-slap game?\u201d</p><p>I sit Indian-style and Henry mimics me. He puts his hands out toward me, palms up. I place my hands on top of his. A second later, he yanks his hands out from beneath mine and tries to smack the tops of my hands, but I jerk away.</p><p>\u201cWinner gets the footbal charm, right?\u201d I ask, nodding at his chest.</p><p>\u201cHel no,\u201d Henry replies, not missing a beat. He puts his hands back out, and we play several more times before he speaks again. \u201cToday, in music appreciation class, Mr. Majors said we al have to choose an instrument and write a five-page paper about its origins. We also have to discuss the instrument\u2019s relevance in today\u2019s society. But don\u2019t worry, I signed you up for a great instrument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe harpsichord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel is a harpsichord?\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI saw it on a poster in the classroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be kidding. How could an instrument I\u2019ve never heard of have any relevance in today\u2019s society?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese things wouldn\u2019t happen if you didn\u2019t skip school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel , man? What instrument did you pick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel , man? What instrument did you pick?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cAn instrument that has a lot of relevance in today\u2019s society. The guitar.\u201d</p><p>I grin, slapping his hands hard. We play several more times, and I win more often than he does, which makes me happier.</p><p>\u201cWoods, it\u2019s okay to get involved with someone. You can date, you know.\u201d Instead of smacking Henry\u2019s hands again, I smack him upside the head. \u201cDamn it,\u201d</p><p>he exclaims, laughing. \u201cStop beating me up. Look, I\u2019m gonna tel you something, because you\u2019re my best friend. Underneath that crazy knot you cal hair, al us guys know you\u2019re real y a girl, and we want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>I knock him in the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious, Jordan. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re so scared of. I know you like Ty, and it\u2019s obvious he likes you, and you\u2019re al pushing him away...you\u2019re final y acting like a girl.\u201d</p><p>I glare at Henry.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cTy and I are on the same team, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDating him wil cause drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me that not dating him is what\u2019s causing the drama...you not showing up for practice, my ass...</p><p>Coach was worried and pissed, to be honest\u2014he tried cal ing, but got your voice mail.\u201d Henry stretches his palms back out for another round of the hand-slap game. I put my hands beneath his and two seconds later, I swiftly jerk my hands out and slap his hands hard.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d Henry asks.</p><p>\u201cSam...if I date him, no one\u2019s going to think I\u2019m, like, a slut or anything, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not...because I think you have to sleep with more than one person, possibly several, to be considered a slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would know,\u201d I reply with a laugh.</p><p>He clutches at his chest, but then says, \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a man-slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you guys have to sleep around al the time?</p><p>Why can\u2019t you just stay with one person?\u201d</p><p>Henry slaps my hands, then runs his hands through his hair and stares at a bag of mulch. \u201cI dunno...maybe I just haven\u2019t gotten with the right person yet. It\u2019s kind of hard to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo stop sleeping around?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get that, Henry.\u201d</p><p>He keeps focusing on the mulch. \u201cWhy would you ever think you\u2019re a slut?\u201d</p><p>I grab his hands and hold them tightly. Biting my lip, I find his eyes. \u201cI, um, heard Lacey and Kristen talking bad about me in the bathroom today. They wondered if I\u2019m a slut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just jealous of you, Woods. Why would you care what those girls think?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cThey also said the only reason Ty\u2019s interested in me is \u2019cause he wants to take my virginity, and that scares me...\u2019cause I almost gave it to him the other night.\u201d</p><p>Henry shuts his eyes for a sec. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie. He cares a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think JJ, Carter, and I had a talk with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoods, answer me...are you going to give Ty a chance?\u201d</p><p>I feel scared. I don\u2019t want the whole school talking about me and Ty. I don\u2019t want anyone cal ing me a slut. As captain of the footbal team, I can\u2019t lose the respect of the guys I lead. But my brother and Henry are also of the guys I lead. But my brother and Henry are also right\u2014a vision of me as a thirty-year-old virgin hasbeen quarterback flashes in my mind. I shudder. There must be a way for me to be both Ty\u2019s girlfriend and the star of the footbal team. Can\u2019t I have both?</p><p>I mean, the guys watched me do that ridiculous photo shoot and stil respected me afterward.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019l give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s al I needed to know,\u201d Henry says. He kisses my forehead, jumps to his feet, and stretches out a hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>We walk outside the potting shed, into a warm pink dusk, and I see Ty standing over next to the tire swing that hangs from an old ash tree. A breeze whips through the grass as I start making my way over to him.</p><p>\u201cSee you, Woods,\u201d Henry says, pul ing his keys from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not staying for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have a study date with Savannah Bailey. But Ty wil stay.\u201d</p><p>Henry disappears around the side of the house to the driveway, and I head over to Ty.</p><p>Smiling, he pushes the tire swing toward me, and I catch it and force it away from us. Then I hurl myself at him and he pul s me into his arms beneath the dripping green leaves.</p><p>I let him kiss me.</p><p>I\u2019m losing myself again, losing track of everything that\u2019s important to me. And the thought of that scares me too. I don\u2019t want to become one of those girls who loses al control and perspective because of a guy, but even this thought, this warning to myself, is being pushed out of my mind by Ty and his hands and his lips.</p><p>He whispers, \u201cLet\u2019s go to your room.\u201d</p><p>Our clothes are starting to come off.</p><p>Mom\u2019s volunteering at the hospital, and Dad\u2019s stil at practice, but I\u2019m not taking any chances. \u201cTy, hold up,\u201d I say, hopping out of bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Not answering, I shuffle across the room in my underwear, lock the door, and then rejoin him in my bed.</p><p>Things start getting even more intense, so intense we just know it\u2019s going to happen, so I say, \u201cDo you have something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>He leans over the side of my bed, reaches down to the floor, and grabs a condom from his jeans pocket. I\u2019m a bit scared, but this feels so right. He actual y likes me for me. And I just have to have him. Every bit of him. Now.</p><p>A little while later, we\u2019re stil clinging to each other under the covers.</p><p>\u201cWant to make this official?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Like be a couple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, smiling.</p><p>He brushes the hair out of my face with his pinky finger and cups my chin with his hand. I can\u2019t believe we just did it. It! It did hurt some, but it wasn\u2019t scary...it was...fun and sweet.</p><p>Now we\u2019re staring at each other and he keeps giving me little kisses. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt like this before,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cMe either. So why me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re strong and in control and different and mature. Why me?\u201d</p><p>Al I can think about is how hot he is, but then I say,</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re smart and cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he replies, tickling my stomach. \u201cThat\u2019s it? \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat more do you want?\u201d I reply, laughing as I squirm.</p><p>\u201cWell , Kristen Markum gave me a long handwritten note saying how much she wants me. Along with a picture.\u201d He raises his eyebrows at me and laughs.</p><p>\u201cUgh. I hate that girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cWel , besides the fact that she cal ed me a dyke and a slut and accused me of sleeping with JJ and Henry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKristen and I were okay friends growing up...and then in seventh grade, we were real y excited about going to the Christmas Dance.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wait\u2014I had these cool, red New Balances I was going to wear, and Kristen and I bought these matching red cashmere sweaters. I thought I might get to dance with this eighth grader who was kinda cute. Maybe even get my first kiss.</p><p>I go on, \u201cAnd then Carter asked Kristen to the dance, and she sort of laughed in his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He felt awful, so I got al the guys on my footbal team to boycott the dance, and I threw this awesome party in my basement instead. We had, like, awesome party in my basement instead. We had, like, a slasher movie marathon, and Dad made chili dogs and gave us root beer and told al the guys these epic footbal stories from when he played with Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin...and, wel , al the guys went back to school on Monday saying my party was better than any dance could ever be.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd al the girls at school were real y pissed at me</p><p>\u2019cause I\u2019d ruined the dance for them, and Kristen told everyone that I\u2019d boycotted the dance because no guy would ever want to dance with me.\u201d</p><p>Because I was taller than all the guys...and huge. Ugly.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d he says, turning to look at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve stil never been to a dance.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t tel Ty about how after Kristen said that, I decided being a guy was better, because none of my teammates would ever say anything so horrible to me. And none of them ever have.</p><p>\u201cWell , I would\u2019ve gone to your slasher-movie chili-dog party, \u2019cause you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Ty says, smiling. A knock sounds on the door, and I hear someone fiddling with the knob. Shit! I didn\u2019t think my parents would be home for another half hour! Then I rol over and look at the clock\u2014I total y lost track of time. I quickly start pul ing my clothes back on. Ty does the same and we\u2019re laughing at each other as we struggle with shirts and jeans and underwear.</p><p>I hear Mom say, \u201cJordan, what are you doing in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing...hanging out with Ty.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t hear her say anything else for a few seconds, but then she says, \u201cWel , come on down for dinner. Ty?</p><p>Can you stay? Mr. Woods wants to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Crap. I bite my fist and shake my head furiously at Ty, which doesn\u2019t deter him at al because he says, \u201cI would love that, Mrs. Woods. Thanks for inviting me.\u201d</p><p>He has this shit-eating grin on his face, so I punch him hard on the shoulder, and he fal s back onto my bed.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Woods. That hurt!\u201d</p><p>I smile at him as he puts his jeans on. After pul ing my hair back into a knot, we head downstairs, and I pray that Mom doesn\u2019t question why Ty and I were in my room with the door locked.</p><p>Sure enough, when she sees us come into the kitchen, she gives me a knowing look, but doesn\u2019t say a thing. I\u2019l be in for it later, though. She tel s me to carry the roast to the table and asks Ty to grab the gravy, which takes just about everything we\u2019ve got because we\u2019re giggling so hard.</p><p>But Ty stops giggling when we walk into the dining room, where Dad is already sitting with his signature bottle of Gatorade. Ty straightens up, seeming to grow by several inches, and wipes the smile off his face. After setting the gravy down on the table, Ty stretches out his hand to Dad and says, \u201cI\u2019m Tyler Green, sir. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Dad smiles and returns the handshake. \u201cDonovan Woods. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d Dad gestures at the seat to his immediate right, then points at Ty to sit in it. I sit down to Ty\u2019s right, poised to butcher the roast.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dad says to Ty, \u201cmy son tel s me you\u2019ve got a cannon for an arm.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiles slightly. \u201cOh, I\u2019m nothing compared to you and Mike.\u201d</p><p>What? No mention of me? Believe it or not, I can throw just as far and as hard as Mike. Doesn\u2019t Ty know that? Between me, Mike, and Ty, Ty\u2019s the obvious footbal prodigy. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so proud, but it would\u2019ve been nice to get some recognition from my new boyfriend.</p><p>Mom final y brings the corn and bread to the table, and we dig in.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for col ege?\u201d Dad asks Ty as</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for col ege?\u201d Dad asks Ty as he grabs some roast.</p><p>\u201cNo plans yet,\u201d Ty replies.</p><p>\u201cWhat col eges are you looking at? Which schools have contacted you so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone so far, sir.\u201d</p><p>Dad bites into a piece of bread, chews, and narrows his eyes. \u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>Ty glances at me and takes a deep breath, so I say,</p><p>\u201cJust drop it, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Dad glares at me. \u201cJordan, just because you have some competition for your position doesn\u2019t mean you should be selfish and ruin Ty\u2019s col ege aspirations. If he\u2019s better than you, like everyone\u2019s saying, you should be helping your teammate to get a good scholarship. Maybe you should tel Coach Mil er to give him more of your playing time.\u201d</p><p>Dad says these horrific things as easily as if he\u2019s buying a book of stamps at the post office.</p><p>I choke on my lemonade. Tears rush to my eyes as Ty pats me on the back.</p><p>\u201cDonovan, please,\u201d Mom says, pinching the bridge of her nose. \u201cJordan has earned her spot on that team. She deserves every second of playing time she gets.\u201d</p><p>Dad keeps chewing his bread. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Ty deserve a chance to play too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, you have no idea what you\u2019re even talking about. You don\u2019t even know Ty. And you never come to our games anyway.\u201d I turn to face my mother. \u201cMom, thank you for dinner. May I be excused?\u201d</p><p>Mom seems on the verge of tears. She nods slowly. Before I leave the room, I steal a peek at Dad, who is chewing on his roast. Does he even have a clue how much he just hurt me? He just embarrassed me in front of my brand new boyfriend. When I find Ty\u2019s face, it\u2019s impassive. Blank as a bed of snow. Is blank how he real y feels about me?</p><p>After running upstairs, I throw open my closet and pul out my trainers and put on some running clothes. I storm back through the house, peering into the dining room, and see that Ty\u2019s stil sitting there with my father, eating as though nothing just happened.</p><p>Running down the road in twilight, winding around the little curves near my house, jogging past the cow pastures and a rustic red barn, I keep waiting for Ty to sprint up behind me, announcing that he punched Dad in the face or something. I run for an hour, but Ty never comes sprinting after me.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but notice that, unlike Henry, Ty didn\u2019t tel my dad to shove it or stick up for me in any way. I get that Dad intimidates people, but how could Ty not say anything? I\u2019m his girlfriend! I just slept with him, and he just absorbed Dad\u2019s attack on me, acting like it didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t he be out here chasing after me?</p><p>revelations</p><p>the count? 7 days until alabama</p><p>After practice, I leave the locker room and I\u2019m heading to the parking lot when Carrie rushes up to me. I can see Ty standing next to my truck waiting on me, but I stop to find out what she wants.</p><p>\u201cCarter told me you and Ty are dating now\u2014I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he, like, an amazing kisser?\u201d</p><p>I smile and, without thinking, I blurt out, \u201cHe\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Okay, okay, it\u2019s kind of fun talking about Ty. It\u2019s not like JJ, Henry, or Carter would want to know how Ty\u2019s tongue feels.</p><p>Carrie returns my smile. \u201cSee, kissing\u2019s not that hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a great body too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan? You know you can talk to me, right? I\u2019d never repeat anything you say.\u201d</p><p>I glance at her and nod. It would be great to talk to her about everything, maybe even get some more pointers on what guys like. \u201cThanks, Carrie. Um, yeah, I had one question, but you can\u2019t tel a soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, wel , it, you know, sort of hurt. Does it always hurt? Because JJ and, um, Henry, say it feels great.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, shifting her bag on her shoulder. \u201cThe first time?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cSure, it hurts. But they\u2019re guys\u2014it always feels good to them. So you\u2019ve only done it once, then?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be so bad next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad the first time!\u201d We both crack up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Are you and Carter...?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cHe\u2019s cool, but I miss Sam, and I need to get over him before I try dating again.\u201d</p><p>The shock of this statement causes me to drop my bag. \u201cWhat? But you broke up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...I had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I say, putting a hand on my hip. I can\u2019t believe I trusted her and she doesn\u2019t seem to have any clue about anything.</p><p>\u201cJordan...I think you should talk to him about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s your fault you broke up!\u201d I\u2019m tempted to push Carrie to the ground and punch her face. Henry hasn\u2019t been himself at al since she dumped him, and here she is, saying she\u2019s stil into him! What. A. Skank. She tightens her ponytail, then peeks at me. \u201cHe wants to get back together with me, and you should know that I love him very much...but I can\u2019t be with a guy who doesn\u2019t love me back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?

Now we\u2019re sitting in my truck in his driveway, making out, but al I can think about is Henry. No, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m pretending to make out with Henry while kissing Ty; it\u2019s that I\u2019m wondering why he never told me about his feelings. Why didn\u2019t anyone tel me until after I got my first real boyfriend?</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he says, running his lips on my neck. It feels amazing. He goes up my shirt, and instead of losing myself in Ty, my mind wanders back to Henry again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta go over to Henry\u2019s house for a little while, but can I come back over here afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to go?\u201d He crawls on top of me and pul s on the lever that makes the seat lean back. There\u2019s a cracking sound, and we fal back along with the seat, laughing. I kiss him again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Henry,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is everything okay?\u201d He runs his hand over my hair. His eyes are so blue...I love them. I remember when I thought I would drown in them, but then I suddenly start thinking of Henry\u2019s green eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe left practice without saying anything today and that\u2019s weird, and he didn\u2019t pick up his phone when I cal ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2014I can go by myself.\u201d</p><p>Ty grabs my hand and squeezes it hard. \u201cI\u2019d feel better if I could go along.\u201d</p><p>I pul my hand from his grip. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like knowing where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l have my cel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l go along, and I\u2019l just wait outside for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, I\u2019m ful y capable of driving myself to my friend\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Ty says, kissing my forehead. He crawls off me and climbs out the driver\u2019s side door. Then he sticks his head back in the window and kisses me again. \u201cDon\u2019t stay gone too long. If you\u2019re not back here in two hours, I\u2019m coming after you with a search party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Ty says, shoving his hair off his forehead,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about yesterday...at dinner.\u201d</p><p>One big difference between Ty and Henry is that Henry wil always say what he thinks when he thinks it, but Ty always comes back to apologize later.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNo, not whatever. After you left, I was so angry, I explained my entire situation to your parents and let them know I just want to play footbal and hang out with you, but I\u2019m not going to take your position away from you.\u201d Ty strokes my jaw with a fingertip.</p><p>\u201cWhat did my parents say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad seemed furious about the wreck, and your mom seemed sad. She offered to pay for my mom\u2019s care, but I refused it.\u201d</p><p>I love my mom. She acts so selfless. \u201cWhy did you refuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need handouts, Woods. I just need to work hard and stay organized. But I do need a great girlfriend.\u201d He kisses me again, but my body doesn\u2019t melt or turn to rubber.</p><p>Is Ty right for me?</p><p>Before I go to Henry\u2019s trailer, I cal Mike on my cel. When he answers, I yel , \u201cCrisis major!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Jordan. What\u2019s goin\u2019 on? Is Dad acting like an asshole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...no. Wel , sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you guys are dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJJ cal ed me. And Mom thinks you\u2019re dating him, even if you haven\u2019t told her yet.

Didn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel are you talking about?\u201d I say, sighing.</p><p>\u201cJordan, he\u2019s loved you forever. It\u2019s obvious. Have you not seen how he stares at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...he\u2019s just...Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and I always thought you knew but weren\u2019t interested. Do you honestly think Mom and Dad would let him spend the night at our house if they thought you were into him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019m shocked; this feels crazy. How could I not have noticed? I thought we were just friends, that this is how our friendship is\u2014very touchy-feely and supportive. My friendships with JJ and Carter are different, because they aren\u2019t emotional. They aren\u2019t like Henry, who\u2019s ful of love and loyalty and sweetness. God, I sound like a girl.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Mike says, \u201cnow that you know, what are you going to do? Do you like him at al ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great guy, Jor, and a great friend. Don\u2019t mess with his heart. You have to be up-front with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wil . I\u2019m going to see him right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCal me after, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay,\u201d I reply. Then I bang my head on the steering wheel.</p><p>I ring the doorbel, and Henry\u2019s youngest sister, who\u2019s only four, opens the door. When she sees it\u2019s me, she yel s, \u201cJordan!\u201d and grabs my leg. Mrs. Henry smiles and after detaching her daughter from me, she gives me a hug and smooths my hair. I always get the feeling she\u2019s dying to grab a hairbrush and a curling iron and give me a makeover.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Mrs. H.? Where is he?\u201d I say, waving at his other sister, who\u2019s twelve.</p><p>\u201cIn his room. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s feeling wel .\u201d She stares down the hal way; her face is a shadow of concern and sadness. I know she and her husband do their best for their kids, but it\u2019s definitely been tough for Henry, what with me and Carter, two rich kids of NFL</p><p>players, for best friends.</p><p>Without another word, I go to his room and stand outside the door. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to say, or how to find out if he\u2019s actual y in love with me. How long has this been going on anyway?</p><p>Final y, I decide to go in. I knock, open the door, and find him lying facedown. It\u2019s like his head is being swal owed by the pil ow. He turns to face me and his blond curls flop al over the place.</p><p>\u201cYo, Woods,\u201d he says, rol ing over to make room for me on his twin bed. It\u2019s tight quarters for two buff footbal players, both over six feet tal . I have no idea what I\u2019m doing, but I lie down next to him and examine al the glow-in-the-dark stars stuck to his ceiling. I cough. \u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He rol s over, propping himself up on an elbow, and focuses on my face. Usual y when he does this, I think it\u2019s sweet and friendly, but today when he does it, it kind of makes me al warm, al over my body. His gorgeous green eyes bore into mine, and a curl swings back and forth across his forehead, and I reach up and brush it away. I let my fingertips linger on his temple. He narrows his eyes, then lies down on his back again.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d things go with Ty last night?\u201d Henry asks.</p><p>\u201cThings are fine. I guess we\u2019re dating now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool\u2014I\u2019m glad you\u2019re cutting loose, Woods.\u201d</p><p>I swal ow. \u201cUm, so I had a talk with Carrie today after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He runs a hand through his hair, then props himself up on an elbow again.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you never tel me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTel you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know...why you and Carrie broke up.\u201d</p><p>Fal ing back down onto his pil ow, he rubs his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she tel you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me she\u2019s stil in love with you, and then I about punched her lights out for hurting you, but then she told me she couldn\u2019t be with you...because you\u2019re in love...with, um, someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s about right,\u201d he whispers. He rol s over to face the wal . \u201cI can\u2019t believe she fucking told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell , maybe she said that so I wouldn\u2019t beat her up.\u201d</p><p>Henry laughs lightly. \u201cYeah. Good point.\u201d</p><p>I rol over and prop myself up on an elbow, looking down at him over his shoulder. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question. Why did you never tel me?\u201d</p><p>He glances in my eyes for a second, then shuts his He glances in my eyes for a second, then shuts his own. \u201cIt would\u2019ve changed everything, Woods. And I don\u2019t want anything to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what I\u2019m doing, but I have this overwhelming urge to hold him, so I curl up against him, spooning him. It\u2019s weird, because part of me feels so right right now. The other part wants to be with Ty. I wish Carrie had never told me about why they broke up, because now? I keep thinking about the barrier between Henry and me, the barrier that can\u2019t be crossed, the barrier I never even thought about. Something is stirring inside me. Have I loved him, as more than a friend, al along?</p><p>What the hel is wrong with me? I\u2019m used to knowing what\u2019s best for me. I guess it\u2019s a big decision. Choosing whether to take it to the next level. But it wasn\u2019t that hard to decide with Ty. I wanted him, so we did it. It\u2019s not so simple with Henry, with someone who has fil ed ten years of my life.</p><p>And what about Ty? He\u2019s sexier than Tom Brady, but he\u2019s no Henry.</p><p>When I\u2019m nestled in tight, Henry flips over, takes his arm out from between us and puts it around my shoulders, squeezing me to him. I rest my chin on his chest and find his eyes, taking everything in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then I feel my lips dragging me up toward him, toward his mouth, and right when I\u2019m about to kiss him, just to see how it feels, he puts a restraining hand on my chest.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t, Woods. I\u2019m sorry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d Embarrassed, I drop my head back onto his chest.

I reach up and drag the back of my hand across my face.</p><p>\u201cYou have a boyfriend now, Woods! You can\u2019t just go around making out with every guy you see,\u201d he says with a laugh.

Then I look up into Henry\u2019s eyes, and he\u2019s staring back at me, at my tears, and I see al these tiny wrinkles around his eyes\u2014sadness wrinkles.

I just sat there hoping he\u2019d change his mind.</p><p>Since I never skip, Mom came in to check on me this morning.</p><p>\u201cIs it your father?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause he feels horrible about how he behaved at dinner the other night.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cIs it Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied, burying my face in the pil ow like Henry does. Remembering what Mike said yesterday, I blurted out, \u201cOh yeah, Mom, I\u2019m dating Ty now, I guess.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and clasped her hands together. \u201cGood. Your father and I like him very much. Come downstairs for some breakfast if you feel better.\u201d</p><p>I stil don\u2019t feel better.</p><p>My cel rings. Before checking the cal er ID, I try to guess who it might be. It\u2019s either Ty or Henry. Please be Henry. Please be Henry. I look at the screen. It\u2019s Carter.</p><p>\u201cYo,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWoods, what the hel are you doing?\u201d he says. \u201cGet your ass to school or Coach won\u2019t let you come to practice this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>Carter doesn\u2019t respond. We\u2019re great friends, but like with JJ, we don\u2019t spend a lot of time talking about hopes and dreams and puppy dogs and shit. We\u2019re just good friends who hang out, eat, and play bal together.</p><p>\u201cWant me to get Henry?\u201d he says final y.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoods, what\u2019s going on? Do you need me to come get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please come get me. Let\u2019s go to Waffle House,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou got it. I\u2019l be there in twenty. You owe me, though. I\u2019l have to skip cooking class, and I was gonna learn how to make dumplings today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l buy you a lifetime supply of dumplings,\u201d I say, hanging up before Carter can change his mind.</p><p>I run back inside, take a quick shower, and put on the underwear that Henry liked\u2014the black ones. It\u2019s not like I think Henry wil see the underwear today; I just hope they\u2019l be good luck. God, clues were al over the place, and I didn\u2019t pick up on any of them. When a guy notices your underwear, that means he\u2019s looking, Jordan!</p><p>Henry said he didn\u2019t want anything to change, but does he actual y mean that? How can you be in love with someone for forever and not be wil ing to take a chance when it final y hits you in the face like a linebacker?</p><p>After Carter and I have ordered enough food to feed ten people, I slide the salt and pepper shakers over in front of me. I stack salt on top of pepper, then yank pepper out. Salt fal s straight down onto the table, not spil ing a lick. Carter takes the shakers and stacks pepper on top of salt. He pul s salt out, but pepper comes down at a weird angle, spil ing al over the table.</p><p>My phone buzzes. Ty texts me: Where are you?</p><p>I don\u2019t answer him.</p><p>Instead, I take a sip of Diet Coke and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Ohio State?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re stil interested,\u201d Carter replies.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sign with them\u2014my dad\u2019s got it al set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, you know, I love playing bal , but I don\u2019t know if I want it to be my life.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I stack pepper on top of salt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like it\u2019s not my life. I mean, it\u2019s my dad\u2019s life. It\u2019s what he expects me to do,\u201d Carter says, running his fingertips through the mess of pepper he spil ed on the table.</p><p>This is huge. Carter never opens up like this. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI dunno...cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I want to cook, like I want to become a chef.\u201d</p><p>This is just insane. No doubt, if he wants it, Carter has a future in the NFL. And he wants to cook?</p><p>Is this how people think of me? Jordan Woods is a girl and she wants to play footbal ? Shouldn\u2019t she be playing with makeup and clothes and strutting around the mal ? What the hell is wrong with her?</p><p>So I guess I shouldn\u2019t judge Carter. No wonder he\u2019s always talking about stuff like Chianti and L\u2019Auberge Wherever.</p><p>Thinking about how much I\u2019m beginning to enjoy writing, and how hard this must have been for him to bring up, I say, \u201cCarter, if you want to become a chef, you should become a chef.\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s gaping. \u201cReal y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014I play footbal \u2019cause I love it. You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to do what you love. You should just do it.\u201d</p><p>Carter pouts his lips and clenches a fist. \u201cOkay, I wil . I just have to figure out a way to tel my dad and not give him a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that. But can\u2019t you play footbal and take cooking classes at Ohio State?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. I mean, that\u2019s probably what I\u2019l do, but I just</p><p>\u201cI guess. I mean, that\u2019s probably what I\u2019l do, but I just feel like it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s not my decision, it\u2019s not me living my life. I\u2019ve never gotten to figure it al out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you have to do things you don\u2019t want to do. To get something better, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So you gonna tel me what\u2019s up with you, Woods? You\u2019ve been weird for like two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell , most of that was Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of figured that. You\u2019re together now, so why skip school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Henry today?\u201d I ask as the waitress brings plates of hash browns and eggs and waffles to our table.</p><p>\u201cFine, I guess. Tired. He said he was out late with Kristen Markum.\u201d</p><p>Kristen? Is Henry freaking kidding me? He went out with her knowing what she said about me on Monday?</p><p>Hearing this makes my eyes tear up again. I grab the plastic ketchup bottle and squeeze it as hard as I can, spraying ketchup al over my hash browns. I try to bust the bottle, squeezing harder and harder until there\u2019s nothing left but hash browns drowning in a mound of ketchup.</p><p>Feeling the empty bottle disappear from my hand, I glance up and see Carter placing it on the table and putting his hand into mine where the bottle was. He squeezes my hand and moves around to the other side of the table to sit next to me. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he loves you...I love you too. And so does JJ.\u201d</p><p>I look up at Carter, who puts an arm around me. \u201cNot like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Carter starts to fidget, squeezing my shoulder unnecessarily hard. He doesn\u2019t say anything else\u2014we just sit here for the next hour, picking at the waffles and hash browns and playing the salt and pepper game. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s here with me, even if he\u2019s not saying anything. Sometimes friendship is just that, just being with someone.</p><p>Then Carter\u2019s cel phone rings. Peeking at the screen, he takes a deep breath before answering.</p><p>\u201cYo...yeah...yeah...\u201d He focuses on my eyes, puffy and stinging from al the tears. \u201cShe\u2019s okay...we\u2019re at the Waffle House out on the highway...yeah...bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not just tel him where we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to talk to him.\u201d Carter picks up the check and goes to the cash register, then comes back and drops several dol ars on the table. \u201cHenry\u2019s gonna come pick you up. And I shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Carter pats my back one last time and leaves.</p><p>trades</p><p>I hop into Henry\u2019s truck, and he drives. I have no idea where we\u2019re going. In silence, he winds alongside stacks of hay and beneath tree branches that hang over the back roads. Which one of us is going to speak first?</p><p>I know he saw my puffy eyes when he first pul ed up, but he chose to focus on a Dumpster instead. It\u2019s bad if your best friend in the world would rather look at a Dumpster than at you.</p><p>Ty texts me: I need to know where you are.</p><p>I don\u2019t text back.</p><p>Final y, Henry parks out by the Cumberland River, and we get out and walk toward a dam. Now that it\u2019s September, the weather is turning cooler. I like it. I can smel the leaves\u2014they\u2019l change color soon. I want to get rid of this tension, so I run down along the banks of the river, heading nowhere. I expect Henry to jog after me, to race me, but he just keeps walking slowly. Henry doesn\u2019t want to race? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I run for five minutes, then take a seat on a fal en log. I look down into the shal ow water at the tiny fish and tadpoles swimming around. When we were little, Henry and I used to go out to the creeks near Lake Jordan. There, we\u2019d spend al day trying to find crayfish, or as we cal ed them, crawdaddies. The trick to catching a crawdad is to grab him right behind the neck like you\u2019d catch a snake. If you don\u2019t, the crawdaddy wil nick you with his pinchers. We got pinched al the time, but it was always worth it when we final y caught a giant fourinch-long crawdad. Now I\u2019m wishing we had never grown up, because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen today, but it can\u2019t be good. My tears fal into the shal ow water, hitting the rocks and fish.</p><p>Henry final y sits down next to me on the log, but we don\u2019t touch.</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>He picks up a smal , flat rock, then stands and skips it twice across the surface of the water. What a poor showing\u2014I can skip a rock more than two times. I dig around next to the log and find a heavy, flat stone, dimpled with grooves and peppered with black specks. I stand and skip it three times. I rule.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cRemember when Nomar Garciaparra got traded from the Red Sox to the Cubs?\u201d I start.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Henry says, picking up another flat stone. He skips it across the water three times.</p><p>I scowl. Oh, it\u2019s on. Bending down, I scrounge beneath the log for another flat stone. \u201cSo later, when Nomar started playing for the Oakland As, he came back to Boston for a game, and it was like he was stil a player for the Red Sox. Everyone at Fenway gave him this mad standing ovation that lasted, like, a whole minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was like nothing had changed. The Red Sox fans stil loved him, and he got al teary-eyed and shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I take my newfound stone and skip it three times. Crap. There must be a stone here that\u2019s capable of doing four skips. \u201cBut you know, things had changed. He wasn\u2019t real y a Red Sox player anymore. He was an Athletic.\u201d</p><p>Henry sighs. \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to say that, even if we aren\u2019t both Red Sox players anymore, we can, uh, stil give each other players anymore, we can, uh, stil give each other standing ovations when we visit each other.\u201d</p> <p>Henry flicks another stone, but it only does two skips. Then he laughs, wiping curls off his forehead. \u201cWoods, I don\u2019t speak Shitty Sports Metaphor Language. I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>I go over to him and touch his arm. \u201cIf you had told me you liked me as more than a friend, I total y would\u2019ve agreed that the feeling is mutual.\u201d</p><p>Henry nods. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t know that before,\u201d he whispers. \u201cUntil you heard how I felt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d just never considered it. You\u2019re like my brother...wel , you were like my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now...\u201d I pick up a big rock and throw it into the water, causing a huge splash. That felt great. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot more than a brother.\u201d I turn to stare at him again. Henry picks up an even bigger rock and throws it into the river. It makes a much larger splash than mine. Damn it.</p><p>I search for a bigger rock, find one and pick it up, launching it into the river. My splash total y kicks Henry\u2019s splash\u2019s ass.</p><p>\u201cWoods, I just want to stay Red Sox.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. Turning to face me, he puts a hand on my hip, rubbing it softly with a thumb. \u201cI love you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I blurt.</p><p>He smiles, but it\u2019s not a happy smile\u2014it\u2019s like a resigned smile. \u201cI real y do love you, Woods, but I like what we have now. And if we go off to different col eges, it\u2019l be horrible. We\u2019d be apart al the time. I couldn\u2019t handle that. I\u2019m already dreading it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I\u2019m already dreading it, and we\u2019re just best friends, imagine how bad it would be if we were more...what if we broke up? We\u2019d never get over it. Wel , I never would.\u201d He picks up another rock and feeds it to the Cumberland.</p><p>\u201cI get it. But Kristen Markum?\u201d</p><p>His face goes al red, and he kicks some rocks into the river. \u201cWon\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, you\u2019re not going to screw around with girl after girl anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. I gotta cope somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour coping,\u201d I say, making finger quotes, \u201cis fucking with my heart. You were breaking it long before I even knew how you felt. I\u2019ve been worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think your being with Ty has just about kil ed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude!\u201d I laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s been three days or something.\u201d</p><p>Henry grins, stretching out his hand toward mine.</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>I take his hand. \u201cRed Sox forever.\u201d And then, thinking of Kristen Markum, I shove Henry into the river, creating a much bigger splash than any of my rocks.</p><p>That evening, as I\u2019m writing, Ty comes into my room without knocking. I barely have time to hide my journal.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been answering my cal s?\u201d he asks in an agitated tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019ve had a rough day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, Jordan,\u201d he shouts. \u201cWhen I cal , you need to answer the phone.\u201d</p><p>This is al too much. I close my eyes. Through clenched teeth, I say, \u201cExcuse me? Don\u2019t talk to me like that. Ever. Understand?\u201d</p><p>When I open my eyes, I find Ty curled up at the end of my bed, tears rol ing down his face. \u201cI thought something had happened to you,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be hurt. Or dead. I didn\u2019t know about my parents for hours...I couldn\u2019t reach them on their cel s.\u201d</p><p>I crawl down and pul Ty\u2019s head into my lap, stroking his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m okay,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Ty stays in my arms for the next hour. What causes the worst pain I\u2019ve ever felt? Watching a quarterback, who prides himself on maintaining control, fal apart. stupid fish plaque</p><p>the count? 5 days until alabama</p><p>After our weekly gorging at Joe\u2019s, JJ and I are hanging back at my place, playing some Nintendo Wii. JJ\u2019s kicking my ass at the game where, riding a cow, you race around a dirt track and knock down scarecrows for points.</p><p>\u201cWoods,\u201d JJ says, as he pummels a few scarecrows with his cow, \u201cyou\u2019d better not miss any more practices. I hate snapping to your pretty-boy boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, man,\u201d I say as I total y miss a line of five scarecrows. Why do I suck so bad at video games?</p><p>\u201cTy\u2019s so picky,\u201d JJ continues. \u201cLike, if I don\u2019t hike the bal at just the right speed and angle, he gets ticked off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better. Or Carter and I are going to kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t kick my boyfriend\u2019s ass,\u201d I say, exasperated. Why are al the men in my life acting like total boneheads?</p><p>The door to the basement squeaks open, and I hold my breath, waiting to hear who opened the door. Is it Henry? Please God, let it be Henry. At school today, we didn\u2019t speak at al , which is strange considering we have four classes and the same lunch period together. How are we supposed to be Red Sox forever if, after one day, he\u2019s already acting weird again? I wish Carrie had never told me why they broke up.</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d Dad cal s out from upstairs. \u201cMay I see you in my study please?\u201d</p><p>I drop the Wii control er on the floor and trot up the stairs to the study, where I stand in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s sitting at his desk, shuffling through paperwork. He never invites me in his study\u2014it\u2019s like his inner sanctum of footbal . He might as wel have a</p><p>\u201cNo Women Al owed\u201d sign on the door because Mom hasn\u2019t been in here in ages. I don\u2019t even think it gets cleaned\u2014it\u2019s ful of empty pizza boxes and Gatorade bottles, coated in layers of dust.</p><p>\u201cTake a seat,\u201d he says, gesturing at the leather sofa where he and Mike watch film of past games. My head says there\u2019s no way he\u2019d ever watch film with me, but my heart is hoping that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been invited here. Doubtful. When I sit down, I hear a crunch, so I stand up and find that I\u2019ve just sat on a Cheeto. Gross.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d Dad says as I wipe orange dust off my butt,</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d like to go to the go-kart track and out for milkshakes tonight. You know, like we used to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike when I was ten?\u201d</p><p>Dad nods.</p><p>I lift a shoulder. \u201cNot real y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he mutters while staring at his paperwork.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m so sorry about what I said at dinner the other night. You\u2019re right\u2014I didn\u2019t know anything about Ty or his family.\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cCan you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>This is about Ty? I\u2019m so mad at Dad right now, I could easily smash his flat-screen TV. I want to grab his stupid footbal -shaped lamp and hurl it out the window. And though it\u2019s sacrilege, I\u2019m considering smashing his Joe Montana autographed picture.</p><p>\u201cI can forgive you about Ty, but how could you say I\u2019m selfish? I\u2019m just trying my hardest to do what I love. You compliment Henry and Ty, but you never ever mention me! You\u2019d support every other footbal player on the freaking planet before me!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I said that out loud. I throw my head back and peer at a trophy case, realizing he has one of back and peer at a trophy case, realizing he has one of those plastic singing fish plaques on his shelf. I thought Mom threw that out years ago! He\u2019s gonna be in huge trouble with Mom for keeping that dumbass fish. Dad turns to see what I\u2019m looking at. \u201cOh hel ,\u201d he says, rubbing his head as he looks at his fish. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna tel Mom, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOn?\u201d</p><p>I pul a deep breath. \u201cI want your support. I want you to come to my games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan\u2014I love you, but I\u2019ve seen what this game can do to people...\u201d Dad stands up and stares out the window at Lake Jordan. \u201cI don\u2019t want that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s it okay for Mike, but not for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the concussions, I\u2019ve seen knees wrecked, I\u2019ve seen legs broken in four places.\u201d Dad exhales deeply. \u201cMike can handle al that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I! You\u2019ve always gone to his games. You never come to mine. And I\u2019ve worked so hard.\u201d I\u2019m tempted to stand up and smash that stupid fish plaque over his head.</p><p>Dad\u2019s eyes meet mine. \u201cI know you work hard and I know you\u2019re a great player...but I get scared. I don\u2019t want to see anything bad happen to you...I couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d His voice trails off.</p><p>\u201cBut I love footbal and have a chance at playing for Alabama!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do you want to go to Alabama so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best footbal team in the country.\u201d Duh. Dad picks up a pen from his desk and clicks it a few times. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019l ever let you play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course they wil .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you find it a bit weird they invited you to visit campus and basical y offered you a ful ride before seeing you in person?\u201d</p> <p>My head droops a bit. I wondered the exact same thing. \u201cMaybe they saw some of my tapes from last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then they make you pose for a calendar? It\u2019s like they want you to be their trophy. And I would\u2019ve said the same thing if this had happened with your brother, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m one of the best footbal players in Tennessee. Did you ever think Alabama may actual y want me to win some games for them?\u201d</p><p>Dad shakes his head and clicks the pen some more before chewing on the end of it. \u201cYou understand the long hours? The hard hits you\u2019d take at the col ege level? Dealing with sixty Jake Reynoldses all the time\u2014the jerks who wil constantly degrade you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad. I understand al of that.\u201d</p> <p>Dad looks at me for a long time, then picks up a footbal from the floor and tosses it to himself. Twirling the bal as he goes over to stare out the window again, he says, \u201cJordan, I love you and I\u2019m so proud of you. I\u2019l try to be better.\u201d</p><p>I feel a snag in my throat and swal ow hard. \u201cI love you too, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I cal ed down to Texas to speak with Buddy Simpson about your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Buddy is one of Dad\u2019s old friends. He used to play for the Cowboys and now just hangs out in Texas not doing much of anything except fol owing the footbal circuit. If something\u2019s happening in Texas regarding footbal , Buddy usual y knows about it.</p><p>Dad tosses the bal up and catches it. \u201cA bunch of schools were interested in him after last year, but he\u2019s been ignoring al their cal s and emails,\u201d Dad says.</p><p>\u201cEven Florida showed some interest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo he lied to us?\u201d I reply, tracing the lines of my palm with a fingertip.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. He\u2019s real y only concerned with what happened to his parents...</p><p>only concerned with what happened to his parents...</p><p>and making sure his sister is okay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to help him\u2014and his sister. I\u2019m worried about him.\u201d</p><p>Thinking of Ty crying last night, I say, \u201cI\u2019m worried too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking care of a sister and a sick mother is not something a seventeen-year-old should have to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know what I can do, though. He doesn\u2019t like being taken care of. He likes being in control.\u201d</p><p>Dad tosses the bal to me. I catch it and toss it back to him. \u201cWel , let\u2019s give him some control then. Tel him I\u2019l loan him whatever money he needs to take care of his mom. But he has to pay me back with interest.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI like that idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019l go for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019l talk to him about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You know, Jordan, even if he was just some guy on the math team, not some great footbal player, I\u2019d stil want to help him out.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes the great Donovan Woods can actual y be pretty cool.</p><p>it gets worse</p><p>the count? 4 days until alabama</p><p>As I pul into the school parking lot before our third game, my cel rings. Mike.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro, guess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlabama\u2019s athletic director sent me another email. He said a friend of his, an Alabama alum, is coming to look at me tonight.\u201d Since recruiters are technical y only al owed to watch a player once during the season, sometimes col ege coaches ask boosters or alumni to come see the rest of the games. It\u2019s kinda shady, but that\u2019s just the way things work. \u201cAnd he thanked me for doing the photo shoot,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>I shut off the truck\u2019s engine. \u201cAre you coming with me to visit campus Tuesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. Big history exam that day.\u201d As I get out of the truck, Mike says, \u201cListen, you need to dress up when you go. Wear a dress and fix your hair, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when I talked to the coach at your first game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me that if you join the team, the coaches wil expect you to act like a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Probably \u2019cause they want to give off a certain impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell , if you want to play for Alabama, you\u2019l have to do what they say. You might as wel go ahead and start now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I reply with a shaky voice. \u201cI guess I can do that.\u201d Even though it\u2019s not me at al . What does acting like a lady have to do with rocking on the footbal field?</p><p>I remember when I decided to play bal . I actual y started out as a cheerleader, for a Pop Warner team, the Hornets. Mom dressed me up in skirts and ribbons and handed me pompoms. Henry played quarterback, and instead of cheering, I was searching for crickets behind some trees, because good bait is always important. The bal went out of bounds\u2014I ran to grab it, and hurled it, and the bal flew farther than any of Henry\u2019s passes. He caught the bal , ran back to me, and said, \u201cDarn, you\u2019re good,\u201d with this big smile on his face, his two front teeth missing. \u201cWanna come out for pizza and air hockey after the game? With me and the team?\u201d</p><p>That day, I traded my pompoms in for cleats. And Henry became a wide receiver. And part of my heart became his.</p><p>I go to the locker room and get changed into my pads and uniform, and then head out to the benches. I see Henry chatting with Carter, beneath the moonlight and the starry sky. I\u2019m about to go tel him about Alabama and the talk with Dad and Ty freaking out on me, but Coach takes me aside.</p><p>\u201cCoach, Alabama\u2019s sending someone to watch me tonight!\u201d</p><p>Coach doesn\u2019t smile, just clutches his clipboard to his chest, and stares out at the field where some of the guys are warming up.</p><p>\u201cWoods, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you, but you can\u2019t miss two practices without saying a word to me.\u201d</p><p>I focus on my cleats and mumble, \u201cSorry, Coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Alabama, your ass would be on the bench, and Ty would be playing. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I look up into Coach\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d better not, or Ty wil be our starting quarterback.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d better not, or Ty wil be our starting quarterback. You\u2019re the leader of this team, Woods. These guys expect a lot from you. If you don\u2019t care enough to show up at practice, or at least talk to me about whatever the hel \u2019s going on in your life, then you don\u2019t deserve to be captain.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve fucked so much up.</p><p>I just need to get this game over with. Prove to Alabama that I\u2019m such an awesome player, it doesn\u2019t matter how I dress. So good that I could even wear kilts and play bagpipes al over the place, and they would stil love my footbal skil s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet going on dril s,\u201d he demands, gesturing at the field with his clipboard.</p><p>I jog over to Henry and pul him away from everyone, but instead of being al loose and playful like he usual y is, he seems stiff.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks, with his hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cRemember when I first started playing bal ? And I was looking for crickets and then I threw the bal back to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>What? We used to joke about this al the time. How I destroyed his future career as quarterback of the Titans.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asks, focusing on the cheerleaders, who just came out of the locker room and are getting set up on the track surrounding the field. The crowd starts waving and cheering as Carrie does a back-handspring.</p><p>\u201cJust need to talk about some stuff,\u201d I reply. Is he okay? He won\u2019t look me in the eye. \u201cWant to come over after the game? To watch a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He waves his arms around in a circle, warming up.</p><p>\u201cOh. What are you up to tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you come over?\u201d</p><p>He stares down at the field before saying, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to, Woods.\u201d</p><p>I stuff my helmet on my head and bite into my cheek. He\u2019s never done this to me before.</p><p>\u201cI need some time alone,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cCaptains,\u201d a ref yel s, and Henry jogs to the sidelines without speaking to me again.</p><p>Tears trickle out of my eyes as I slowly buckle my chinstrap.</p><p>Al I know is, without him as my friend, I\u2019m just a shel . Just a playbook without any plays.</p><p>\u201cWoods,\u201d Coach shouts, waving his clipboard. \u201cThe coin toss.\u201d</p><p>I look up, my eyes blurred from tears, and find Carter and JJ jogging over to me. JJ takes my elbow in his hand and leads me toward the center of the field, whispering, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn Alabama alum is here to watch me,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Carter replies, patting my back.</p><p>\u201cI feel sick,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l be great,\u201d JJ says. \u201cNorthgate\u2019s got nothing on us. Not with you playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014can you do the toss?\u201d I whisper, and he nods and pats my shoulder.</p><p>Carter cal s heads. It lands on heads, and he chooses to receive.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumble as we head back over to the benches. Henry runs out to receive the kickoff, and while I shake my shoulders out and drink some Gatorade, Ty comes over.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks, focusing on my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>He puts his helmet under an arm and rubs the back of his neck with his other hand, peering at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve been weird ever since, you know, we slept together. I\u2019m sorry if you felt pressured, or anything...\u201d</p><p>I so don\u2019t need this right now. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that. I just need to get in the zone for the game.\u201d</p><p>Northgate\u2019s set to kick off, and Henry\u2019s bouncing around in the end zone getting ready to receive, and my knees are shaking. Partly because of the Alabama alum, partly because of Henry, but mostly because I feel like my entire life has changed in the past month. I\u2019m used to being in control, and even that\u2019s gone. I gave up what I had left when I missed practice.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you can play?\u201d Ty asks. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to lose if we want to make it to district finals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cGood. Watch out for the corner blitz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and looks at the crowd for a few seconds. \u201cAfter the game, we need to talk,\u201d he says before walking over to stand next to Coach.</p><p>\u201cFanfuckingtastic,\u201d I whisper to myself.</p><p>I scan the bleachers, looking for Mom\u2014she\u2019s sitting with Mr. and Mrs. H. I bet Henry\u2019s glad his dad final y showed up at a game. Must be nice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mom stares down at me, concern etched on her face. \u201cI love you,\u201d she mouths.</p><p>I wave at her, thinking how much I needed that. Northgate kicks off, and Henry makes it to the thirty before getting slammed to the ground. The team and fans erupt, screaming and clapping, and the marching band plays the fight song. I run out onto the field with JJ, who slaps my back before we get into formation. My hands shake.</p><p>\u201cZ-spread eighteen,\u201d I shout, and JJ hikes me the bal . I pedal three steps backward, scanning the field, then zip a short pass to Higgins. He jumps to catch the bal , but it sails right over his head. Incomplete.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d I mutter. I wipe my sweaty palms on my towel.</p> <p>Back into formation.</p><p>JJ hikes the bal again. Keeping it simple, I hand off to Bates, and we gain fifteen yards. Nice.</p><p>Next play? I hurl the bal downfield to Henry, but he sidesteps a cornerback at the last second, and the bal lands directly in the cornerback\u2019s arms.</p><p>Interception.</p><p>The cornerback darts down the field toward our end zone, and I sprint over and throw myself at him, but I miss the tackle, flip, and crash onto my back in the grass. Ow.</p> <p>grass. Ow.</p><p>The cornerback scores. Because of me.</p><p>Because I\u2019m playing like complete crap.</p><p>When I run back over to the benches, Carter says,</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d I only had one interception al last year, and that\u2019s when I blew it at the state championship. I can\u2019t blow it again.</p> <p>JJ and I hustle back out after Northgate kicks off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got this, Woods,\u201d he says.</p><p>On the first play, I hand off to Bates for ten yards, but then on the next snap, I fumble the bal and as I\u2019m scrambling after it, I get slammed and my helmet smashes into the ground. My nose feels like someone hurled a brick at it.</p><p>Thank God JJ recovers the bal .</p><p>We lose the ten yards.</p><p>Breathing deeply, my hands keep shaking as I huddle with the guys. \u201cGo route to Henry. I\u2019m bombing it straight down the field.\u201d</p><p>We clap and break, and JJ hikes the bal again. I dash back several feet, avoiding the linebacker trying to sack me, and throw the bal to Henry, but it\u2019s way short. I don\u2019t get enough on the throw and he runs the wrong route\u2014he was supposed to come back on the bal , but didn\u2019t.</p><p>Northgate intercepts again.</p> <p>\u201cShit!\u201d I yel . Higgins manages to tackle the safety who got the pick on me, but it\u2019s Northgate\u2019s bal again. I can hear my teammates shouting from the bench, including Ty. \u201cWhat the hel , Woods?\u201d he cal s out with his arms spread wide.</p><p>I want to yel , \u201cIt\u2019s not only my fault!\u201d but captains don\u2019t do that.</p><p>Henry jerks his head, looking pissed at himself for messing up the play.</p><p>My eyes dart to the fence where al the recruiters and alumni stand, and locate the hat with the Alabama logo on it. The guy\u2019s writing in his notebook and shaking his head. Another guy wearing an orange Tennessee windbreaker is with him. Great. So now Mike wil know I\u2019ve screwed everything up.</p><p>I\u2019m a total waste of Alabama\u2019s time.</p><p>I yank my chinstrap loose and storm over to the bench as shitloads of cameras blind me like strobe lights. Damned reporters.</p><p>Coach walks up, while Henry stands as far away from me as possible, but I can see him panting hard as he glances at me. Good. He should know this is his own damn fault. Couldn\u2019t he have waited until the game was over to destroy my heart?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Woods?\u201d Coach asks.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Coach,\u201d I say with a shrug.</p><p>He whispers, \u201cI\u2019m sorry too. Your head\u2019s not in the game. You\u2019re benched.\u201d</p><p>And right then, when I look up into the stands for Mom, I see Dad kiss her cheek and take a seat.</p><p>losing it</p><p>Ty ran the score up 28\u20137</p><p>Didn\u2019t even look like he was trying as</p><p>he bombed the ball down the field over and over again to Higgins</p><p>The great Donovan Woods finally showed up Sat in the stands</p><p>Signed autographs</p><p>Smiled and laughed</p><p>It\u2019s like he knew I\u2019d get benched</p><p>It\u2019s like he knew Ty would play</p><p>So he came</p><p>A recruiter from Mike\u2019s school showed up</p><p>Gawked at Ty</p><p>Even worse?</p><p>Mr. Henry came</p><p>But didn\u2019t get to see Henry play for real</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t make one pass to Henry</p><p>I ruined my chances with Alabama</p><p>I threw my helmet at my locker</p><p>the daily special</p><p>will i still get to go to alabama?</p><p>After the game, Ty and I head to my truck. He stil wants to talk.</p><p>In the parking lot, we pass JJ and Lacey, who are pawing at each other up against her mom\u2019s Ford Taurus. Classy.</p><p>Celebratory rap music rings out from Higgins\u2019s truck, and Carrie and Marie are encouraging Carter to start a bonfire.</p><p>\u201cNice game, Ty!\u201d Kristen cal s out, sitting on the tailgate of Higgins\u2019s truck, displaying lots of leg.</p><p>\u201cGood job, Green,\u201d Higgins adds, slapping Ty\u2019s back.</p><p>And no one looks at me.</p><p>Then I see Henry sitting on the tailgate of his truck. With Savannah Bailey standing in front of him, in between his legs. He kisses her and pul s her hips up against him and digs his fingers into her brown hair, and I feel this pain shoot up my arm and into my chest.</p><p>\u201cIs there one girl at this school he hasn\u2019t been with?\u201d</p><p>Ty asks, nodding at Henry.</p><p>\u201cGood question.\u201d</p><p>When Henry comes up for air, he looks over Savannah\u2019s shoulder at me. He mouths, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Even though I\u2019m pissed, I give him a slight smile.</p><p>\u201cGive me your keys,\u201d Ty says, thrusting his hand in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the keys. You\u2019re not driving when you\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset!\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cMy dad died in a car wreck, you know.\u201d</p><p>I reluctantly pass Ty the keys; he rips them from my hand, and we climb into my truck and start to drive. A minute later, I get a text from Henry: I\u2019m really sorry. I text back, Okay.</p><p>But it\u2019s not that simple.</p><p>Thinking of Henry gives me this dul ache in my chest. How long wil that be around?</p><p>Back at Ty\u2019s place, I wait in the living room as he visits his mother, who I stil haven\u2019t met, then I watch as he checks on Vanessa, who\u2019s already asleep. He brushes her hair away from her face and kisses her cheek.</p><p>I sit down on Ty\u2019s bed, but he doesn\u2019t join me. He pul s out his desk chair, flips it around toward me and straddles it. Folding his arms across the back of the chair, he rests his chin on his forearms and stares at me.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ty asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your dad actual y came tonight...\u201d</p><p>I rol my eyes. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s karma for skipping practice for the first time ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, after the game, your dad introduced me to a coach from your brother\u2019s school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures,\u201d I say, burying my face in my hands. But like with Henry, I won\u2019t be selfish. I\u2019m not going to sacrifice Ty\u2019s future just because I have a horrible relationship with my father. Looking up, I say with a smile, a real smile, \u201cI think it\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Ty focuses on the carpet. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d He moves to sit with me on the bed, taking my hand in his. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I yel ed at you the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine...wait. I talked to Dad about his offer to help pay for your mom\u2019s care so you can go to school.\u201d Ty sighs and fal s backward onto his pil ow. I lie down on the pil ow too, taking in its scent of soap. \u201cAnd I know you don\u2019t want to accept a handout\u2014believe me, I wouldn\u2019t either\u2014but would you be wil ing to consider a loan? To be paid back with interest after col ege?\u201d</p><p>loan? To be paid back with interest after col ege?\u201d</p><p>Ty stares at me. \u201cInterest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like once you\u2019re on an NFL team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee I\u2019l end up in the NFL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l never know unless you try. And you can do that with my parents\u2019 offer. Even if my dad is the biggest asshole on the planet to me, I think you should take advantage. If not for you, for Vanessa. You\u2019l be able to provide so much more for her if you go to col ege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoods, before I can accept this, I need to know if you real y want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want you to take the money and focus on col ege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant us. Do you want to date me?\u201d</p><p>I do have feelings for him, even if they aren\u2019t as strong as my feelings for Henry. He\u2019s cute and sweet and he total y gets what footbal means to me. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI real y like you. And with everything that\u2019s happened to me in the past few months, I can\u2019t handle much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I moved here, I didn\u2019t know what would happen. I didn\u2019t care about much of anything except for making sure my mom got taken care of and my sister got to school. Once I got that figured out, for now anyway, I thought I could be selfish for a little while. I could play some bal , make some friends...and then I met you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m biting my fingernails, feeling that dul ache making way for a much deeper pain. Who ever knew Jordan Woods was capable of being such a heartbreaker? I\u2019m plundering the hearts of footbal players, left and right. It must be the new pushup bras. He continues, \u201cAnd I\u2019m fal ing for you\u2014I love how driven and serious you are. I can\u2019t believe everything that\u2019s happened between us. But if you\u2019re not going to be mature and serious about me, like I thought you would be, I want out now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If you\u2019re going to keep running off with Henry, doing God knows what, I want out. I don\u2019t like it when I can\u2019t reach you on your cel . I need to know where you are.\u201d</p><p>I must be awful y important to him since he\u2019s freaking out like he did with his sister. Picking up a phone isn\u2019t a lot to ask. \u201cI\u2019l pick up from now on. I\u2019m sorry about the other day. I left my phone in the car.\u201d Lie.</p><p>\u201cGood. And I can\u2019t stand how Henry gets to stay over at your house at night. So can you not...?\u201d</p><p>Um, okay. Al owing Ty to have a say in my friendship with Henry is a lot to ask. I\u2019ve been dating Ty for what?</p><p>Five days? And he\u2019s already questioning my friendship with Henry? I guess he has a point. I mean, two days ago, I was total y ready to end this for Henry. But if Henry and I can\u2019t be together, and if he\u2019s going to act like a jerk, and if he\u2019s going to kiss another girl in front of me, I\u2019m not putting my life on hold.</p><p>I won\u2019t give up my boyfriend for the best friend who said, \u201cI need some time alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy\u2014I\u2019m serious about me and you. Henry\u2019s been my best friend for ages, and I can\u2019t imagine not hanging out with him, but he won\u2019t be sleeping over anymore. And just so you know, nothing has ever happened between us. You\u2019re the first guy I\u2019ve ever wanted. You\u2019re my first everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why didn\u2019t you tel me?

But what\u2019s not okay is how you played tonight. Why didn\u2019t you pass to Henry?\u201d</p><p>Ty glances at me sideways. \u201cUm...I dunno...I guess</p><p>I\u2019m a little pissed at him. I heard he disappeared from school on Wednesday, just like you. And since you didn\u2019t answer my cal s...I thought...\u201d</p><p>I cut him off, leaning in for a kiss. With this kiss, I\u2019m tel ing Ty I\u2019m serious, that I wil continue being serious. tel ing Ty I\u2019m serious, that I wil continue being serious. When unrequited love is the most expensive thing on the menu, sometimes you settle for the daily special. having cake</p> <p>the count? 1 day until alabama</p><p>After practice on Monday, Ty and I are leaning up against my truck, making out in ful view of the junior varsity footbal team. I open my eyes slightly and see a couple freshman guys gawking at us. I grin, continuing to kiss Ty. When I open my eyes for a second time, I see Coach staring at us, pul ing off his cap and scratching his head. He focuses on his clipboard but looks up at us again several times before final y going back into the school. This must be the weirdest thing a footbal coach has ever seen: two quarterbacks making out.</p><p>When I open my eyes for the third time, Henry, who must\u2019ve final y come out of the locker room, is staring at us. I stop kissing Ty the minute I see Henry, because the last thing I want is to hurt him.</p><p>\u201cWoods, would you please get a room? Seriously,\u201d</p><p>Henry says.</p> <p>Ty pul s away from me and grins, staring into my eyes as he says, \u201cWhat do you need, Henry?\u201d</p><p>Henry looks only at me. \u201cCan I have a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Ty says, but he doesn\u2019t move. He turns and puts an arm around my waist, as if to protect me. As if to tel Henry he\u2019s not leaving me alone with him.</p><p>\u201cAlone,\u201d Henry says.</p><p>\u201cAnything you want to say to her you can say to me,\u201d</p><p>Ty says, digging his fingertips into my hip bone.</p> <p>\u201cTy,\u201d I intervene, \u201cI can talk to my best friend if I want to.\u201d I jerk my head at my boyfriend, and he nods. After squeezing my hand, he shuffles across the parking lot to talk to Higgins.</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be acting like that,\u201d Henry says, glaring at Ty.</p><p>How Ty acts is none of Henry\u2019s business. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask, leaning back against my truck.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay over tonight? I need to get out of the house.\u201d</p><p>I stuff my hands into the pockets of my mesh shorts, pissed that he wouldn\u2019t hang out with me when I needed him, more than ever. What happened to</p><p>\u201cneeding a break\u201d?</p><p>\u201cHenry, we can\u2019t do that anymore. I have a boyfriend now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I thought nothing was going to change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat has to change. I can\u2019t share a bed with another guy if I have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just another guy, Woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I promised Ty you wouldn\u2019t stay over anymore.\u201d</p><p>Henry seems furious. He\u2019s biting down on his bottom lip and he keeps kneading his palm like he\u2019s getting ready to punch something. \u201cJJ and Carter were right. They told me Ty was going to start taking over everything. He already got your position. He\u2019s control ing the plays on the field. And now he\u2019s taking you away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! He got to play on Friday because I skipped practice and messed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t throw a single pass to me on Friday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my problem. Maybe you weren\u2019t open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that. You know I was open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tel you, Henry. You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you even know what that means.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m crying now. \u201cExcuse me? I\u2019m not stupid. It means you can\u2019t expect everything to stay the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe agreed that nothing would change between us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy and I are dating now. He\u2019s asked one thing of me</p><p>\u2014he doesn\u2019t want you sleeping over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan...\u201d Henry grasps his curls with both hands.</p><p>\u201cJordan...\u201d Henry grasps his curls with both hands.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you didn\u2019t want him to take me away from you, maybe you should\u2019ve talked to me when I needed you so badly on Friday.\u201d Tears slip down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should\u2019ve taken me when you had the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Woods, we\u2019re not ever going to be together, so you need to get over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already was.\u201d Lie.</p><p>Henry glares at me. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear I mean so little to you that you\u2019re already over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is al your fault, Sam. You control al the plays here. But you haven\u2019t even stopped to consider what I might want. You just tel me how it\u2019s going to be. Wel , Ty doesn\u2019t control me, and you don\u2019t control me. I control myself.\u201d</p><p>Henry laughs a mean laugh, staring up at the cloudy blue sky. \u201cWhat a crock of shit. You let everyone else control you and tel you how to feel. Ty, Kristen Markum, Alabama, your dad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you. If I lose my scholarship to Alabama, it\u2019s al your fault.\u201d</p><p>I get into my truck and slam the door shut and bang my forehead on the steering wheel. Through my tears, out of the corner of my eye, I see Ty come back, and he and Henry start yel ing at one another outside my truck. I turn the ignition and drive off.</p><p>How could everything in my life fal apart in less than a month?</p><p>Later that evening before Monday Night Football, I\u2019m in our exercise room, slamming my fists into the punching bag.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d I yel , throwing a punch. \u201cMoron,\u201d I say, kicking the bag, causing it to swing back a few feet toward the wal . \u201cI thought you loved me! You screwed up my chance at Alabama.\u201d I throw a few more punches but stop when I hear a loud slurping noise coming from the doorway.</p><p>Peeking around the bag, I find Carter leaning up against the doorframe drinking a Slurpee through a straw. Glancing at the clock, I see the game wil be on in a few minutes. Thank God, the Vikings and Chargers wil be a great distraction from thinking about how mad I am at Henry.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, ripping off my gloves, then wiping sweat off my forehead using my tank top.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he replies, walking over and handing me a Styrofoam cup. \u201cThought a Slurpee might cheer you up. It\u2019s pink lemonade.\u201d He smiles as I start sucking it up through the straw. Damn, it\u2019s good.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say as I take a seat on a weight bench and lean over onto my knees. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta talk to Dad about buying a Slurpee machine from 7-Eleven. We could put it out by the foosbal table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then JJ and I would never leave your basement,\u201d</p><p>Carter says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cFine with me. At least you guys haven\u2019t become total boneheads.\u201d</p><p>Carter lets out a deep breath, then starts slurping again.</p><p>\u201cIs Henry okay?\u201d I ask, though I\u2019m not sure I want to know what happened after I left today.</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give it to me straight, man. Does he hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201d Carter stares up at the ceiling, not looking at my face. \u201cHe loves you more than anything,\u201d he says quietly, then pul s the lid off his cup and starts shaking it, trying to get more Slurpee out.</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you tel ing me?\u201d</p><p>Carter takes another deep breath. It\u2019s so weird for us to be talking about this stuff. I mean, shouldn\u2019t we be planning how we\u2019re going to beat the shit out of Cool Springs on Friday?</p><p>\u201cUm, wel ,\u201d he says, \u201cHenry sort of punched Ty in the jaw, so then Ty busted Henry\u2019s nose, and then Henry gave Ty a black eye, al before we could break them up. They\u2019re not real y hurt, but they both got suspended from school for a week and can\u2019t play on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Carter clears his throat. \u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good,\u201d I say, getting up and kicking the bag again. The chains hanging from the ceiling groan as the bag swings around in circles. \u201cThat means I\u2019l get to play the whole game, and I won\u2019t have to throw the bal to Henry. Jerk.\u201d As the words tumble out of my mouth, I immediately regret them. This must be how Jake Reynolds feels every time he speaks. A sob rises in my throat as I plop back down on the weight bench. I can\u2019t believe how much I\u2019ve hurt Henry and Ty.</p><p>And Alabama wil never want me now.</p><p>Sitting down, Carter slides up next to me, slipping an arm around my waist. I lean against his shoulder and say, \u201cI promise I\u2019m never gonna lose sight of footbal again.\u201d</p><p>Carter nods, then grins. \u201cYup, who needs a girlfriend when you\u2019ve got good friends and footbal ?\u201d</p><p>when you\u2019ve got good friends and footbal ?\u201d</p><p>JJ suddenly appears in the doorway, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cShould I leave you two alone so you can get it on with a footbal ?\u201d He yanks his wal et out of his pocket and finds some condoms, which he throws at us.</p><p>\u201cShut up, man,\u201d I say, dodging the condoms, \u201cor I\u2019l kick your ass out of here for good, which would suck for you because I\u2019m gonna get Dad to buy us a Slurpee machine.\u201d</p><p>JJ has a hurt look on his face as he stares down at the cups in our hands. \u201cWhere\u2019s my Slurpee?\u201d</p><p>Carter shakes his head and points toward the door.</p><p>\u201cCan we just watch the game and play some foosbal already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d JJ says, clapping his hands together as if we\u2019re in a huddle. I love my friends\u2014I feel better already. Now al we\u2019re missing is Henry. Even if we both acted like total jerks today, I want to know that he\u2019s al right and right here beside me.</p><p>After I kick JJ\u2019s and Carter\u2019s asses at a few rounds of foosbal , the Vikings are winning by ten points, and Henry stil hasn\u2019t shown up.</p><p>\u201cIs Henry coming?\u201d I ask JJ quietly. I bite my lip so I won\u2019t let another sob out.</p><p>After throwing a dart at the dartboard, JJ finds my eyes for a sec, then looks away. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>trip to alabama</p><p>The plan?</p><p>I\u2019m going to tel the athletic director and coaches that Friday night was a fluke \u2019cause I got food poisoning from Joe\u2019s Al -You-Can-Eat Pasta Shack, that it won\u2019t ever happen again, and pray to the footbal gods to give me another chance.</p><p>The only reason they might is because my dad is the great Donovan Woods.</p><p>Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m banking on my name to get me through today.</p><p>Mom and I have just arrived at the University of Alabama...with Dad. When he got into the car with us, I gasped so hard I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t puncture a lung. I hope I get to throw a bal around and meet some of the other players today, but mostly I\u2019m excited to see the stadium.</p><p>Because of Dad and Mike, I\u2019ve been on pro and col ege fields hundreds of times, but this is the first time it wil be my field. Box seats and beer and VIP</p><p>boxes for my fans are a big step up from the metal bleachers and cheap frozen pizza at the high school level. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since Alabama expects me to act like a lady al the time, I\u2019m wearing a new grey dress and heels, so I\u2019m stumbling along as we enter the quad, which is covered in red and white Rol Tide flags. I\u2019m drawing tons of attention to myself, including the stares of some hot guys. I mean, they\u2019re nothing compared to Ty, but I\u2019m glad to know there wil be more of a selection than at Hundred Oaks. Some of them smile at us.</p><p>I elbow Mom. \u201cDad better watch out. These col ege guys are total y into you.\u201d</p><p>Mom laughs. \u201cThat would certainly be a scandal. The wife of the Tennessee Titans\u2019 quarterback runs off with a twenty-year-old col ege boy.\u201d</p><p>Then a dark, tal guy with wavy black hair walks by us. He puts Ty to shame. \u201cUh, Mom, if you ran off with that guy, no one would blame you.\u201d</p> <p>And then Dad gives me a noogie and says, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad! Stop,\u201d I exclaim, smoothing out my hair.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s staring!\u201d I add, which makes him laugh even harder.</p><p>We find the athletic department, where the director greets us enthusiastical y, offering us coffee and soda and food, and if we didn\u2019t cut him off, I\u2019m sure Mark Tucker would\u2019ve offered us a trip to a spa and a vacation and a new Ferrari.</p><p>I did my homework. Before Mr. Tucker became the Director of Athletics for Alabama, he was an Olympic skier. Then he total y wiped out in the final seconds of a race, blowing the gold medal. So he retired, vowing never to ski again or some shit like that. Afterward, he went back to col ege and got a degree in school administration.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re so glad you could visit,\u201d Mr. Tucker says, shaking my hand and patting my shoulder</p><p>simultaneously. \u201cCome on in my office.\u201d He ushers us in, and I can\u2019t help but notice al the people in the outer office gawking and pointing at me. What\u2019s that about?</p><p>Mom, Dad, and I take a seat, and then I hear Mr. Tucker raising his voice, so I turn and see he\u2019s speaking with his assistant. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d Mr. Tucker says quickly, quietly.</p><p>\u201cHe said he doesn\u2019t have time for this,\u201d the assistant replies.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what he says,\u201d Mr. Tucker exclaims. \u201cTel him to get over here. Now.\u201d</p><p>him to get over here. Now.\u201d</p> <p>Who doesn\u2019t have time for what?</p><p>Dad furrows his eyebrows as he turns from watching the exchange. He glances at me.</p><p>Mr. Tucker shuts the door and sits at his desk, unbuttoning his suit jacket. \u201cSo, Jordan, what are you thinking of majoring in?\u201d</p><p>I kinda want to say creative writing, but the last thing I need is my future teammates to hear that I\u2019m beginning to like poetry. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet, Mr. Tucker. Maybe physical therapy? I dunno.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Tucker laughs lightly. \u201cNo need to worry. You have a lot of time before you have to figure that out. So, I trust you know how excited we are that you\u2019re considering joining our program?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I reply. \u201cSir, about the game on Friday, I wasn\u2019t feeling wel and didn\u2019t play my best, but it won\u2019t happen aga\u2014\u201d</p><p>He waves a hand at me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Happens to the best of us.\u201d</p><p>I played like complete suckage on Friday night\u2014how could he not care? Maybe he\u2019s sympathetic \u2019cause he flew off the Super G ski track and landed in some pine trees. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cYour performance on Friday night isn\u2019t an issue,\u201d Mr. Tucker adds.</p><p>\u201cBut she threw two picks,\u201d Dad exclaims. Confusion and anger cloud his face.</p><p>Mr. Tucker waves his hand again. \u201cSo you know we want you to be part of our recruiting team here at Alabama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yes, sir. But I don\u2019t know what that means exactly. Would you want me to talk to potential players or something?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Tucker fiddles with a paperweight on his desk.</p><p>\u201cWell ...yes, but that\u2019s not al .\u201d The office door slams open to reveal a man in khakis, a windbreaker, and a basebal cap. Typical coach-wear. It\u2019s the head coach, Rob Thompson. He\u2019s one of the best coaches in the game; his specialty is rearing future NFL quarterbacks. Some of the best have come from this school.</p><p>I jump to my feet and smooth out my dress, but before I can introduce myself, Coach Thompson says,</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got five minutes, Tucker. I have practice.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fal s open. The coach doesn\u2019t have more than five minutes to speak with a potential quarterback? One they are prepared to give a ful ride to? What the hel does that mean?</p><p>\u201cCan you give us ten minutes, Rob?\u201d Mr. Tucker asks. \u201cAnd I\u2019l give Mr. and Mrs. Woods and Jordan the tour of the grounds and stadium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got five,\u201d Coach Thompson says, shaking Dad\u2019s hand, then taking a seat on the other side of Mom.</p><p>She purses her lips and clutches her bag. She looks like she might just stand up and leave.</p><p>Does Coach Thompson have a problem with the Titans? Maybe he\u2019s acting like an asshole because my bro plays for Alabama\u2019s main rival, Tennessee. But wait, I would be an asset because I know how Mike plays and thinks. Coach Thompson must realize this. So what the hel is this dude\u2019s problem?</p><p>Dad sits back down in his chair and rubs his eyes with a thumb and a forefinger.</p><p>Mom speaks up first. \u201cMr. Tucker, you were discussing Jordan\u2019s role in recruiting? What exactly does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like for her to speak at some events and do more photography work for us\u2014like she did for our boosters\u2019 calendar. We\u2019d also like her to be the face of our charity program. We encourage foster children to consider sports, showing them that a team can be a family too.\u201d</p><p>I feel confused. Mike doesn\u2019t have to do any of this stuff for Tennessee. Sure, they make posters of him, stuff for Tennessee. Sure, they make posters of him, but it\u2019s not like he has to pose like I did. And I\u2019m al for charity and helping kids, but with practice and school and traveling to games, how wil I have time for the charity program, speaking at events, and recruiting?</p><p>\u201cOkay. I can do those things,\u201d I say, peeking at Coach Thompson. \u201cBut it seems like al these extra activities might affect my practice time. Shouldn\u2019t I be focusing on playing bal ?\u201d</p><p>Coach Thompson crosses his arms and stares out the window. \u201cYou won\u2019t be playing footbal for me anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she has the best QB record in the entire state of Tennessee,\u201d Dad replies, and my heart gets so excited I think it might stop.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true\u2014I threw for 2,653 yards and thirty-one touchdowns last year alone.\u201d</p><p>The coach laughs, but it\u2019s not a nice laugh. \u201cI think my five minutes are up, Tucker.\u201d He stands and walks out of the office, letting the door slam behind him. I\u2019m going to play for this jerk?</p><p>Glaring at the door, Mr. Tucker runs a hand through his hair and rises from his desk. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Coach Thompson. He\u2019s under a lot of stress...you know, with the upcoming game against Florida. Let me show you around the school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure hope the coach won\u2019t be treating my daughter like that when she\u2019s a member of his team,\u201d Mom says, folding her hands in front of her.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course not,\u201d Mr. Tucker says, ushering us out of his office.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d Dad says to me.</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen the field yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, come on,\u201d I whisper, bouncing on my tiptoes. He\u2019d use any reason to get me to leave. So what if Thompson\u2019s in a grouchy mood today? \u201cAlabama\u2019s my dream.\u201d</p><p>Dad rests a hand on my shoulder and, eventual y, he nods. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt to take a look around campus.\u201d</p><p>We get to see some of the classrooms and the new state-of-the-art gym and workout facilities, including a new pool. Al of this bores me. I want to see the freaking stadium! It takes about an eon for us to go out there, what with these awful shoes I\u2019m wearing, and with Mr. Tucker\u2019s need to point out every last little thing, from where the bike racks are located to where I could pick up a newspaper to where students are al owed to smoke. I would hope an athletic director would know better than to point out ashtrays to a quarterback, but whatever. I\u2019l trudge through Mr. Tucker\u2019s show-and-tel as long as I get to see the field eventual y.</p><p>Final y, when we get to the stadium, Dad says, \u201cI\u2019l stay outside.\u201d He drops to sit on a bench. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta make some cal s.\u201d</p><p>He slumps, staring at the parking lot, and doesn\u2019t take his phone out.</p><p>Mom and I head inside Bryant-Denny, which is so beautiful, even better than on television. The lush green field reminds me of an Irish countryside, and I can even smel the freshly painted yard lines. The giant red scoreboard and the little tunnel leading from the locker room make me giddy. I can\u2019t wait to run out of it. Water coolers are set up on the benches and staffers are carrying bal s and assorted equipment across the field. I indulge in a few daydreams, including one where I run for a touchdown with only ten seconds left in a tie game, and another where I throw for a touchdown from the fifty-yard line. Okay, that would never happen, but it\u2019s a cool dream. I\u2019m knocked out of my fantasies by some guys who jog up to me. Wearing red and white sweats, these guys are even hotter than the ones we saw on the quad. I recognize them from pictures on the team website\u2014three wide receivers and two running backs.</p><p>backs.</p><p>They al smile at Mom and say, \u201cHel o, ma\u2019am.\u201d At first, I\u2019m convinced they\u2019re southern gentlemen, but then one of them says, \u201cAnd you must be Jordan Woods, our new poster girl!\u201d</p><p>The other four guys laugh. So that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be? Not only can I play quarterback, I can play this game too: sarcastic bitchiness. In my heels, I stumble up to the asshole wide receiver who just taunted me and say, \u201cYup. I\u2019m the new poster girl. But only because you weren\u2019t pretty enough. Wouldn\u2019t want to scare the fans away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh,\u201d and \u201cOuch,\u201d the other guys say, slapping the wide receiver, who bats their arms away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re prettier than I thought you\u2019d be,\u201d says one of the wide receivers. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. I won\u2019t mind you being on the team one bit. I hope we get to be roommates.\u201d He sidles up next to me and wraps an arm around my shoulder. Ugh. Jake Reynolds\u2019s face flashes in my head. I shove the wide receiver away, hard, but immediately regret it because this is not how a lady acts. Hopeful y none of the coaches saw that. The receiver stumbles away, laughing.</p><p>Mr. Tucker is fiddling with his cufflinks, glancing back and forth between me and the Alabama players.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you al be getting ready for practice?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, he points toward Coach Thompson, who is inspecting a player\u2019s knee and talking to a trainer at the same time.</p><p>The guys al say \u201cYes, sir\u201d and jog off toward the benches.</p><p>I\u2019ve been lucky for the past ten years, because everyone in Tennessee just accepted me. What should count is that I\u2019m a great footbal player, a great person. It shouldn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m not a boy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I guess that\u2019s how everyone sees me. Girl first, footbal player second.</p><p>Just like Henry said.</p><p>It gets worse when the wide receiver who groped my shoulder comes running back over, tossing a bal . He throws it at me so hard that when I catch it, I stumble backward because of these stupid shoes. He laughs at me. Kicking the heels off, I decide I\u2019m not gonna let this asshole embarrass me. He\u2019s standing there, stretching his arms out and smiling, just daring me. So I run back a few steps, but instead of throwing the bal at the wide receiver, I draw my arm back and launch a thirty-fiveyard bomb over the dude\u2019s head. Oh yeah, it goes exactly where I want it to. The bal flies right between two of the other assholes, hitting the water cooler. Ice and water explode al over the rest of the players who made fun of me.</p><p>They turn and gawk at me. Even Coach Thompson is staring. It takes every bit of decorum I possess not to slap my hips with my hands and yel , \u201cSuck it!\u201d at these fools.</p> <p>The wide receiver gapes, then shrugs, saying, \u201cNice. But you\u2019ve stil got a lot to prove, little girl.\u201d</p><p>I glare back at him, wishing I had another bal , because I think his helmet needs a good dent in it. Considering I led my team to the state championship game last year, I have proven myself. Girl or not, I\u2019m an awesome footbal player.</p><p>\u201cWell , Mom, I think we\u2019ve seen enough. Thank you, Mr. Tucker, for your time.\u201d I elbow Mom, who is smiling at the water cooler mess on the other side of the field.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, thank you, Mr. Tucker. I\u2019m glad there\u2019s at least one gentleman at this school,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>Hel , I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anyone act more embarrassed than Tucker. His face is red and sweaty and he\u2019s dabbing at his forehead with a handkerchief. Dad\u2019s right. Alabama never wanted me to play in the first place. No wonder Mr. Tucker didn\u2019t care that I fucked up royal y on Friday night.</p> <p>So now what?</p><p>So now what?</p><p>Later that night, I\u2019m sitting on the dock, writing in my journal while watching the moon shine down on algaecovered Lake Jordan. When I got home, I stripped out of that stupid grey dress and hurled it into the closet, where I found Henry\u2019s blue Converses nestled up against a pair of my cleats. And then I noticed his Super Mario Bros. Tshirt, so I sat down in the closet and cried into Luigi\u2019s face. And then I realized how psycho that was, so I ran out to the lake. (After putting clothes on, of course.) As soon as my back was to the house, I started bawling. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse: me screwing up on the field and letting my team down, or knowing that Alabama never wanted me to play in the first place. Now, I keep opening and closing my cel phone. I want to cal Henry so much. But why bother?</p><p>And I can\u2019t cal Ty to tel him about my trip to Alabama. I can\u2019t show weakness in front of him\u2014he\u2019l just question my ability to play, like he did on Friday night.</p><p>Carter and JJ just aren\u2019t good at talking about this stuff. Besides, I don\u2019t want anyone to know about what happened today. I mean, if Alabama isn\u2019t going to let me play, then why should I keep starting for Hundred Oaks? Might as wel give Ty the chance so he can get a ful ride to col ege.</p><p>He does deserve and need it...</p> <p>I write in my journal:</p><p>Even though Dad\u2019s always been kind of a jerk, at least I had my dreams and my best friend.</p><p>Well, Henry\u2019s gone, and my dream school wasn\u2019t a dream after all. I have a boyfriend now, but the perfect boyfriend was right in front of me, and I didn\u2019t even notice. It\u2019s like I flew into a black hole, into a void where I don\u2019t know anything.</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>I look over my shoulder as I snap my journal shut and sit on it. Dad\u2019s standing behind me with his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cPlease just leave me alone...\u201d</p><p>Dad comes and sits down next to me, pul s his loafers off, and dips his toes in the lake.</p> <p>\u201cYou gonna say I told you so?\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cCourse not. Just came out to check on you\u2014you haven\u2019t said two words since we left Alabama. Mom\u2019s worried.\u201d He jerks his head toward the house, so I turn and see Mom staring from the kitchen window, arms folded across her stomach.</p><p>Dad asks, \u201cWhy do you want to go to Alabama?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at him as I wipe my nose on my sweatshirt sleeve and repeat what I said the other day.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best footbal school in the country.\u201d Duh. He elbows me in the side. \u201cHey\u2014what about Ole Miss? I turned out okay, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I let out a tiny laugh.</p><p>Dad swats at a mosquito before saying, \u201cAlabama may have the best record ever, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right school for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is the best school for me, Dad? One without a footbal team?\u201d</p><p>He blows a bunch of air out and leans back on his hands, staring up at the clear sky. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the best school is for you, but you should explore al your options.\u201d</p><p>I pul my knees up to my chest and wrap my arms around my legs, thinking how embarrassing it would be to admit to my teammates that I\u2019m not going to Alabama. Maybe if I play harder and better than ever before, they\u2019l have no choice but to let me play.</p><p>\u201cAlabama\u2019s what\u2019s best for me, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He reaches over and rubs my back. \u201cYour mom and I love you no matter what you choose, but I hope you\u2019l seriously think about other col eges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Dad pauses for awhile. \u201cHow about we go fishing together on Saturday? Just you and me?\u201d</p><p>So he can try to talk me out of Alabama again? \u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>Pain washes over his face as he stares into my eyes and takes his hand off my back. Then he gets up and heads back to the house while I keep staring at the moon and slapping at mosquitoes.</p><p>When I turn to see if Mom\u2019s stil looking at me from the kitchen window, I don\u2019t find her staring at me. But Dad is.</p><p>Maybe he does care, but I can\u2019t forget how he\u2019s tried to get me to quit for years. This is what Dad\u2019s been waiting for\u2014for me to give up.</p><p>But I\u2019m not going to.</p><p>FROM: Woods, Jordan</p><p>TO: Tucker, Mark (Athletics, University of Alabama) DATE: Saturday, September 18, 07:32 a.m.</p><p>SUBJECT: Thank you</p><p>Dear Mr. Tucker:</p><p>Thank you again for inviting me to visit campus last Tuesday. I enjoyed meeting Coach Thompson and the players. While I look forward to helping with recruitment and working with charities that the University of Alabama supports, I\u2019m very excited to play for the football team one day.</p><p>I\u2019ve enclosed a video from our fourth game. Last night, we beat Cool Springs 42\u201314. I threw for 300 yards and ran for one touchdown. Please feel free to share my video with the coaching staff.</p><p>I\u2019m looking forward to visiting campus again and to joining the team next year.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jordan Woods</p><p>FROM: Tucker, Mark (Athletics, University of Alabama) TO: Woods, Jordan</p><p>DATE: Monday, September 20, 09:13 a.m.</p><p>SUBJECT: RE: Thank you</p><p>Hi Jordan:</p><p>I hope you enjoyed your tour of campus. It was great to meet you and your family. I\u2019m sorry you couldn\u2019t stay longer. We just received the proofs for next year\u2019s calendar, and we love your photos. We\u2019re most excited you\u2019re joining our community.</p><p>The University of Alabama Alumni Charity Ball is on December 4, and we\u2019d appreciate it if you could attend. Several alumnae have expressed a desire to meet you.</p><p>Yours truly,</p><p>Mark Tucker</p><p>the count? 21 days since the fight with</p><p>henry</p><p>\u201cFor our next project,\u201d says Mr. Majors, the music appreciation teacher, as he paces back and forth across the classroom, \u201cyou and your partner wil pick a classical composer. I\u2019d like you to prepare a tenminute oral report, including a biography of the composer\u2019s life and an analysis of how that composer\u2019s work has influenced current music. Also, I\u2019d like you to play a recording of a piece of music written by that composer and tel us what it means to you. So now, please go ahead and choose your partner and your composer.\u201d</p><p>Even though he hasn\u2019t been speaking to me, I automatical y look at Henry, who\u2019s sitting in the desk right next to mine. He glances at my face, and after frowning his perpetual frown, he turns away. \u201cYo, Bates,\u201d Henry shouts across the room. \u201cYou\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>Bates, who was already moving to sit with his usual partner, looks from Henry to me and back at Henry again. Shrugging, Bates says, \u201cSure, whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry,\u201d I say. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m working with Bates on this one.\u201d</p><p>A bunch of other kids start looking at me and Henry, wide-eyed. The whole class is silent.</p><p>I pick up my pen and start clicking it repeatedly, hoping the noise wil distract me, because I\u2019m about to smash something. No other footbal players are in this class. Maybe I just won\u2019t do the project\u2014I don\u2019t give a shit about this class anyway.</p><p>But if I get a bad grade, the principal could make Coach bench me for a few games until I bring my grades up. And I can\u2019t stand to miss a game\u2014I\u2019ve gotta prove to Alabama that I\u2019m the best high school quarterback in the country, and that when I join their team, they should let me play.</p><p>As I put my head down on my desk, I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn and find Marie, Henry\u2019s recent fling.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI need a good grade on this, and since you did great on that disco project, I was hoping we could work together?\u201d She smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cUm, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d she says, sitting down next to me. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to tel you I loved your flea-flicker play the other night. You don\u2019t see those very often.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open. \u201cYou know what a flea-flicker is?\u201d</p><p>Marie shrugs and pul s a nail file from her purse, running it across her fingernails. \u201cSure. Who doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>After practice, I try to catch Henry before he drives off, but he leaves without saying anything. Leaning up against my truck, I pul out my cel and dial his number, but he doesn\u2019t answer. This must be the hundredth time I\u2019ve tried to cal him in the past two weeks. Why oh why did I accuse him of not being open on the field? And why did I defend Ty? Why didn\u2019t I just let Henry sleep over anyway? How do I fix this? \u201cSam,\u201d I say to his voice mail, \u201cI hope you\u2019re feeling okay. Can we please talk? I miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m flipping my phone shut, Carter walks up. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cJust worried about Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Carter replies as he shifts his bag from one shoulder to the other.</p><p>I\u2019m sick of talking to my journal about this shit. \u201cDo you think I should dump Ty? Do you think Henry would go back to normal if I did that?\u201d</p><p>Carter focuses on his sneakers and clutches the strap on his bag. \u201cI dunno...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I like Ty, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m in love with him or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve been having sex, and I worry that it\u2019s a mista\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhoa, whoa,\u201d Carter says, waving his hands. \u201cToo much info.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I wish Carter could give me some advice, some answers. \u201cI think I\u2019m just gonna go over to Henry\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool\u2014good idea.\u201d</p><p>Carter and I knock fists, and then I get in my truck and drive over to Henry\u2019s trailer. But when I get there, his truck is gone. His mom\u2019s station wagon is here, though, so I jump out of my truck and jog up to the front door.</p> <p>Mrs. H. answers after I knock and gives me a hug, smoothing out my hair with her fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s not here, sweetie,\u201d she says, looking up at me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool. Know where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he was going to lift weights and run at the gym with the personal trainer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonal trainer?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. H. keeps playing with my hair as she says, \u201cYes</p> <p>\u2014I\u2019m so happy your father introduced Sam to that trainer. He\u2019l be in such good shape for col ege and wil have a much greater shot at getting a scholarship. I\u2019m so glad Sam has your family\u2014I don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do without your father\u2019s support.\u201d</p><p>I smile. So Henry took Dad up on it? \u201cRight,\u201d I say, acting as if I know everything. His mom clearly doesn\u2019t know about what\u2019s happened between Henry and me.</p><p>\u201cWell , I\u2019l get going then. Thanks, Mrs. H.\u201d</p><p>She pats my back. \u201cI\u2019l tel him you stopped by.\u201d</p><p>I hop off the front stoop and start heading to my truck, but then whip around. \u201cMrs. H.? Could you also tel him that...I\u2019m so proud of him and that I love him?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cOf course\u2014but he already knows that.\u201d</p> <p>Later that afternoon, when I get home, Dad stops me in the driveway.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go over to the drive-in tonight,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThe movies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>If I didn\u2019t feel so awful about Alabama and Henry and every other thing going on in my life, a smile probably would\u2019ve popped up on my face.</p><p>I love the old drive-in movie theater. In the summer, Henry, Carter, JJ, and I like to go buy a few tubs of fried chicken, and we sit in lawn chairs in front of the big screen and try to guess what the characters are saying on the screen, because we never turn the speakers on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go to the movies, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You love it there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do, but not with you.\u201d</p><p>Dad rubs his eyes. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you ever do anything with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. You\u2019l get Henry a personal trainer, but the only thing you\u2019l do for me is say that Alabama wil never let me play, as if you\u2019re doing me a favor, and then you go along on the trip to campus so you can rub it in, and then you tel me to consider other options?</p><p>You never even considered my first option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not wha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Dad.\u201d</p><p>I storm off to the backyard, looking over my shoulder to make sure Dad isn\u2019t fol owing me, and then duck into the potting shed, where I lie down on the dusty ground and use a bag of mulch as a pil ow.</p><p>Sunlight flickers through the window as I stare up at the cobwebs, looking for patterns like people do with clouds. I spot a section of web that looks like the state of Tennessee. One time Henry spotted a web that looked like a Snoopy Pez dispenser.</p><p>Several minutes later, I hear Mom speaking, so I get up and peek out the window. I wipe some dust from the glass. Mom\u2019s standing in her garden, surrounded by tal sunflowers, talking to Dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear,\u201d she says, cutting a sunflower stem,</p><p>\u201cbut Jordan\u2019s never going to let you in any part of her life until you start paying attention to what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see her get hurt. I watched one of my best friends die at thirty-eight because he\u2019d had so many concussions...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but footbal is what your daughter loves most right now. You can either share that with her, or you can share nothing with her. Probably for the rest of your life. Your choice.\u201d Mom turns around and heads back inside the house carrying a bundle of flowers, leaving Dad alone.</p><p>He rubs his eyes some more, then lifts his head, and touches one of Mom\u2019s sunflowers.</p><p>Three nights later, I carry the mac and cheese to the table and take a seat, glancing at Henry\u2019s empty chair. Ty\u2019s at work tonight and Mike and Jake are at school, so the dining room feels lonely with just me, Mom, Dad, and Dad\u2019s bottle of Gatorade.</p><p>I spoon some salad and macaroni onto my plate, then grab a few pieces of bread. I miss having to wrangle with the guys for food.</p><p>\u201cSo, Jordan,\u201d Dad says, wiping his mouth with a napkin. \u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I guess.\u201d Lie.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Henry been?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>\u201cI dunno...he\u2019s busy.\u201d Lie. I bow my head and push my macaroni around on my plate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking I should cal him,\u201d Mom says. I don\u2019t respond. I sip my lemonade, which has recently lost its flavor. I don\u2019t even enjoy my favorite drink anymore because it only reminds me of Henry. God, what doesn\u2019t remind me of him? Even macaroni reminds me of Henry.</p><p>One time when we were about nine, we decided to open our own restaurant in the family room. We cal ed it the Bite and Tackle. I was the chef and Henry played the waiter. We draped a tablecloth over the coffee table and set it with plates, glasses, and silverware from the kitchen. Using markers and glitter and construction paper, we drew up an elaborate menu that listed our offerings: fruit punch Kool-Aid, microwaved popcorn, fish sticks, and macaroni and cheese. Our only customers were Mom and Mike, but it was a hel of a lot of fun, and Mom left Henry a twenty-dol ar tip, which we promptly spent on skee-bal at the arcade.</p><p>\u201cJordan\u2014what\u2019s going on with Henry?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>I shrug. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Dad shaking his head at Mom, as if to tel her to drop it.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dad says. I hate al these awkward attempts at conversation. \u201cWho are you playing tomorrow? It\u2019s Davidson County, right?\u201d</p><p>I turn to stare at Dad. Did he just bring up a game?</p><p>One of my games? Holy shit. I nod frantical y. \u201cYeah\u2014</p><p>we\u2019re playing Davidson County. It\u2019s homecoming.\u201d</p><p>Mom smiles at Dad and pats his hand. Dad stares down at his plate, chewing on his salad. After swal owing, he says, \u201cI\u2019l be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I reply. I take a sip of lemonade and notice I can actual y taste the sugar now.</p><p>mom</p><p>Nothing like me\u2014</p><p>Never direct\u2014</p><p>Behind the scenes</p><p>Always behind the scenes</p><p>She asked what\u2019s going on with Henry</p><p>Surprising</p><p>She never intrudes</p><p>During dinner, Dad made me feel better</p><p>After dinner, the emotions all rushed back</p><p>Empty</p><p>Alone</p><p>Confused</p><p>Lost in the woods</p><p>I lie on my bed</p><p>Wishing I was looking up at glow-in-the-dark stars Like in Henry\u2019s room</p><p>But my ceiling is bare</p><p>Like my heart</p><p>Tears are falling</p><p>Mom comes in</p><p>Curls up next to me</p><p>\u201cMom\u201d</p><p>It comes out as a cry</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d</p><p>who the hell was in</p><p>charge of homecoming?</p><p>the count? 25 days since the fight with</p><p>henry</p><p>As some sort of prank, God decided that Henry should be homecoming king and Carrie Myer should be queen. It\u2019s halftime, and I\u2019m suffering through this horrible ceremony where they ride around the track in a scrambled-egg-colored convertible and wave at the crowd.</p><p>The marching band is playing the theme song from Titanic, \u201cMy Heart Wil Go On.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Carter says as he leans up against the fence surrounding the field. \u201cDidn\u2019t that movie come out, like, decades ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven I could plan homecoming better than this,\u201d I reply. \u201cYel ow convertibles and Titanic, my ass.\u201d I toss a footbal up in the air and catch it. Taking aim at Henry, who\u2019s stil sitting on the back of the convertible, I pretend to throw the bal at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Carter says, laughing softly.</p><p>\u201cI bet I can knock Henry out of the car,\u201d I say, taking a few hops back and rotating my arm as if I\u2019m about to launch a long bomb.</p><p>\u201cYou definitely could, but I know you don\u2019t want to embarrass Carrie like that. Give me the bal .\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I drop the bal into Carter\u2019s outstretched palm, but I bet Henry would find it hilarious if I knocked him out of the car. The old Henry would have, anyway.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re real y taking Carrie to the dance?\u201d</p><p>Carter grins a tiny smile. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not like a date or anything. We\u2019re going as friends.\u201d</p><p>I feel a smile edging on my lips, secretly hoping it ends up becoming a date. Carter deserves a nice girl. I\u2019m going to the dance with Ty, of course, and although he vehemently objected to \u201cattending a suckass gym social,\u201d JJ is taking Lacey. But I don\u2019t know if Henry\u2019s going.</p><p>Final y, after what seems like a year, Henry and Carrie climb out of the convertible and join the rest of the homecoming court. Now the marching band is playing the Whitney Houston song, \u201cI Wil Always Love You,\u201d and I\u2019m feeling like I could barf at any given moment. Everyone besides Henry, even the other footbal players, is dressed up in a tux. He chose to stay in his footbal uniform. I want to laugh, I real y do, but I\u2019m stil so pissed at him. I\u2019m sad too.</p><p>Because Kristen is stil obsessed with Ty or something, the cheerleaders asked him to \u201cpreside over Carrie\u2019s coronation,\u201d meaning he gets to put the cheap-ass crown on her head. He kisses her cheek as she steadies her plastic tiara. Before he walks away, he and Henry glare at one another.</p><p>As head cheerleader, Lacey puts a stupid cheapo crown on Henry\u2019s head. She smiles at him, but he just frowns back at her. He glances over at me for a sec, but then pul s the crown off and starts twirling it on a finger. Shaking her head, Carrie reaches over, takes the crown off his finger and puts it back on his head. Doing everything I can to ignore the marching band\u2019s rendition of \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman,\u201d I\u2019m staring at the scoreboard, which reads 17\u20130 (Hundred Oaks, of course), when Carter says, \u201cYou\u2019re playing an amazing game, Woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks\u2014so are you.\u201d I pause. \u201cI\u2019ve real y been stepping it up, you know, to show people what I\u2019d play like in col ege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Henry tel you that Western Kentucky and Auburn sent him letters about playing for them next year?\u201d</p><p>I smile down at my cleats. \u201cNo, but that\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>I smile down at my cleats. \u201cNo, but that\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have any other schools cal ed you or emailed or anything?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and peek at Carter out of the corner of my eye and twirl the footbal . \u201cUm, not real y. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, his eyebrows raised higher than a goal post. \u201cThink it\u2019s \u2019cause everybody already knows you\u2019re gonna take Alabama\u2019s offer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think back to when Mike was a senior, and just about every team in the whole freaking country cal ed him. Everyone from crazy-big teams like LSU and USC to not-so-impressive teams like Appalachian State in Boone, North Carolina. Even after Mike made a verbal commitment to Tennessee, letters stil flooded our mailbox and the answering machine fil ed up, like, three times a week.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why no one\u2019s cal ing,\u201d I tel Carter. \u201cBut yeah, probably \u2019cause of Alabama.\u201d Lie.</p><p>It\u2019s because I\u2019m a girl. Just like Henry said.</p><p>Feeling tears wel ing in my eyes, I wrap my arms around my waist, clutching my red and black jersey, and lean back against the fence, soaking up sappy marching band music until Mrs. H. comes rushing up to me.</p> <p>\u201cJordan, sweetie,\u201d she says, \u201cI need a picture of you with Sam. Come on.\u201d She grabs my hand and pul s me over to where the homecoming court is standing. Mom and Mrs. Carter are there too, oohing and ahhing over Carrie\u2019s pink satin dress.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a picture of the four of you,\u201d Mom says, pointing at me, Henry, JJ, and Carter. As Henry rips the crown off his head, I stand between JJ and Carter as our moms get camera happy. They make us trade places about a bil ion times and encourage us to smile while passing their cameras back and forth to each other, showing off their shots.</p><p>Final y after about fifty freaking photos, a teary-eyed Mrs. H. says, \u201cSam, Jordan, I want one of just the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Carter steps away, leaving a gap between me and Henry. We simultaneously take a step closer together, but we don\u2019t touch. \u201cSmile!\u201d Mrs. H. says, so I put on a fake grin, but when I look out of the corner of my eye, Henry\u2019s face is blank.</p><p>This is the closest he\u2019s been to me in three weeks, so I take my chance. \u201cSam, I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he replies softly.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk about al this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, I just can\u2019t right now,\u201d he whispers, glancing at my face once before walking to the bench, where he pul s his helmet on over his blond curls and starts reading a playbook.</p><p>Standing in the locker room after the game, which, of course, I rocked, I\u2019m getting ready for the dance. I\u2019m actual y excited.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been to a dance, and I\u2019ve certainly never worn a girly evening gown dress thing. Mom and Vanessa took me to the mal and while I played video games in the arcade, they picked out this awesome black number with a slit up the side. It had better drive Ty crazy, because I can\u2019t breathe in this damned thing. I have to admit it looks real y pretty, though. Looking in the mirror, I brush my hair, trying to make it look good, but I can\u2019t seem to do anything with it. The door to the locker room slams open and Carrie walks in. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since that day at practice.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything; I just keep brushing my hair, hoping that maybe some sort of fairy godmother wil pop up and make my hair respectable, and maybe turn my Gatorade into a Ferrari like Cinderel a\u2019s fairy godmother turned that pumpkin into a horse-drawn carriage.</p> <p>\u201cLove your dress,\u201d Carrie says softly. Using the mirror\u2019s reflection, I watch as she eyes me. She drops her bag into her locker and then rubs her elbows.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I like yours too,\u201d I say, glancing at her pink dress. Only she could make that color look good. Biting her lip, she starts to leave.</p><p>\u201cCarrie\u2014wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, do you think, maybe, you could?\u201d I lift a clump of hair.</p><p>She licks her lips, looking at the ratty black and red carpet, but then comes back over to me, takes my hand, and leads me to a bench. She sits me down and starts fiddling with my hair.</p><p>In the mirror, I watch as she brushes my hair and pul s it back. She lets little wisps of hair out of the bun so that it almost looks like one of my knots, but somehow this seems softer, daintier. It looks good.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say.</p> <p>Carrie takes a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I told you, Jordan...this is al my fault. I don\u2019t know if Henry wil ever forgive me. I hope you can.\u201d</p><p>Standing and smoothing my dress, I smile. I prefer being around guys, but I need this friendship too. It\u2019s not like Carter or JJ could talk about girl stuff, like hooking up with guys. Or fix my hair when I\u2019m desperate. If I asked Carter to fix my hair, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d muss it and slap a hat on me.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014definitely. I\u2019m real y glad we\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>She beams at me. \u201cThanks. Ready to hit the dance?</p><p>Ty\u2019s outside waiting for you and he looks so damned hot I almost jumped him.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s hard not to do that,\u201d I say as we leave the locker room, where we find Ty and Carter waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, Woods,\u201d Carter says, looking me up and down. \u201cYou can\u2019t wear shit like that. It\u2019s, like, against the nature of the universe or something.\u201d Chuckling, I walk up and shove him, and he laughs too. \u201cJust kidding,\u201d he whispers. Pul ing me up close, he continues, \u201cSeriously though, you\u2019l be the most gorgeous girl at the dance tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I reply, giving his shoulder a punch. Ty\u2019s holding a red rose and he\u2019s wearing a buttondown shirt and khakis with no tie. Carrie was right\u2014he looks rugged and hot. I take the rose from him and give him a kiss.</p><p>\u201cWho said the rose was for you?\u201d Ty whispers into</p><p>\u201cWho said the rose was for you?\u201d Ty whispers into my neck.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it for? Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d Ty grins.</p><p>I bring the rose to my nose, to smel it. \u201cThank you anyway. You look nice.\u201d</p><p>Ty eyes my dress. \u201cYou look sexy.\u201d He pul s me away from Carter and Carrie, heading away from the gym and toward the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cUh, Ty, the gym is that way.\u201d</p><p>He turns around, moving backward as he keeps pul ing me. \u201cI know. But after seeing you in that dress, I want to rip it off you.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I drop his hand. \u201cNo way, man. I\u2019ve never been to a dance. We\u2019re going.\u201d I turn and march toward the gym, making him chase me. From behind, he jogs up and slips a hand around my waist.</p><p>Inside the gym, red and black bal oons hang from the wal s and cr\u00eape paper is everywhere.</p><p>\u201c\u00dcber-cheesy,\u201d I tel Ty. \u201cEven I could do better than this.\u201d</p><p>Still , I\u2019m glad to experience this before I graduate. A slow Tim McGraw song is playing as Ty grabs my hand and leads me to the center of the gym. He whirls me around, then pul s me in close. I rest my chin on his shoulder and gaze around at the darkened gym, taking in the scene.</p><p>JJ and Lacey are standing in the corner, fighting. Carter and Carrie are dancing, smiling at one another. I sure hope she\u2019s able to get over Henry, because it seems as if Carter actual y likes her, and he never seriously likes anybody. Kristen is dancing with Higgins, but she keeps glancing at me and Ty, then quickly looks away. Jealous much?</p><p>I lean my forehead against Ty\u2019s for a minute, but then move my chin back to his shoulder, taking in the scene again. Now, JJ and Lacey are standing in the corner, making out. Ridiculous. Then Henry comes into the gym. He certainly didn\u2019t dress up for the dance. He\u2019s wearing holey jeans and an old T-shirt, but he stil looks damned hot.</p><p>He\u2019s twirling that stupid cheapo crown on his finger and gazing around the gym. A couple of girls hustle up to him, probably asking him to dance, but he waves them away. Leaning against the wal , he keeps twirling the crown. As the slow song ends, Henry\u2019s green eyes find mine, and I pul away from Ty and begin walking toward my friend. Henry stares at me, then stares at my dress. And then he just turns around and leaves the gym, dropping the stupid crown.</p><p>What the hel ?</p><p>FROM: Woods, Jordan</p><p>TO: Tucker, Mark (Athletics, University of Alabama) DATE: Saturday, October 9, 06:47 a.m.</p><p>SUBJECT: District finals</p><p>Dear Mr. Tucker:</p><p>I hope you are well.

We\u2019re playing burnout, a game where we throw the bal at one another as hard as we can, and the first person to drop the bal loses.</p><p>Ty is standing about thirty yards away as I launch the bal at him. He catches it and throws it back to me. He\u2019s a damned good quarterback\u2014I have red stinging hands to prove it. I jog back a couple steps and hurl the bal at Ty, and surprisingly, he actual y drops it.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he shouts. \u201cThat one had some heat on it, Woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to play again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he says, walking toward me, tossing the bal up and catching it. Then he grabs my side and pul s me up against him, and we kiss. \u201cSo guess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might sign to play at Tennessee.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze his biceps. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that I\u2019l be living near Mom and Vanessa. It\u2019s no Alabama, but it\u2019s stil a damn good team,\u201d he says, laughing.</p><p>I rest my chin on his shoulder and wrap my arms around his waist. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s no Alabama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since your brother is graduating next year, I\u2019d be starting as a sophomore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m real y excited for you.\u201d I\u2019m also really jealous of you.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you think you\u2019l start at Alabama? As a sophomore? Or a junior?\u201d</p><p>I hug Ty harder and close my eyes. \u201cNot sure,\u201d I lie, thinking about how Mark Tucker never even discusses my skil s on the field, and probably never wil . This embarrasses me so much, that deep down I know the truth, that Alabama is probably never gonna let me play, that unless I look for another col ege program that might take a girl, my footbal career wil probably be over at the end of this season. But what if Alabama ends up giving me a shot? Why should I give up now when I\u2019ve worked this hard? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see who can throw the farthest,\u201d I say. \u201cAfter each pass, step back about five yards.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d Ty throws the bal at me and I catch it. I go back a few yards, and toss it to Ty, who catches it and steps back a few feet. Then he throws it to me again. We keep hurling long bombs until we\u2019re about fifty yards apart.</p><p>\u201cGo to the other side of the lake,\u201d I yel .</p><p>Ty smirks. \u201cYou real y think you can throw a bal across the lake? It must be at least sixty yards at the skinniest part.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on! I wanna try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But if it goes in the water, you\u2019re the one fishing it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Ty jogs down to the lake and sprints around the banks toward the other side. While I\u2019m waiting for him to get in position, Dad comes outside and stands next to me.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Ty sure has an arm on him,\u201d Dad says.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t figure Dad would say anything about my arm, but I stil feel my body sagging a bit. I guess I\u2019l never stop hoping he\u2019l want to support me.</p><p>Dad cups his chin with his hand. \u201cI was watching you guys throw the bal around. It\u2019s amazing that, out of the entire United States, the NFL can\u2019t find thirty-two good quarterbacks.

It flies over the water, and like Dad and Ty suspected, it doesn\u2019t land in Ty\u2019s arms. It hits the water right before the bank and bounces up onto the grass.</p> <p>\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d Ty yel s from the other side of the lake as he picks up the wet bal and wipes it on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Dad says, patting me on the back.</p><p>I turn and smile at Dad. Not to taunt him or anything, but because I\u2019m glad he at least said, \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if I could make that pass across the lake. What you just did was pretty amazing,\u201d Dad says, squeezing my shoulder. He takes a deep breath. \u201cCan I throw the bal around with you?\u201d</p><p>I stare at the gleaming water for a sec, my pulse racing as I turn to look at Dad, who\u2019s wearing that same expectant look he gives me when he asks to go fishing, or to race go-karts. I find myself wrapping my arms around his neck, letting him pul me in for a hug, for the first time in forever.</p><p>\u201cYou can throw the bal around with us as long as you take me out for milkshakes later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d Ty cal s out. \u201cCatch!\u201d He runs back a few steps, winds his arm and hurls the bal . It doesn\u2019t come anywhere near me and lands about ten feet away, right in the water. It splashes and just floats there like a cork.

Our first real date. Since he spends his Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays washing dishes, and every other day is devoted to practice and games, we haven\u2019t had a chance to go out, just the two of us. Usual y, he comes over after practice for a couple hours, we make out, and then he goes home. At school, we eat lunch and walk down the hal , but it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve gotten to spend a huge amount of time together. In some ways, I barely know him.</p><p>What\u2019s his favorite color? Favorite band? Favorite vacation? Mustard or mayo? Both? When the hel is his birthday?</p><p>In some ways, I do know him. Does he like my hair up or down? Down. Boxers or briefs? Boxer briefs. Does he like it when I dress up? He prefers my jeans and T-shirts. Joe Montana or John Elway? Elway. (Blasphemy.)</p><p>Henry? Favorite color? Silver. Favorite band? Led Zeppelin. Favorite vacation? A cross-country trip with his dad to the Grand Canyon. Mustard or mayo?</p><p>Ketchup. Birthday? December 1.</p><p>Ty picks me up and we\u2019re off to some undisclosed location. Wearing jeans and a sweater, he\u2019s borrowed his grandfather\u2019s car for the occasion, and he brings me a bouquet of red roses. It\u2019s 5:30, which is early for a date, so we\u2019re driving into a lilac-and-bubblegumcolored sunset when he reaches over and rubs my thigh.</p><p>He smiles and it reminds me of the first day I saw him, how just seeing him made my body crazy. Practical y catatonic. Even if he\u2019s not perfect for me, perfect like Henry is, it\u2019s easy to like Ty.</p><p>Soon I notice we\u2019re heading away from town and out into the country, aka nowhere. \u201cTy, where are we going? There\u2019s nothing out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think,\u201d he says with a wicked grin stretched across his face.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate surprises. And how can you like surprises?</p><p>You like being in control.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m in control if I\u2019m the one doing the surprising.\u201d</p><p>He parks the car and we get out and walk across a vast green field, overrun with hay and weeds, until we come to a path that leads down to a little waterfal , where Ty has set up a picnic. I bet 99.9 percent of al women would absolutely swoon if they saw this setup, and I\u2019m in the majority.</p><p>Gaping, I grab his elbow. \u201cHow did you find this place?\u201d</p><p>He smiles, gesturing for me to take a seat on the blanket he\u2019s spread out. \u201cMy grandfather told me about it.\u201d He lights a couple of lanterns.</p><p>Water is lapping over rocks and crickets are chirping as Ty reaches into a backpack and pul s out sub sandwiches, potato salad, and chocolate-chip cookies, my favorite.</p><p>\u201cYou real y know the way to a girl\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>He piles some potato salad on a paper plate and passes it to me. \u201cWel , not every girl\u2019s heart. Just yours.\u201d My face heats up. If I had never heard that Henry loved me, would I stil be completely crazy over Ty? Probably.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say, biting into my meatbal sub, \u201cwhat do you like to do when you\u2019re not playing footbal or washing like to do when you\u2019re not playing footbal or washing dishes or control ing Vanessa\u2019s social life?\u201d</p><p>Ty wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cWel , control ing Vanessa\u2019s social life is my whole reason for being, but when I\u2019m not doing that, I like reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReading? What do you like to read?\u201d</p><p>Ty laughs. \u201cBooks...they\u2019re these things with paper and words.\u201d</p><p>I flick a forkful of potato salad at him, which he dodges. \u201cI know that, asshole. What kinds of books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like reading about history, you know, the Civil and Revolutionary Wars. I\u2019m thinking about being a history major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I say. Hel , I know nothing about wars, and I barely pul a B in history class. How smart is he?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you like to do when you\u2019re not playing footbal , Woods?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shoveling potato salad in my mouth as I think about my journal. But if I don\u2019t even feel comfortable tel ing my best friends about it, how could I tel Ty? \u201cUm, I like to play games. Like cards and foosbal . I like running, and I like chal enges and races too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, as in women\u2019s bathing suits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardy har har,\u201d I say, giggling. \u201cFor real y though, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue. And you?\u201d</p><p>My first reaction is to say blue too, but then thoughts of Henry\u2019s green eyes pop into my head. Ugh. I mean, here I am, sitting in my own personal Eden with Ty as tempting as Eve\u2019s apple, and I\u2019m thinking about a guy who I thought was my best friend. A best friend who ditched me the moment things got rough.</p><p>\u201cI like blue too,\u201d I say, rebel ing against green. I don\u2019t care how much my heart wanted me to pick that color.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>I focus on my sub sandwich, demolishing it, then I move on to the cookies.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night...\u201d Ty says.</p><p>\u201cYup. I love fal ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. It\u2019s my favorite season...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine too...\u201d I eat another cookie.</p><p>Do we have anything to talk about?</p><p>When we\u2019re hooking up, it seems like we have lots to talk about, but maybe that\u2019s because we\u2019re too busy kissing. This lack of conversation, this isn\u2019t what love is supposed to be like, right? But what happens when you don\u2019t find that right person? Do you just spend the rest of your life in a relationship where the conversation isn\u2019t great, everything isn\u2019t perfect, but it is nice and sweet?</p><p>Knowing how much I\u2019m missing Henry, should I even be with this guy?</p><p>Maybe I could deal with unrequited love, but since I know Henry does love me, it\u2019s not real y unrequited. It\u2019s...unaccepted love? Avoided love? Abandoned love?</p><p>When the cookies are al gone, I lie back on the blanket and stare up at the emerging stars, trying to think about nothing but Ty and waterfal s and blue eyes. prepping for the state championship the count? 45 days since the fight with henry</p><p>The day before the state championship, I\u2019m feeling down. Isn\u2019t senior year of high school supposed to be the best year of my life? What a bust.</p><p>\u201cWoods?\u201d JJ says, knocking me out of this pity trance I\u2019ve been drowning in for a week. We\u2019re sitting at Joe\u2019s. \u201cYou gonna eat that?\u201d JJ points at my untouched plate of spaghetti, then leans across the table and feels my forehead with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cStop it, man. I\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, batting his hand away.</p><p>\u201cEat. You need your carbs for the game.\u201d</p><p>I salute JJ, then dig in, forking up some saucy noodles and lifting them to my mouth. \u201cYou nervous about the game?\u201d I say through a mouthful.</p><p>\u201cHel yeah.\u201d Using his non-fork hand, JJ clicks his pen incessantly. \u201cBut as long as you\u2019re the one playing, I\u2019l be fine.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. Sure, Ty\u2019s a tad control ing, but he\u2019s a quarterback! \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem with Ty?\u201d</p><p>JJ shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve told you. He\u2019s picky. You don\u2019t see what he\u2019s like in the locker room, looking down on al of us, nagging us about how we don\u2019t tuck our jerseys in right, or how Carter made a block using the wrong part of his shoulder. I mean, what\u2019s that about? I honestly don\u2019t know what you see in him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I focus on my pasta. \u201cHe\u2019s sweet, he\u2019s nice to me, he\u2019s hot. Let\u2019s be honest, there aren\u2019t a lot of options around here.\u201d I use my fork to point at him. \u201cLike you said, Lacey\u2019s a good lay, right?\u201d</p><p>JJ bows his head toward me, obviously conceding.</p><p>\u201cHey, if the sex is good, what else do you need, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell , um, I bet sex might be better if you\u2019re actual y in love, you know?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs. \u201cPass the Parmesan, wil you?\u201d</p><p>I pick up the cheese and pass it to JJ, feeling deflated. With Henry gone, I have no one to talk to except my journal, and it can\u2019t ever talk back.</p><p>\u201cLook, Carter and I don\u2019t care if you date Ty. But Henry...\u201d</p><p>This surprises me, because this is the first time JJ</p><p>has brought up Henry since this stupid feud started.</p> <p>\u201cWhy? What did he say?\u201d</p><p>JJ clicks his pen, hesitating. \u201cJust that he can\u2019t stand being around you while you\u2019re dating Ty and he thinks you\u2019ve chosen Ty over us.\u201d</p><p>I drop my fork. \u201cOh, that\u2019s total bul shit, JJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tel Henry that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure...but I think he\u2019s gotta work this out for himself. And that\u2019s al I\u2019m gonna say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAl I\u2019m gonna say is that first, Henry told me to date Ty. Then he got mad about it. Then I gave Henry the choice of whether I would keep dating Ty or not...and his response was to give Ty a black eye and ignore me for a month and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said this was your fault, Woods. But when did you become the Angel of Drama?\u201d Smiling, he stares at his crossword book. \u201cWhat\u2019s a five-letter word for polo participant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno, man...a shirt? Like a polo shirt?\u201d</p><p>After dropping JJ off at home, I drive. Drive, with no real destination. But then I realize where I want to go. Soon I find myself standing beside the Cumberland River, the spot of my last real conversation with Henry. I open my journal and pul a pen from my pocket.</p><p>The dull ache still infests my body like cancer Henry cancer</p><p>Only rather than killing me, this cancer lets me live, in a reduced sort of way</p><p>Without Henry, I\u2019m living 75 percent of my life And maybe some people accept that, settle for that, but I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>I find the log where Henry and I sat over a month ago. I root around beneath the rotting wood, groping for flat stones. I pul out several, stand, and take aim at the river. First I manage two skips. Then three. Wil I ever get up to four? I search for more stones, discovering some brick-like rocks, which I launch into the river, creating big splashes.</p> <p>I skip stones and throw rocks until the sun starts to set. Just as I\u2019m getting ready to leave, I see a large splash in the river, so I jerk around to find the thrower of the rock. And there he is. Henry. Standing there with a handful of rocks, launching them into the river. No one knew I was coming here, so he must\u2019ve just shown up, just like me.</p><p>He stares at the journal in my hand, and then looks away as he picks up more rocks and starts throwing them in the river.</p><p>I drop my journal onto the ground, reach down, and grab a huge stone, almost as big as a cinder block, and hurl it at the water. Then I pick a few flat stones and skip them each three times.</p><p>He picks up a tiny rock, probably no bigger than a golf bal , and flicks it into the river, creating the measliest splash ever. I glance at him, scared to say or do anything. I watch as he reaches down and picks some wildflowers. Sunflowers. Goldenrod. Queen Anne\u2019s lace. He slowly shuffles over and hands me the bouquet.</p><p>My tears are everywhere. I sop them up using my sweatshirt, and when I look at his face, he reaches around his neck and pul s off the silver chain that holds the plastic footbal charm, fingering it. He stares down at the charm, then finds my eyes and puts the chain around my neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I fucked everything up, Jordan,\u201d he says, and then he\u2019s gone.</p><p>Later that evening, I\u2019m huddled in the potting shed with my flashlight, writing in my journal.</p><p>My fears have come true:</p><p>I\u2019m that girl who\u2019s lost all control and perspective because of a guy</p><p>What do I say to Henry?</p><p>Is there anything I could say to make things better?</p><p>I finally have the charm I\u2019ve wanted forever</p><p>But it\u2019s just a shitty piece of plastic if it\u2019s not attached to Henry Al of a sudden the door to the potting shed creaks open and Mom crawls inside with me.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, you\u2019ve been coming here for years. Ever since that first time you and Henry played house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mom real y does know al .</p><p>\u201cYour friends are here.\u201d</p><p>I furiously wipe my wet eyes on my sleeve. \u201cCarter? JJ?\u201d</p><p>Light from the porch il uminates the inside of the shed, so I can see Mom smiling. \u201cCarrie and Marie.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? \u201cWhy are they here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Mom hesitates. \u201cLook, sweetie, I wish you\u2019d talk to someone. I hate watching you keep everything bottled up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not! I\u2019ve been writing in the stupid journal you gave me.\u201d</p><p>Mom puts an arm around my waist and drops her forehead onto my shoulder. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve found another outlet besides footbal . But talking to Carrie might be more helpful than writing in your journal.\u201d</p><p>I think back to when I told Carrie I slept with Ty, and I felt so scared, because she could\u2019ve told everyone. But no one found out. And Marie didn\u2019t make a big deal of being my partner in music appreciation class. I like that she\u2019s kinda low-key, at least compared to the other cheerleaders. Hel , she knows what a flea flicker is.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Want to go inside?\u201d</p><p>I stand up, and together, we go out of the potting shed. Mom holds my hand as we walk through the garden and up to the porch.</p><p>Back in the house, after glancing at my red face in the bathroom mirror, I go to the foyer, where Carrie and Marie are waiting for me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I say.</p><p>When the girls see me, they glance at one another. Carrie clears her throat. \u201cYou okay, Jordan?\u201d</p><p>I wipe my eyes again and force a smile. \u201cOh yeah\u2014</p><p>I\u2019m fine. What are y\u2019al up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie needs your advice,\u201d Marie says, patting Carrie\u2019s back.</p><p>My advice? \u201cIs this some kind of a joke? Did JJ put you up to this?\u201d</p><p>Marie laughs. \u201cNo\u2014for real. Is there someplace we can talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure\u2014let\u2019s go to the basement.\u201d Carrie and Marie fol ow me down the stairs and we plop down on the couches. So now what? Should I offer them a drink?</p><p>What would Henry want?</p><p>\u201cYou guys want to order pizza?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Carrie says.</p><p>\u201cCan we get wings too?\u201d Marie asks.</p><p>\u201cHel yeah,\u201d I say.</p><p>Marie likes wings?</p><p>I grab a menu from the desk, pul out my cel phone, and order the pizza and wings, then sit back down on the couch. \u201cSo what kind of advice do you need? Need my opinion on buying a new pair of cleats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Marie says. \u201cGuy advice.\u201d</p><p>I laugh loudly. \u201cYou must be joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Marie says. \u201cThe issue is that Carrie total y likes Carter, but he doesn\u2019t want to date her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d I exclaim, focusing on Carrie, whose face is al red. \u201cI thought he liked you a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying,\u201d Marie replies.</p><p>\u201cLook, guys,\u201d Carrie says, \u201cI know he likes me. But he doesn\u2019t want to get involved because he thinks Henry is stil hung up on me.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cCarter is so dense.\u201d</p><p>Carrie pauses for a beat. \u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told Carter why you dumped Henry?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tel him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care if I tel him about Henry?\u201d Carrie says, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Or if you\u2019d rather, I can send Carter a text tel ing him to stop being a bonehead.\u201d</p><p>Carrie smiles. \u201cNah, I can do it. Thanks, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that that\u2019s settled, can we play some foosbal ?\u201d</p><p>Marie asks, eyeing the table in the corner.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d I say. The three of us head over to the table and start a tournament. Since they\u2019re guests, I let Marie and Carrie play the first game while I go upstairs and raid the kitchen for sodas.</p><p>When I get downstairs, only three minutes later, Marie says, \u201cYour turn to play me, Jordan. I just slaughtered Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I say, popping a Diet Coke open and setting it on the table. I grab the knobs and start moving my wooden men to hit the bal . One of Marie\u2019s wooden men steals the bal from me and slams it into the goal.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I say. \u201cCarrie, you could\u2019ve warned me that Marie\u2019s a foosbal prodigy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChampion of Cedar Creek Camp, three years running,\u201d Marie replies.</p><p>\u201cSo how are things going with Ty?\u201d Carrie asks, taking a seat on a bar stool and opening her Diet Coke. When I look up from the foosbal table, she\u2019s staring into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Lie.</p><p>\u201cJust fine?\u201d Marie exclaims. She swal ows before asking, \u201cAre you guys, you know, fooling around?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he like in bed?\u201d</p><p>I freeze\u2014I can\u2019t believe she asked that, but he is hot, so I can understand why she\u2019s curious.</p><p>\u201cUnfrickinbelievable.\u201d</p><p>Not a lie.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Marie asks.</p><p>\u201cHooking up isn\u2019t everything,\u201d I say, trying not to think about how much I love Henry. Henry, who\u2019s probably gone forever. Friend or otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love Ty?\u201d Carrie asks quietly.</p><p>I shrug and focus on the foosbal game. \u201cWith Ty, it\u2019s like I have this amazing guy, and he\u2019s sweet and nice, and yeah, unbelievable in bed, but it\u2019s not al there, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of other guys out there,\u201d Marie says as she twirls the knob, knocking the bal into my goal again. \u201cSo if you want to dump Ty, everything wil be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be fine,\u201d I blurt out before realizing I\u2019m speaking.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause Henry\u2019s not around?\u201d Carrie asks, a frown spreading across her face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and if he\u2019s not around, I might as wel be with someone like Ty, right?\u201d</p><p>Marie and Carrie exchange a look again and then Marie says, \u201cIf Henry doesn\u2019t know what an ass he\u2019s being and what he\u2019s missing, then screw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t help,\u201d Carrie says, coming over and resting a hand on my back. \u201cWe\u2019re here if you want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just miss him, that\u2019s al .\u201d I feel tears wel ing again. \u201cI hate that we don\u2019t play cards anymore. I hate waking up alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d Marie replies. She digs the bal out of the goal and drops it back down in the middle of the table, and we start playing again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t know what comes over me, but I feel like ranting.

I\u2019m bouncing up and down on my toes, trying to get warmed up. I wring my hands and, one at a time, I shake my feet, loosening up my ankles.</p><p>A quadzil ion reporters are taking pictures of me. Tons of col ege coaches are here, but none are from Alabama. Mark Tucker isn\u2019t here either. Asshole. The great Donovan Woods is here, sitting in the front row of the stands with Mom, Mike, and Jake Reynolds. The Tennessee head coach is with them, undoubtedly here to take a look at Ty, if he gets to play.</p><p>When I glance at Dad, he smiles and waves. Um, okay? I smile back at him, loving him for spending a whole hour with me this afternoon, watching film. Film!</p><p>Jake Reynolds yel s, \u201cLooking hot, Jor!\u201d and whistles. I shout, \u201cYou\u2019d better not mess up my concentration or I\u2019l bust your kneecaps, perv!\u201d</p><p>Jake laughs.</p><p>Carrie and Marie come jogging up to me, their short red and black skirts whipping around in the wind.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d Marie says, \u201cWho\u2019s the hot guy sitting with your family?\u201d She peers over at Jake, who winks at her, nudges Mike, and points at Marie\u2019s butt. My bro shakes his head and goes back to eating his popcorn.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d I reply, making a gagging noise. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d Marie says, putting her pompoms under an arm so she can examine her fingernails, which look freshly painted. \u201cKristen was asking me who he is.\u201d</p><p>I pause, then burst out laughing. \u201cOh. Wel , they\u2019re perfect for each other! I\u2019l introduce them after the game. Maybe he\u2019l stop bothering me if he gets someone new to harass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then maybe Kristen would stop being obsessed with Ty,\u201d Carrie says, rol ing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a win-win for al of us. So, did you talk to Carter?\u201d I ask Carrie.</p><p>She smiles so hard I think she might faint. \u201cHe asked me out for next Friday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetails!\u201d Marie says.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cooking dinner for me and his parents, and then he\u2019s taking me to a jazz concert thing at the Opryland Hotel in Nashvil e.\u201d</p><p>I feel this strange urge to jump up and down and giggle but decide to say, \u201cThat\u2019s cool. Very romantic,\u201d</p><p>and pat Carrie\u2019s shoulder instead.</p><p>\u201cListen, Jordan,\u201d Marie says. \u201cYou should try the Statue of Liberty play you did at practice the other day.\u201d</p><p>I gaze up at the announcer\u2019s booth at the top of the bleachers and rub my hands together, trying to keep them warm. \u201cYou know, I bet they\u2019re thinking I\u2019l bomb it to Henry first thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Marie replies, nodding.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys even talking about?\u201d Carrie says, sighing, then laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l see,\u201d I say, grinning.</p><p>\u201cCaptains!\u201d the referee shouts.</p><p>\u201cGotta jet,\u201d I tel the girls before turning to run out onto the field.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Jordan!\u201d they cal out, jumping up and down and waving their pompoms.</p><p>JJ and I run out to the fifty-yard line, and when I turn to find Carter, I see him walking over to Carrie. She reaches up and gives him a hug, probably for luck, but then he picks her up and kisses her in front of the then he picks her up and kisses her in front of the entire crowd. Everyone starts clapping and cheering for them, including me and JJ. Henry\u2019s grinning at them too.</p><p>Coach throws his clipboard on the ground and yel s,</p><p>\u201cCarter, get your ass on the field!\u201d</p><p>Pul ing his helmet on, Carter jogs out to us, and both JJ and I shove him around a bit. \u201cThanks for joining us, hot lips,\u201d JJ says.</p><p>We\u2019re playing the game at Vanderbilt University, and since we have the better record, Woodbridge High cal s the toss. They say heads. It lands on tails. I choose to receive the kick.</p><p>I run back to the sidelines, meeting Henry as he goes out to return the kickoff. We knock fists, then he knocks fists with Carter and JJ. I shove thoughts of Henry from my mind\u2014I need to get in the zone, so I turn and look at the Woodbridge bench. A team from Western Tennessee, we\u2019ve never played them before, and neither did my bro. I\u2019ve never seen them play either. But I\u2019ve done my homework.</p><p>The quarterback doesn\u2019t have a great arm, but he\u2019s quick and he\u2019s smart. He knows how to direct the field, but he carries the bal more than anything. I told Carter to focus on containing the QB, or he\u2019l run it. Carter loves to sack the quarterback, but we can\u2019t afford to have him miss, because if the QB escapes, I don\u2019t think anyone on our team has the speed to stop him except Henry. And Henry can\u2019t play both wide receiver and defensive back. Besides, he\u2019s too thin to play defense.</p><p>Speaking of Henry, I also know the Woodbridge kicker has a much more powerful leg than most high school players. \u201cHenry!\u201d I yel when he\u2019s almost into position at the Woodbridge end zone. He sprints back over to the sidelines.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he says, springing up and down, trying to keep his muscles warm.</p><p>\u201cYou know about this dude, right? This kicker?\u201d</p><p>He lifts his helmet a little, and I see him smiling, his green eyes twinkling. Fog spil s out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cObviously, Woods. Why the hel do you think I was playing so far back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust checking.\u201d</p><p>He nods toward the stands. \u201cSo where are the Alabama coaches?\u201d</p><p>I fiddle with my chinstrap and shrug. \u201cNot here, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here?\u201d he exclaims. \u201cBut this is the last time they\u2019l get to see you play this year.\u201d</p><p>I bite into my upper lip as it dawns on me that unless I do what Dad says and look at some other options, this may be the last time I ever real y get to play. The last time I ever huddle under hundreds of lights and smel the freshly painted yard lines and hear fans cheering. The last time I ever throw my perfect spiral in a game.</p><p>\u201cHenry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cRemember that time I was searching for crickets at your game, and the bal went out of bounds and I threw it back to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he says with a grin.</p><p>I return the smile. \u201cWere you mad that I took your position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse not. I could see how much you loved playing bal ...and that made me love the game even more. I\u2019ve always loved catching your passes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Michigan asked you to join their team, but then, like, made it clear you weren\u2019t going to get to play, would you stil wanna go there?\u201d</p><p>He pul s his helmet al the way off and stares at me.</p><p>\u201cNo way. I want to play bal . And if that\u2019s why Alabama isn\u2019t here tonight, then it\u2019s their loss.\u201d He pats my elbow. \u201cYou can do better, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry!\u201d Coach yel s. \u201cCould I trouble you to receive</p><p>\u201cHenry!\u201d Coach yel s. \u201cCould I trouble you to receive the kickoff, or should I send JJ out to do it?\u201d</p><p>Henry runs backward onto the field, staring at me as he puts his helmet back on.</p><p>I jog to the benches, where I stand between JJ and Carter as Woodbridge gets ready to kick off.</p><p>Ty comes up behind me and whispers, \u201cHenry knows about the kicker, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say through gritted teeth. It\u2019s my job to captain this team, not Ty\u2019s. He stil doesn\u2019t get that?</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ty replies.</p><p>Woodbridge kicks off and Henry catches the bal . Sprinting, he makes it to the thirty-yard line before he\u2019s tackled. We al scream and celebrate, yel ing Henry\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cWoods,\u201d Coach says, \u201cTake it up the gut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it, Coach.\u201d To see how good the Woodbridge defense is, Coach wants to test them by running the bal up the middle.</p><p>I jog out to the thirty and huddle with the guys. \u201cStatue of Liberty to Bates.\u201d We al clap our hands once and break. JJ hikes the bal to me, I take three steps back and with my right hand, I pretend to throw the bal to Henry, who\u2019s running up the right side of the field. This causes most of the defense to change direction, and when they do, I hand the bal off with my left hand to Bates, who grabs it and darts up the middle of the field. The Statue of Liberty trick only works occasional y, but with this experiment, I can see that the defense is expecting me to pass every chance I get. Bates makes it eleven yards before getting tackled.</p><p>We run up to the line and I yel , \u201cBlue fifty, red twenty, blue fifty, red thirty!\u201d Red thirty is the cue. JJ hikes the bal and I throw it down the field to Higgins. A cornerback is al over him, and Higgins misses the bal and crashes to the ground. Incomplete. Damn it. The Woodbridge defense might be better than I thought. If we want to score, Henry\u2019s our best chance, but the defense is doubling up on him.</p><p>We huddle. \u201cPost route to Henry. Take a hard left at the twenty-yard line,\u201d I say. Henry claps his hands. JJ</p><p>hikes the bal , and Henry takes off down the field so fast he confuses the Woodbridge defensive line. At the twenty, a cornerback catches up to Henry, but Henry takes a quick left and catches my perfect pass and darts off. Taking huge strides, he barely beats the cornerback to the end zone.</p><p>Touchdown! I jump and yel and rip off my helmet. I pump my fist as we jog back to the sidelines, where I grab Henry by the jersey. \u201cNice!\u201d I say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I drink some Gatorade as I watch our kicker make the extra point, after which our defense runs out onto the field, led by Carter. Not al owing Woodbridge to get a first down is tougher than usual for us, but Carter manages to sack their QB once. But they stil make it into field goal range. On fourth down, they go for a field goal from the twenty-five-yard line and score. We\u2019re up 7\u20133 when I run back onto the field.</p><p>Huddling with the guys, I say, \u201cThis time, Woodbridge is gonna be al over Henry. We\u2019ve gotta throw them off a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Henry asks. He puts his hands on his hips.</p><p>I\u2019m so nervous, I\u2019m sweating, so I wipe my hands on my towel. \u201cRed Rabbit to Bates?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Henry says with a clap.</p><p>JJ hikes the bal , I make a short ten-yard pass to Henry, he catches it and as the defense moves in to clobber him, he pitches it to Bates, who runs it up the left side of the field. He goes another ten yards before getting tackled.</p><p>\u201cHot!\u201d I yel as we move up to the line. I give Henry a high five, then squeeze Bates\u2019 forearm. Our victory doesn\u2019t last long, because the defense steps up their doesn\u2019t last long, because the defense steps up their game. I\u2019m not able to get another first down.</p><p>When\u2019s the last time that happened? Last year\u2019s state championship.</p><p>On the sidelines, I sip my Gatorade and try to relax. I turn and look at my family, and Mike and Jake raise their fists at me. When I look at Dad, he gives me a thumbs up. Whoa.</p> <p>By halftime, the score is stil 7\u20133 Hundred Oaks, but the guys are pumped and we haven\u2019t lost our spirit. As we\u2019re running for the locker room, I see Dad and Mike waving Ty over to the bleachers. Ty jogs over and shakes hands with the Tennessee head coach.</p><p>I feel jealous because I know the Tennessee coach is taking Ty seriously. He\u2019s treating Ty like a real player, not some meal ticket, some beauty queen, some poster girl. But I\u2019m the one who\u2019s holding her own against Woodbridge; stil , none of these col ege coaches think of me as a real player. No one has made an offer except for Alabama. Every time a recruiter comes to a game, it\u2019s Henry and Carter and Ty they\u2019re looking at. Not me. Which I don\u2019t get, because girl or not, I\u2019m an amazing footbal player. That\u2019s what it should come down to, right? That I can throw an awesome perfect spiral.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know what Dad was talking about when he said I should consider al options. Are there other options?</p><p>The third quarter starts, and I hear Coach through the speaker in my helmet. \u201cWoods, run the bal for the first play. See how far Bates can get. As soon as we\u2019re within thirty yards of the end zone, bomb it to Henry. He can run faster than any of these Woodbridge players.\u201d</p><p>I do as Coach says. We run the bal until we\u2019re almost at the thirty-yard line. There, I yel , \u201cBlue fortytwo! Blue forty-two! Red seventeen!\u201d</p><p>JJ hikes the bal to me and I take five steps back as Henry darts down the field. The defense is blitzing. Oh hel . The entire defense is coming at me. My offensive line is being pummeled. JJ can\u2019t hold off both the safety and the linebacker who are trying to get at me. JJ chooses to block the safety. Henry\u2019s nearing the end zone, and I only have about a second before the linebacker wil crash into me. I\u2019ve gotta get rid of the bal . Now. Just as I hurl it, the linebacker hits me low and hard, and I\u2019m crushed to the ground. Then I hear our stands erupt.</p> <p>\u201cTouchdown!\u201d</p><p>JJ yel s, \u201cSuck it, fools!\u201d</p><p>And for a second, I\u2019m celebrating, but then the pain hits me. Something is very, very wrong with my knee. I scream.</p><p>He Stopped To Get Flowers?</p><p>Grasping at my left knee, I\u2019m crying, but not because of the pain, but because I am terrified. What the hel did I do to my knee? Did I hear a crack? Did something rip?</p><p>A tendon? My ACL? Oh God...my future...</p><p>Both Henry and Ty fal down next to me, Ty on my right, Henry on my left. Everyone\u2019s yel ing.</p><p>\u201cJust stay stil , okay?\u201d Henry says, careful y pul ing off my helmet. He runs a hand over my hair.</p> <p>\u201cJordan, are you okay? Talk to me, Jordan,\u201d Ty begs.</p><p>\u201cOh God, please be okay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, stop crying,\u201d JJ says, pul ing Ty off me and dragging him away. Thank God.</p><p>Henry takes my hand. \u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnee,\u201d I say, panting.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not going to let anyone touch you,\u201d Henry says as al the guys huddle around me. \u201cCarter!\u201d he cal s out, \u201cGet these fools away from us!\u201d Tears are pooling in my eyes, but I\u2019m trying to show a brave face for my team, for Henry, who\u2019s caressing my hand. I\u2019m stil staring up at Henry\u2019s face when Coach kneels down next to me, but I don\u2019t hear what he\u2019s saying because al I can concentrate on is the pain and Henry\u2019s fingers. But one voice knocks me out of this Henry trance: Donovan Woods\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNobody touch her!\u201d Dad says, kneeling down next to us. \u201cTalk to me, Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her left knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hel \u2014that\u2019s the leg she plants to throw.\u201d Wait, Dad cares about if my knee wil be in good enough shape to throw passes in the future? \u201cHas she tried to move it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I didn\u2019t let anyone else touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man,\u201d Dad replies, pul ing a cel phone from his pocket. I listen as he cal s the Titans\u2019 team doctor and tel s him to meet us at Vanderbilt Hospital. Then he cal s for an ambulance. \u201cI don\u2019t want to risk further hurting your knee, so we\u2019re going to do this right.\u201d</p><p>A referee says, \u201cCoach Mil er, let\u2019s get her off the field so we can keep playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hel you wil ,\u201d Dad says, glaring at the ref, who puts his hands up and moves away.</p><p>When the ambulance final y comes, Dad and Henry get into it with me. The pain is nowhere near as intense as before, so I\u2019m able to speak. \u201cHenry...the game? You should play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d Henry says. In the past twenty minutes, he\u2019s barely let go of my hand. And I\u2019m loving it. Maybe I should\u2019ve hurt myself a month ago, I chuckle to myself.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>He cradles my neck with his hand. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I reply, biting my lips together. He gives me a slight smile and says, \u201cEverything\u2019s okay,\u201d and then gets back on the phone.</p><p>Dad cal s his doctor again, tel ing him what\u2019s up, what my knee looks like, saying that from one to ten, I\u2019m at a six on the pain scale. I don\u2019t even know what the hel that scale is supposed to mean. What does ten represent? Getting your head chopped off? Is one a paper cut?</p><p>At the hospital, the EMTs push me down the hal as Dad storms around making demands, private rooms and portable X-ray machines and shit, but Henry keeps holding my hand. Having driven separately, Mom comes rushing in behind us, taking my other hand.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I say to Mom.</p><p>\u201cHe stayed with the Tennessee coach to watch Ty. We couldn\u2019t leave your boyfriend there alone.\u201d</p><p>The EMTs bypass the emergency room and wheel The EMTs bypass the emergency room and wheel me right into my own room, which reeks of sterilizer and hospital food, but I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to share. Having the great Donovan Woods for a father does have its perks. The EMTs careful y move me from the rol ing stretcher to the bed and wish me luck. A technician comes in with a portable X-ray machine.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Dad asks the technician. \u201cIf you make the damage worse and ruin her dreams of playing footbal in col ege I\u2019l \u2014\u201d</p><p>The technician drops the lead blanket he was about to drape over my abdomen onto the floor. He looks like he\u2019s going to shit his pants. So does Henry, who\u2019s gaping at Dad. I\u2019m gawking too. Dad cares about my dreams?</p><p>\u201cDonovan, please,\u201d Mom says, grabbing Dad\u2019s hand and pul ing him away to sit in a chair. The technician careful y cuts my footbal pants away from my left knee and slides a cool, metal plate beneath it.</p><p>\u201cAny chance you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d the technician says as he pul s the X-ray lamp over my swol en knee.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Henry and Dad say at the same time.</p><p>Laughing, the technician says to me, \u201cThat true?\u201d</p><p>I nod. He takes X-rays from a bazil ion angles and then leaves. Standing up, Henry runs a hand over my hair. \u201cCan I get you a soda, Woods? Anything you need, I\u2019m your guy.\u201d</p><p>Using my finger, I beckon him closer and closer until his ear is right in front of my mouth. \u201cStay with me. Please. Sit here. I\u2019m so scared.\u201d</p><p>He whispers back, \u201cI won\u2019t leave until you tel me to. Promise.\u201d Henry takes a seat and grabs my hand again. \u201cWoods, what do you cal a ghost with a broken leg?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hobblin\u2019 goblin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, you\u2019re so embarrassing, Henry,\u201d I say, giggling.</p><p>It turns out the only thing on TV Friday night is reruns o f Cops, so Henry and I watch an episode while we wait on the team doctor and the X-rays. Our favorite story line involves a woman who cal ed the cops because some men stole her jeans. When the cops ask her why she needs the jeans back so badly, she replies, \u201cBecause my heroin is in them!\u201d Together, we laugh so hard at the woman\u2019s stupidity, it\u2019s almost like before.</p><p>The team doctor final y shows up to examine my leg. Dad wouldn\u2019t let any of the other staff look at it before Dr. Freeman got here. First, the two of them study the X-ray images of my knee more intently than they\u2019d study</p><p>the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Whispering, Dr. Freeman points at my ligaments and Dad moves in close to examine whatever he\u2019s talking about. Then the doctor comes over and flexes my knee a few times. It hurts like hel , but I don\u2019t feel anything popping and I don\u2019t hear any strange noises coming from it. If I had to, I bet I could walk.</p><p>Dr. Freeman squeezes my knee. \u201cDoes this hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I reply.</p><p>He squeezes it in a different place. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you just sprained it. Nothing\u2019s torn, nothing\u2019s broken. You\u2019l be up and walking around by tomorrow. Tonight, I just want to wrap it, but for the next couple months, you and I are gonna do some physical therapy, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say.</p><p>Smiling, I laugh, suddenly feeling relieved. About my knee, about my future. Mom and Dad hug me, then Henry does. I\u2019m the luckiest girl alive today, so I take a risk and give Henry a quick peck on the cheek before he pul s away from me. Staring in my eyes, he purses his lips and sits down with me again, holding my hand.

Are you okay?\u201d He hands me the flowers and drags a hand across my hair.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smel the flowers and whisper, \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2014just a sprain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Ty says, leaning toward my lips. As he kisses me in front of everyone, I open my eyes for a quick peek at Henry. His face is blank as he stares out the window. He drops my hand as Ty continues to kiss me and stroke my cheek.</p> <p>\u201cGet a room,\u201d Jake says loudly.</p><p>I pul away from Ty. \u201cThe game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won!\u201d</p><p>Henry and I shout, \u201cHel yeah!\u201d and \u201cAwesome!\u201d and</p><p>\u201cState champions!\u201d and knock fists. \u201cThe score?\u201d</p> <p>Henry asks.</p><p>\u201c14\u20133,\u201d Ty says, looking only at me. \u201cWe never scored again after you left. I was a wreck. I threw an interception.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cYou? When\u2019s the last time you did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Henry guffaws. Ty scowls at Henry, then whispers to me, \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be fine. Couple weeks of physical therapy and I\u2019l be a brand new quarterback.\u201d</p> <p>Ty closes his eyes, nodding. \u201cJordan, tonight was horrifying for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you?\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cYeah...I couldn\u2019t handle it if anything serious happened to you,\u201d Ty whispers. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only going to be worse at the col ege level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, I\u2019m not going to quit because I sprained my knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so scared something wil happen to you. You\u2019re, like, one of the only things I have left.\u201d</p><p>Poor Vanessa. She\u2019l have to live with Ty\u2019s paranoia forever, but at least I have a choice. I won\u2019t do something just because my boyfriend thinks I should. Not anymore. I never should\u2019ve let Ty tel me Henry couldn\u2019t sleep over.</p><p>Maybe my life needs some physical therapy too.</p><p>I\u2019m Jordan Woods. I lead a sixty-person footbal team, and I\u2019ve been letting everyone else shape me. I want to be a rock again.</p> <p>\u201cTy\u2014I\u2019m not going to quit. You\u2019l just have to get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight was just a sprain. But you could get permanently hurt in col ege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think she knows that, man?\u201d Henry says, taking my hand again.</p><p>When Ty sees our hands together, I think he\u2019s going to get mad, but he gazes over at my dad, who\u2019s standing by the window.</p><p>\u201cMr. Woods? You agree with me, right?\u201d Ty says. Dad rocks to his left side, shifts his weight, and coughs. \u201cI might try to discourage my daughter from playing footbal , but I\u2019d never stop her from doing anything she loves. That\u2019s her decision. If I had any say, I never would\u2019ve let her join that Pop Warner team when she was seven.\u201d</p><p>Mom smiles at Dad and rubs his neck. I can\u2019t believe Dad feels this way. It\u2019s true\u2014he never has told me I can\u2019t play footbal . Though I\u2019m scared about my knee, I can\u2019t play footbal . Though I\u2019m scared about my knee, I feel happier than I have in a long time. I mean, it\u2019s not like I have Dad\u2019s total support, but even having his blessing to do what I love is huge.</p><p>Ty\u2019s face goes red. \u201cFine...whatever you want to do, Woods. I\u2019ve gotta get home to check on Vanessa. I\u2019l cal you later.\u201d He kisses my forehead and leaves. I shut my eyes, and then I feel Henry moving closer to me. He whispers in my ear, \u201cLet me know if you need anything, okay?\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s doctor just told me my knee should be fine in a few weeks. Stil , this injury terrifies me. What terrifies me even more?</p><p>What happens next with Henry.</p><p>Knowing that my knee isn\u2019t royally messed up, I feel like I\u2019ve been given a free play.</p><p>A chance to make some choices.</p><p>Henry was right\u2014I let everyone else\u2019s feelings affect my decisions.</p><p>Screw that.</p><p>I\u2019m taking the ball and running with it.</p><p>Maybe they\u2019re not my top choices, but they\u2019re choices that are good for me, choices I can live with.</p><p>Some things I can\u2019t control; but some things I can. And I\u2019m going to.</p><p>First I go to Dad\u2019s study, the girl-free zone, and use one of my crutches to push the door open.</p><p>\u201cDad? You know how you said I should consider al options?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he says, peering up from the sports\u2019 section of the Tennessean.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering...if maybe you can...maybe you could...help me come up with some other options?\u201d</p><p>Dad sets the newspaper down on his desk, leans back in his chair, and stares up at the ceiling. A smile blooms.</p><p>\u201cLet me see what I can come up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t get it,\u201d Ty says, laughing and running a hand across his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re great, and I real y love hanging out with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking up with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I reach out and touch his arm, and he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. Every girl at Hundred Oaks wants to go out with me...and you\u2019re breaking up with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this because of Henry?\u201d he asks, confusion creeping across his face.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s real y not. You\u2019re great\u2014I just know you\u2019re not the right guy for me. And it\u2019s not fair to either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry I asked you to give up footbal . It was stupid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I get that you\u2019re scared of what might happen to me...to anyone you care about. I understand everything you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this because I\u2019m a better footbal player?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ty,\u201d I say with a laugh. \u201cSometimes you just aren\u2019t supposed to be with someone. You can\u2019t control everything, no matter how much you want to.\u201d</p><p>And even if Henry doesn\u2019t want to talk to me, I can stil talk to him.</p><p>After school on Monday, I hobble over to Henry\u2019s rusty maroon truck, being careful to mind my knee, and tuck a note under his windshield wiper.</p><p>Dear Sam\u2014I\u2019m here. Whenever you\u2019re ready. Love, Jordan</p><p>One Week Since</p><p>On this lame Friday afternoon, I\u2019m lying on my bed, alternating between fiddling with the plastic footbal charm and writing in my journal. I write:</p><p>No best friend + no boyfriend = no plans and no life Neither of my parents has mentioned my breakup with Ty except to say they\u2019re stil going to help him get through col ege, and Mom wil keep taking Vanessa on shopping trips because she doesn\u2019t trust Ty or his grandfather with such an important responsibility. Henry? Wel , after I left him the note, several strange gifts started showing up. Like a giant stuffed panda holding a bag of chocolate-chip cookies. I devoured the cookies in about two minutes, but why the hel would he get me a panda?</p><p>In retaliation for the stupid panda, I cal ed Marie and Carrie, and together, we dressed the thing up in girly clothes and smeared makeup on it. Then we wrote Henry\u2019s name on its white fur in lipstick and put it out in front of the school. Pretty lame, I know, but it actual y made Henry laugh when he saw it. I spied on him from a window.</p><p>Then, the other night, Chinese food was delivered with a special fortune cookie. A handwritten fortune taped to the plastic read, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Woods.\u201d So I tried to cal and thank him, but he didn\u2019t pick his phone up. Of course.</p><p>In response, I had a pizza delivered to him with a message that read, \u201cI forgive you. Stop being a bonehead\u201d in olives. Apparently, my message barely fit on an extra large pizza! Man, Henry hates olives. Then yesterday, a deck of cards, a pair of salt and pepper shakers, and a blank journal showed up outside the door to my room. I love the new journal\u2014 it\u2019s leather bound and the paper smel s wonderful. And it makes me feel good, that maybe my interest in writing isn\u2019t total y lame, that I can be publicly proud of myself for something other than footbal .</p><p>But why can\u2019t the boy just freaking talk to me? Why al the covert shit?</p><p>My dad pokes his head in my room. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>I hide my journal under the pil ow and pick up my footbal . \u201cSure,\u201d I reply, sitting up.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the knee feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see you extend it,\u201d Dad says, picking up my right foot and pushing and pul ing my leg in and out several times. \u201cGood. You\u2019re healing up nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I drop my foot back on the bed and start tossing my bal .</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing this weekend?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>\u201cNo plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about taking a little trip with me? I don\u2019t have a game on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going? The beach? God, I could so use some heat and some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>Dad sits on my bed with me. \u201cI was thinking Michigan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichigan?\u201d I say, sticking out my tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s colder there than it is here! Why the hel would we go there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted other options, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I know I can\u2019t stop you from playing bal in col ege, but if you\u2019re going to play, I want you to go someplace where you\u2019l be taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike where?\u201d</p><p>Dad takes a deep breath. \u201cWant to take a trip up to Michigan State with me? Their head coach is interested in you. He\u2019s an honest guy\u2014I played against interested in you. He\u2019s an honest guy\u2014I played against him in col ege.\u201d</p><p>I laugh loudly. When I said options, I meant Florida or Ole Miss or Tennessee, even. \u201cGive up Alabama for Michigan State? Are you freaking kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan\u2014if you go to Alabama, I know you\u2019l be doing great things like the charity program with foster kids. There\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019l ever actual y hit the field, but there\u2019s a 100 percent chance they\u2019re going to make you do stuff like model for their calendar.\u201d</p><p>I nod, clutching my pil ow. \u201cMichigan State would actual y let me play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you keep playing like you are now, yes.\u201d</p><p>Dad smiles. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen some of your tapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the guys on the team wil be sexist?\u201d</p><p>Dad laughs. \u201cProbably. But there, at least you\u2019l get to play. And the coach promised me you won\u2019t be paraded around like a piece of meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d</p><p>Dad musses my hair. \u201cSo, what do you say? Can we at least go talk to the Michigan State coach? Maybe throw a bal around with some of his wide receivers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it. When do we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can leave now. Get your bags packed. Bring some cleats.\u201d Dad stands up and walks out the door, but then pokes his head back in. \u201cBy the way, we\u2019re taking Henry with us. He doesn\u2019t know it yet, but we\u2019re going to stop by the University of Michigan too. I told his mom to keep him home until we get there.\u201d Dad grins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I drop the suitcase I just pul ed out of the closet.</p><p>\u201cHenry?\u201d I say, gasping. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014you are. Henry has worked too hard and too long on getting into Michigan to blow it now. He deserves this. And you and I are going to support him.\u201d</p><p>I nod and avert my eyes, which are starting to tear up again.</p> <p>Dad sighs. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you and Henry work through whatever has been going on since September?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to him about this, Dad. Not me. I\u2019ve been ready to work through it for weeks and weeks.\u201d</p><p>Dad shuts the door, comes back in, and picks up the footbal , twirling it in his hands. \u201cWhat happened exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHonest to God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest to God.\u201d</p><p>I touch the plastic footbal charm. \u201cDid you know that Henry liked me? As, um, more than a friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Who didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we al thought you weren\u2019t interested.\u201d</p> <p>This conversation with Dad is going far better than I ever could\u2019ve imagined. Who is this strange Donovan Woods impersonator? \u201cWhen I found out that Henry likes me, wel liked me, as more than a friend, I went to him. I told him I was up for it. For trying...you know...to have a relationship?\u201d</p><p>Dad nods.</p><p>\u201cHe said we couldn\u2019t date, but that we would stil be friends. But he got weird anyway. He got mad about Ty and said some mean things. He never stopped to think about how much he was hurting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say about Ty?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tel Dad about how Ty didn\u2019t want me and Henry sharing a bed, so I say, \u201cI told Henry that I couldn\u2019t do something with him because I was going to hang out with Ty. Then he said al this crap about Ty trying to control everything, and that I let everyone control me, which is probably true, but Henry just went nuts, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like Henry was jealous. His pride was hurt. So he acted like an ass. Every guy does that from time So he acted like an ass. Every guy does that from time to time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. But I\u2019ve been trying to make up, but he doesn\u2019t even return my cal s.\u201d</p><p>Dad twirls the bal again. \u201cSo do you stil like him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI loved the old Henry. I barely know this new Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it sounds like even if you went to him and told him how much you love him, it wouldn\u2019t matter, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. \u2019Cause I already tried. Doesn\u2019t that suck?\u201d</p><p>Dad smiles. \u201cA wise man once said, \u2018Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hel said that? Gandhi?\u201d</p><p>Dad laughs. \u201cCharlie Brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought comics were supposed to be funny.\u201d</p><p>Dad tosses the bal to me. \u201cOne thing I learned a long time ago is that even if you think you\u2019re meant to be with someone, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you get to be with them.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re depressing too, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Thinking of Mom, I say, \u201cDoes that mean you, uh, didn\u2019t marry the person you wanted to be with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I married the right girl. It just took a while to get her attention. Why the hel would a woman like your mom be interested in a jerk like me?\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cThere is that.\u201d</p><p>Dad picks up a picture of me and Henry from the shelf, a picture taken at Lake Jordan when we were thirteen. In the photo, I\u2019m grinning at a trout I\u2019ve just caught. And Henry\u2019s smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d Dad says, running his fingers over the picture, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone run faster than Henry after you hurt your knee last week.\u201d</p><p>Trips</p><p>We pul up in front of Henry\u2019s trailer, and Dad goes inside. A few minutes later, he comes out pul ing a struggling Henry by an elbow and stuffs him in the back of the Audi.</p><p>\u201cYo, Woods.\u201d With dark circles under his eyes, Henry seems miserable.</p><p>\u201cHi, Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the knee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter, thanks.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s al we say the entire way to the airport. Dad has chartered a private jet to Ann Arbor so he doesn\u2019t have to \u201cdeal with the masses\u201d on a commercial flight. On the plane, Dad makes us play a game of Monopoly with him and I kick ass, buying up Park Place, Boardwalk, and al those green properties that are worth a shitload. After Henry lands on Boardwalk, where I\u2019ve just built a hotel, he has to mortgage his lame purple and orange properties. I giggle maniacal y. Henry shakes his head at me and pouts. But now that we\u2019re actual y playing a game together, I\u2019ve seen smiles trickle across his face a few times.</p><p>After checking into the hotel, where Dad has reserved three rooms for us, he tel s us we\u2019re going out to dinner with the University of Michigan head coach. I throw my suitcase on the bed, unzip the bag, and pul out this new dress Carrie and Marie helped me buy, this black sweater skirt thing with short sleeves, and pair it with black boots. I want to look pretty for Henry because tonight is important for him, so I also put on some mascara and lip gloss.</p><p>I\u2019m brushing my hair as my phone rings. I check the cal er ID. Ty. I pul a deep breath and answer.</p><p>\u201cHey, Woods,\u201d he says.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cHey. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His voice sounds fine. Upbeat. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks, so I tel him about the impromptu trip to Michigan, which surprises him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Alabama?\u201d</p><p>I tel him it\u2019s probably not the right school for me, which surprises him more. \u201cDad thinks Michigan State might be a good fit for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Ty says. \u201cText me after you meet the coach\u2014I want to know how it goes. Michigan State\u2019s a great program.\u201d</p><p>I smile at my reflection in the mirror. \u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother cal ed and asked if I want to come to a party tomorrow night in Knoxvil e. You know, after his game against LSU?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I just wanted to see if that\u2019s okay with you. I mean, that I\u2019m hanging out with your bro\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d I say, stil smiling.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere might be girls at the party. I, um\u2014\u201d Ty pauses to cough.</p><p>I had wondered, if I found out Ty was dating someone else, if my heart would lurch, but it\u2019s stil .</p><p>\u201cHave a great time. We\u2019re cool.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m glad he\u2019s wil ing to have fun, to let go, even if it\u2019s only one night. Maybe he\u2019l relax a bit.</p><p>I chat with Ty for a few more minutes, arguing over who\u2019l win in Sunday\u2019s Colts-Texans matchup, and I tel him to hang close to my brother at the party and to steer clear of Jake Reynolds and al his possibly STDridden minions. Someone knocks on the door, so I grab my coat and Someone knocks on the door, so I grab my coat and wal et, and step out into the hal , finding Henry standing there in a suit and blue tie, which brings out the aqua flecks in his green eyes. I\u2019ve never seen him so dressed up before.</p><p>Smiling, I say, \u201cDamn, Henry, you clean up wel .\u201d</p><p>He smiles back at me. \u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>I rol my eyes. \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Henry ushers me toward the elevator. From the corner of my eye, I see him looking me up and down. \u201cYou look real y pretty.\u201d</p><p>Outside the hotel, we hop into Dad\u2019s town car and head to some fancy French restaurant where I won\u2019t know what anything on the menu is. Too bad Carter\u2019s not here.</p><p>The restaurant is dark and romantic and ful of flowers, and I find myself wishing it was just me and Henry here, huddled over wine and champagne and cr\u00eapes or some shit like that. As we walk beneath beautiful chandeliers, alongside a wal made up of mirrors, my hand moves without permission, linking with Henry\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Woods,\u201d he says, taking a deep breath. He keeps holding my hand as we approach our table, where two men are waiting for us. They introduce themselves as the head and offensive coaches for the University of Michigan. After introductions, we sit down and I have a fit trying to decide what to order because it\u2019s al in French.</p><p>Fol owing a bunch of smal talk about the university and the Titans and how Mom and Mike are doing, the head coach takes a sip of wine and says, \u201cSo, Henry...</p><p>my recruiter liked what he saw in Tennessee, and I love your speed, but you\u2019l have to work extra hard on finishing your routes.\u201d What the coach means is some wide receivers get lazy if they know the bal isn\u2019t coming to them, so they won\u2019t run hard or try to fake out a cornerback. This is a dead giveaway to the defensive back that this wil be a running play or the bal wil be thrown to a different wide receiver. Crazy. I\u2019d never even noticed that about Henry. This coach must\u2019ve watched the tapes closely. And I have a lot to learn.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Henry says. \u201cIs there anything else I should do to improve my game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust keep working on your speed and your explosiveness, and I think you\u2019l fit right in here.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze Henry\u2019s hand under the table as a smile edges on the sides of his lips.</p><p>The next day, a car takes me, Dad, and Henry out to East Lansing\u2014home of the Michigan State Spartans. Dad told me not to wear a dress, but my sweats and knee brace and cleats, which makes me excited. I might get to throw a bal around with some col ege guys today!</p><p>Again, I did my homework last night\u2014Googling on my laptop\u2014so when we arrive, I recognize the head coach and the athletic director, who are waiting to greet us when we pul up outside the stadium. I expect it\u2019s because the great Donovan Woods is with us, so it surprises me when Coach Bryson shakes my hand first.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so happy you agreed to come take a look at our program,\u201d the coach says, staring in my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed watching your tapes. You\u2019ve got a lot of style on the field, Woods.\u201d Judging by his smile and firm handshake, he seems genuine. I think he actual y wants me here, unlike crazy Coach Thompson at Alabama.</p><p>Coach Bryson and the athletic director shake hands with Dad and Henry too, and then we\u2019re off to see the inside of Spartan Stadium. Another good sign? I don\u2019t have to see al sorts of lame things like where to buy shampoo and where to see a piano recital; we go straight to the field, where a bunch of guys are standing around. I count at least thirty players.</p><p>They have a game versus Notre Dame today, their biggest game of the year, so I\u2019m glad half of the team has time for me. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s al because of Dad, but regardless, it makes me feel pretty damned good. The stadium is just as beautiful as Alabama\u2019s. Maybe even more so. I take a knee and run my hand over the natural grass, digging my fingers into the blades, then gaze up at the bleachers. The place is so huge, I bet you could see it from space. I love the cool weather; it would be fun to play a bunch of games in snow.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Coach Bryson asks, kneeling down next to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hel of a lot better than Astroturf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he says, laughing. Another plus? Coach Bryson clearly doesn\u2019t care if I use language unbecoming of a lady.</p><p>\u201cI love the stadium,\u201d I say. \u201cIt has a lot of character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014I\u2019ve always felt like it\u2019s alive, you know? Kind of like New York City.\u201d</p> <p>I nod, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWant to meet some of the guys?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely! I mean, if they want to meet me.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but wonder where the other thirty team members are. Could they be anti-girl, like the guys at Alabama?</p><p>\u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t tel them they had to come out early today. They were beside themselves when I told them you were coming to visit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReal y?\u201d I say. Henry snorts. Being on this field is giving me confidence, so I turn and say, \u201cShut up, Henry! Would you stop being so freaking jealous al the time?\u201d</p><p>Dad and Coach Bryson laugh, and so does Henry. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s smiling.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Woods,\u201d Coach Bryson says, beckoning me to walk across the field to the benches. Dad and Henry stay behind. None of the guys are dressed to play yet, as the game isn\u2019t going to start for hours, but they\u2019re wearing green and white sweats and they look ready to work out.</p><p>Another plus? These guys are just as hot as the Alabama boys. Sa-woon! Their starting quarterback, Todd Phil ips, this buff guy with olive skin, black hair, hazel eyes, and a rugged scar on his jaw, steps up and shakes my hand. He\u2019s gorgeous and he knows it. shakes my hand. He\u2019s gorgeous and he knows it.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful. I love your accent,\u201d he says, putting an arm around me, but I shove him away. Dad was right\u2014sexist guys are everywhere. Phil ips laughs at me, turning to Coach Bryson. \u201cCoach\u2014do I get to be her sponsor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hel no,\u201d Coach Bryson responds, pul ing Phil ips away by the hood of his sweatshirt. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let a pig like you within a hundred feet of my own daughter. Go run a lap, wil you?\u201d Al the other guys laugh, so I smile too. Phil ips jogs off toward the track, blowing me a kiss. This time, I actual y do catch the kiss, crumble it in my hand, and throw it to the ground, where I pretend to stomp on it.</p> <p>\u201cOuch!\u201d the guys exclaim, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cSponsor?\u201d I say, focusing on Coach Bryson again.</p><p>\u201cAl new recruits get assigned a sponsor on the team\u2014like a big brother, someone to show you the ropes. If you decide you want to be part of our team, I\u2019l assign our freshman center, Seth Brennan, to you.\u201d</p><p>The guys say, \u201cDamn\u201d and \u201cFigures\u201d as they shove a younger, pudgy guy around. The pudgy guy, who I can only assume is Brennan, looks like a pinbal being bounced between al these linebackers and wide receivers.</p><p>When he final y gets dislodged from the group, he comes over and, after smoothing his hair, says, \u201cNice to meet you, Jordan.\u201d He beams at me. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got time before our game tonight, I\u2019d love to show you around campus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by campus?\u201d I ask, thinking of Mr. Tucker\u2019s boring tour of the Alabama newspaper stands and bike racks.</p><p>\u201cYou know, where the best pizza place is, and where our gym is, and where the twenty-four-hour mini-mart is, important stuff like that. I\u2019l even spring for a slice of pizza. And you\u2019ve gotta try the smoothies at the minimart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great.\u201d I slap Brennan\u2019s shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cWooo! Brennan\u2019s got himself a date!\u201d one of the guys says, smacking Brennan\u2019s ass.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you manage that, Brennan?\u201d says another guy.</p><p>A couple guys stare me down, narrowing their eyes. Checking me out, like they\u2019re trying to decide if I\u2019m a circus show or the real thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to meet y\u2019al ,\u201d I tel the team. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a great program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to show us what you\u2019ve got, Woods?\u201d asks one of the players, who I recognize as a wide receiver. According to the Michigan State website, this dude is pul ing numbers almost as good as Jake Reynolds\u2019s, so I bet I\u2019l be seeing him at the NFL draft soon. He drops a footbal into my hands.</p><p>\u201cHel yeah,\u201d I reply, bending my knee a couple times.</p><p>\u201cCheck this.\u201d Henry and Dad are standing about fortyfive yards away down near the goal posts. Tossing the bal up in the air to myself, I cal out, \u201cHenry!\u201d</p><p>I hop back a few steps and hurl the bal down to my best friend, a perfect spiral. Seconds later, it lands right in his hands.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Coach Bryson says, and some of the guys whistle and pat my back, jostling me around. Henry tosses the bal up in the air and Dad catches it. When he winds up to throw it back, several of the players jog out because they obviously want to catch Dad\u2019s pass. They\u2019re shoving each other, acting like a bunch of boneheads, but they\u2019re boneheads I think I could grow to love, much like the guys I\u2019ve grown up with over the past ten years.</p><p>Dad launches the bal down the field, but he didn\u2019t aim at any of the guys vying for the pass, but to me. As I catch the bal , I feel my eyes burning. This pass was a sign of respect.</p><p>Everything about this stadium, this coach, this team, Everything about this stadium, this coach, this team, this moment, feels right. I hope I can win the respect of the rest of the team, if it needs to be won.</p><p>For the next hour, Phil ips shows me some moves, and I can already tel I could learn a ton from him. We run some plays with the wide receivers and we even do a dril where some linebackers rush at me and I have to get the bal off within three seconds. Then Henry and I show off our flawless hook and lateral play, Red Rabbit, which total y impresses Phil ips. With his hand cupping his chin, he watches as I do a few handoffs to some running backs and gives me pointers. Unlike when I first showed up at the stadium, he behaves seriously, treating me as an equal, which I love in a leader.</p><p>Final y, Coach Bryson claps a hand on my back. \u201cSo what do you think?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like what I told Carter. Sometimes you have to give something up to get something better. I\u2019m wil ing to give up my fantasies of Alabama if it means I actual y get to play for a coach and with guys who al respect me. Grinning and tossing the bal to myself, I turn to Coach Bryson. \u201cI should explore al my options, but I think you\u2019re my number one choice.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and a bunch of the players start whooping and shoving me around.</p><p>Phil ips slaps Brennan\u2019s back and says, \u201cBrennan might final y get himself a girlfriend!\u201d</p><p>I throw my arm around Brennan, which is difficult, as he\u2019s wel over six-foot-four and must weigh 300</p><p>pounds. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so jealous, Phil ips. Maybe if you weren\u2019t such a pig, you wouldn\u2019t stil be a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d the guys say again, and I\u2019m loving this place.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is the pizza place I was teling you about,\u201d</p><p>Brennan says, gesturing to a grungy hole-in-the-wal restaurant that looks greasier than my hair after footbal practice.</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d I say as we walk in. Brennan goes to the counter and buys us six slices of cheese. My kind of guy. We carry the pizza to an empty booth, and after taking a bite, I pul the salt and pepper shakers over in front of me. I stack salt on top of pepper, yank pepper out and salt fal s straight down.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Brennan says. \u201cI suck at that game.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cDuh. You\u2019re a center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you gonna major in, Woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure yet,\u201d I lie, thinking of poetry. \u201cMaybe physical therapy. What\u2019s your major?\u201d I ask as I take another bite of cheese.</p><p>\u201cTheater. Like stage management.\u201d</p><p>What? Brennan\u2019s a theater major? Crazy. \u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d I say, smiling big time.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014I love acting. But obviously, I don\u2019t have the looks or the body for it,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cSo I\u2019m doing behind the scenes stuff. Directing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think you\u2019re the next Spielberg?\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I say, \u201cI lied...I actual y want to major in creative writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can write plays for me to direct,\u201d he says, and we smile at each other.</p><p>The day is only getting better. After my tour and pizza with Brennan, I\u2019m sitting with Dad and Henry at the fiftyyard line. Coach Bryson gave us tickets for the big game versus Notre Dame, and Henry and I are pigging out on hot dogs and cotton candy and nachos.</p><p>Each time some kid comes and asks Dad for an autograph, Henry pretends like they\u2019re asking for his autograph, and when they say they actual y want Donovan Woods\u2019s autograph, Henry says, \u201cOh. Wel , I guess I\u2019ve gotta let old Don Woods get some of the attention.\u201d</p><p>Dad and I smack Henry\u2019s head several times.</p><p>Dad asks over the crowd, \u201cSo do you like this school?\u201d</p><p>I lean near his ear. \u201cI do.\u201d I hesitate before adding,</p><p>\u201cBut can we check out some other schools too? Just so I\u2019l know I\u2019m making the right decision?\u201d</p><p>He pats my good knee. \u201cI\u2019l set up some more visits. Maybe Purdue and Missouri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d I smile and cup my mouth, blowing warm air onto my hands.</p><p>The marching band is playing a fight song when Henry cups my ear with his hand. He whispers, \u201cSo, if you come to school here, and I go to UM, we\u2019l only be an hour away from each other.\u201d</p><p>When he takes his hand away, I whisper back, \u201cI know. But we can stil be close, no matter what schools we go to. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says, his breath hot against my face.</p><p>Then I give him a quick kiss on the cheek. He responds by running a fingertip across the back of my hand. God, I hope Dad isn\u2019t watching us.</p><p>Speaking of Dad, did he purposely set up the whole Michigan State thing so Henry and I could live close to each other? I grin at the great Donovan Woods as he autographs a Notre Dame foam finger for a little boy, despite that 1) Dad went to Ole Miss, and 2) Dad hates Notre Dame.</p><p>At one point, Phil ips runs for a touchdown from the five-yard line, hopping over a cornerback. When he runs back to the benches, I yel , \u201cYou rock, Phil ips!\u201d</p><p>and pump my fist at him, and he rips his helmet off and grins at me. He gives me a little wave and I feel myself blushing. Michigan State wouldn\u2019t be bad at al ...</p><p>\u201cWoods,\u201d Henry whispers as cheerleaders do a pyramid in front of us.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that al about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, acting oblivious.</p><p>\u201cYou know...him,\u201d Henry says, gesturing at Phil ips, who, while sipping his Gatorade, keeps glancing at me.</p><p>\u201cHenry, stop being jealous! I wish you\u2019d stop being such a pansy.\u201d</p><p>Henry laughs, then runs his hand along my thigh.</p><p>\u201cOh, hel no,\u201d I say, picking his hand up and putting it</p><p>\u201cOh, hel no,\u201d I say, picking his hand up and putting it back on his own knee, and he chuckles.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t touch me again until we\u2019re getting ready to go. I\u2019m pul ing my jacket on when Henry rests his hand on the smal of my back. Leaning near my ear, he whispers, \u201cCan we hang out later?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A Lifetime Supply of Cookies and Lemonade</p><p>Back at the hotel, I\u2019m changing into my sweats when Henry texts me: Come to my room? #2205</p><p>I\u2019m so happy I squeal, but I don\u2019t immediately respond. I\u2019m gonna make him wait. But after about five minutes of doing everything from brushing my teeth to playing with the in-room coffee maker, I lose patience and text him back: On my way.</p><p>I knock on the door to his room. A few seconds later, Henry, wearing a T-shirt and mesh shorts, opens the door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s good, Woods?\u201d I walk in to find a window providing a view of the university, and a pitcher of lemonade and a bunch of chocolate-chip cookies sit waiting on the table.</p><p>His hair is as unruly as ever, hanging down to his shoulders. He wipes a few curls off his face. \u201cSo, it\u2019s real y good to spend time with you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYeah...total y.\u201d We just stare at each other for a long moment, a moment that seems to last longer than an overtime. Then I rush forward and hug him.</p><p>He releases me a few seconds later, rubs my back, then takes a seat on the couch. He leans back and crosses his legs. After that hug, I don\u2019t want to push it, so instead of joining him, I sit down on the bed and pul a pil ow to my chest. I prop my chin on the pil ow and rake a hand through my hair and peer up at Henry. He coughs. \u201cSo, I, uh, know I should\u2019ve cal ed to apologize after Ty and I got into the fight,\u201d he says. Leaning over onto his knees, he focuses on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have hit him. I\u2019m sorry I was so stupid.\u201d</p> <p>Tears rush to my eyes. \u201cWe were best friends for ten years\u2014it\u2019s pretty unforgivable that you didn\u2019t cal . That you haven\u2019t cal ed.\u201d</p><p>The tears fal freely, and I dig the heels of my hands into my eyes, trying to stanch the flow, but it won\u2019t stop. Suddenly I feel him sitting down on the bed. When I can open my eyes without a flood gushing out of them, I turn and see that he\u2019s got both hands out as if he wants to play the hand-slap game. A grin starts to spread across my face as first, I slap him upside the head, then I shove his chest so hard he flies back onto the bed. Getting up onto my one good knee, I stretch my other leg out to the side and punch him in the gut.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Woods!\u201d Before I can slap his face, Henry rol s over and fal s off the bed. When he pokes his head up above the mattress, I see he\u2019s cracking up.</p><p>\u201cMan, you deserved every bit of that, and more!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAre we even?\u201d He crawls up next to me.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I punch him in the jaw and I hear a crack.</p> <p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>I cringe. Shit, what\u2019s his jaw made of? Titanium? I shake out my hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Henry! I didn\u2019t mean to hit you so hard.\u201d</p><p>Eyes watering, he rubs his chin. \u201cFinished?\u201d He smiles.</p><p>I laugh softly. \u201cFor now,\u201d I reply, popping my knuckles. He goes over to the table, where he pours two glasses of lemonade, hands one to me, and uses the other to ice his jaw. I hold my glass of lemonade up to my knuckles. He sees me icing my hand and we laugh so hard\u2014just like before.</p><p>Still holding the glass to his jaw, he shuffles his socked feet across the room and digs around in his bag, final y pul ing out a deck of cards. He sits back down on the bed, puts the glass on the nightstand, and starts dealing the cards into two stacks. \u201cLet\u2019s play some war.\u201d</p><p>I grab the plate of cookies from the table and set it on top of a pil ow. He picks a cookie, puts it in his mouth, and uses both hands to keep dealing. When al mouth, and uses both hands to keep dealing. When al the cards are dealt, he takes a bite of the cookie and wipes his mouth, then looks down at the plate.</p><p>\u201cWoods, where did al the cookies go?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve already eaten four. \u201cYou snooze, you lose, man. Cal room service and order some more.\u201d He throws down a queen, I throw down an eight. He sweeps the cards away and up into his pile.</p> <p>\u201cNo way\u2014I\u2019m not made of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t realize you were paying for al this,\u201d I say, gesturing to the lavish room. \u201cCharge it to my dad.\u201d I throw down a five, he throws down a three. I sweep the cards away.</p><p>He grins. \u201cFine.\u201d Grabbing up the phone, he orders more cookies and lemonade, and even asks for some champagne too. He opens his wal et and pul s out a fake ID, showing it off for me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He glances up at me and takes a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the occasion, Woods. I\u2019ve missed you so, so much.\u201d</p><p>Lowering my chin, I bite my lip. A tear drops down my cheek. I throw down an ace, he throws down an ace. I deal three cards facedown, and he mimics me. At the same time, we each drop a fourth card. He has a queen; I, a king.</p><p>He looks up at me again and grabs my hands, pul ing me up against his chest in one motion. He leans back against the pil ow.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting your knee?\u201d he whispers as I drop my chin onto his chest and gaze up at him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes. \u201cYou know what I regret more than anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot kissing you in my room that day.\u201d He drags a hand across my head and rests it on my back.</p><p>I smile and try not to cry again. \u201cYeah, you were pretty stupid, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I could never deserve you, but can I try to make it up to you?\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lifetime supply of cookies and lemonade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty tempting...\u201d I clutch his side as he continues rubbing my back. His hand drifts up, and he sweeps my hair away, letting his fingers trickle along the nape of my neck.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI want something else more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? You gonna tel me what it is so I can get it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess...\u201d</p><p>He guesses right, because he takes me by the elbows and pul s my body up so our noses touch. His breath smel s like chocolate-chip cookies. My favorite. We kiss.</p><p>Final y.</p><p>\u201cWil you stay with me tonight?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l stay as long as you\u2019l let me.\u201d Somehow, even with my sore knee, I manage to straddle his hips and weave my fingers through his curls. \u201cBut we have to sleep head-to-toe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t tonight. I heard you haven\u2019t been washing your socks. In homage to me.\u201d</p><p>I giggle as he kisses my neck. \u201cDon\u2019t test me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how do you feel about living in Michigan?\u201d he says. \u201cYou can be my trophy girlfriend.\u201d Before I can smack him, he pins my arms to my sides and rol s me over, holding me down. We laugh and kiss again and again. He\u2019s a lot stronger than me now. He must be working out hard. I squeeze his biceps to get a taste. Rocks.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you change your mind about us?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhen I stopped being such a wimpy idiot and</p><p>\u201cWhen I stopped being such a wimpy idiot and stopped being afraid of losing you, I realized I\u2019d already lost you because of how stupid I\u2019d been, but didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d give me another chance. I didn\u2019t want to talk...\u2019cause I was so scared you\u2019d get mad or reject me for Ty. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are clenched shut.</p><p>I kiss his forehead. \u201cYou are a wimpy idiot. But...I stil love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Woods.\u201d</p><p>I grab a handful of his curls, yanking his face to mine.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever leave me again, I\u2019l fucking kil you.\u201d</p><p>Opening his eyes, Henry laughs and rubs his jaw where I just punched him. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>We kiss some more, and his soft lips are making it hot in here, so I pul off my sweatshirt, revealing a tank top underneath, and Henry focuses on the plastic footbal charm, taking it in his fingers. I hesitate, then pul the chain off and drop it around Henry\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d he says, kissing the charm. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you\u2019ve missed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hel yeah.\u201d</p><p>I knock him off the bed again, and laughing, he climbs back up and kisses me. We make out for what seems like hours, pausing only for cookies and champagne.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of your cheerleaders du jour,\u201d I tel him when his fingers edge under my tank top. I bat his hand away.</p><p>He smiles, lies back on the pil ow, and clasps his hands behind his head. \u201cAdmit it, you\u2019re my number one fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. I\u2019m having T-shirts made.\u201d</p><p>Then we crawl under the covers with me at the base of the bed and he at the head. He shoves his feet in my face.</p><p>Dad told me that even if you\u2019re meant to be with someone, that doesn\u2019t mean you necessarily get to be with them. But sometimes? Maybe you do.</p><p>I guess we\u2019l find out. </p> </body></html>"]
