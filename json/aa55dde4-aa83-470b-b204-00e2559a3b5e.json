It\u2019s October and I can already tell that winter is going to be rough. The lady behind the counter looks up from her computer with a look of shock on her face. I can\u2019t blame her. I look like I feel which is crap.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey are you okay?\u201d she asks. I hate that question.</p><p>\u201cI'm fine.\u201d I try to smile. \u201cI need a room. Something that\u2019s dog friendly, if you have it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she says, looking back down at her computer and typing. \u201cHow many nights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one.\u201d I lean on the counter, feeling the exhaustion of the last few days catching up to me.</p><p>\u201cRoom 312 is dog friendly. You just take the elevator to the third floor and take a right. It will be seventy for the night and a fifty dollar deposit for the dog.\u201d</p><p>I hand over my card. Waiting for her to finish checking us in, I look down at my new companion. I can\u2019t believe that he saved my life.</p><p>From what I can remember, I was attacked and he came out of nowhere, jumping on the guy attacking me. The cops said that if it wasn\u2019t for him, I probably would have been killed or in a coma. Instead, I just had a concussion, two broken ribs and a sprained wrist.</p> <p>Beast was the first thing I saw when I woke up in that alley with the smell of garbage and urine all around me. I thought I was dead until I heard whining and felt a warm, wet tongue move across my face. I opened my eyes to see a huge face looking down on me like some kind of doggie angel. He stayed at my side while I gathered my strength to get up. He never, even when I stumbled into the apartment to call the police. He was my own personal guardian through every moment.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, honey,\u201d she says, handing me the room card. \u201cThe elevator is right down that hall.\u201d She points to the left.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumble, ready to get into bed.</p><p>\u201cI know that it\u2019s none of my business,\u201d she says and I stop to look at her. \u201cI hope that you were able to get in a few licks before you left his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like.\u201d I smile and shake my head.</p><p>\u201cMmm humm, honey. If you say so.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t have it in me to argue with her so I just let it go and smile. \u201cCome on, boy.\u201d I drag Beast along with me towards the elevator while trying to carry my bag. \u201cYou can smell everything in the morning when I'm not so tired,\u201d I say through a yawn while pulling him behind me.</p><p>When we finally reach our room, I'm overwhelmed by the smell of dog urine. I wondered why they take fifty dollars if they were obviously not using it to get the smell out of the carpet. I\u2019m too tired at this point to care and just happy to have a bed. We could sleep in my car but with all of my stuff stuffed in it, there\u2019s not a lot of room. I take Beast\u2019s leash off and go to the bathroom, carrying my bag with me.</p><p>After brushing my teeth and washing my face, I look in the mirror and cringe. I look like a cow. My face is black and blue, my green eyes are red and puffy, my upper lip is cut, and I have so many bruises that even my hair hurts. I pull off my jeans, sweater and bra but keep on my tank top and panties then crawl into bed. Leaning over, I turn off the light. Two seconds later, I feel the bed bounce with Beast\u2019s huge body as he curls into me. And then I'm out.</p><p>The sun is shining through the crack in the curtain. I moan and roll over. Beast is lying on his back with his legs straight up in the air, and he\u2019s snoring. He is the strangest dog I\u2019ve ever met. Not that I have a lot of experience with dogs. I\u2019ve always tried to avoid them. When I was four, we went to visit one of my mom\u2019s friends out in the Hamptons. They had a dog that attacked me. I ended up in the hospital with stitches from my eyebrow to the corner of my eye. Ever since then, I\u2019ve had a deep fear of dogs. Including the small ones that everyone thinks are so cute because they look like you could put them in your pocket. My dog, Beast, is not small. I Googled dog photos after I found him and from what I can tell, he\u2019s a Great Dane. He comes up to my waist when he is standing on all fours. I'm five four and when he stands on his back paws, his head is a good four inches above mine. Surprisingly, I'm not afraid of him at all. Actually, I don\u2019t think I would have made it through the last couple days without him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, buddy,\u201d I say as I pat his stomach. He rolls his body to the side, looking at me like I'm crazy. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s time to wake up and get back on the road if we want to make it to Dad\u2019s by tonight,\u201d I say while getting out of bed. He still doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I'm going to shower,\u201d I tell him like he cares. Stumbling my way into the bathroom, I start the shower. As steam fills up the small room, I take off my tank top and panties and climb in. Peeling the paper off the cheap hotel soap, I wash my body. After I\u2019ve washed from head to toe, trying to be careful around the cuts on my legs and arms, I find the shampoo but realize there\u2019s no conditioner. I regret not digging through the stuff in the car last night to find all my bathroom supplies. Getting out and drying off, I try to finger comb my hair enough that I won\u2019t look totally crazy when we make our way down to check out. Not that it will matter, I laugh to myself.</p><p>One look at my face and no one will care what my hair looks like. I find a clean bra and panties and sweats. I throw on a hoodie and put my hair up in a messy knot at the top of my head then slide my sunglasses up to rest on my head till we get downstairs. Walking out of the bathroom, Beast is sitting on the bed, looking like he has been waiting for me forever. Typical male.</p><p>\u201cCome on, boy. Let\u2019s roll.\u201d I pat my leg and he jumps down from the bed to walk over to me. Sitting at my feet, he waits for me to attach his leash. \u201cOkay, sweet boy, I\u2019ll feed you outside,\u201d I say while double-checking the bathroom to make sure I didn\u2019t leave anything. Walking to the elevator, with beast in tow, I slow down so he can smell everything that he missed last night.</p> <p>The elevator opens up and the person stepping out almost stumbles at the sight of Beast. I mean, he is big but he is not that scary looking. His fur is dark gray with black spots, his nose is pink with black spots and his eyes are almost blue. He\u2019s actually really beautiful. I give the guy a look and apologize. \u201cMaybe my face is what scared him,\u201d I say to Beast when the elevator door closes. He tilts his head in agreement. Once on the first floor with the elevator door open, there\u2019s enough light to put on my sunglasses so I slide them down my face.</p><p>Walking to the checkout, I notice there is a new desk clerk. I\u2019m praying we don\u2019t have to have another uncomfortable conversation. That\u2019s when I spot a key card drop box and make my way to it without a second look at the front desk.</p><p>Once I drop my key inside, the smell of coffee hits me. My feet move without my command to the source of my weakness. I love coffee. I drink so much coffee every day that my coffee consumption alone could support a small country. Coffee in hand and a bagel hanging out of my mouth, we make our way out to my car. Outside, the cold air hits my lungs and it feels amazing. I walk to my other baby, my light blue convertible VW bug. I pop the trunk and drop my bag inside then dig out Beast's food and water bowl and set them down on the ground. Leaning against my car, I watch Beast scarf down his food while I enjoy mine. Once he\u2019s done, I put his bowls back in the car and take him to the grassy area near the parking lot to take care of his business. I lay down in the cold grass, looking up into the sky and all I can think is in a just few hours, my life is going to be so different.</p><p>Driving is not fun. Okay, let\u2019s be clear, driving in \u201cmy\u201d car with a giant beast of a dog, going from New York to Tennessee is not fun. My car is small and with all my stuff packed in the trunk and the back seat, there is no room for Beast. I feel bad for him being stuck up here with no place to lie down. But I have to say, he is pretty inventive. At one point, his butt was on the seat while the upper part of his body was lying on the floor board. It didn\u2019t look comfortable to me, but apparently he didn\u2019t mind because within a few minutes of finding that position, he was snoring. Who knew dogs could snore so loud?</p><p>We\u2019ve been stopping every couple hours to use the rest room and stretch our legs. We still haven\u2019t made it out of Virginia. To be honest, I\u2019m just glad the roads are clear. You never know what kind of weather you\u2019re going to run into during this time of year. October is one of those tricky months. Some days are beautiful and sunny with fall in the air and other days are freezing and all you want to do is go hibernate for the winter.</p><p>I hate the cold. Maybe after I get settled with my dad, I\u2019ll take a trip to a beach somewhere. The only good thing about winter is being able to wear cute sweaters and boots. But I do miss my dresses during the winter. I wear a dress every day during the summer. I\u2019ve taken sewing classes just so I could make my own summer dresses. There\u2019s nothing like getting up in the morning, taking a shower and slipping on a dress and a cute pair of sandals. There\u2019s no work involved. You can add a cute jacket or extra jewelry but you don\u2019t have to. A dress is simple. During the winter, not only do you have to wear pants and boots but you have to make sure that your shoes go with your top and jacket. Yep, I hate the cold.</p><p>My phone blasting Breathe by Anna Nalick startles me out of my daydream about summer and dresses. Looking at the screen, I see it\u2019s Dad calling.</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, baby girl. Just checking to see how far you got.\u201d</p><p>Looking at my GPS, I say, \u201cWe're still in Virginia and have about six hours left. I\u2019ve been stopping a lot for Beast.\u201d</p><p>\"Oh, yeah. Forgot you\u2019re bringing that thing you call a dog with you.\u201d He chuckles under his breath. \u201cI hope you know the only reason I'm letting you bring him into my house is because he saved your life.\u201d</p><p>I sent him a picture of Beast when I told him he was coming with me. Dad was shocked. He told me that girls were supposed to have little cute dogs for pets, not things that looked like they would eat you.</p><p>\u201cI know, Dad, but he\u2019s a really good dog.\u201d As if he knows we're talking about him, Beast lifts his head and barks. \u201cI know, sweet boy,\u201d I coo at him.</p><p>\"Yeah, I guess it's not such a bad thing that he can help me scare off all the guys who start sniffing around.\"</p><p>\u201cHa ha, Dad!\u201d</p><p>\"Well, baby girl, I\u2019ll call you in a few hours to check on you.\"</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad. Talk to you then.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up with my dad, I have a smile on my face. I wonder how different my life would be if my mom would have left me with him rather than take me with her. I also wonder why she took me to begin with. My mom met my dad at a graduation party when she was eighteen. They had one night of drunken, unprotected sex and I was born nine months later. Two weeks after that, my mom took off with me to live with her cousin in New York. Growing up, my mom wasn\u2019t involved at all. I had a nanny from as far back as I can remember. Her name was Mrs. B. She lived in the apartment next to us. She was the person I always counted on. If something happened, I would go to her. She would bandage me up or tell me that I shouldn\u2019t cry over boys because they were all stupid. She was the only parental figure I\u2019ve ever really known and when she passed away, I felt like my world crumbled around me. My dad found me not long after Mrs. B\u2019s passing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At first, I was angry and refused to reply to any of the letters he sent. Then one day, I received a huge box stuffed full of cards from birthdays, Christmas, Halloween and every holiday in between. Some looked old and some looked new but they all said the same thing. \u201cDreaming of when we will spend this day together.\u201d Since then, we talk every day and he has become one of my best friend\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cOkay, boy, were gonna go take a break. What do you say?\u201d Yes, talking to my dog is now becoming a habit. Most likely, a bad one. I need to make sure that no one is around when I do it or I'm going to end up looking like one of the crazy people who think their animal is sending them messages from the other side. That would not be a good thing. I have enough problems without adding insanity into the mix.</p><p>I pull off at the next rest stop and park close to the area designated for dogs. I let Beast out and he shakes his coat and stretches his legs in front of him. We walk over to the grass and I hear another vehicle pull in. I turn around to see if the person getting out has a dog as well. I don\u2019t want to break up a dog fight, and I have no idea how Beast will react to other dogs. I notice that the car that pulled in is still running and no one is getting out.</p><p>The car is a silver Ford Edge with New York plates. The windows are tinted so dark that you can\u2019t see anything inside. Something buzzes across my skin. Beast must feel it too because he starts to growl. Trying to act casually, we start walking back towards my car. I see the back passenger-side door on the Edge open. That\u2019s when I run with Beast running right along beside me. I get my door open and he jumps across my seat.</p> <p>I'm just able to get the door closed when I see a guy walking in my direction. He\u2019s wearing a black hoodie and black jeans. The hoodie is up so I can\u2019t make out any details of his face, but I know he\u2019s white because his hands are resting on his hips. Without a second look, I put my car in reverse and press the gas pedal. Boxes go sliding as I turn my car to get out of the rest area. I slam the car into drive and start speeding away. I don\u2019t see the Ford Edge in my rearview mirror. My heart is going a million miles a minute and I keep checking for any signs of the Edge. Fortunately, it\u2019s nowhere in sight.</p><p>I start thinking about the whole situation and realize that my imagination is going a little crazy after being attacked. I mean, really, what are the chances that someone from New York would follow me just to try and hurt me again. A few hours later, there\u2019s no sign of the Edge when I check my GPS. I have less than two hours until we get to my dad\u2019s. Looking down at my gas gauge, I see that I have to stop soon to fill up. With that thought, my once calm heart starts to speed up again.</p><p>It\u2019s after seven at night and the interstate is quiet with just a few cars traveling but there are lots of semis on the road. The next exit offers every kind of fast food available so I'm hoping there will be a lot of people there. No, not just people. I'm hoping for the scary trucker type of people. I exit the interstate and pull into the most well lit gas station around. There are a few other cars getting gas so I get out and go inside to pay. There is a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and, like a parched man in a desert, I find myself standing in front of their counter. After getting my coffee, paying for gas, and getting another bottle of water for Beast, I step out into the parking lot. Looking around, I walk quickly to my car.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful dog you have there.\u201d</p><p>Screaming and stepping back, I almost fall over the hose that is going from the pump into my car. \u201cSorry I scared you, honey. I just saw your dog and he\u2019s a beaute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d I say while holding my chest. Getting a look at the guy, he looks harmless. He\u2019s dressed a lot like Santa Claus, including the suspenders with a red and black plaid shirt tucked into his jeans and black boots. I can\u2019t help the smile that comes to my face. He smiles back.</p><p>\u201cRuss,\u201d he says, sticking out his hand.</p><p>\u201cNovember,\u201d I say, shaking his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dog is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat Dane, I think. I'm not sure. I only looked up pictures online after I found him. His name is Beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found him and named him Beast,\u201d he laughs.</p> <p>\u201cWell, actually, it\u2019s a long story but I guess he kind of found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I believe!\u201d he says with a sad look on his face. \u201cYou take care of him and he\u2019ll take care of you, honey. I used to have a dog like that and he traveled everywhere with me. Even took my back a couple times when I got into a jam. They really are man\u2019s best friend.\u201d He looks so lost talking about his dog that I wanted to say something but didn\u2019t know what. I reach my hand out and squeeze his. He squeezes mine back then I drop mine to my side and gave him a small smile.</p><p>\u201cWelp, gotta hit the road. Have a load to drop off in Nashville. You drive safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d I say as he walks to a semi with the word yellow written on the back and climbs inside. Then, without thinking, I lift my fist up in the air and pull down. With that, he blows his horn and is on his way. I can\u2019t help the smile that hits my face.</p><p>My GPS announces that we have reached our destination as I'm driving up a long private road. In the distance, I see large blue house with a white wraparound porch. Sitting in the dark in a rocking chair is my dad. I slow down to take him in. He has his bare feet stretched out in front of him with a cup in his left hand. He\u2019s wearing jeans with a V-neck blue long sleeve T-shirt. His dark hair barely touches the collar of his shirt and is pushed back from his face. His skin looks tan, like he spends a lot of time out in the sun, but around his eyes is lighter. He probably wears sunglasses when he\u2019s out enjoying the sun.</p><p>I pull up as he stands and starts down the stairs. I try to open my door but he\u2019s already there, pulling my door open. Getting out of the car, my hands start to shake and all of the stress and worry from the last few days comes to the surface. I know that now that I'm here, my dad will take care of everything. He is my biggest supporter and the person I can always count on to have my back. He pulls me into a giant hug, shaking me around. When he finally sets me in front of him, he looks down at me and his hands go to my face.</p><p>\u201cYou look more beautiful than the last time I saw you, baby girl. Even with all the bruises,\u201d he says, holding my face gently in his hands. His face changes and his jaw gets tight. \u201cIf I ever see the fucking guy who did this to you, he\u2019s going to wish he was never born. I hope they catch that fucking coward,\u201d he says, letting go of my face and hugging me into his chest while kissing the top of my head. \u201cWelcome home, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>That was all I needed to hear for my whole body to relax into his. Welcome home. I actually had a home and it felt beautiful. \u201cIt feels good to be home,\u201d I say with a smile. Just then, Beast pushes his way between us. Dad bends down to show him some love. He scratches his head and, in return, Beast licks his face. \u201cHey, now. None of that,\u201d he says while standing. \u201cSo, baby girl, are you ready to see your new place and get a lay of the land or do you want to just see your room and pass out?\u201d</p> <p>Laughing, I say, \u201cI\u2019ll just see the room and pass out. It was a long drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that you wanted to get here quickly but you should have stayed another night in a hotel.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t tell my dad about the rest stop because I didn\u2019t want him to worry. And I think I was just being paranoid. But after that happened, all I wanted was to get to my dad\u2019s house and put as many miles as I could between me and New York.</p><p>\u201cI know, Dad, but I just wanted to get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm glad you made it here safely. Let\u2019s get you inside so you can get settled and get some sleep.\" He puts his arm around my shoulder, taking me with him.</p><p>Walking into the house, I was a surprised that everything looked like it was out of a magazine. By the front door was a long, black table with a bowl filled with keys and coins. The wood floors were so dark, they almost looked black. Walking down the hallway, we enter a room with the tallest ceilings I\u2019ve ever seen. The beams going across the room were the same color as the wood floors. There was a wall of windows from one side of the room to the other. The kitchen was open to the living room with an island in the center that was as big as a dining table with five stools in front of it. The appliances in the kitchen all looked new and unused. The countertops are a light granite with brown and red streaming through them. In living room, there's a leather couch that looks more like a bed with a low back. The entertainment center is built into the wall and two leather recliners sit on either side of the low couch. The throw pillows and blankets on the back of the couch match the granite in the kitchen. All the colors in the room blend perfectly together. I see caramel, dark brown, and red everywhere I turn.</p><p>\u201cWow, Dad, this is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, baby. Your grandmother decorated it.\"</p><p>\u201cGrandmother?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\"Yeah. She can't wait to meet you. I know we haven't talked about my family much but they all know about you and are excited to get to know you.\"</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d I whisper, still in shock that my mom took me when I a baby. She never talked about my dad at all. I never even knew who he was until I turned eighteen and he tracked me down. Every time he has come to New York to visit, he never talked about his family and I never asked. I figured his story was the same as my mom\u2019s. Her parents died before I could meet them and she didn't have any brothers or sisters. My mom has always been a loner, unless you have something she wants. Then, she will attach herself to you like a life-sucking parasite.</p><p>\"Everyone will be here for breakfast. They wanted to come tonight but I thought you might get overwhelmed on your first night home. Also, we need to talk about you doing the books for the club. Your degree will help me get the office straightened out. I don\u2019t have a lot of time to manage that part of the business. Lynn moved away with her husband and I haven\u2019t had a chance to replace her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do I start?\u201d I say, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWell, tonight I want you to rest.\u201d He squeezes my shoulder. \u201cAnd for the rest of the week, I want you to recover. After you\u2019re feeling up to it, I\u2019ll take you down to the club and show you the office. Hopefully, you can set something up so you can work from home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Walking through the kitchen, there\u2019s a set of stairs going down to the basement. \u201cWow, Dad, I thought you loved me and now you\u2019re taking me to the dungeon.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he shakes his head. \u201cNo. There\u2019s a basement apartment. Your grandma and everyone else came over and worked on it all day yesterday. They rushed over as soon as they found out you\u2019d be staying with me. It also has its own entrance so you can have some privacy.\u201d He flips on the light.</p><p>\u201cIt's perfect.\u201d There\u2019s a small living room and kitchen when you first walk in. He leads me down a short hall and opens a door. The bedroom is huge and there\u2019s also an attached bathroom with a stand-up shower and a pedestal sink. I\u2019m so overwhelmed that I start crying.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Dad says while dragging me into his body for a hug. \u201cWe just want you to be happy here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is so nice. I can\u2019t even tell you how happy I\u2019m,\u201d I say into his shirt, giving him a squeeze. It\u2019s the truth. I have never seen a more perfect space. It\u2019s amazing that this is someplace to call my own.</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm gonna go unpack your car while you get some sleep,\u201d he says, kissing me on my forehead. He turns to leave then stops and looks at me over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m really happy you\u2019re here, November. I can\u2019t even tell you how happy you this makes me.\u201d With that, he\u2019s gone. Leaving me to think about how different my life could have been.</p><p>Waking up in the morning to the smell of coffee and the sound of voices above me, I climb out of bed. After I shower, I put on a pair of my favorite jeans. They are so dark, they\u2019re almost black and look good with an off-the-shoulder lavender sweater and dark brown riding boots. I blow out my hair and tie it into a ponytail that hits the middle of my back. I put on some makeup to try and conceal the bruises that are now starting to turn green. With a little mascara, some bronzer, and blush, I make my way upstairs. Beast is sitting at the island next to a woman with the same hair as my dad. When she sees me, she jumps off the stool and runs to me, pulling me into a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet girl, you\u2019re finally here,\u201d she says while holding me away from her body and putting her hands to my face. \u201cYou look so much like your great grandma Ellie. She was a beauty and you have your daddy\u2019s eyes and hair.\u201d Pulling me back into her chest, I want to cry for the little girl who missed out on this.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, trying to control the tears I feel coming.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, you don\u2019t have to thank me. That is a gift given by God and good genes. Lord, I'm just so happy that you\u2019re here and I can see for myself how beautiful you are. Your daddy has showed us all pictures from his cell phone but that\u2019s not the same. He is very proud of you.\u201d That does it. I start to cry like a baby. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever cried so much in my life. The whole situation is surreal. I feel both lucky and scared, wondering if I am going to disappoint them.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Dad says, cutting in. \u201cEnough of the sad stuff. Let\u2019s introduce you to everyone, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Meeting all of my family is a little terrifying. My dad\u2019s brother, Uncle Joe, is a little bit taller than my dad but has the same body type. You can tell that he takes care of himself like my dad does they. They both have bulky muscles my uncles. My uncle\u2019s dark hair is starting to gray and he looks like he could model for a cool biker magazine with his goatee and tattoos. He brought my cousins too. His twin sons are the complete opposite of each other. Chris and Nick are twenty-five years old. Chris looks like a surfer with dirty blond hair and a golden tan. Nick looks like a rock star with dark brown hair and light skin covered with tattoos. My dad\u2019s cousin, Maddy, her husband, Mark, and their two-year-old daughter, Alyssa, are also here. They even have a few other family friends over to meet me.</p><p>Breakfast is delicious and I am really enjoying getting to know everyone. They all seemed genuinely nice. We were talking about what I plan on doing after getting settled. I explain about having a degree in business management and that I\u2019m planning on helping my dad at the club. That\u2019s when the vibe changes and all hell breaks loose.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d Uncle Joe asked, yelling so loud his face turned red.</p><p>\u201cUm, I'm going to help my dad?\u201d I say, my answer sounding like a question. I look around, wondering what I missed and why he\u2019s so upset.</p><p>\u201cWatch it, Joe,\u201d my dad growls.</p><p>\u201cNo niece of mine is going to work at the strip club...that we own together, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrip club?\u201d I ask in complete shock.</p><p>\u201cShe is not going to be working in the club. She\u2019s going to be doing the books and managing the office. She won\u2019t be there during club hours and will never be in the front of the house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if she\u2019s working in the front or in the fucking alley, she\u2019s not working there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I checked, she is my daughter and I own half that club. You have no say in what she does or doesn\u2019t do. I want her to work for me and, like I said before, she will never see the front of the fucking club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to work there?\u201d my uncle asks me. I feel put on the spot and I really don\u2019t want to answer him.</p><p>\u201cUm... I... ugh.\u201d I take a deep breath before trying to respond. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that it was that kind of club,\u201d I say in a whisper. Not that I had anything against strip clubs. I mean, to each their own, right?</p><p>\u201cOkay, Joe,\u201d Grandma cuts in. \u201cIf November wants to work there, that\u2019s her choice. And, Mike, if she doesn\u2019t want to work there after finding out what kind of club it is, that\u2019s also her choice. Now you know that I don\u2019t love that club but I do love you both and I supported you in your decision to open it. But, as for November, it will be her choice and her choice alone if she wants to help you out on the business side of the club. I'm not happy about the look on her face right now and I'm telling you both that you will let her make her own decision.\u201d</p><p>After Grandma said her peace, everything went back to normal, but I could still feel the tension between my dad and uncle. I wanted to work with my dad but I also didn\u2019t want to cause a problem between him and his brother. I couldn\u2019t wrap my mind around the fact that my dad owned a strip club. When I imagined a strip club owner, I pictured an evil, fat old guy with beady eyes, tacky suits and a bad comb over. Not someone like my dad. He\u2019s a kind, handsome, put-together, forty-five-year-old man. After pondering this for a few minutes, I realized that I was proud. Knowing my dad and the kind of man he is, I couldn\u2019t help but think of the women who work for him and how lucky they are. I'm sure in the stripper industry, respect is hard to come by. But one thing I know for sure, he respects the women who work for him. I'm sure that\u2019s not always the case in strip clubs. So, with those thoughts floating in my head, I turn and smile at my dad. He smiles back even bigger.</p><p>After two weeks of getting settled in and healing, it was time to start living in the real world again. The world where you needed things like a job and money to survive. Me and my dad are going to the club to meet some of his main employees. To say I'm nervous is an understatement. It took me longer than normal to get ready. I mean really! What do you wear to the strip club that your dad owns? After settling on my gray, empire waist sweater dress with black legging and black boots, I curl my hair in large waves down my back. I put on light makeup. Looking at myself in the mirror, I\u2019m happy to see all the bruising is gone and I look like myself again. I go upstairs to give Beast some love before me and Dad take off. I know that Beast is happy here. He has a large backyard and room to run and I take him on a walk every night.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad, I'm ready,\u201d I yell into the living room while scratching Beast behind his ears.</p> <p>\u201cWow, you look beautiful,\u201d he says, kissing my cheek. \u201cLet\u2019s get this shit over with.\u201d I smile at him, knowing that he\u2019s nervous. I think at this point, he\u2019s more nervous than me.</p><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d Going with my dad to his club is completely nerve racking for me. I mean, my dad owns a strip club where naked girls work. I'm freaking out on the inside but trying to act cool. I don't want him to feel any more uncomfortable than I know he already does.</p><p>\"Just so you know, baby girl, the women who work for me are not your friends. There is nothing wrong with what they do but you are not going to be hanging with them.\"</p><p>I raise my eyebrows at him and he shakes his head. \u201cI know that you won't be there during club hours but I want to make it perfectly clear\u2014there is no reason for you to ever be in the front of the house when you\u2019re in the building. You can come in, sort shit out in the office, but there will be no drinking at the bar and no socializing with the employees. The only reason I'm bringing you here tonight is because I want the people I trust to meet you. That way, you will always have someone to go to in case I'm not around.\"</p><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t worry so much. You\u2019re giving yourself grey hair and soon you\u2019re going to look like Uncle Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny!\u201d he says, smiling.</p><p>The club is pretty much how I pictured it. Not that I've been in a strip club but what do you really think of when you imagine a strip club. There's a long bar on the back wall with stools in front of it. Off to the side, there's a stage with two poles and a girl dancing. Along the stage, there are four tables with guys of every age watching the show. In the back of the room, the lighting is so dim that you can barely make out the couches. Behind them is a wall of mirrors. Looking around, everything looks new and modern.</p><p>\"Okay, baby girl.\u201d My dad snaps me out of my perusal. \u201cThis is Rex.\u201d He points to the guy behind the bar. \"Rex, this is my daughter, November. She's going to be doing the books and helping me out from behind the scenes. You won't see her much but I wanted you to meet her so that if I'm not around, she knows who to talk to.\"</p><p>\u201cHey, girl,\u201d Rex says, wiping his hands on a towel. \u201cNice to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d I say as my dad pulls me into his side.</p><p>\"Wow, Mike, didn't think that with your ugly mug you could make such a pretty girl,\" Rex says and I feel myself turn red.</p><p>My dad looks down at me with so much pride. \u201cYeah, I did good,\" he says, smiling.</p><p>\u201cOh, geeze, Daddy, stop,\u201d I say while squeezing his middle and rolling my eyes. That's when I feel like someone\u2019s watching me. I look around but don't see anyone.</p><p>\"I'm gonna take her to the office and show her my mess,\" Dad says.</p><p>\"Okay, man, but when you\u2019re done, we need to talk about the shit Skittles pulled the other night.\"</p><p>\u201cOnce November leaves, I\u2019ll be on the floor,\" my dad says, pulling me with him.</p><p>After meeting a couple other people, we go into his office. He was not joking\u2014the place is a mess. It's going to take me weeks just to get everything organized. There are papers, books and files everywhere and the computer looks like the first one ever invented. \"Well, here you are. You can start tomorrow morning. Just try to be out of here by three. Once you get stuff figured out, you can always move your office to the house if you feel like that works better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I'll start tomorrow. It's gonna take some time just to get things sorted. After that, I should be able to do it from home most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\"Sounds good,\" Dad says, looking around. Just then, the phone rings on the desk. He moves some papers around. When he finally finds the handset, he puts it to his ear. \"Yeah, okay. I\u2019ll be out. I have to go, baby girl. There's a problem out front.\"</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Dad,\u201d I say to his back as he runs from the office. Looking around for a few minutes, I see that I have my work cut out for me. I decide to go home and get some sleep so that I\u2019ll have all my brain cells in the morning when I come back to this disaster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walk out into the cool November air. I pull out my phone and text Dad that I\u2019ll see him tomorrow. The music is now just background noise, but I can still smell the alcohol, perfume and beer that lingers on my clothes from being inside the club. I'm almost to my car, thinking about taking Beast for a walk. I want to go before it\u2019s too late and we have another skunk incident like we did the other night. \"Yo,\" I hear shouted from behind me. I jump and end up dropping my purse and keys to the ground. I pick them up then look around. All the air is pushed out of my lungs. The most beautiful man I have ever seen is standing a few feet from me. He is more than a foot taller than my five feet four inch frame. His dark brown hair is cut so short that I can see his scalp. His jaw is so square that it looks like it was cut from glass. He has a couple days of stubble on it that makes me want to rub my cheek across it to see how it feels. His nose looks like it may have been broken but it does nothing to take away from the beauty of his face.</p><p>With only the light from the street lamp above us, I can\u2019t tell his exact eye color but they look blue or light gray. His lips have a perfect cupid\u2019s bow at the top and bottom. They\u2019re so full, they would make my mom, the queen of lip injections, jealous.</p><p>Taking in his face, I\u2019m completely caught off guard by the anger I see in his eyes. He is about three times my size. His arms are so large he could squash me like a bug. I can make out the definition of almost every muscle in his torso. His body is as impressive as his face and the thermal shirt he\u2019s wearing does nothing to hide it from me...or anyone with eyes. His legs are planted shoulder-length apart. His jeans hang low on his hips and with the way he stands, I don't even think a tornado could move him. He crosses his arms over his chest while looking down at me.</p><p>I take a step back towards my car and remind myself that I need to breathe. I adjust my keys in the palm of my hand so they become a weapon. He doesn\u2019t miss this move, judging by the flash of surprise I see cross his face.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I squeak out.</p><p>\"Yeah, hi,\u201d he says back in a mocking tone that catches me off guard. \u201cYou need to have an escort to your car anytime you leave the club.\u201d He\u2019s practically growling at me.</p><p>\u201cWh... Wha. What?\u201d I ask, stuttering.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he says slowly, like I'm stupid, \u201cneed an escort anytime you leave from inside the club to your car. All the girls know this shit.\"</p><p>\u201cUm...okay?\u201d I say, still not understanding.</p> <p>\"It\u2019s my boy\u2019s job to make sure your ass is safe from the building to your car. So don\u2019t piss me off by not doing what you\u2019re told. And trust me, sweetheart, I don\u2019t give a fuck if you\u2019re fucking Big Mike. Next time, wait for one of the guys to walk you out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Big Mike?\u201d I ask. I\u2019ve only been in town a short while. How can rumors of me and some guy already be going around?</p><p>\"Big Mike, the guy you were hanging on and calling \u2019Daddy!\u2019\u201d he says with distaste. \u201cI don't give a fuck if you\u2019re sleeping with the boss. He should have told you this shit himself or had the decency to walk your ass out here to your car.\"</p><p>Oh my God! Ewwww... Now I get it. He thinks I'm sleeping with my dad. Gross! And he's being totally rude.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I ask, narrowing my eyes, hoping that he gets the message that he should choose his next words wisely.</p><p>\"What part don't you understand, sweetheart?\u201d he says, mocking me. I'm sure at this point, my eyes are bugging out of my head and steam is coming out of my ears.</p> <p>I jerk my hand out angrily in his direction. \u201cI'm not \u2018sweetheart,\u2019 I\u2019m November. I'm also Big Mi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\"Don't give a fuck who you are.\u201d He cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cWow, you are so flipping rude, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\"Don't care that you think that shit either.\"</p><p>\u201cWho the hell do you think you are?\u201d I ask him, hands on my hips, my voice bringing my New York attitude out in full force.</p><p>\"The guy that\u2019s waiting for you to get in your car and leave so I can go do my job instead of standing out here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUggggg, you are such a jerk.\u201d I growl, feeling like I should kick him.</p><p>\"November?\u201d I hear my dad call me. I smile on the inside. This is going to be good.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Daddy, over here,\u201d I yell back, exaggerating the daddy part. I look at the guy in front of me, daring him with my eyes to say something. He doesn\u2019t, but his eyes narrow.</p><p>My dad walks towards us then sees big jerk face standing across from me. He pats him on the back while smiling. \"Hey, Asher,\u201d my dad says.</p><p>Oh my God, seriously? Asher. Why did this guy have to have a hot guy name? Why couldn\u2019t his name be Urkel or Poindexter. I mean really, something\u2019s just were not fair.</p><p>\u201cI see you already met my daughter.\" I can't help the small giggle that climbs up my throat from the look of pure shock on the big jerk\u2019s face. Okay, it\u2019s safe to say that his look made me feel somewhat better. My dad looks down at me, smiling, not understanding what has gone on for the last few minutes.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, Dad. He was just telling me that I need an escort when leaving the club,\u201d I say through my laugh.</p><p>\"Oh,\" my dad says, scratching his head. \u201cYeah, I didn't think about it because you\u2019re not... Ugh, you don\u2019t work here... I mean, you work here but not really in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s okay. Asher didn\u2019t know and just wanted to make sure I was safe.\u201d</p><p>\"Yeah, okay,\u201d he says, looking a little sheepish. \u201cAnyways, Asher, this is my baby girl, November,\u201d he says, pulling me into his side. \u201cShe just moved here.\u201d</p><p>I look from my dad\u2019s smiling face to Asher and he still looks stunned but there's also something else working behind his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, sticking out my hand with a big smile on my face. When he puts his hand to mine, I feel a jolt go from our connection straight through my body. What the heck is that?</p><p>\"November,\u201d he says softly, looking down at our hands and it makes me wonder if he felt it too. Then, without another word or look, he turns around and walks back towards the club. Well, alrighty then. He might be hot but he\u2019s definitely strange. I look at my dad and he\u2019s watching him go.</p><p>\"Um... Hey, Dad, I'm gonna go,\u201d I say, regaining his attention.</p><p>\"What?\u201d he says, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cI'm leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Of course, honey. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow at home.\" He bends, kissing my forehead. When I pull out of the parking lot, I can see a tall figure leaning against the door that leads into the club, watching my car leave. My pulse starts to race, wondering if that\u2019s Asher. Then, I remind myself that he\u2019s a jerk and not to think about him anymore. Sadly, I don\u2019t stop thinking about him until my head hits my pillow and I'm dead to the world.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cI'm coming, I'm coming. Geez, you have to slow down, boy. My boots are too high for running,\u201d I say, following Beast to my car.</p><p>The minute I asked him if he wanted to go for a ride, he was running out of the house, dragging me behind him. Today is the day we visit the nursing home, and I swear he knows exactly where we\u2019re going. We have been doing this every week since we came to town.</p><p>Beast loves the attention and the elderly love Beast. It's been six days\u2014not that I\u2019m counting\u2014since I last saw Asher. I wanted to ask my dad about him but I chickened out. Really, I just want to see him again. I don\u2019t really want to talk to him because, truthfully, he\u2019s a jerk. But I do want to look at him. He has made me consider taking an art class. Maybe something like body sculpting or painting. It\u2019s not normal for a guy to be that beautiful. Now I sound like a weird stalker. Like that movie where the guy puts the girls in the hole and forces them to eat so he can wear their skin. Okay, I'm not that creepy, thank God. I need to stop. Maybe he brainwashed me. I need a hobby.</p><p>The last few days have been uneventful. Monday, me and Grandma went up to Nashville and got new computers. One is for my dad\u2019s home office and one is for the club. Tuesday, I went to the club at seven in the morning so I would have plenty of time to get the computer set up and to start organizing the office.</p><p>I don't know what I thought I would find, but there were no lap dance spread sheets or pole dancing tables. It was all normal office paperwork. Spending reports, payroll, and ordering sheets. I finished as much as I could before I had to leave at three. The next few days went the same. I was at the office till three, making dinner with my dad before he went to work, walking Beast in the evening, then setting up my dad\u2019s home office before I went to bed at night.</p><p>I am getting settled. I feel more at home here in Tennessee than I ever felt in New York. Everyone in town was nice. They always have a smile for you. The thing I had to get used to was everyone waving at you when you pass them on the road. At first, it caught me off guard. Then I asked my dad about it and he said it\u2019s just what they do. Now every time I pass someone, I make sure to wave. Okay, okay, my wave may be a little dramatic but I like it and it makes me smile.</p><p>\u201cAlright, boy. Let\u2019s go inside,\u201d I say as I turn off the car. The nursing home we visit is a long brick building. The front sits on a hill of green grass with large pine trees that give shade to sitting areas located all around the building.</p><p>\"Hi, Beth,\" I say quietly while giggling. Beth is in charge of greeting people as they come into the building. At least she should be greeting people but she's always asleep in her wheelchair with her chin tucked to her chest and her blue hair is the only thing you can see.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d I sigh to myself. Now I want some cotton candy. Every time I see her hair, I get a craving for the stuff. I look down at Beast and his head comes up. \u201cLooks like we're gonna be making a stop at the store on our way home, boy.\u201d I should have bought more than one pack of cotton candy the last time I was there. He looks at me and tilts his head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, boy. First stop is Max so you better be on your best behavior,\u201d I tell him, walking into Max\u2019s room. Billie Holiday is playing on an old record player and Max is sitting in his chair with the newspaper in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHi, Max. I brought Beast here to see you,\u201d I say loudly, knowing that he never remembers to put in his hearing aid.</p><p>\"Well, hello there, pretty lady. How are you today?\" he shouts at me.</p><p>\u201cI'm good. How are you?\u201d I ask, bending to give his wrinkled cheek a kiss. I find his hearing aid in a small bowl by his bed and hand it to him. He shakes his head and puts it in.</p><p>\"Well, gotta say that my day just got better.\u201d He smiles. \u201cHey, Beast. How are you, boy?\u201d he asks as Beast places his head in his lap for a rub. \u201cBetsy was in here earlier bugging me about going to the dance tonight. I keep telling her that I'm not interested but she won't leave me alone. She\u2019s already stopped by four times,\" he grumbles.</p><p>I laugh. Betsy is one of the older ladies here and has more energy than I do. She\u2019s always on the hunt for a new man. \u201cAw, Max, you should go. You might have fun. I hear the band that's coming is really good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Nope, I ain't going. You couldn't pay me enough to go to a dance.\"</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to dance. You could just go listen to music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening, darlin\u2019, and we\u2019re not talking about it again.\u201d</p><p>I giggle. Max is set in his ways. I know there will be no convincing him. We visit for a while longer until I look at the clock and see how late it is.</p> <p>\u201cOh, crude, Max. Me and Beast better go. We have a few people to visit before dinner.\u201d</p><p>\"Alright, darlin\u2019. See you in a few days,\u201d he says while still petting Beast. \u201cAnd see you too, boy.\"</p><p>Walking down the hall, the smell of cleaning supplies is overwhelming until we reach the assisted living units. Then, it\u2019s like walking into a country club. The floors are beautiful printed carpet. There are fresh flowers on all tables along the wall. The whole place looks warm and inviting with sitting areas and cozy nooks to read. I can't help but feel bad for the people who can't afford to live on this side of the building.</p><p>\u201cAlright, boy. One more stop. Remember, be good,\u201d I say, looking down. He just looks at me then back towards the direction are walking. I was just dismissed by my dog.</p><p>Walking into Ms. Alice's room always makes me happy. She has photos and things from all over the world on shelves and bookcases. Her husband was in the military and they traveled a lot. When he retired, they moved to town and opened a hardware store. They were married for sixty-two years and when her husband passed away, she refused to move in with her family. She moved here when she could no longer be on her own. But still, the room feels like a home.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Ms. Alice. How are you?\u201d I ask, leaning down and kissing her cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh, November. I'm wonderful. I was just talking to my grandson. He's on his way to visit too.\"</p><p>\u201cThat's nice. We won't stay long, then. I just wanted to bring Beast by and say hi,\u201d I tell her, sitting down.</p><p>\"Hey, you handsome boy. Come here and give me some sugar,\u201d she says, patting her leg. Beast walks to her and puts his head in her lap. \u201cYou are such a sweet thing just like your mama,\" she says, making me smile.</p><p>Beast is like my child. I feed him, love him, and make sure he is cared for. But I hope one day I find someone to have a real family with. I don\u2019t want to be single for the rest of my life and become known as the crazy dog lady. Since I'm allergic to cats, I can\u2019t even be the norm and have a million cats. Well, I could but then I\u2019d just walk around with puffy eyes and a runny nose.</p><p>\u201cI hope my grandson gets here soon. I would love you too meet him. He's very handsome,\u201d she tells me with a big smile on her face. I can see her mind racing with ways to hook us up. \u201cI keep telling him he needs to settle down. He has never brought a girl home and he's getting too old for all that playing around business that men these days do. I want great grandbabies before I leave this earth. Back in my day, it was normal to get married young. I was eighteen when I got married and I stayed married until I lost my James. I miss him every day and still love him. I want that for my grandsons.\"</p> <p>\u201cWell, I hope they all find the kind of love you had, Ms. Alice. It sounds beautiful,\u201d I tell her truthfully. I can see the love that she still carries for her husband whenever she talks about him.</p><p>\"What the fuck are you doing here?\" I jump and Beast barks at the sound of the voice. I slowly turn around, praying I'm wrong.</p><p>\"Asher James Mayson, you watch your mouth. Don't talk to my guest like that,\" Ms. Alice scolds him. I can feel all the color drain out of my face and my stomach drops to my toes. Oh my God, he's more beautiful than I remember in his dark green thermal with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows and the colorful tattoos on his arms are so bright that even his tan does nothing to take away from their beauty. His jeans are light blue overwashed and hug him perfectly. His light brown boots are so dirty that you would think he spent the day playing in the mud. Great! Just flipping great. He's Ms. Alice's grandson. Can my life get any worse?</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, trying to smile but I know that I probably look like I'm in pain. I stand up, ready to bolt. \u201cCome on Beast, Ms. Alice has a guest and we need to go to the store.\u201d Yes, now I'm talking to my dog out loud in front of hot jerk face. Ugh, I'm such a loser. \u201cWell, Ms. Alice, I\u2019ll see you in a few days,\u201d I say, leaning down to kiss her cheek.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sweet girl,\" she says quietly. She looks like she wants to say something but she closes her mouth then glares at her grandson. I'm sure if she could have made him catch fire, she would have. If I could make him catch fire, I know I would. I turn and start walking down the short hall towards the exit when I feel pressure on my elbow.</p><p>\"I'm gonna walk November out. I\u2019ll be right back, Gran,\" Asher says from behind me.</p><p>Crap, crap, crap. \u201cUmm... No... No, that's okay,\u201d I say, trying to pull my arm free from his touch. I can already feel his fingers burning into me.</p><p>\"No, I\u2019ll walk you,\" he whispers near my ear, causing goose bumps to breakout across my skin.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I mutter because I don't want to cause a scene in front of Ms. Alice. I'm sure she likes me but not so sure she would like me ruining the chances of her having great grandchildren when I \u2018accidently\u2019 kick him in the nuts. She doesn't say anything as we leave. She just waves goodbye with a face splitting smile. Oh, if she only knew.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Beast. Asher is walking us out,\u201d I say then bite my tongue. I really need to work on not talking to my dog in front of people. Once out the door, I pull my elbow from his grip. \u201cLook, I'm sorry. I had no idea that she is your grandma. I just bring Beast here to see anyone who wants the company. I watched a show on TV about animals visiting with people in hospitals and nursing homes and how much joy it brought them. So I figured, I\u2019d give it a try. I have a beautiful dog who loves attention, so why not, you know.\u201d</p><p>Asher's not saying anything and I realize I'm rambling. Crap. \u201cSo we're just gonna go.\u201d I turn to leave but he grabs my hand, pulling me back.</p><p>\"Hey, not so fast. You caught just surprised me. I didn\u2019t expect I would see you here.\"</p><p>\u201cWell, I really like your grandma and she likes Beast so if you just tell me the days you\u2019re gonna come, I\u2019ll make sure not to show up then.\u201d</p><p>\"That's not gonna work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, feeling my shoulders slump. \u201cWell, have a good day.\u201d And don\u2019t fall off a cliff. I say it under my breath as I turn to walk off again.</p><p>\u201cMeet me tonight,\" he says and I know that I must have heard him wrong. His rough voice and his southern accent are making it hard to concentrate on what he is saying. I swear I heard him wrong. I look over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, scrunching my nose.</p><p>\"You, me, tonight, beer, a game of pool?\"</p><p>\u201cUm...\" Nope, didn\u2019t hear him wrong. I look around to make sure that it\u2019s still just me and him in the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cIt's just a beer,\u201d he says, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of a jerk,\u201d I tell him. It\u2019s something he probably hears all the time.</p><p>\"I can be but it's still just a beer, November.\u201d The way he says my name makes me think that this is a lot more than just a beer and a game of pool. Plus, when a guy admits that they are a jerk, is that really a good thing? \u201cJust meet me at the Stumble In at seven,\u201d he says, taking a step closer to me. All of the sudden, I can feel the heat from his body, smell the scent of his cologne and I can finally make out the color of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLight blue with gold flecks,\u201d I mumble to myself. My lips part and my eyes glaze over. All my senses are on overload.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d he asks and I realize that I just said that out loud.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I mumble, still staring at him. I realize that I probably look like an idiot so I take a step back. He smiles, revealing one perfect dimple and I know in that moment that I am so screwed. Crap!</p><p>\u201cMeet me at seven,\u201d he repeats, taking a step closer to me. His hand comes up, moving my hair to behind my ear, and I'm totally lost. Just floating away in a hot guy fog.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I blink, trying to pull myself together. \u201cOkay, seven,\u201d I say, wondering what the heck just happened. The words are out and I need to get away from him and his Jedi mind tricks. I turn to go but get tugged back. I almost fall on my butt when I turn my head and see Asher squat down to pet Beast.</p><p>\u201cAlright, babe. Seven. See you then.\" His smile gets bigger, like he knows something I don\u2019t. He stands from his squatting position and winks. I turn around because I need to go, go, go before I throw myself at him and ask him to help me give Ms. Alice great grandbabies.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Beast.\u201d I tug on his leash but he wants to stay with Asher. \u201cI know the feeling, boy,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Walking into my dad\u2019s house, I'm assaulted by the smell of garlic and butter. I stop in my tracks when I realize that he\u2019s home. \u201cCrap,\u201d I whisper to myself. Dad\u2019s home. Of course, he's home. We have dinner together every night. I try to act normal as I walk into the kitchen. My dad is standing in front of the stove, wearing an apron that looks like a girl in a bikini. I start laughing. \"Hey, now. What's so funny?\" he asks, smiling.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Daddy,\u201d I say, giggling.</p><p>\"I'll have you know that your uncle got this for me.\"</p><p>\u201cI'm sure Uncle Joe did,\u201d I say, smirking. Uncle Joe is a funny guy.</p><p>\u201cWell, I like it. I look hot,\" he says, holding his hands out to his sides.</p><p>\u201cThat you do,\u201d I agree, shaking my head. \u201cSo what are we having?\u201d I ask, hopping up on the counter.</p><p>\u201cShrimp Alfredo, garlic bread and salad.\"</p><p>\u201cYum. Sounds good. I'm leaving at six thirty to head to the Stumble In,\u201d I say, glad that it sounds casual.</p><p>\"The Stumble In? Why are you going to the bar on a Thursday. I'm not driving you to drink already, am I?\"</p><p>\u201cUm... No, I'm meeting someone there?\u201d I say, asking rather than telling him. Please don\u2019t ask who, I pray.</p><p>\u201cIs that a question or are you meeting someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I um...ran into Asher at the nursing home when I was visiting his grandmother and he asked me to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re meeting Asher at the bar?\" he asks with a look on his face that doesn\u2019t bode well for me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it's just a beer, Dad,\u201d I say, using Asher's words.</p><p>\"I don't know how I feel about this. I know you\u2019re not a kid but Asher is not the kind of guy I expected you to date. Don't get me wrong, he's a good man.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll be careful. I don\u2019t want to see you hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise, Dad,\u201d I say quietly. The last thing I need is to get my heart trampled on again. Been there, done that. And Asher\u2019s boots look like they would do a lot more damage than my ex\u2019s. \u201cBesides, Dad, he knows I'm new in town and feels bad for me or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d he says under his breath and I ignore him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dinner was awesome and Dad quickly dropped the uncomfortable conversation about Asher. Thank God. So now I am standing in front of my closet, trying to pick out what to wear. What do you wear to a bar to have a beer with a hot guy that you don\u2019t want to like?</p><p>I haven\u2019t ever really dated random guys. The one serious relationship I had in college went bad after my mom slept with him. I caught them together at his apartment after he sent me a text saying that he was going home after class because he wasn\u2019t feeling well. Me, the loving fianc\u00e9 that I was, showed up out of the blue to check on him. When I let myself in, the place felt strange. I wanted to turn around and run out but I stayed, walked to his bedroom and when I got there, all I heard was him moaning. It sounded like he was in a lot of pain so I opened the door to find my mom on top of him. I couldn\u2019t even speak. I shut the door silently behind me and sent him a text telling him that I stopped by to check on him but saw for myself that he was feeling much better. He called a million times after that and sent flowers, cards, texts, but I didn\u2019t care. I ignored all of it. I cut him out of my life, mailed him back everything that I had of his\u2014including the ring he had given me\u2014along with a note telling him to stop calling or I would press charges for stalking. After that, I never heard from him again.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Beast? Red sweater dress or T-shirt and jeans,\u201d I ask, holding the items up for Beast to look at. He doesn\u2019t even lift his head. His big body is lying across my bed with his head on his paws.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. The dress is too much.\u201d I take off my boots, dress, and leggings. I put on my tight, straight leg, dark blue jeans with holes all over them.</p> <p>With my jeans on, I decide to go casual and pull out my converse sneakers that are gold with glitter. I put on a long sleeve, scoop neck, white T-shirt and a black, zip front hoodie.</p><p>\u201cNow, hair up or down?\u201d I ask Beast, who still hasn\u2019t moved.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I agree. I'm just going to leave it down,\u201d I tell him, putting on some lip gloss. I look at the clock and I'm running late. Once out the door and in my car, my nerves start to get the better of me.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, calm down, calm down,\u201d I chant out loud to myself. It\u2019s not helping so I turn on music and start singing along. Okay, not singing, I\u2019m rapping. I love listening to rap music. Yes, some of the stuff they say is a little, um, questionable, but it makes me happy.</p><p>So, with music thumping and me rapping, I pull up in front of Stumble In. There are a lot of cars parked out front. It seems this is the place to be on a Thursday night. I check my face in the rearview mirror and add more lip gloss. I get out and start walking towards the building. My hands start to sweat and I feel slightly sick.</p> <p>Once I open the door, all thoughts leave my head. Asher is sitting at a table with three other guys who all look similar to him. The thing that gives me pause is the girl standing next to him. She is so close that her giant boobs are squishing out of her white tank top. I can also see that she\u2019s wearing a red bra. I mean, really. Who does that? I want to puke or run away but all I can do is stare at him. Then, she bends her head to the side with her blonde hair hiding what she\u2019s whispering into his ear.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I jump at the sound and turn my head. \u201cYou must be new. I'm Nick.\u201d The guy standing next to me says and I take a step towards him so I'm not blocking the door. He\u2019s very cute in that boy next door kind of way. He\u2019s all dirty blond hair and blue eyes. He\u2019s wearing a button-up shirt that\u2019s perfectly pressed and khakis. He\u2019s also the only guy that I\u2019ve met here that wasn\u2019t wearing jeans.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. Hi, I'm November,\u201d I say, putting my hand out. That\u2019s when I'm pulled by my waist. I scream because I'm startled then I look up. Asher is standing behind me, holding me against him.</p><p>\u201cNot happening, baby,\u201d he whispers in my ear. I can\u2019t help the shiver that slides down my spine.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, completely confused.</p><p>\u201cLater, Nick,\u201d Asher growls and I realize what he\u2019s doing.</p> <p>Heck no! I walked in and he has a girl practically sitting on his lap but I can\u2019t even introduce myself to Nick. I pull myself away, or try to because his arm just gets tighter. Screw it. I stick out my hand in Nick\u2019s direction. \u201cHi, Nick. I'm November. It was nice to meet you but I just realized that I forgot to wash my hair and need to go home and do that. So, maybe I\u2019ll see you around?\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cUgh, yeah sure,\u201d he says, looking between me and Asher while running his hand down the back of his neck. With that, I pull myself out of Asher\u2019s grasp and walk out the door that I walked through less than three minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cHey, what the fuck? Slowdown.\u201d</p><p>I spin around, almost running into him. I\u2019m so pissed that I can feel my blood heating. \u201cLook here, buddy,\u201d I yell while poking his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your problem is but you just embarrassed me. God!\u201d I shout. \u201cWhy the hell did I even come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was going to hit on you and that\u2019s not happening, especially not right in front of my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, you big jerk. I'm shocked that you noticed because you had big boobed Barbie basically sitting on your lap when I walked in.\u201d I poke him in the chest again. \u201cAnd, for your information, all Nick was going to do was shake my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig boobed Barbie?\u201d He laughs and I want to kick him. \u201cAre you jealous?\u201d he asks, smirking.</p><p>\u201cI'm not jealous. I'm embarrassed and pissed off.\u201d Even though I was jealous, there is no way I would tell him that. It seems to me that he probably already had trouble walking into buildings with the size of his big fat head.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try not to embarrass you anymore. Now, will you please come inside with me?\u201d he asks, giving me puppy dog eyes. \u201cMy brothers are here but they have to leave in a couple hours and we want to get a few games of pool in before that.\u201d</p><p>I really must have lost a lot of brain cells when I was attacked because all I can say is, \u201cFine.\u201d I start walking back toward the bar with him when he puts his arm around me. \u201cGod, I must be crazy,\u201d I say under my breath.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, you look beautiful tonight,\u201d he says in my ear. \u201cBut if any motherfucker touches you, I will not be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please try not to be a jerk and piss me off for the next hour?\u201d I ask, looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he says, bringing me closer to his body. I try to pull away but he just holds me even tighter. So, I do what any woman does when she doesn\u2019t get her way. I cross my arms over my chest to let him know that I'm in no way cooperating. I hear him chuckle. I look up and glare at him but all it does is make him smile bigger. Getting inside, we walk up to the table he was sitting at earlier. The girl is gone but the other three guys are still sitting there. And they are all gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cNovember, these are my brothers. Trevor, Nico and Cash. Guys, this is November, Big Mike\u2019s daughter.\u201d All the guys are sitting so I can\u2019t tell how tall they are but they look big and gorgeous.</p><p>Trevor has dark brown hair that is cut short like Asher\u2019s. He has brown eyes with the longest lashes I have ever seen, his jaw is square with a couple days\u2019 worth of stubble on it and he has an amazing smile but no dimple.</p><p>Nico has dark blond hair that needs to be cut. He looks like the baby of all of them with darker blue eyes than Asher\u2019s and his face is more round than square. He has his left eye brow pierced and gauges in his ears. If I had to use one word to describe him, it would be \u2019trouble\u2019 but the good kind that you sneak out of your bedroom window in the middle of the night to go look for.</p><p>Cash looks the most like Asher with light blue eyes, dark brown hair and a square jaw but his smile is sweet and he was blessed with two dimples rather than one. I feel like I just hit the hot guy mother lode. If my best friend, Tia, was here, she would be freaking out.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Nico says, making me come out of my hot guy daze.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that Big Mike had a daughter, let alone a daughter who looks like you. What did he do, hide you away all this time?\u201d Cash asks and I laugh.</p><p>\u201cUm, no,\u201d I say, feeling heat hit my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been living in New York with my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you move here?\u201d Nico asks.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t feel safe staying in the city any more so I moved down here. I was already planning to move to Tennessee in a few months but with what happened, I just came earlier.\u201d I could feel Asher\u2019s arm around my waist tighten so much that I could make out each of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a wrong place wrong time thing,\u201d I say, not wanting to talk about it.</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm glad you\u2019re okay,\u201d Nico says. \u201dYeah,\u201d they all agreed.</p><p>\u201cYo, bro, you may want to loosen your grip before your hand fuses with her waist,\u201d Cash says, laughing. The whole situation starts to feel uncomfortable and I need to put some space between me and Asher.</p><p>\u201cWell, I came here to have a beer and play a game of pool so that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do,\u201d I say and try to walk away towards the bar but quickly feel an arm go around my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Asher whispers in my ear. I can feel the warmth from his breath against my skin and I had to fight myself from leaning into him.</p><p>\u201cTo get a beer?\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of beer do you want? I\u2019ll get it for you while you sit with my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this bossy?\u201d I ask, trying to tug free.</p><p>\u201cNope, just with you, baby.\u201d He chuckles.</p><p>\u201cOh, joy,\u201d I say, sarcastically. I can feel his body shake with laughter.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want to drink?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cCorona with lime,\u201d I tell him, debating on whether to take off the minute his back is turned. He must see my intention because he pulls out a stool, picks me up, and sits me on it.</p><p>\u201cSit here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He looks at his brothers. \u201cWatch her,\u201d he says and they all look at him like he\u2019s gone crazy. I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one who thinks so.</p><p>\u201cSo how did you meet our brother?\u201d Trevor asks, looking across the bar at Asher who has turned around and is watching me.</p><p>\u201cI started working for my dad and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d they all cut me off. \u201cShit, when do you go on? I'm so gonna be there,\u201d Nico says with a really goofy smile on his face. Then I realize what I just said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shriek. \u201cNo, I mean I work for him doing the books,\u201d I say, laughing and shaking my head. \u201cSorry, no. I'm not a stripper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, that\u2019s a shame,\u201d Cash says, smiling and I laugh harder.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a shame?\u201d Asher asks while walking up to the table with two Coronas, handing me one.</p><p>\u201cThat November is not a stripper,\u201d Cash says and they all laugh. I can feel my face getting red.</p><p>I look at Asher and see his jaw tighten. \u201cAnyways,\u201d I say, cutting in, \u201cyour brother thought I was a stripper. He made big deal about me going to my car without an escort.\u201d Thinking back on it, the whole thing is pretty funny. \u201cHe even thought I was sleeping with my dad because I called him \u2018Daddy.\u2019 I mean, ewwww,\u201d I say, scrunching up my nose. \u201cThe look on his face was priceless when my dad came over and introduced me as his daughter.\u201d Everyone started laughing, even Asher. \u201cSo I work for my dad doing the books for the club. It should take me about a month to get organized and then I won\u2019t even need to be there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d Trevor says and they all nod their heads in agreement.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to play pool?\u201d Nico asks, looking over at the now empty pool table.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I shrug and get off the stool. I take off my hoodie and wrap it around my purse. Trevor grabs it and puts it in the booth then I start walking towards the pool tables with the boys following behind me. I can feel Asher\u2019s hand on my lower back, guiding me through the bar. We\u2019re a few steps from the table when big boobed Barbie steps in front of our group. I step around her and leave them to deal with her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I hear her whine. Why women do that, I will never know. Do they not know that it\u2019s annoying?</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna play pool,\u201d I hear Asher tell her. \u201cWhat? Wait,\u201d she says. I turn around and see her grabbing on to his arm. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting all night for you to get here and you\u2019re going to ditch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ditch someone you\u2019re not with,\u201d Cash mumbles from beside me.</p><p>I turn around and start setting up the table. I have no interest in watching her throw herself at him. \u201cOkay, guys. Who\u2019s gonna break?\u201d I look up but they all look confused. \u201cAre we gonna play or what?\u201d I ask, looking at each of them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll break,\u201d Nico says, walking to pick a stick from the wall.</p><p>Standing near the table, I feel heat at my back. \u201cYou keep walking away from me,\u201d Asher says and I almost laugh because he sounds upset.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I'm sorry. I didn\u2019t realize that I was supposed to stand there while you got rid of big boobed Barbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have taken me with you when you went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to remember that next time,\u201d I say, shaking my head.</p><p>Nico, standing next to us, starts laughing. \u201cWow. The first one who is immune. I smell a recipe for disaster brewing,\u201d he says. Asher smiles down at me like he\u2019s happy about something.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I give him my most sarcastic smile. Playing pool with the guys is fun. Me and Asher are laughing and having a good time. The guys are telling me funny stories about people in town and Asher introduces me to some people who know my dad.</p><p>There have been a ton of people dropping by the table, talking to his brothers, or just introducing themselves to me. After an hour, I start to notice that there were a lot of women gathering around us. Whenever I try to make eye contact with them, they give me a dirty look. I thought this was odd and I had no idea who any of them were. Then, more and more women started coming around the table. There were so many that it was hard to shoot without ramming the stick into one of them.</p> <p>Asher was standing near me when a very pretty woman with a perfect body, deep red hair and milky white skin came up to us. She was wearing an outfit similar to big boobed Barbie except her bra was black. I was starting to wonder if this was some kind of dress code because they weren\u2019t the only two women wearing something similar.</p><p>\u201cHi, Asher,\u201d she purred, placing herself between me and him while pressing her boobs into his chest.</p><p>\u201cJen,\u201d he replied without really looking at her. Then she staged whispered in his ear so that we could all hear her.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming to my house tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you ask that shit? I haven\u2019t been to your house for over a year,\u201d he says, crossing his arms over his chest. She was almost as tall as him. I realized that they would make a beautiful couple and would give Ms. Alice amazing looking grandbabies. That\u2019s when I knew I needed to leave.</p><p>Yeah, he was hot but it was clear that he was a player. Not only that, but I would say that we didn\u2019t fit at all. I'm cute but not beautiful. I'm also not skinny. I have a tummy, big boobs and a bigger butt and, on top of all that, I'm short. It would never work. Not when I could see the women that he normally went after. They all were perfectly skinny women who looked like models.</p><p>I kept telling myself that this wasn\u2019t a date and that I didn\u2019t want him like that, but honestly, no woman in their right mind would look at a guy like him and not get their hopes up. And, after hanging out with him and getting to know him some, I found out that he was kind of sweet and really funny. But now I was done. Date or not, having women come up and rub themselves all over him with looks that said they knew exactly what to expect if he took one of them home was too much. I knew I needed to bounce as in B-O-U-N-C-E on out of there.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to make it obvious that I was leaving because of the women that were hanging around so I was biding my time and talking to Nico. Then some girl named Becky came over and I had enough. I couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer and I knew that if I didn\u2019t leave, I was going to ask all the women standing around how the hell they made it into the girl\u2019s club. I'm pretty sure there is a rule about acting desperate written on the first page.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, guys,\u201d I say, looking at my watch, or where I would have one if I ever wore a watch. \u201cI gotta go. I need to take my dog for a walk before it gets too late.\u201d All the guys turn to look at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving to walk your dog?\u201d Cash asked in a tone that said he didn\u2019t believe me. But I didn\u2019t care anymore. I just needed to leave\u2014quickly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I walk him every night. So, I guess I\u2019ll see you guys around sometime. It was nice meeting you all.\u201d</p><p>I walk to the booth that had all of our coats and dug mine out from the bottom of the pile, along with my purse. Turning around, I bumped into a solid wall.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d I say. Asher was glaring down at me with a look of disbelief and what appeared to be a lot like anger on his very handsome face. I wanted to laugh. What did he really expect? He brought me to a place where every five minutes, he\u2019s getting hit on. It was totally rude! He has so many females vying for his attention, I was sure he wouldn\u2019t even notice I was gone. Plus, I\u2019ve lived with a woman who had to be the center of attention and I refuse to date someone who had the same problem. Not that this was a date...I'm just saying, I wouldn\u2019t do that to myself.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say, trying to walk around him. He grabs my hand and starts pulling me out the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cLater, November.\u201d I hear from behind me along with a lot of laughter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, later, guys,\u201d I yell back, trying to pull my hand free without making a scene.</p><p>\u201cCan you slow down, buddy? Your legs are a lot longer than mine,\u201d I say to Asher\u2019s back. He doesn\u2019t say anything but he does slow down. Whatever. I just need to get home and forget this day ever happened. Once I\u2019m at my car, I pull my hand free and start searching for my keys.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for the beer,\u201d I say, looking in my bag. \u201cIt was um...fun. Ah...there you are, you sneaky little buggers,\u201d I say when I find my keys. I go to unlock my door and my keys are snatched out of my hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, I need those,\u201d I yell, trying to reach for the keys that are now in Asher\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou can have them back after you tell me why the fuck you\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I already told you I have to walk Beast. He\u2019s looking forward to it,\u201d I say, crossing my arms over my chest. He watches me cross my arms and his lips go into a flat line.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you said that about your dog. But I know that\u2019s not the real reason so tell my why the fuck you\u2019re really leaving.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on my hips, realizing that I'm pissed off once again. \u201cListen, buddy, I have to go walk my dog. I\u2019ve told you three times now.\u201d I show him three fingers just to make sure my point is made.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? We were having a good time then all the sudden your face looked like someone stole your ice cream and you had to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so annoying! Can\u2019t I just want to go home to my dog?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI know that there were a lot of people in there and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people in there?\u201d I ask, completely shocked. Did he not notice the harem of women gathered around us? Yes, his brothers were there and they are just as hot as him, but they didn\u2019t ask me to come here. Asher did.</p><p>\u201cI just thought you would like to meet some people. I know that you\u2019re new to town.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least now I know for sure that this was in no way a date. He just wanted to be nice and introduce me to people. Wow, I'm such a loser. Now I\u2019m pissed off that I made myself believe that maybe he liked me. And I was even more pissed off that most of the people he introduced me to were women that he had slept with. I mean, really. Was he recruiting?</p><p>\u201cWell, buddy, I did have a good time. Maybe when we do it again, you can tell all the chicks that you\u2019re sleeping with, or have slept with, to come by and we\u2019ll all hang out. They seemed so excited to meet me. How does that sound to you?\u201d His mouth was hanging open and he looked shocked. \u201cCan I have my keys now?\u201d I ask, holding out my hand. I feel like an idiot for saying that, but I know there is no way to shove the words back down my throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I slept with any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sure!\u201d I say, holding out my hand. \u201cNow, my keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d he says and I see a tic in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, not believing for one second the crap that\u2019s coming out of his mouth. \u201cCan I have my keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re taking my jeep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I can actually feel my eyes popping out of my head like I'm some crazy cartoon character.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking my jeep to get your dog and take him for a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not doing anything. I'm getting in my car and going home to walk my dog,\u201d I say, pointing at myself. \u201cYou can do whatever it is that you do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Why the hell am I sitting in his car? Oh, yeah, I remember. He picked me up and carried me\u2014kicking and screaming\u2014over his shoulder to his jeep. Then, he dropped me in the driver\u2019s side and forced me over to the passenger\u2019s seat while holding my hand so I couldn't escape.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a jerk, you know that, right?\u201d I say with my arms crossed over my chest.</p><p>\"You already said that, babe.\u201d I swear, I can see a smile on his face. \u201cBut if you would have just agreed to get in my jeep, we would not be having this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you even want to come?\u201d I ask in a huff.</p><p>\"I'm not ready to have you out of my sight.\"</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I'm interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sure.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cSo if you interested, then why not ask me out like a normal guy instead of basically kidnapping me?\u201d</p><p>\"Why? If I asked you out, you would have blown me off and avoided me. This way, you don't have a choice. I have your keys and your phone.\"</p><p>\u201cYou have my phone?\u201d I screech, opening my bag to see if he\u2019s telling the truth. \u201cHow did you get my phone? Oh my God, you\u2019re insane. I\u2019m driving down a dark road with an insane person who kidnapped me.\u201d</p><p>I hear him laughing and I look over to make sure that I'm not imagining things. He has a really great laugh. Ugh... Why couldn\u2019t he have a crappy laugh? I shake my head in disgust. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRelax, I just want to spend more time with you. Your dad trusts me so you\u2019re safe. Tell me about your mom,\u201d he says, completely ignoring my question about my phone and the fact that he kidnapped me.</p><p>Geez...</p><p>\"We're not talking about my mom. And my dad might like you but he doesn\u2019t trust you. He says you\u2019re a player. And after the performance I saw tonight, I would agree with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm no saint, but I have been honest with every woman that has hit my sheets. They know the score before anything goes down.\u201d As much as it makes my stomach knot to think about him with all those women, I have no right to judge him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I'm sorry,\u201d I whisper. I heard him let out a breath and I swear I feel his whole body relax from across the cab of his jeep.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about my mom.\u201d</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>\u201cBecause my mom stresses me out. Talking about her gets me upset even when she's thousands of miles away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, my mom is awesome. She works for me and my brothers doing office work at our construction company. She bakes us cookies at least a couple times a week and makes sure we eat lunch.\u201d</p><p>I start giggling, thinking about him and his brothers, who are all built like redwood trees, having their mom bake them cookies and remind them to eat lunch.</p><p>\"She sounds sweet,\u201d I say, laughing because it really is nice. I hope one day I can be that kind of mom to my kids. \u201cWhat does your dad do?\u201d I ask stupidly.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s the sheriff. He\u2019s been a cop forever. Mom never worked till we graduated high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really lucky. My mom was never really around,\u201d I say, leaning my head back against the seat and closing my eyes. I can actually feel the sadness in my own words. He reaches over and squeezes my knee. I can\u2019t deal with anyone feeling sorry for me, especially not him, so I change the subject.</p><p>\u201cSo your brothers work construction with you? And you work for my dad?\u201d I ask, confused.</p> <p>\"We all work together. I started the business after I got out of the Marine Corps. Then, when each of them graduated from college, they bought into the company. I don\u2019t work for your dad. My cousin owns a business that supplies security and bodyguards to businesses like your dads. Those that aren\u2019t the norm. Every once in a while, he\u2019ll call me in and ask me to check on one of his men.</p><p>\"It\u2019s great that you get to work with your brothers,\u201d I say, thinking it\u2019s good that he doesn\u2019t work at the strip club. I don\u2019t know how I would feel about dating a guy in that line of work. Not that we\u2019re dating, I remind myself. \u201cYour family seems really nice. Well, your grandma and brothers, do anyways.\u201d</p><p>\"We're all close. It\u2019s not always easy working together but at the end of the day, we know that we\u2019re family. Do you have any brothers or sisters?\"</p><p>\u201cNo. My mom had bigger dreams than having a family,\u201d I say as we pull up in front of my house.</p><p>The house is completely dark. The only light around is coming from the headlights of Asher\u2019s jeep. \u201cWhat the hell\u201d I mumble, starting to feel nervous about going inside. Not because Asher is with me and we\u2019re alone. This is more of a scared feeling, like when I have a bad dream and the fright stays stuck to you for a while after you wake up.</p><p>\"Why didn't Mike leave a light on for you?\" Asher asks, looking over at me.</p><p>\u201cUh... I don't know. I'm always home way before he leaves. Maybe he just forgot,\u201d I say, starting to get out of the jeep. I stop when he opens the glove box and pulls out a gun. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask in shock.</p><p>\u201cSafety.\u201d That\u2019s all he says before he opens his door. I follow, opening mine. Before I even make it to the front of his jeep, he\u2019s next to me, grabbing my hand. The warmth from his touch is soothing and I swear I can feel him rubbing his thumb back and forth against my skin. We start to walk up the porch when he stops me.\"Is there another way to get in the house?\" he asks, turning towards me.</p> <p>\u201cMy apartment is in the basement and has its own entrance,\" I tell him, looking around.</p><p>\u201cStay close,\u201d he says softly. I hold on to the back of his shirt, walking so close that I don\u2019t think you could slip a piece of paper between us. I can hardly see in the darkness. The only source of light is coming from the moon, cutting through the clouds. Walking around the side of the house, my heart starts pounding. It feels like it\u2019s going to jump out of my chest. My breathing starts to pick up when I think about what happened the last time I went home after dark.</p><p>The night that I was attacked, I had been walking to my apartment from the subway. I passed the alley next to my building and a guy grabbed me from behind, covered my mouth then dragged me down into the shadows next to a dumpster. That\u2019s where he proceeded to beat me. I fought as much as I could and was feeling dizzy by the time he stood over me, grabbing my head. I knew he was going to bash my head into the concrete so I closed my eyes and started to pray. Then, he was gone and I could vaguely see Beast attacking him.</p><p>Asher must notice me shaking because he stops and pulls me into his big, warm body. His arms go around me and I feel his lips touch my hair. He smells like spicy, warm man and it makes me want to crawl into his skin. He pulls my face out of his chest and brings his face towards mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d he whispers, putting his forehead to mine. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you. I want you to breathe deeply for me, okay.\" I am so caught up in how close he is that I can\u2019t think about anything but leaning in and touching my mouth to his. I shake my head, trying to clear it, and take a deep breath. I wonder if he can read my mind because even in the darkness, I can see the white of his smile.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asks. I feel his breath against my lips so I pull my face away and nod, not trusting myself to speak. My apartment door is down a short set of stairs. Asher's in front of me and he opens the door. \u201cStay here until I come and get you,\u201d he says, entering my dark apartment.</p><p>\"Okay,\u201d I say as my hands start to shake. After a few minutes, Beast comes running out. I bend down to pet him but his fur feels wet. What the heck? Holding my hands close to my face, they look really dark. Then the light comes on and I scream. My hands are covered in blood. \u201cOh my God! What happened?\u201d I say, running my hands over Beast\u2019s body. He's red also but I can't feel any kind of cuts or holes on him. I'm shaking so badly that I have to sit on the ground. Beast immediately crawls into my lap.</p><p>\"Fuck,\" Asher clips, coming outside. He pushes Beast off me and pulls me into his arms. \u201cBaby, it\u2019s okay. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>I tho... I... I thought Beast was hurt but I couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with him. Why is he covered in blood?\u201d I sob while he rubs my back and pulls me tighter into him.</p><p>\u201cBeast is fine but we need to call the police. Someone broke into the house and used something red to write on the walls. Somehow, Beast got it on him before they locked him upstairs.\u201d Before he can finish what he\u2019s saying, I run into my apartment. The living room is trashed. On the wall, in red letters that looks like blood, is a message.</p><p>No sun - no moon!</p><p>No morn - no noon -</p><p>No dawn - no dusk - no proper time of day.</p><p>No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful ease,</p><p>No comfortable feel in any member -</p><p>No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees,</p><p>No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds! -</p><p>November!</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I whisper as Asher picks me up and carries me back outside.</p><p>\u201cI know that poem. It\u2019s November by Thomas Hood. Why would someone write that on my wall?\u201d I ask, trying to figure out what the words mean.</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure,\u201d he says. I\u2019m sure I feel him kiss the side of my head.</p><p>\u201cI can walk, you know,\u201d I grumble. He doesn\u2019t answer me or put me down until he drops me in the passenger side of his jeep. With my feet out the door, he stands between my legs. His arms wrap around my body and one of his hands reaches in his back pocket for his phone.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. Gotta problem. I'm at Big Mike\u2019s house with his daughter, November. Her apartment was broken into. Yeah, Mike\u2019s daughter. We\u2019re not gonna talk about that shit right now. Yeah, see ya.\" Closing the phone, he tosses it behind me on the driver\u2019s seat. I'm looking down at my hands. They\u2019re covered in red gunk and so are my jeans. All I can wonder is who would do this and why.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, baby!\u201d I lift my eyes to his and they are warm and concerned. \u201cI will make sure that you are safe. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Looking into his eyes with the jeep\u2019s interior light reflecting off them, I can see he\u2019s worried so I tell him about New York and being attacked before I left. He listens the whole time. His eyes turn darker and his jaw is getting tighter with every word. He shakes his head when I finish, pulling me in for a hug that I think is more for him than for me.</p><p>\"Thank you for helping me,\" I say.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he says, kissing my head, \u201cnever have to thank me for doing something I want to do.\"</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm glad you were here.\u201d And that\u2019s not a lie. I can\u2019t imagine what would have happened if I had come home by myself.</p><p>\"Fuck, baby, me too,\u201d he says, letting out a long breath.</p><p>I look down at Beast, who is sitting at our feet, looking up at us and waiting to see if we\u2019re still going for a walk or if I might have a treat. His head tilts when I start talking to him. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re gonna get a bath, boy.\u201d He tilts his head the other direction. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re done, I need take one too,\u201d I say then realized that I was, once again, talking to my dog. I look up at Asher and he\u2019s smiling. I said the first thing that popped into my head.</p><p>\"Do I look like Carrie?\u201d He burst out laughing then kissed my forehead.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re covered from having that damn dog sit on you while you hugged him. When my dad gets here and checks everything out, you can shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I whisper, horrified when I remember that his dad is the sheriff. \u201cYour dad\u2019s coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby. He's the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, your dad\u2019s coming,\u201d I repeat. Without thinking, I stick my hands up the front of his shirt and use it to wipe my face. \"Is that better?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\"I can't believe you just did that,\u201d he says, sounding completely shocked.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Your dad\u2019s going to meet me looking like Carrie,\u201d I cry out. I still have my hands up his shirt so I repeat the process of wiping my face. Then I use the inside to wipe my hands. I look up because he's not saying anything.</p><p>\"I can't believe you just did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay! So, is most of the red off my face?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a new shirt,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>\"Fine, whatever. But is the red gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby. The red is mostly gone but now I don't know if I should kiss you or spank you for that shit.\"</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\" I whisper and press my forehead against his chest to hide my huge smile. My belly was doing acrobatics at the thought of him kissing me. Two minutes later, red and blue lights flash up the driveway and two police cars pull in next to Asher\u2019s jeep. Looking around Asher's big body, I see a very tall man with grey hair mixed with dirty blond walking towards us. This must be his dad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDad, this is November,\u201d Asher says, taking a step back. Then, he pulls me from the seat. When my feet hit the ground, he puts his arm around me, dragging me into his body. His dad is smiling when he walks towards us.</p><p>\u201cHi, November. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you visiting my mama with that dog of yours. She\u2019s been bragging about you for a few weeks now. But I didn\u2019t know that you were Big Mike\u2019s daughter. I don\u2019t think anyone even knew he had a daughter,\u201d he says with a kind smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cYour mom is a very nice lady, Mr. Mayson. And, not a lot of people know about me,\u201d I tell him as if he doesn\u2019t already know it.</p><p>\u201cPlease call me James. Mr. Mayson makes me feel old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, laughing.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened tonight? You said someone broke in?\u201d</p><p>Asher told his dad about the red writing in my living room and Beast being covered in the same liquid that was used on the walls. And how all the lights were off in the house when we got there.</p><p>\u201cOkay, darlin\u2019, do you know of anyone who would want to hurt you?\u201d he asks, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cNo, but the reason I moved here is because I was attacked in New York. Then, on the way here, I pulled into a rest stop to let Beast out and a car with New York plates pulled up a couple minutes later. The strange thing was that I was parked in the area for dogs and they never got out with a dog. I got spooked and ran back to my car but didn\u2019t see them again. So I don\u2019t know if it was just my imagination or if I was really in danger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no telling,\u201d he says, looking more concerned. \u201cDid you ever receive gifts or anything unusual before you were attacked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. Why? Do you think I have a stalker or something?\u201d I ask, a chill sliding down my spine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. I'm gonna do some checking around and see if we can find anything. Can you stay with someone else for the night? I don\u2019t think you should be alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... I ugh... have to call my dad. I'm sure that I can stay at my grandma\u2019s or uncle\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying with me!\u201d Asher says, making my heart pound.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d I say, looking up at him.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t give a fuck. You\u2019re not leaving my sight and I don\u2019t think your grandma or uncle want me staying at either of their houses with you. So you\u2019re staying with me.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes at Asher, I see his dad watching us. He looks smug for some reason.</p><p>\u201cYour son is very annoying and bossy,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI'm sure with you he is, darling.\u201d He laughs. \u201cBut he\u2019s a Mayson so I also know that his bossy side is coming from is a very safe place,\u201d he says, looking at me. His smile is so warm that my stomach does a flip. \u201cWhat did I tell you, son?\u201d he says, looking at Asher. \u201cWhen it happens\u2014BOOM!\u201d He makes a motion with his hands of an explosion.</p><p>\u201cWhen what happens?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d they say at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAlrighty, then,\u201d I say, looking back at Asher. \u201cI need to call my dad.\u201d After calling him and explaining everything that happened, Dad wanted to come home. I explained that Asher and his dad were with me and that he didn't need to worry. I knew the club was busy because every few minutes, someone was asking him a question while we were on the phone. I told him that me and Beast were going to stay with Asher for the night.</p><p>To say my dad didn't like that idea was an understatement. It took ten minutes to assure him that I wouldn't do anything stupid but he still made me put Asher on the phone to reiterate his point to him. The only thing Asher said was, \"She's safe with me, Mike,\" then he handed me back my phone. So now me, a hosed off Beast and my overnight bag are on our way to Asher's place. We drive out into the country. All along the roads are open fields. \"So you live out here?\" I ask, looking at his profile in the lights of the dashboard.</p> <p>\"Yeah, I bought the land I live on when I first started my business and started building my house not long after.\"</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s impressive. How old were you when you started your company?\u201d I ask, wanting to know his age but trying to be sneaky about it.</p><p>\u201cI was twenty-two when I first started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. How long ago was that?\u201d I hear him chuckle and I look over at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm twenty-seven, babe. Nothing is ever easy with you, is it?\u201d he asks and I hear amusement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I say, feeling like an idiot that he figured me out. We pass a large red barn then turn down a dirt road. I can\u2019t see anything ahead of us until we go over a small hill. My breath catches and I'm stunned. I don\u2019t know what I expected but I didn\u2019t expect to see a large, two story log house with a wraparound porch on the second level. Beams are holding it up and space for parking is below. I see a car and four wheeler parked under it.</p><p>\u201cYou built this?\u201d I ask and even to myself I sound breathy.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It took me four years to get it finished because I was working on it between jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I say because...wow, it\u2019s just amazing.</p><p>We get out of the jeep and start walking up to the front porch. Beast is walking behind us and it\u2019s so quiet out here that I can hear his tail cutting through the air. He's so excited to see this new place and explore. Asher let us inside and I am completely stunned by what I see. It\u2019s huge. You can see the logs. There are no white walls. It\u2019s all warm wood and open. There are giant windows that jut out and make the space almost seem larger. There is a sunken living room with a long, dark blue couch in the center of the room. It looks like it needs to be replaced but it also looks really comfortable. On the wall, there is a huge entertainment center and off to the side is a floor to ceiling fire place made out of different types of rocks. There are no pictures or throw pillows of any kind. Actually, looking around, I realize that there are no decorations anywhere. We turn a corner and enter a giant kitchen with stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, and a large island in the middle with the stove built into it. It looks like a chef's dream but it also looks unused.</p><p>\u201cDo you cook?\u201d I ask. That\u2019s the only reason I can think someone would want a kitchen this large.</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d he says with a look on his face that I can\u2019t read. What the heck? This is a top of the line kitchen. I would love to spend hours in this kitchen baking or just sitting at the island and drinking coffee.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, it\u2019s a really nice kitchen.\u201d I mean, what else I could say?</p><p>\u201cGlad you like it,\u201d he says in a way that makes me think he\u2019s really glad that I like it. I follow him down a hall that runs beside the kitchen. I look for Beast but don\u2019t see him so I turn around to search him out. When I walk back through the kitchen, I stop. Beast is lying on the couch on his back with his legs straight up in the air. I feel an arm slide around my waist and Asher speaks close to my ear. \u201cLooks like he made himself at home.\u201d A shiver runs across my skin and I know that he can feel it when his arm goes tighter.</p><p>\u201cShould I tell him to get down?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. He\u2019s fine,\u201d he says in his deep drawl. I love that he calls me baby, and at the same time, it scares me that I love it. \u201cLet me show you the bedroom,\u201d he mumbles. At his words, I get another shiver. This one\u2019s in a completely different place.</p><p>We walk past two rooms with the doors open. One is an office and the other is a workout room. Across the hall from both is a bathroom. At the end of the hall, he opens the door. I follow behind him and realize that this is his bedroom. There is a platform bed that\u2019s so big, everyone I know could sleep on it and no one would even touch. The sheets and blankets are a mess and there are clothes scattered all over the floor.</p><p>Next to the bed is a wall of windows and the shades are slightly open. I can see a deck off his room as well. Beside the bed are night stands built into the wall. There is a long, black dresser in the same color of the bed and side tables. There are two doors. One is open and I can tell that it\u2019s my dream closet. It\u2019s the size of my apartment back in New York. I walk towards it without thinking and turn on the light. I could fit a chair and a table in the space and still have room to add a king size bed.</p><p>There are shelves on both sides that have a few pairs of shoes and boots on them and along the walls there is plenty of space to hang clothes. There are a few pieces of clothing hanging but most of it is in piles on the floor.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I'm in love.\u201d I hear Asher laughing behind me so I turn to look over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou have committed a huge crime,\u201d I tell him with a completely straight face. He\u2019s still laughing. \u201cNo, seriously, this closet should be taken care of and should never have stuff defacing the floor.\u201d He throws his head back and is laughing so hard that the tendons in his neck are out. I catch myself wanting to run my tongue along them. I double blink at that thought. When his eyes come back to mine, he\u2019s still chuckling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even like doing laundry. I'm not a big fan of hanging shit up,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course,\u201d I whisper. Geez, I'm such a dork. He\u2019s a guy. They don\u2019t care about dream closets and having the space to show of all their fashion treasures. I step out of the closet and cross my arms under my breasts. His eyes drop to my cleavage so I quickly uncross my arms. Then, I realize that I'm standing in his bedroom and I'm sleeping in his house while he\u2019s there.</p><p>I look at the bed then back at him. He\u2019s watching me the whole time. When we make eye contact again, there is something working behind his beautiful blue eyes that makes me hold my breath. He breaks eye contact and runs his hand over his head. I clench my hands into fist. I want to know if his hair will feel prickly against my palms. \u201cUm...\u201d I say, trying to clear my brain now that it seems to have gone into an Asher fog. He looks up and smiles. I see his dimple and that doesn\u2019t help. Now I want to lick his cheek and taste his dimple. His smile widens and I swear that he can read my mind. Crap, crap, crap.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me show you the bathroom and you can change and get ready for bed,\u201d he says.</p><p>Thank God for small favors, I think to myself until we walk into the bathroom. There is a large walk in shower that\u2019s made out of rock with a glass door that makes it look like an open cave. Next to the shower is a bathtub that dreams are made of. Well, at least girl dreams. I can\u2019t picture Asher filling it with bubbles and having a soak. Then, I'm bombarded with thoughts of Asher naked and in the bathtub. I'm staring at the tub when I hear him moving behind me so I turn around. He has my bag in his hand and is setting it on the sink.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to take a bath and get into bed. I gotta make a few calls.\u201d I would love to take a bath in his tub. Well, I would love to take a bath in his tub with him but I push that thought away.</p><p>\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d I say, feeling strange. He smiles and leaves, closing the door behind him. I stand there for a few more minutes, trying to figure out what the heck is happening. Then I realize that I\u2019ve been standing there staring at the tub so I jerk out of my Asher tub fog and go to the sink. I took a shower before I left my house so I just dig through my bag and find my pajamas. They\u2019re white, cotton, sleep shorts with a yellow drawstring that matches a yellow tank top. I tie my hair in a knot at the top of my head and wash my face. Then, I dig through my bag and find my toothbrush and toothpaste. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After I'm done, I put on some nighttime skin cream. That is one thing my mom taught me. It was good advice to never go to bed without night cream. She would say, \u2018No man wants a woman with wrinkles.\u2019 How she would know, this I don\u2019t know. She has been getting Botox since she was twenty and that\u2019s probably the last time her face showed an expression that wasn\u2019t surprise.</p><p>I open the door to the bedroom and the room is dark except for one of the bed side lights. I realize that Asher made the bed while I was changing and for some reason that makes me smile. I think about going out and getting Beast but he won\u2019t move if he\u2019s asleep unless I carry him and that\u2019s not going to happen. I wonder where Asher is sleeping. Then I realize that I'm tired and don\u2019t care. I look at the clock on the side table and see that it\u2019s after two in the morning. Without thinking, I crawl into bed. It smells like him so I pull the covers over me and I'm, once again, dead to the world.</p><p>I wake up feeling warm and cozy. It takes me a minute to realize that it is not Beast behind me. Beast doesn\u2019t have arms. I keep my eyes closed and hold my breath, trying to figure out what has happened? Then, I hear the door open.</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d I hear a woman\u2019s voice say and my eyes pop open, and I'm looking into the eyes of a beautiful, older woman and she's looking back at me. Asher's arm goes tight around me and I look over my shoulder. \u201cMorning, baby,\u201d he rumbles into my ear. I'm so humiliated that I blurt out the first thing that pops into my head when I turn back to look at the woman.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have sex!\u201d I basically yell this at her.</p><p>The lady looks at me again and smiles so big that I can see all of her teeth. \u201cI'll just be in the kitchen,\u201d she says and Asher starts laughing as she\u2019s closing the door behind her. I swear I hear her giggle. As soon as I know the door is closed, I turn to Asher. I'm really going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThis is my bed,\u201d he says, smiling. Grrrrrrr. I want to choke him.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were sleeping on the couch or, like, in another room or something,\u201d I say and wonder why he thinks this is so funny.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I do that? My bed is big. Plus, your dog was taking up the whole couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have woken me up. I would've slept on the couch with Beast,\u201d I tell him, trying to shove his arm off me.</p><p>\u201cMy bed is big enough for both of us. We didn't even have to touch, but the minute I got into bed, you were all over me,\u201d he says, hugging me tighter.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you're so full of it. I was asleep. I didn't even know you were here. How could I be all over you?\u201d I yell at him knowing full well that my face is turning red.</p><p>\u201cWhen I climbed into bed, you wrapped yourself around me,\u201d he says, watching my face. I can feel it getting redder by the second.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I say, even though I most likely did. I have always liked to cuddle.</p> <p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he says, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I mumble, trying to hide my face.</p><p>\u201cAt least tell me that\u2019s not your mother,\u201d I say, covering my face with my hands. He starts laughing and pulls me down in the bed so I'm basically lying under him. Feeling his skin against mine, I uncover my eyes and see that he\u2019s not wearing a shirt. How I missed that, I have no idea. His chest is awesome. It\u2019s wide and you can see the definition of all of the muscles. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of chest hair, just enough that you could feel it against your chest as he moves inside of you. His tattoos start under his collar bone and go around his shoulders and down his arms. They look like fire but it\u2019s all tribal. Running in and out of the flames are names and a pair of military type boots. Then the same design goes down his other arm but with a gun and a military type hat. It\u2019s shaded in black and has bright colors running through. It\u2019s truly a piece of art.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s my ma. She probably came to make sure you were okay. I'm sure Dad told her what happened last night,\u201d he says, startling me out of the perusal I was making of his body and tattoos. I look up into his smiling face, wondering what he thinks is so funny about his mom finding me in his bed.</p><p>\u201cThis is so embarrassing. She probably thinks I'm a slut,\u201d I say, wondering if this is normal for him.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t think anything except that you slept here after your apartment was broken into. Now we need to get up but first, you need to kiss me,\u201d he tells me with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou need to kiss me. All night you slept cuddled into me. You can\u2019t do that to a man without at least kissing him.\u201d His face was close to mine and his eyes were warm. My eyes drop to his mouth. I couldn\u2019t help it, he has a nice mouth.</p> <p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he whispers his mouth brushing mine.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper back, watching his eyes darken.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I'm going to kiss you,\u201d he says against my lips. My brain is screaming, \u2018Yes, yes. yes.\u2019 Then I feel his lips touch mine softly. My hand moves to his bicep to hold on. When his mouth moves away from mine, I want to pull him back. Then he licks the seam of my mouth and the minute his tongue touches me, my lips part.</p><p>I kiss him back, first softly then wildly. My other hand reaches for his hair and I run my palm against it, feeling it prickle my skin, happy to know it feels as good as I thought it would. When his hand went to my hair, I could feel him pull out my hair tie and grab a fist full of hair at the back of my head. The bite of pain felt so good that I moaned into his mouth. He bit my lip softly then sucked my tongue into his mouth. I followed him, doing the same. He growls and his other hand travels along my side until I feel his fingers near my breast. I press myself into his hand and he growls again. My other hand goes from his bicep to his back. It is so smooth and hard at the same time. I\u2019m mesmerized by the sensation of his thumb traveling across my nipple, I whimper, arching into him. He pulls his mouth away from mine, shoving my face into his neck. \u201cFuck!\u201d I was so turned on that I didn\u2019t realize what was happening until I heard his mom from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI'm making coffee, kiddos. Where is the dog food?\u201d she asked through the door.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I whisper into his neck and I can feel his body start to shake. \u201cThis is not funny,\u201d I tell him and he laughs harder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. This shit is not funny. I'm harder than I\u2019ve ever been in my life and I know Ma\u2019s not gonna leave until she see for herself that you\u2019re okay.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to think too much about it but the thought of me turning him on and making him harder than he\u2019s ever been makes me smile and I can\u2019t help but giggle.</p><p>\u201cAre you laughing at me, baby?\u201d he whispers in my ear. I start laughing louder. Then he starts tickling me. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me, baby.\u201d I was laughing so hard that I thought I might pee my pants so I started begging him to stop. \u201cPlease, I won\u2019t laugh at you anymore. I promise, I promise,\u201d I say through my laughter. He stops and looks down at me and both of his hands cup my face.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re so fucking beautiful.\u201d The way he said it, and the way he is looking at me, makes me believe that he really thinks I\u2019m beautiful. I can feel my face go soft at his words. He bends his head and kisses me again. This time, it\u2019s soft and sweet. When his mouth leaves mine, we are both breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s, beautiful,\u201d I tell him softly, running my fingers down his jaw. His face goes soft and his eyes warm. His mouth is coming toward mine again.</p><p>\u201cAlright, kids, coffee\u2019s on and I still can\u2019t find the dog food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa, Jesus! We\u2019ll be out in a minute to feed the dog,\u201d Asher yells.</p><p>\u201cAsher James Mayson, you watch your tone and don\u2019t use the lord\u2019s name in vain,\u201d his mom says.</p><p>I have to bite my lip but when I can\u2019t hold it and start laughing, I have to cover my mouth so his mom doesn\u2019t hear me.</p><p>Without warning, he knifes up and pulls me up with him. We are suddenly standing next to the bed. He bends to kiss my nose then turns and walks towards the bathroom. I\u2019m stuck in place, looking at his back muscles as he moves. I was still standing in the same place when I heard the toilet flush and he walks out. Then I was in a complete Asher fog because he was still shirtless and the tattoos on his arms and chest were on full display, along with his eight pack abs and the sexy v leading into his loose sweats.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna feed Beast or do you want to stand there and stare at me some more?\u201d he asks. I look into his face and see a very arrogant smile with his dimple out.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I muttered and hear him chuckle as I walk around the bed with my eyes to my feet.</p><p>Once in the bathroom, I shut the door and look at myself in the mirror. My green eyes look brighter, my lips are swollen from kissing, my cheeks are pink and my hair is wild. I remember how I ended up looking like this and smile then quickly frown. Asher is hot but I\u2019m not the kind of girl that sleeps with, then makes out with, a guy after one date. Plus, we weren\u2019t even on an actual date. Then again, I didn\u2019t know that we were going to sleep together.</p><p>Shaking my head at my own crazy thoughts, I decide that I\u2019m just going to be honest and tell him that I don\u2019t do casual. I'm sure that will scare him off. I brush my teeth and pull out a bra and zip up sweatshirt from my bag. After putting both on, I head out of the room to the kitchen. When I get there, Asher is sitting on a bar stool, still shirtless, with a cup of coffee in front of him. Once he notices me, he does a full body sweep. I get a smile out of him but it\u2019s a small smile. This time, there is no dimple. Hummm.</p><p>\u201cHi, I'm Susan, Asher\u2019s mom.\u201d At the sound of her voice, I jump. I\u2019m so caught up in Asher\u2019s missing dimple that I forget his mom is here. She comes around the island and takes my hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cI'm November,\u201d I say, smiling back at her. She is very pretty. She has short, dark brown hair that is cut into a cute mom bob. Her eyes are the same color as Asher\u2019s. She\u2019s wearing a white button-up shirt with a large turquoise necklace, dark blue jeans and brown cowboy boots. She looks very county chic and I\u2019m instantly in love with her. Then she grabs me into a tight hug. The instant that her arms wrap around me in a motherly hug, I want to cry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you, November,\u201d she whispers into my hair. I hug her tighter, closing my eyes against the tears that want to escape. She steps back and hold\u2019s me at arm\u2019s length. \u201cWell, you are as beautiful as everyone said you were.\u201d I was taken off guard by her comment. I mean, my dad calls me beautiful and Asher told me that this morning, but that was in the heat of the moment. I\u2019m not ugly but I\u2019ve always just been cute. Even my ex-boyfriends have only ever said that I was cute and my mom never once in my life has called me beautiful.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mutter, feeling awkward. I can feel heat rise up my cheeks. She smiles brighter and turns towards Asher. They both share a smile and I feel like I\u2019m intruding on a private moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you like coffee?\u201d she asks, walking back into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cLike is not the word I would use for how I feel about coffee,\u201d I say. She tilts her head to the side, giving me a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cUm... I love coffee,\u201d I say, feeling like a dork. \u201cI'm pretty sure that my coffee consumption alone is helping to get the United States out of debt.\u201d I\u2019m rambling and both she and Asher laugh. I hear scratching and look to the side. Beast has his big paw on the glass door, wanting in. I walk to the door and when I open it, Beast comes in with such force that he knocks me on my butt and starts licking me like he hasn\u2019t seen me in weeks. I\u2019m laughing when I look up and see Asher and his mom watching me with the same smile on their faces.</p><p>\u201cAlright, let her up,\u201d Asher says, pushing Beast away. He stands over me with his legs on either side of my body, looking down. \u201cYou\u2019re too much,\u201d he mumbles. His hands take mine to lift me off the ground. His words hit me hard for some reason. My mom used to tell me that I was too much, but every time she said it, she would get a look on her face that said she didn\u2019t know why she even bothered with me. I didn\u2019t want to look at Asher and see the same look on his face so let go of his hands, avoiding his eyes. I walk to the island where his mom has a cup of coffee waiting for me. I pour in some milk and add two scoops of sugar. She and Asher are both watching me. I need to get away so I can pull myself together.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for the coffee,\u201d I say, looking at Asher\u2019s mom with tears clogging my throat. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I just need to get Beast\u2019s food out of my bag.\u201d Walking out of the kitchen and down the hall, I feel like an idiot. My mom isn\u2019t even here and she is making me feel like crap. I\u2019m at the door of Asher\u2019s room when I feel an arm around my waist and I\u2019m flying through the air. I let out a girly scream then land in the bed with Asher on top of me.</p><p>\u201cWh... Wha... What are you doing?\u201d I asked, stuttering and trying to shove him off me.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened back there?\u201d he asks, holding me down. I can\u2019t tell him that my mom has made me a total nut case so I just press my lips together, trying harder to shove him off. I didn\u2019t want his mom to hear me scream at him that it was none of his business. \u201cYou were laughing once second and then you closed up. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just need to get Beast\u2019s food. Now get off me,\u201d I say, shoving at him.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened. Did I hurt you?\u201d He really looks worried.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I pulled you up, did I hurt you?\u201d he asks again, making me feel even worse.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t hurt me. I'm fine now. Can you please move so I can feed my dog?\u201d I ask, shoving him again.</p><p>\u201cSo what was it then? One minute you were rolling around on the floor with your dog, laughing. Then you looked like someone smacked you. I'm not letting you up until you tell me what happened.\u201d I feel tears and I don\u2019t want to cry in front of him. How can you tell someone that had an amazing mom that yours totally messed up your head.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d I say because he really wouldn\u2019t. No one could understand how it feels to have the person who is supposed to protect and guide you through life makes you feel completely worthless.</p><p>\u201cTry me,\u201d he whispers. His hand moves from where he was holding me down to glide through the hair at my temple. I feel tears start to fall and I try to look away but he\u2019s holding my face in his hands and bends over to kiss each eye. \u201cPlease tell me, baby,\u201d he whisper. I can\u2019t help it. His voice is so soft and his warmth is all around me and I feel safe in that moment. Maybe safer than I\u2019ve ever felt.</p> <p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s not like yours. She\u2019s not sweet, she doesn\u2019t hug, she doesn\u2019t tell people that they\u2019re beautiful, she would never make anyone coffee.\u201d Tears are falling harder and I feel like I have sand in my throat. \u201cI know that it\u2019s stupid, but my whole life she has made me feel bad about myself. My mom is abusive. Not physically, but verbally and emotionally. She has cut me down my whole life. It took me a long time to realize that what she has drilled into my head wasn\u2019t true but those wounds are still there and they run so deep that there are times I can still feel them inside me. Even when someone makes a passing comment that anyone else would laugh at, to me, it feels like a cut.\u201d I realize that I have my eyes closed so I open them and see that Asher looks pissed. His whole body is tight and his teeth are clenched. I started to get scared and he must have read my face. He looks into my eyes and I feel his whole body relax. His jaw unclenches and his thumb travels over my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cIt was what I said about you being \u2018too much.\u2019\u201d He didn\u2019t ask, it was just a statement. I nod my head because I can\u2019t talk. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful when you laugh. Not too many women would get tackled to the ground by a dog, even their own, and laugh about it, definitely not in front of a man. That\u2019s why I said you were too much. I love that you don\u2019t care what people think and that you act like yourself around me. I'm sorry that your mom is a bitch. I bet that she\u2019s jealous of you so she cut you down, hoping you would always feel infer to her. Hopefully, we can work on filling all the marks she left,\u201d he says softly. His fingers wipe away my tears. I feel it down to my soul. The words that he said feel true but then I remember that I can\u2019t trust it or believe him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do casual,\u201d I blurt out. I wanted to cover my face or go hide in the bathroom. Instead, I close my eyes. His body is shaking so I open my eyes and he\u2019s laughing. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d I ask, irritated.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I would try that with you, knowing that your dad, uncle, and cousins would come to kick my ass if I wanted something casual?\u201d he asks, searching my face.</p><p>\u201cUgh...\u201d That never crossed my mind.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t casual. Christ!\u201d He growled. \u201cYou\u2019ve met my brothers, mom, dad, and grandma. No woman I\u2019ve ever dated has met my whole family. I\u2019ve wanted you from the moment I saw you in the club, hanging on your dad. That\u2019s why I was pissed when I caught you outside. Then when I saw you with my grandmother, I knew I was fucked. She\u2019d been talking about you for weeks, telling me that I need to meet this girl that\u2019s so beautiful and sweet. She told me that she just moved into town and I should ask her out before someone else did. She was right. I realized yesterday that I needed to stake my claim before some stupid fuck got to you. That\u2019s why I did what you called \u2018kidnapping.\u2019 I like to call that \u2018securing my future.\u2019 We\u2019re going to see where this goes, November, and while we\u2019re doing that, it\u2019s not going to be casual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, feeling excited and a little scared from the tone of his voice and the look in his eyes. I can tell he\u2019s dead serious.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He kisses me softly. \u201cAnd just so you know, if your mother ever comes to visit, I won\u2019t be nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my mother will ever come to town.\u201d I\u2019m looking over his shoulder at the same time as I\u2019m praying that I\u2019m right. I truly hope my mother never shows her face in this town. My dad would flip and my grandmother would probably shoot her.</p><p>\u201cAlright, now we need to get up before Ma comes in here. She\u2019s worried about you after what happened last night and the look on your face when you walked out of the kitchen. Let\u2019s go have breakfast then go meet your dad at your house.\u201d As if Asher summoned it from thin air, my phone started playing Highway to Hell, my dad\u2019s ring tone. Asher stands, bringing me with him, then walks to his jeans on the floor and pulls my cell out of his pocket and hands it to me. I turn around and put my phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I'm good. I'm getting ready to feed Beast and then I'm going to eat breakfast with Asher and his mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mom is there?\u201d he says, sounding surprised.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she came by this morning. Mr. Mayson told her about what happened last night and I guess she wanted to make sure I was alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHum,\u201d I hear my dad say then he\u2019s quiet.</p><p>\u201cDad, you still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I'm here, baby girl. So what time are you going to be home?\u201d</p><p>I turn and see Asher leaning against the door, watching me. \u201cWhat time do you think we\u2019ll be at my dad\u2019s?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cIn about an hour and a half, baby,\u201d he says softly. I feel a small smile touch my mouth at the word baby.</p><p>\u201cAsher says about an hour and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard him, baby girl. Can you put him on the phone for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sure. Hold on. Dad wants to talk to you,\u201d I say to Asher, holding out my phone. He slides it from my hand and kisses me on my nose then takes a step back, putting the phone to his ear.</p><p>\u201cMike,\u201d I hear him say. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll talk when I get there.\u201d</p><p>Then he hands the phone back to me. \u201cDad,\u201d I say, hoping that with the tone I'm using, he understands that I'm not being stupid.</p><p>\u201cSee you when you get here, baby girl. Love you.\u201d He hangs up before I can tell him I love him too. Asher is watching me.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I ask, looking at the phone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good, baby. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, feeling dread creep up my spine. I knew Dad was going to say something to Asher when we got to the house and I was suddenly nervous about going home. We walk back into the kitchen and Mrs. Mayson is standing at the stove.</p><p>\u201cDo you like grits?\u201d she asks with a smile. I have no idea what grits are and she must have read the look on my face.</p><p>\u201cOkay, how about some eggs and toast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Thank you, Mrs. Mayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Susan, beautiful. Mrs. Mayson makes me feel old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Do you have a bowl I can use to put Beast\u2019s food in?\u201d I ask Asher. He gets up and walks around the island to pull out a huge bowl. The kind that you would use to make cookies or bread in. He fills the bowl to the top. I watched this in horror, too stunned to stop him. I always measured his food so he doesn\u2019t eat too much. I read online that you have to be careful with big dogs and their diets.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask as Asher sets the bowl down on the ground.</p><p>\u201cFeeding the dog,\u201d he says with an eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t feed him that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asks with his eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cBecause I Googled it and they say to measure it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, he\u2019s a dog. He knows when to stop eating.\u201d He\u2019s looking at me like he thinks something is funny.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I ask, tilting my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had dogs my whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d That was all I could say. Beast was my first dog and all the information I had came from Google. He chuckled and I kind of wanted to punch him in the arm for laughing at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I say, shaking my head. His arm goes to the back of my head and he kisses me. I can hear his mom laughing. Oh my God, how embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kiss me in front of your mom,\u201d I whisper when he pulls away.</p><p>\u201cJust did and it won\u2019t be the last time.\u201d I hear his mom laugh again and I look at her, smiling down at the stove. Her head comes up and she looks happy for some reason.</p><p>\u201cI love this, honey. Asher and his women, well, all my sons and their women. None of them ever came around. At first, I thought maybe they were embarrassed of me and their dad. Then, me and James were out one night and we saw Cash with this girl. Let me tell you...after that, I was glad they never brought anyone around if that was what they would bring home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was lucky enough to meet some of those women first hand last night when Asher took me to the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t?\u201d His mom looked over at Asher with narrow eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe totally did.\u201d I smile and look over at Asher who looks like he\u2019s ready to strangle me.</p><p>\u201cAsher James Mayson, I thought I taught you better than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa, we met the boy\u2019s there to play pool. I don\u2019t have any control over who goes to the bar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you took her to play pool for a first date.\u201d She looks at me. \u201cI swear I raised him better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a date,\u201d I reassure her.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ma,\u201d Asher grumbles. He looks at me and his eyes narrow. \u201cIt was a date.\u201d All I can do is shake my head and smile.</p><p>\u201cYou know, even when Asher was married, we never met the girl. All we knew was that they met when he was stationed in Texas and got married at a court house. We weren\u2019t even invited.\u201d I feel my heart drop into my stomach at the thought of him married. Stupid, I know. I mean, I was engaged and thought that I would spend the rest of my life with the douche bag.</p><p>\u201cMa, Jesus! What the fuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth, Asher James.\u201d She glared at him then looked at me. \u201cSorry, I thought you knew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, no. That\u2019s okay. I mean, we just met and we all have a past. Some of it beautiful and some ugly,\u201d I told her. There were some things in my past that were ugly too. Like the guy that I was going to marry before he slept with my mother. How much more ugly could you get? Her eyes were soft and she gave me a sad smile.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you kids planning for the day?\u201d she asked, thankfully changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cGoing home then I need to have my dad take me to get my car.\u201d I was standing at the corner of the island. Asher pulled my hand, dragging me in between his legs. He had a hand on my hip and I looked him in the eye and gave him a death glare. He ran his fingers down the side of my face and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI'm gonna give Ma the key to your car. She can have Nico or Cash bring your car home for you. Then you need to pack up some stuff and bring it over. I\u2019ll be out for a while, I gotta go up to Nashville to check on the job site and make sure the fire inspector doesn\u2019t shut us down. I\u2019ll give you a key so just come in and make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>I know I have an \u2018are you crazy\u2019 look on my face but he was telling me to stay the night again. What?</p><p>\u201cI'm not staying here,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou are staying here. Your dad works the club at night and doesn\u2019t get home till after four in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not! I\u2019ll just stay with my grandma,\u201d I tell him, even though I don\u2019t want to stay with her. She has three cats and every time I walk into her house, my eyes get so swollen that I can\u2019t blink.</p> <p>\u201cIf you try to go to your grandma\u2019s, I will go there and drag you back here so I suggest that you just come here and save us both the trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d I ask, thinking that I know the answer is yes. \u201cI'm not going to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d I have a feeling that we are not going to talk about it later and that he is going to try to boss me into doing what he wants me to do. I glare at him again and he has the nerve to laugh. Then his mom slides some eggs and toast in front of us and then comes around the island and sits down. I move out from between Asher\u2019s legs and sit on the stool between him and his mom. I turn towards her, completely dismissing him and he knows what I doing because he\u2019s still chuckling. He grabs my neck and kisses me again.</p><p>\u201cStop doing that,\u201d I tell him, glaring.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d It\u2019s all he said before he let me go and started eating.</p><p>\u201cSo, November, have you been to Nashville?\u201d his mom asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but only once. Me and my grandma went up there to go shopping for a new computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, honey. I mean real shopping?\u201d she says and I start laughing.</p><p>\u201cMy grandma\u2019s not a big shopper. We only went to one store but before we left, she made me call to make sure that the stuff I needed was there and then had me put it on hold so all we had to do was walk in and pick it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like her.\u201d She laughs. \u201cMe and you need to do a girl\u2019s day. We\u2019ll leave early and hit the shops then go get a mani pedi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I breathe. I went all the time with my best friend, Tia, to get mani pedis. I would always get jealous of the girls who were there with their moms. I always wanted to do that.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d she says, touching my face. \u201cHow about Sunday?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d She is smiling again. \u201cI never had a daughter. I kept trying for a girl and ended up with four boys. After that, I gave up. So this is going to be a lot of fun.\u201d I had a mom, but my mom never asked me to go shopping with her let alone go shopping and get our nails done. Suddenly, tears start to sting my nose and she pulls me in for a hug. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, hugging her back. We finish breakfast then I let Beast outside as Asher walks his mom to her car. When he comes back in, he just looks at me and says, \u201cGotta make a call.\u201d</p><p>I go to his bathroom to get ready. I put on black leggings and an oversized off-the-shoulder sweatshirt in a soft peach color. It matches my ballet flats perfectly. Then I braid my hair to the side and it falls over my breast. I put on some blush, mascara, and lip gloss then I finish with peach body spray.</p><p>I shove everything back into my bag and carry it with me to the living room. When I got there, Asher isn\u2019t there, or in the kitchen, so I look out the sliding glass door. He is standing in the yard in a pair of worn out blue jeans, his light brown work boots, and a dark gray thermal that fits like a second skin. Just looking at him makes my mouth go dry. I watch as Beast comes running at him with a stick in his mouth. Asher wrestles it away from him and throws it as Beast takes off. He looks so beautiful, playing with my dog. Then I remember what he said earlier. If I\u2019m not mistaken, he is kind of my boyfriend. With that thought, I want to do some kind of acrobatics...or maybe a cheer. He kissed me and introduced me to his mom. Well, technically she just showed up, but that had to count, right?</p><p>Plus, he said this wasn\u2019t casual even though deep down, I don\u2019t completely trust what he was saying. But, I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m going to give him the benefit of the doubt until he proves that he doesn\u2019t deserve it. He must feel me watching him because he turns around and smiles at me and my breath is stuck in my lungs. He calls Beast and they both come up the stairs at the same time and walk into the house. Without stopping to close the sliding door, he comes right to me, picks me up and kisses me. When he breaks away, I\u2019m in another Asher kiss fog.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asks and all I can do is nod. He slides me down his body and kisses my nose. My legs are jelly so I hold onto his T-shirt to keep me from falling on my face. He smiles like he knows what he\u2019s doing to me. I glare at him because no girl wants a guy to think that he\u2019s got it going on even if he does. \u201cOkay, babe, get your ass to the jeep.\u201d He steps away and closes the door.</p><p>I watch him move then realize that I\u2019m just standing there watching him. I\u2019m finally able to break out of the fog and grab my purse and overnight bag. I walk to the door with Beast at my side, saying over my shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to get my ass in your car. It\u2019s rude!\u201d Then, I open the door and walk out to his jeep. His laughter follows me.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>We pull up to my dad\u2019s house and he is standing outside. I start to open my door when Asher stops me.</p><p>\u201cWait till I come around and open your door.\u201d This confuses me.</p><p>\u201cWhy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always have to ask questions?\u201d I think about it for a minute then realize that I do always have to ask questions. Sometimes I ask questions that make no sense or questions that I know the answers to, but I still like to ask them. Asher is watching me and then he starts laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, baby. Just wait till I come around to open your door. Will you do that for me?\u201d Because he asks nicely and isn\u2019t being bossy, plus he called me baby and I\u2019m really starting to love that, I nod my head in agreement.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says then kisses me softly and runs his nose across mine. I\u2019m in such a fog that I don\u2019t even realize that he\u2019s gotten out of the car until my door opens and he\u2019s holding a hand out to me. His jeep is one of the cool ones with giant tires that were made for taking into the hills to go mudding. I wondered if he ever does that.</p><p>\u201cDo you go mudding?\u201d I ask, looking up at him and, not for the first time, realizing how tall he is compared to me. I come up to the middle of his chest and my head has to go way back to make eye contact. The good thing is I never have to worry that my heels will be too high. My ex never liked me wearing heels because he didn\u2019t want me to be taller than him.</p><p>\u201cMudding?\u201d he asks, bringing me back to topic.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, where you drive a truck through mud and... I don\u2019t know what else you do when you go mudding.\u201d He starts laughing again and I have no idea what is so funny so I just wait till he gets control of himself.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gone mudding since I was seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say with disappointment. I kinda wanted to go. Not that I knew much about it, but I saw a video once and it looked like fun.</p><p>\u201cIf you want, we can take my four wheeler out and drive through some puddles during the next storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask. That sounds like fun.</p><p>\u201cThis is why you\u2019re too much. Not too many women go from talking about getting manicures and shopping to wanting to get muddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm versatile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He kisses me then and just when it starts getting good, my dad yells at me.</p><p>\u201cNovember!\u201d Crap, I forgot where we are. I put my face in Asher\u2019s chest and giggle. My dad is mad. I\u2019ve never made my dad mad before.</p><p>\u201cNovember,\u201d my dad calls again.</p><p>\u201cOh, lord,\u201d I say, looking up at Asher. He is smiling down at me. I turn my head and my dad and Uncle Joe are standing on the porch. Both of them have their arms crossed and feet planted apart. I don\u2019t think this is going to go well. Asher grabs my hand and starts walking. I am dragging my feet behind him, trying to avoid the confrontation that is coming. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Daddy. Hi, Uncle Joe,\u201d I say in my sweetest voice. My dad knows my game because he\u2019s glaring at me and Uncle Joe is shaking his head but his lips are twitching. Then I hear Asher chuckle and both Uncle Joe and my dad look at him like he has a death sentence.</p><p>\u201cOh, geez,\u201d I say, leaning my head back in exasperation. \u201cI'm going to be twenty-five soon so I'm way past the stage of my dad trying to run men off.\u201d I pin my dad with a glare of my own.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never too old for me to look out for you and to make sure that every guy knows that if he tries to screw you over, I will shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, looking up at Asher. \u201cIf you screw me over, my dad will shoot you.\u201d Asher looks down at me and I can see that he wants to smile but he\u2019s fighting it.</p> <p>\u201cGo inside and pack, baby,\u201d he says, running his knuckles down my jaw. I glare at him.</p><p>\u201cI'm not staying with you.\u201d Geez, what is so hard to understand? We had one semi date. It\u2019s way too soon to start nightly sleepovers.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he says in a tone that I'm sure would work on someone but that someone is not me.</p><p>\u201cI'm not,\u201d I say, my voice getting louder. I look at my dad for support but I see that he is now fighting a smile. Then, I look to Uncle Joe and he\u2019s straight out smiling. What the heck?</p><p>\u201cBaby girl,\u201d my dad calls and I look at him. \u201cI think it would be best if you stayed somewhere at night until I can get a security system put in. But I agree that maybe Asher isn\u2019t the best bet. What if you went to stay with your uncle tonight?\u201d Now I know I'm going to end up at Asher\u2019s. My uncle is a hardcore biker and always has some biker babe staying at his place. Me and my grandma stopped by his house one day and there were two random women, both basically naked, wandering around his house.</p> <p>Besides, he doesn\u2019t really have room for me. His sons are both older so he turned one of their rooms into a work out space and the other room into an office. He has a couch but I would rather not sleep on it knowing that some woman could come out of his room at any point.</p><p>Uncle Joe was married for eighteen years. From the time he found out that the woman was pregnant till his boys graduated high school. I never met the lady but from the stories I was told, she was a major bitch to him and his sons.</p><p>At the time, he felt he was doing the right thing by keeping his family together. But as soon as my cousins went to college, he no longer felt the need to pretend who he was. I guess under the suits that he used to wear to work he was secretly a bad ass biker.</p><p>\u201cI'm staying with Asher. No offense, Uncle Joe,\u201d I say, looking at him with a smile and hoping he won\u2019t be mad. He smiles back at me and I know he doesn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your grandmother?\u201d my dad asks.</p><p>\u201cI would stay with her but I'm afraid I might die from allergies.\u201d My dad looks like he is trying to come up with somewhere\u2014anywhere\u2014for me to stay. The moon, a convent, prison, perhaps? I don\u2019t think he cares as long as Asher is not there.</p> <p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Asher says getting my attention. \u201cI need to talk with your dad and uncle for a minute but I\u2019ll be in to say goodbye before I leave,\u201d he says, looking down at me and then his eyes go to my dad.</p><p>\u201cAlrighty, then,\u201d I say. I look at my dad and give him the look that says be nice. Then I start to walk away but I'm pulled back by my sweatshirt. I look over my shoulder at Asher and see he\u2019s holding on to me.</p><p>\u201cYou forget something?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cUgh...no,\u201d I say, turning around to look at him and wondering what I could have forgotten.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he says, with a completely serious expression. I can\u2019t believe he just said that in front of my dad.</p><p>\u201cI'm not kissing you in front of my dad and uncle,\u201d I hiss at him and he has the nerve to smile.</p><p>\u201cYou kiss me or I\u2019ll kiss you. Make up your mind, and make it quick. I need to talk to your dad then I\u2019ve got shit to do.\u201d I cross my arms over my chest and glare at him. He cannot be serious.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to kiss you in fro\u2014\u201d I'm cut off when Asher pulls me to him and kisses me. It\u2019s closed mouthed and ends before it really starts, but I'm speechless that he just did that in front of my dad. I try to pull myself together but I'm completely stunned by what just happened. Then, I hear my dad laughing and I look at him just to make sure I'm not imagining things.</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be getting your gun or something?\u201d I say, looking at my dad while throwing my hand out in Asher\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cNow I see what James was talking about when he called me this morning.\u201d My dad recrosses his arms over his chest and leans back on the heels of his boots.</p><p>\u201cGreat! Just frickin\u2019 great,\u201d I mutter to the ground, rubbing my temples. I look up and glare at Asher. \u201cSeriously, stop kissing me in front of our parents,\u201d I say, pointing at him. Then I turn around and stomp all the way up the stairs and into the house. I slam the door for good measure before I realize that I left Beast outside. I open the door and call Beast but all three heads turn to watch me. I glare at all of them then slam the door again.</p><p>This time, I can hear laughter from the other side. \u201cWhatever,\u201d I mumble as I make my way down to my apartment.</p><p>Sitting on Asher\u2019s back deck with my kindle in my hand, my feet up on the railing, my head tilted back and enjoying the sun on my face, is practically paradise. I can hear Beast running back and forth in the yard, chasing something. I let my mind wander to thoughts about my day.</p><p>After my tantrum, I went down to my apartment and looked around. It was obvious that my uncle and Dad had been busy. The red was gone and there were three full garbage bags. I walked around to see if anything was missing but couldn\u2019t find anything out of place. The chair and couch were now garbage because the cushions had been slashed. I walked into my bedroom to make sure that everything was in its place and it looked perfect. There were even yellow roses sitting on my side table. I walked to them and noticed the card.</p><p>You deserve beauty. Why are you forcing me to become ugly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d I whispered. These were from the person who broke into my apartment. My hand started to shake and I wanted to cry. I knew that my family had worked hard to make that space special for me and now I didn\u2019t even want to be down there. I sat on the ripped couch and had my face in my hands, thinking about how I was going to fix this. I smelled Asher and he pulled my hands away from my face. He was crouched in front of me and looked worried.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I asked, thinking that he and my dad got into it.</p><p>\u201cI think I should ask you that,\u201d he said pulling me up then sitting on the couch with me in his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhoever did this left me flowers.\u201d I felt Asher freeze underneath me as I handed him the card.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow am I going to fix this?\u201d I asked. \u201cEveryone worked so hard for me to feel welcome and now this is happening and I don\u2019t even know why.\u201d He started rubbing my back so I cuddled into his chest with my head under his chin.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to give this to my dad. The rest is just stuff, baby. Your family is just glad that nothing happened to you.\u201d He ran his fingers along my jaw then kissed the top of my head and I can\u2019t help but to sigh. I wanted to close everything off and pretend that this wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>\u201cI'm glad that I wasn\u2019t here when it happened,\u201d I said, cuddling closer.</p><p>\u201cNovember,\u201d my dad called from the top of the stairs. \u201cNick Stevenson is on the phone. He says he needs to talk to you.\u201d I felt Asher\u2019s body go tight under me again. I lifted my head to look at him and he was pissed.</p><p>\u201cNick who?\u201d I called up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNick Stevenson. His dad is a lawyer in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Asher clipped then he stood, taking me with him. He dragged me up to the kitchen where my dad left the phone on the counter. I watched in horror as Asher answered the phone. Well, if you understand caveman talk, he answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cI know that I made myself clear yesterday so why the fuck are you calling?\u201d Asher growled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Asher. Give me the phone,\u201d I yelled as I reached around him, trying to grab the phone from his hand but he\u2019s so damn tall that it was useless.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Asher said, handing me the phone. I wanted to kick him but he wrapped his arms around me, holding me close. I was counting in my head, trying to keep calm and it wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>\u201cNick, I'm sorry,\u201d I said, apologizing for Asher\u2019s rudeness while shoving Asher but he didn\u2019t even move.</p><p>\u201dUm, it\u2019s okay, November. I'm calling to set up a time for you to meet with my father. He represented John and Ellen Armsted before they passed away and he needs to go over a few things with you regarding their will. Can you come into the office on Monday at around eleven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Nick, but I have no idea who John or Ellen are.\u201d I was completely confused. Armsted is my last name but John or Ellen didn\u2019t ring any bells.</p><p>\u201cJohn and Ellen Armsted were your grandparents on your mother\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... Why do I need to see your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems that your grandparents had you in their will before they passed away and my father needs to meet with you to talk about it. I don\u2019t know what it says but if you can meet here on Monday, he will discuss it with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...sure. Monday at eleven,\u201d I said into the phone.</p><p>\u201cOkay, November, see you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, see you then,\u201d I said, confused about the conversation. I heard the phone cut off and felt Asher\u2019s arms give me a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I remembered what he did and I'm pissed at him. I turned in his arms and stood on my tiptoes so I could get in his face.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that you answered the phone and worse, you were rude to Nick. He didn\u2019t do anything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, he wants in your pants.\u201d I can feel my head getting ready to explode and I know that my eyes are bugging out.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does and that shit\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you\u2019re insane. He just introduced himself to me at a bar. He noticed that I was new. That\u2019s all it was. Then he calls to tell me that I need to meet with his dad because my grandparents put me in their will and you go all caveman on him for no reason.\u201d I push at his chest.</p><p>\u201cAm I a man?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I snapped, not knowing why the heck he asked that stupid question.</p><p>\u201cThen I think I know what the fuck I'm talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I said with clenched teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to argue with you. I have stuff to do and you need to go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be pissed, babe. It\u2019s done. Now he knows that I was serious yesterday. Hopefully he spreads that shit wide so I don\u2019t have to deal with anyone else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do realize that it\u2019s 2013, right?\u201d I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you mine?\u201d He nuzzled my neck then I felt his tongue and I forgot that I was mad and that he was rude and that, once again, he embarrassed me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, even though I was questioning my sanity. I just can\u2019t help it when his mouth is on my neck. Then, without warning, he picked me up. I squealed and my legs automatically went around his waist so that I wouldn\u2019t fly back. My hand goes to his shoulder, the other to his hair, feeling it prickle under my palm. One of his hands is at my ass, the other goes up my back and into my hair. Then he tugged my hair to tilt my head while his went the other way. The kiss was hot and wild. He started walking and I felt the wall at my back and his heat hit my center. As I moaned into his mouth, he was grinding into me. He pulled his mouth away and set his forehead to mine.</p><p>\u201cI fucking love your mouth, baby,\u201d he said against my lips.</p> <p>\u201cI kind of like yours too,\u201d I told him and laughed when he growled at me, grinding his hips into mine, making me whimper even more.</p><p>\u201cWell, good thing I\u2019ve got all night to make you love it.\u201d Oh, crap. With everything that has happened, I forgot that I'm going to be sleeping at his house again.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about tonight,\u201d I blurted out then bite my bottom lip. I mean, I'm okay with making out but sex...I wasn\u2019t sure about that.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said, grabbing my face while holding me up by his waist and the wall. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do anything. We can go slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered, feeling the tension leave my body.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he whispered back then kissed me softly on my lips then my nose. My hands went to his shoulders and his to my ass then he slid me down and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at my house. The key will be on your car key ring and I\u2019ll bring pizza back for dinner.\u201d He kissed me quickly and was gone before I could get out of my Asher fog and remember that he\u2019s a caveman and I should really question why the heck that turns me on.</p><p>The rest of my day was quiet. I packed a bag with enough stuff for a couple days. Me and my dad hung around and I told him about the lawyer. He offered to take me if I wanted him to. I asked him how he felt about me and Asher and he said that he trusted him. It made me feel better that my dad approved. I was just going to have to try and take things slowly.</p><p>I spent the rest of time begging him to teach me how to ride a motorcycle. Once he agreed, he had to go to bed so I decided to go into town. I wanted to look around at some of the antique shops to see if they had anything interesting.</p><p>I found a small side table that had a large round top with three legs that curved up and in. I couldn\u2019t wait to get the old white paint off it and to see what kind of wood was underneath.</p><p>After I stowed the table in my car, I wandered into a small boutique on the square in the center of town. The window display is what caught my eye. They had a cool metal mannequin that would look perfect in my dream closet. When I walked in the store, there was an older lady behind the counter talking on the phone.</p><p>As soon as she saw me come in, she gave me a smile and a wave then went back to her conversation. Looking around, they had large and small mannequin stands. They also had all kinds of cool handbags, scarves, socks, jewelry and other odds and ends that women don\u2019t really need but want anyways. I was in the back of the store looking at a mannequin stand. It was a metal frame painted pink with no head or arms. It was just the torso in the shape of a dress with a long pole out the bottom and three legs like a Christmas tree stand. I loved it. I could picture it in my dream closet or even just the corner of my bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cCan I help you,\u201d I heard a small voice ask. I turned my head and a woman my age was standing next to me. She was about my height. Her long, blonde hair was pulled away from her face with a clip and she was very pretty, even with faceless makeup. She had on a pair of dark jeans and a green wrap shirt and cowboy boots.</p><p>\u201cYeah, how much for this stand?\u201d I asked her, smiling.</p><p>\u201cThis is one hundred and twenty five,\u201d she mumbled like she didn\u2019t want to actually talk to me but was forced to because of her job.</p><p>\u201cReally? Wow, I love it. Don\u2019t you love it?\u201d Her head flew up and she looked me in the eye for the first time. They were light green with a ring of dark green. She had the most beautiful eyes I had ever seen besides Asher\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s nice,\u201d she said so quietly that I almost didn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>\u201cI'm November,\u201d I said, sticking out my hand. She hesitantly shook it.</p><p>She looked a little surprised before she answered. \u201cI'm Liz, are you Mike\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You know my dad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe and my dad were best friends,\u201d she says quietly. I see the look of sadness cross her face and I realize that she said were and not are.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to meet you, Liz. This is an amazing store. I can see where my pay checks will be going,\u201d I say, trying to change the subject and hating that she looks so lost. She laughed and the sadness was replaced with pride and her whole face became stunning.</p><p>\u201cMe and my mom own it. We just opened a few weeks ago. I grew up around here so if you ever want me to show you around, let me know,\u201d she said. Then she froze when we heard laughing from behind us. Two women were there. One I recognized from the bar.</p><p>\u201cOh, how cute. Liz is trying to make a friend,\u201d the taller of the two girls said.</p><p>\u201cSome people never grow up,\u201d I mumbled under my breath, shaking my head. Having dealt with my mother, who was just like these women, I did what I always did. I ignored them. \u201cI don\u2019t know many people in town. We should get together and have coffee sometime.\u201d</p><p>She looked a little surprised but recovered quickly. For some reason, I was proud of her. I got the feeling that she usually let what people say get to her.</p><p>\u201cUm...sure. That would be nice. I\u2019ll give you my phone number when you finish shopping,\u201d she said, turning and going through a curtain into the back room of the store. I looked around for a few more minutes and the girls were still in the store. I heard them whispering and could make out Asher\u2019s name a few times but I couldn\u2019t be bothered with them so I went to check out. I found a very pretty scarf that had a bold paisley print in lots of bright colors and I also found a pair of wide silver hoops with a cool design etched into them. I set my stuff on the counter and the woman looked up to me.</p><p>\u201cDid you find everything okay, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and I would also like to buy that stand in the back. The pink one,\u201d I told her with a smile, thinking about my new treasures.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll have Liz pull it out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She gave me my total and when Liz came back out, we exchanged numbers. I told her that I would call. I went to my dad\u2019s and dropped off my new stuff and packed up Beast. I quickly left my dad a note telling him to call me later and drove to Asher\u2019s.</p><p>Now I am enjoying the sun that is slowly setting. There is a slight chill in the air but I put on my knit hat and giant wool sweater so I feel nice and toasty. My hair slides across my neck and then lips kiss the sensitive skin under my ear. I open my eyes to see Asher smiling down at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. I\u2019ve been looking for you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I stretch, sitting up and looking around. \u201cI guess I fell asleep,\u201d I say quietly, realizing that I'm still sitting outside but it\u2019s dusk and really cold.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got worried when I couldn\u2019t find you in the house. Where is your phone? Your dad and I tried calling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, crap. I think it\u2019s still in my bag. I wasn\u2019t planning on being out here so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you inside,\u201d he says, picking me up. My arms go around his shoulders and I lay my head on his chest. His body is so warm and he smells so good.</p><p>\u201cI can walk,\u201d I mumble into his chest.</p><p>\u201cI like carrying you. You\u2019re so tiny,\u201d he says and I feel him kiss my forehead.</p><p>\u201cHa! Only to you cause you\u2019re a giant.\u201d He laughs and I can feel it rumble against my cheek as he carries me into the living room and sits with me in his lap. I curl into him for a few minutes just absorbing his warmth and the feel of his steady breathing. It should feel awkward to be with him like this but it feels completely normal. How creepy is that?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want on the pizza, baby?\u201d he asks, rubbing my back. I feel like I could fall back asleep.</p><p>\u201cUm, mushrooms, peppers, olives, and pepperoni, unless you want something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, sounds good.\u201d I feel him lift his hips and his hand leaves my back. I can hear the beeping of his phone before he places our order. After disconnect the call, I hear the phone hit the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good day?\u201d I ask into his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo. The fire inspector wanted to close the site and Cash had to go to the hospital to get stitches.\u201d The minute that the words are out of his mouth, I'm up, trying to pull out of his arms.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! What are you doing? You should be with him. Is he okay? Who\u2019s taking care of him?\u201d I yell, trying hard to pull away.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Mom\u2019s with him. He just cut his hand. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many stitches did he need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust three. Why are you so worried?\u201d he asks, narrowing his eyes. Suddenly, he looks angry.</p><p>\u201cHe was hurt and he\u2019s your brother,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cWhat do you mean, why am I worried?\u201d I ask, confused. He doesn\u2019t say anything. He just stares at me then I realize why he\u2019s asking that question and I want to kick him. \u201cSeriously? Your own brother?\u201d I ask him, shaking my head in disbelief and again trying to pull away.</p><p>\u201cLet me up,\u201d I say but his arms only tighten. \u201cI'm serious, Asher. Let me up right now. I cannot believe that you would even think that I would be sitting here with you if I was even a little interested in your brother. I mean, obviously we don\u2019t know each other very well but if you want to get to know me, you\u2019re going to have to trust me. Otherwise, don\u2019t waste my time.\u201d I pull away and am finally able to stand. I leave him sitting on the couch and go into the bathroom and hop up on the counter, wondering what the hell is wrong with him. First Nick, now his brother. I want to scream at the top of my lungs. The door opens and I look up. He\u2019s just standing there, looking at me, not saying anything. I'm starting to feel like I shouldn\u2019t be here anymore and should risk respiratory failure and stay with my grandma.</p><p>\u201cI think I should go stay with my grandma,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>He still doesn\u2019t say anything and I start to squirm on the counter under his stare. Then I see him take a deep breath and he lunges at me and his mouth crashes into mine. His hands go to my ass, pulling me to the edge of the counter.</p><p>I'm caught off guard but my body takes over and my hand goes to his back. My other hand digs into his hair as he bites my bottom lip, then lightly bites my chin and then comes back to my mouth where he devours me. His tongue is in my mouth and playing with mine, nipping and biting my lips. I feel one of his hands leave my ass and travel around and up the front of my shirt, cupping my breast through my bra. I whimper into his mouth and try to press closer, knowing my panties are soaked. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so turned on in my life. Then pulls away, kissing me softer and setting his forehead to mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d he rumbles and I feel the vibrations of his words straight between my legs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere,\u201d I tell him truthfully, knowing that I should leave because this situation has heartache written all over it.</p><p>He presses his forehead to mine and takes a breath. \u201cAlmost every woman that I\u2019ve fucked has also fucked one or more of my brothers,\u201d he says quietly. I can feel bile crawling up my throat and a horrible pain hit my chest at his words. He was actually opening up to me but I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to know this.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but I feel like I need to share something about me to make us even, to make him understand that he isn\u2019t the only one with baggage.</p> <p>\u201cI was engaged and found out that my mother had been sleeping with my fianc\u00e9 during the whole time we were together,\u201d I blurt and immediately wonder why the hell I said it like that. Why I couldn\u2019t just keep my damn mouth shut. \u201cI'm sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have told you like that. It\u2019s just...I know how you feel. Well, not that I have sisters that have had sex with the same guys as me but if I did, I would tell them that it\u2019s really gross. Who does that?\u201d</p><p>I feel his body start shaking and I wonder what the hell could be funny about this conversation. \u201cAre you laughing?\u201d I feel his body still and he takes his face out of my neck and holds it in his hands, running his nose along mine.</p><p>\u201cI'm not letting you go, November.\u201d His eyebrows pull together and I can see something working behind his eyes. It looks like hope but I don\u2019t know him well enough to be sure.</p><p>\u201cJust try and trust me, okay,\u201d I say, watching my finger travel across his bottom lip. He places his forehead against mine again and doesn\u2019t say anything for a long time. What is he thinking?</p><p>\u201cI'm gonna try,\u201d he says softly, taking a deep breath.</p> <p>\u201cI'm going to try too, you know?\u201d I say, trying to lighten the mood. \u201cI feel like I have a lot of competition to deal with. All those women constantly throwing themselves at you.\u201d He opens his eyes and looks at me seriously.</p><p>\u201cI promise that it\u2019s you, only you, for as long as this lasts. Now, we need to pick up the pizza so get your ass in the jeep.\u201d And just like that, the conversation\u2019s over and he\u2019s pulling me off the sink and onto my feet. He kisses my nose and walks out of the bathroom, leaving me there with his words replaying in my head.</p><p>It\u2019s you, only you.</p><p>I smile to myself in the mirror and walk out to the living room. I grab my bag then get my ass in his jeep.</p><p>I wake up wrapped around Asher. My thigh is over his, my arm is across his waist and his arm is holding me close. Last night, after we got the pizza, we came back to his house, put in a movie and lounged on the couch while we ate. Then he moved the pizza box, got us both another beer, and stretched out with his bare feet up on the coffee table and dragging me by the hand until I was pressed into his side with my leg wrapped over his thigh and my arm around his waist, holding my beer and my head on his chest. After the movie, we got up and Asher pushed me toward the bedroom, telling me to get ready for bed and that he would let Beast out.</p><p>I did my normal nightly routine, brushed my teeth, moisturized, took my hair down and brushed it out. I dug out my pajamas. This time it was a night gown with slim straps and a built-in bra. The cotton material gathered under the breast and went to above the knee. It was cute and not too sexy for sleeping with a new boyfriend. Well, I thought so anyways until Asher walked in. \u201cJesus,\u201d he mumbled and I watched in fascination as his eyes got dark.</p> <p>Without saying anything else, or touching me at all, he pulled out something from his dresser then went into the bathroom and closed the door. As soon as the door closed behind him, I ran to the bed and jumped in, pulling the blankets up around my waist. Then I reached over to turn on the lamp. When he came back out, he was shirtless and wearing a pair of flannel pajama pants that looked hot on him. They hung low, showing the v of his hips and I could I feel my mouth water just watching him.</p><p>He turned off the bedroom light then walked to the opposite side of the bed and got in. I sat there for a second then leaned over and turned off the light next to me. I lay down and pulled the covers up over my shoulder. The next thing I knew, I was being pulled across the bed, my back to Asher\u2019s front, his arm around my waist and his legs bent into mine. He moved my hair off my shoulder gently.</p><p>\u201cNight, baby,\u201d he whispered then kissed me where my neck and shoulder met.</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d I whispered, cuddling closer and listening to his breathing even out. I felt his body relax a few minutes later and I quickly followed him to sleep.</p><p>I place my nose against his ribs and take a deep breath, absorbing his smell. It\u2019s earthy and spicy and all Asher. I feel his hand flex on my hip where he\u2019s holding me and I scoot closer. Suddenly, I'm on my back, looking up at his face. Rumpled with sleep, he\u2019s still beautiful.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d His voice is scratchy and rough and does serious stuff to my insides. His eyes are warm as he leans down and kisses me softly. Moving his face away, he holds my face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d I breathe deeply, looking up at him and wondering what he\u2019s thinking. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like waking up to you.\u201d I don\u2019t say anything back but I can feel my face get soft. I like waking up to him too. \u201cSo what do you want to do today?\u201d he asks as he nuzzles my neck. I wrap my leg around his hip and my arm on his back, feeling the hardness of his muscles and the smoothness of his skin.</p> <p>\u201cWill you take me out on your four wheeler?\u201d I ask. He lifts his head and smiles down at me.</p><p>\u201cHow about we load \u2019em up. Mom and Dad have two hundred acres and a few ponds on their property. I\u2019ll call the guys and see if they want to go four wheeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, yes!\u201d I scream excitedly then I roll him over, straddling his hips. I bend down and kiss him quickly then go to jump off him and the bed but I'm held down by his hands at my hips. I look at his face and see his eyes are dark and hooded. I know I'm in trouble when his hands slide from my hips, down my thighs, and up under my nightgown.</p><p>I feel the length of him pressed to my core and become instantly wet as his hands travel over my ribs. His thumbs move over the sensitive skin under my breast and my breathing becomes erratic. My nipples go instantly hard. He sits up and kisses me as one of his hands moves to my ass and the other grabs my hair, tilting my head. He tastes so good that my hands go to his head, holding him close. He bends me back so I'm under him. My legs go around his waist and he kisses me deeply then sits back, looking down at me.</p><p>We are both breathing heavily and I want his mouth back. I whimper as I feel his fingers at my hip, running up my thigh. He\u2019s watching it travel over my skin. When his eyes lock with mine, he bends his head and takes my mouth again. His tongue is against mine then on my neck, licking and biting. His hand travels up my side to my breast and I feel the air against my nipple just before his mouth is on me, sucking hard. My back bows off the bed and I hold his head against me, trying to pull him closer. I\u2019m shocked when I feel like I might orgasm just from this. I moan and he growls, releasing my breast then attacking my other nipple while his fingers roll and pull the one he just left. My hips lift into his and the friction hits me just right. I shatter into a million pieces, moaning his name as my legs tighten around him. My fingers are gripping his head while I come back slowly.</p><p>Opening my eyes, I see that he\u2019s looking down at me. \u201cFucking beautiful,\u201d he says, kissing me again. This time it\u2019s much harder. I kiss him back while my hand goes to his stomach. I can feel his muscles tense under my fingers and I drag my nails along his skin. Then my nightgown is gone, over my head, and Asher\u2019s body is covering mine. His chest is against mine, his mouth is devouring mine and I roll him over and straddle his hips. His hips rise up as mine go down and I moan. My head flies back and then his mouth is on my nipple. He rolls me back over and his fingers go inside my panties and press in. \u201cFucking soaked.\u201d He growls and that just makes me wetter. \u201cJesus, I can\u2019t wait to taste you.\u201d His fingers swirl over my clit and I grab onto his bicep, my head flying back for another swirl. His fingers fill me so perfectly that my hips lift off the bed. I pull his head down to mine and kiss him deeply. \u201cPlease,\u201d I begged. I needed more.</p><p>\u201cI'm not letting you come again until I can taste you doing it, baby.\u201d I have a mini orgasm from his words and he starts sliding my panties down my legs.</p><p>\u201cYo! Get your lazy ass out of bed.\u201d My head jerks up. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d the person says then I hear barking and growling coming from Beast.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Asher growls then the alarm starts going off. \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he mutters, rolls off the bed and I sit up, trying to find my nightgown. He puts an arm on each side on my waist then kisses me like my dog is not about to kill someone and the alarm is not going off. It\u2019s wet and deep and I'm breathing heavily when he pulls away. \u201cCome to the kitchen, baby,\u201d he says, putting a shirt on and walking out of the room. The alarm stops and I jump off the bed, pull my nightgown down over my head, then run to the bathroom to do my business.</p><p>I brush my teeth, dig through my bag to find a hoodie and put it on over my nightgown then go to the kitchen. Asher is standing near the coffee pot and there is a guy sitting at the island. He\u2019s slim but you can tell that he\u2019s also muscular. His dark brown hair is messy and his face is model perfect with long lashes, dark eyes, and full lips.</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me strangely then his eyes drop to my legs. I feel so uncomfortable that I know I'm not going to be able to stand in the same room as him wearing what I have on so I turn and run back to the bedroom. I find my sweats and tank and put them on quickly. When I go back out, the guy is smirking at me but Asher\u2019s just smiling. \u201cCome here, baby,\u201d he says quietly, lifting his arm as I walk to him and my face goes into his chest. I feel his lips at my hairline. \u201dNovember, this is Sven. Sven, November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. Nice to meet you,\u201d I say and he\u2019s looking between Asher and me. I can tell that he is guarded and that\u2019s okay. I feel the same.</p><p>\u201cYou too, November.\u201d I smile at him then look around for Beast. I hear his paw on the door so I leave Asher\u2019s side and slide the door open.</p><p>Once again, I'm trampled by my dog. I fall on my butt and he\u2019s licking me and standing over me. I try to push him off but he\u2019s too excited and I'm laughing so hard that tears start to fall from my eyes. Then Beast is pushed away and Asher\u2019s there smiling down at me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, we need to get you a smaller dog,\u201d he says, picking me up off the floor.</p><p>\u201cHe just gets a little excited.\u201d I laugh and Asher runs his nose along mine.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he whispers then kisses me softly and puts me back under his arm. He walks me back around the island into the kitchen and I'm in such a fog that I forget for a second that someone else is here with us.</p><p>I look up at Asher and smile big, biting my lip and realizing that I could fall in love with him. I look at Sven and he smiles and winks like he\u2019s reading my mind. I smile back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Asher asks, giving me a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYes, please. Can I, um, make breakfast?\u201d I ask, unsure if that might cross a line.</p><p>\u201cIf you want.\u201d He shrugs his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say and go about getting everything ready for French toast. Once it\u2019s done, I slide some on a plate of Sven, Asher and myself. I find syrup and butter and put them out on the counter in front of the guys then grab the coffee pot and fill their cups. Everything has gone silent so I look up and both of them are staring at me like I'm crazy. \u201cUm...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou gonna eat, baby?\u201d I nod my head. \u201cCome here, November.\u201d I walk towards him even though I want to run and hide in the bathroom. Once I'm in front of him, he pulls me onto his lap and pulls my plate toward us so mine and his are next to each other then he hands me my fork.</p><p>\u201cI can sit on the other stool,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>I feel his lips under my ear. \u201cI want you close.\u201d He kisses my neck and goes about eating and talking to Sven. \u201cI'm taking November to Mom and Dad\u2019s to go four wheeling. I'll call the boys and see if they want to meet there. You wanna go?\u201d he asks Sven. Sven just looks at me.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go four wheeling?\u201d Sven asks with a look of shock written all over his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cYes! I'm so excited.\u201d I squeal and clap, which makes him and Asher chuckle. \u201cHey, can I invite Liz?\u201d I turn, looking over my shoulder at Asher.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Liz?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI met her yesterday. She owns a store on the square with her mom. She\u2019s really sweet. Some of your harem were there giving her a hard time.\u201d I roll my eyes and I hear Sven chuckle.</p><p>\u201cHarem?\u201d Asher questions with his eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cThe girls from the bar that were all gathered around the pool table waiting to be chosen like a bad episode of the bachelor,\u201d I say, giggling when Asher starts tickling my sides.</p><p>\u201cWell, I chose you so I guess you get my pool stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you seriously just say that?\u201d I ask, scrunching up my nose, laughing. I look at Sven who is also cracking up.</p> <p>\u201cCall your friend. Just have her meet us there. I\u2019ll give you the address.\u201d He smiles and kisses my neck.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I say, smiling back.</p><p>After breakfast, Asher and Sven leave to load up the four wheelers while I clean up the kitchen and jump in the shower. I\u2019m standing in Asher\u2019s bedroom, wrapped in a towel, when he walks into the room. I automatically feel like prey to a very large, very hungry predator.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I feel like I'm living a fucking nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whisper, feeling uncomfortable all of the sudden, wondering if I read his expression wrong.</p><p>\u201cHaving you wrapped around me all night, feeling you coming around my fingers, now wrapped in a towel and knowing what\u2019s under that shit and not being able to do a damn thing about it is my worst fucking nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God, my nipples go hard and my breath hitches at his words. I want him to do something about it and I am debating running across the room. When he lunges before I can make a move, I am in his arms with his mouth on mine. I go into an instant Asher fog. He breaks away, shoving his face in my neck.</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d he growls, biting my neck then letting me go. He goes straight into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. I can hear the shower turn on. I run to my bag and pull out jeans, a plain red T-shirt and a red lace bra and matching lace cheeky panties. I dress fast and am braiding my hair when Asher comes out with a towel wrapped around his waist and water dripping down the contours of his body. I am completely lost and know what he was talking about when he said he was living a nightmare. Part of me wants nothing more than to throw myself at him but the other part of me is afraid that once we have sex, he will get bored and lose interest.</p> <p>\u201cI'm gonna get dressed, baby, so unless you want to watch, you should go wait in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the kitchen,\u201d I squeak then walk quickly out of the room.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>I was lying on the ground, laughing so hard that I thought I might pee myself after calling Liz and asking her to come four wheeling. She was working at her shop and couldn\u2019t make it so we made plans to meet up Monday after my meeting with the lawyer.</p><p>Asher drove us out to his parents\u2019 house. Everyone was standing outside a huge, steel building when we arrived. They were gassing up the four wheelers and bikes.</p><p>I\u2019ve never ridden before so Asher showed me what to do. I really only heard half of what he said because my excitement was taking over. We took off on the trails around his parents\u2019 place and rode for a couple hours.</p><p>Eventually, the guys started racing so Sven said he would teach me how to ride his dirt bike while Asher was racing his dad. I was practicing my balance when Asher came around the corner and saw me on the dirt bike. I watched Asher walk over and shove Sven then he slung his hand out in my direction. I could see his mouth moving but I had a helmet on so I couldn\u2019t hear what was being said.</p><p>I stopped the bike and Cash held it up while I got off. I walked towards Asher. His mom and dad were standing to the side while he yelled at his friend about how in the hell he let me get on his bike. Hearing what he was saying pissed me off. I wasn\u2019t some helpless child who needed constant supervision.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I asked, crossing my arms over my chest. I looked around and noticed everyone was watching.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you thinking?\u201d Asher glared at me. \u201cThat bike is too big for you. Do you realize you could be seriously hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I asked looking at him like he grew a third eye. I could hear the guys chuckling behind us.</p><p>\u201cDeadly fucking serious.\u201d He growled.</p><p>\u201cYou listen to me, Asher. You are not the boss of me. I'm going to learn how to ride a motorcycle and then I'm going to buy one so I can ride it whenever I want and there is not a damn thing you can do about it,\u201d I said, poking him in the chest.</p><p>\u201cFuck, no, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s teaching me on his next day off,\u201d I said, smiling sweetly.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I'm telling you right now, if you think that I'm going to let you ride, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, baby,\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cI'm telling you that I don\u2019t need your permission to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d He growled then pulled me into his chest and kissed me hard\u2014with tongue\u2014while everyone watched. When he broke the kiss, I was in such a fog that I didn\u2019t even yell at him for kissing me in front of his parents. He put his arm around my shoulder and pulled me into his side. I looked around and everyone was smiling. I was wondering what the hell just happened. We were arguing then we weren\u2019t...is that normal?</p><p>\u201cAlright, kiddos. Let\u2019s go eat,\u201d Asher\u2019s mom called loudly. I started giggling and Asher just looked down on me, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shrugged my shoulders. \u201cShe makes me feel like I'm five years old.\u201d</p><p>Asher\u2019s mom made amazing BBQ pulled pork in her crockpot then toasted giant potatoes buns and loaded them with meat. She even made sweet potatoes fries and homemade coleslaw. It was delicious.</p><p>We sat around a large fire pit, drinking and eating, then she brought out marshmallows, graham crackers and chocolate bars so we could make s\u2019mores. It was perfect.</p><p>I was tucked close to Asher with my belly full and my favorite hard apple cider in my hand. Life couldn\u2019t get any better than that. The guys started telling stories about tricks they played on each other when they were younger and other stupid things they did.</p><p>\u201cSo Asher and me used to skateboard when we were in high school,\u201d Sven said starting his story. \u201cOne time we were out riding around when Asher fell while trying to do a trick off a set of stairs near the library. Well, he missed his landing and ended up doing the splits down the stairs, hurting his groin muscle. We went back to my house so he could put some ice on it. I was in the kitchen getting ice out for him when I heard him screaming from the bathroom like a damn girl. I ran towards the bathroom to figure out what happened. I bang on the door and he didn\u2019t answer. All I could hear was moaning and crying. So, I say fuck it and walk in to a scene that, to this day, is still burned into the back of my eyelids. Your man,\u201d he said, looking at me and laughing, \u201cwas laying on the floor in the bathroom with a jar of icy/hot. He decided to put that shit on his groin, thinking that would help. He got that shit on his balls and almost passed out from the pain.\u201d</p><p>I was laughing so hard, I fell backwards off the log that we were sitting on. I hadn\u2019t had this much fun ever and I was dirtier than I had ever been in my life. I had mud in my hair, on my face and all over my clothes. I'm sure I looked like a homeless person but everyone else was just as dirty. Even Asher\u2019s mom was covered in dirt. I loved all of them and I loved Tennessee. The laid back lifestyle and the friendly people were so different from New Yorkers. I realized, lying on the ground in the dirt, that I was happy. Really, really happy for the first time in my life. Asher leaned over and helped me back up on the log. He put me back under his arm and kissed my nose, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI'm stealing your girl,\u201d Sven said deadpan.</p><p>\u201cFuck, no,\u201d Asher said, smiling at him. The guys went back to talking about the job site and things they had to get done before the next inspection. Me and Susan were talking about our trip to Nashville tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll pick you up around nine,\u201d she told me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve, Mom. No earlier,\u201d Asher said, breaking into our conversation.</p><p>\u201cNine,\u201d his mom said, looking at him, daring him to disagree.</p><p>\u201cTwelve. Tomorrow is Sunday and we\u2019re sleeping in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNi\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cSusan,\u201d Mr. James said in a warning tone to his wife then he pulled her into his lap and whispered in her ear. She melted against him then looked over at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there at twelve.\u201d I nodded my head in agreement then giggled when she laughed. Apparently, Asher took after his dad.</p><p>I crawled into Asher\u2019s lap and cuddled into him while everyone sat around talking. I must have fallen asleep because the next thing I knew, I was being put into the front seat of Asher\u2019s jeep.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be home soon, baby,\u201d he whispered and I felt his lips at my forehead. I was back asleep before he shut my door.</p><p>I felt the car come to a stop and I lifted my head from Asher\u2019s shoulder where it had fallen.</p><p>\u201cHey, sleepy head,\u201d he said, looking over at me.</p><p>\u201cThis was the best day ever,\u201d I said, smiling. I grabbed his face and kissed him hard.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said with his eyes running over my face. He kissed my nose and opened his door and let Beast out on his side. I met him in front of the jeep and we walked into the house with me leaning into his side. I didn\u2019t pull away until we were in the living room.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to shower,\u201d I told him and stumbled my way to the bathroom. I was standing in my clothes. I had already taken off my dirty shoes and socks and was waiting for the water to get hot before I undressed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turned on the shower and felt warmth hit my back and Asher\u2019s hand slide along my belly. I turned my head to ask what he was doing when I caught the look in his eyes. He used his hands to turn me by my waist, his fingers at the edge of my shirt as a shiver ran down my spine and heat flooded my center. He lifted the edge of my shirt and pulled it up over my head. His eyes were on my red lace bra and his finger traced the edge of it. I put my hands up the front of his shirt, feeling his smooth skin. He took his hands away from me and put them on the wall behind his head. Dragging his shirt up and over, his hands then came to the button of my jeans. My stomach muscles contracted at his touch. My breaths were becoming erratic from having him this close to me, touching him. Asher touching me. I prayed that no one interrupted us this time and quickly moved my hands to the front of his jeans.</p><p>Without warning, he captured my hands and pulled them away from his skin. Startled, I looked up at him. His mouth crashed into mine, his tongue swept the seam of my mouth and mine opened under his. My hands grabbed his head, holding him closer, deepening the kiss. His hands slid down my waist to my ass and he picked me up. My jeans fell to the floor and my legs circled his hips. He walked five steps to set me down on the basin of the sink. His hand went to my hair and he tugs out my hair tie. My hair fell down around me and he wrapped his fist in it, tugging my head to the side so he could kiss me harder.</p><p>My body was on fire and my panties were soaked. I tightened my legs around him, trying to get some friction to relieve the ache that he created. He growled and pulled his lower body slightly away from me. I whimpered and my head fell back against the mirror. His lips trailed down my neck, breathing heavily. My thighs started shaking as he kissed down my neck, over my collar bone, to the edge of my lace bra. Then his mouth was sucking my nipple through the lace. The friction was intense. \u201cAsher,\u201d I whimpered.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby.\u201d Then he sucked harder and I could feel his teeth scrape against my sensitive flesh. His hand traveled down my side to the edge of my panties. Near my hip, I felt his finger sliding under the edge and traveling along the inside of my thigh. He was approaching my core and I started panting. His hands and mouth felt amazing on me but I needed more.</p><p>Biting my lip, I looked down at him. It was the most erotic thing I\u2019ve ever seen. His hand pulled down the cups of my bra then his mouth latched back on. His hand went to my other nipple, pulling and rolling it between his fingers. My head trashed then his mouth was back on mine. My hands traveled down his back, around to the front of his jeans so I could get his button undone.</p><p>I used my toes to shove his jeans and boxers down his hips then I watched as he sprang free. His cock is as beautiful as he is. Long and thick, I just want to wrap my mouth around it but I'm pinned to the counter. I wrapped my hand around him and pumped once.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Asher growled and pulled away from my grasp. His mouth was trailing down my body, licking and biting. His hand went to my panties and he grabbed the material at my core and ripped them away. \u201cYou\u2019re soaked, baby. Do you want my mouth or my cock?\u201d This was such a complicated question.</p><p>I wanted both but all I could say was, \u201cPlease.\u201d Then his hot mouth was on me sucking, licking, and consuming me like he was starving. His hands went to my ass, pulling me closer. My hands went to his head, holding him to me. His fingers slid in and I shattered, screaming out his name. My body was shaking. Never have I felt that way in my life. It was one of those mind blowing, body shaking orgasms that everyone talks about. I floated slowly back to earth.</p><p>When I opened my eyes, Asher was leaning over me. \u201cPlease tell me that you\u2019re on birth control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I cried, feeling the length of him against me. Then he slammed into me. I screamed his name and his forehead dropped to my chest and he stilled his movements. I rolled my hips, trying to get him to give me what I needed.</p><p>His head came up. \u201cDon\u2019t move, baby,\u201d he whispered. I watched as he took a deep breath then he pulled out and slid back in.</p><p>My back bowed. \u201cPlease, Asher,\u201d I cried, digging my nails into his back.</p><p>\u201cHold onto me, baby.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed on to him and wrapped my legs around his waist. He carried me to the bed. Once he laid me down, he grabbed my hips and slammed into me over and over. My head went back and my eyes closed. He was hitting the perfect spot and his fingers were digging into my hips. The pain and pleasure that I was feeling was making me cry out with each thrust.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He growled. My head tipped down and he kissed me deeply. I tore my mouth away and my head flew against the mattress as I felt myself start to come. \u201cLook at me, November.\u201d He growled again and my eyes came to his.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t come until I come with you,\u201d he said, pounding into me.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to come now,\u201d I told him, feeling my insides tighten.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Hold it.\u201d Oh God, I didn\u2019t know if I could hold it. My body was on fire. I bit down on his shoulder, trying to control my orgasm.</p><p>\u201cFuck, come now,\u201d he roared and I felt him swell as my body exploded around him.</p><p>I was floating with a million colors dancing around me. My face went into his neck, my arms and legs tightened around him, holding him close. We stayed like that for a long time, just holding each other closely. Our breathing evened out and he lifted his head. I pulled my face out of his neck.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, baby?\u201d he asked, his eyes searching my face.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d I said, leaning in and kissing him softly.</p><p>\u201cFuck, your pussy is as beautiful as you are.\u201d He tightened his arms around me. \u201cAnd as sweet as your mouth.\u201d I had never had a guy go down on me before. I thought it would be uncomfortable but it was amazing. All I could do was smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s that look?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cUm, I\u2019ve never done that before. I mean, I\u2019ve done it but never had a guy do that to me.\u201d He started chuckling. His body was still surrounding me and I could still feel him inside me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d he asked. I felt embarrassed and my body went tight. I looked over his shoulder, wondering why I had no filter with him. It was like whatever was on my mind came out like word vomit.</p><p>\u201cWe should, um, turn off the shower,\u201d I told his shoulder. That wasn\u2019t a lie. There was steam rolling out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cBaby, look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying we don\u2019t want to run out of hot water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNovember, look at me.\u201d At his tone, my eyes went to his. He cupped my cheek in his big palm and kissed me softly. \u201cYou never have to be embarrassed. Trust me, I'm fucking thankful that I'm the only one who has gotten to see you like that.\u201d I felt my nose sting and I shoved my face in his neck.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered. He made me feel beautiful and special, like I had known him forever rather than just a few days.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s have a shower,\u201d he said, picking me up. My legs were still around him and I could feel him inside me. The movement caused me to moan. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get soapy and play with yourself while I watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whispered, feeling nervous and excited.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d he said, nipping my neck. He stood me up in the shower and handed me a bottle of body wash and a sponge. As directed, I got soapy and played with myself. Then, he played with me. Then, I played with him.</p><p>When we got out and dried off, he carried me to bed without bothering with clothes. He wrapped his body around mine and we fell asleep. It was definitely the best day of my life.</p><p>So maybe I'm more like my grandmother than I thought. I mean I love shopping as much as the next woman but seriously, it\u2019s almost ten at night and we\u2019re just now heading home from our girls\u2019 day out.</p><p>The day started with Asher waking me with his mouth and fingers then he had me get on top and ride him until we both collapsed back into bed breathing heavily. We made breakfast and drank coffee out on the deck while watching Beast chase wild turkeys around the yard.</p><p>Asher\u2019s mom showed up at eleven thirty when I was still in the bathroom putting on makeup. I just had to put my clothes on so I chose a pair of dark jeans and an empire waist floral tank top and a mint green cardigan over it with knee high brown boots. They have a low heel so they\u2019re comfortable for walking.</p><p>I walked into the kitchen and Asher was standing near the sink in jeans, bare feet and a black thermal long sleeve shirt that had buttons at the neck that were undone. His face was extra scruffy so he looked exceptionally sexy. I wanted to send his mom home and drag him back to bed for the day. His eyes came to me and he did a head to toe inspection and gave me a sweet smile. His eyes were warm and as I bit my lip, they dropped to my mouth and I got the dimple.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go, beautiful girl?\u201d his mom asked, making me jump. I felt heat hit my cheeks because I forgot that she was there the minute I saw Asher.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. Can we stop at my dad\u2019s so I can drop off Beast?\u201d I asked, looking at her.</p><p>\u201cBeast is going with me, baby. I'm meeting Trevor to help him with some shit at his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, now come kiss before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsher,\u201d I said in a warning tone.</p><p>\u201cBaby, get your ass over here. If I have to come to you, you\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d I feel my nipples tighten at his tone. I wasn\u2019t so sure that I didn\u2019t want to see what he would do.</p><p>\u201cYou do know that you\u2019re not the boss of me, right?\u201d I asked, crossing my arms over my chest to hide how turned on I was. He didn\u2019t miss the gesture and a smug smile slid across his face. \u201cWhatever,\u201d I muttered and grabbed my bag off the island.</p><p>Looking at Asher\u2019s mom, I asked, \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Before I could make it five steps, I was spun around and Asher\u2019s mouth was on mine. I tried to fight him but his hand twisted into the hair at the back of my head. I gasped then his tongue was in my mouth. I couldn\u2019t help but to kiss him back.</p><p>When he tears his mouth from mine, he moves his lips near my ear and whispers, \u201cYou\u2019re mine. Every inch of you belongs to me. From your sweet mouth to your even sweeter pussy and when I want it, you better give it to me.\u201d</p><p>He bites my earlobe then kisses my nose. I was in a complete Asher fog when I heard Susan call my name. I looked at her and she was smiling. I look up at Asher and he kisses my nose again. \u201cHave fun, baby.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes on him, praying for magical powers that would cause him to light on fire. This didn\u2019t happen and I rolled my eyes. Susan moved to stand in front of Asher.</p><p>\u201cHave fun, Ma, and take care of my girl,\u201d he said, bending down to kiss her cheek. He walked us to the door. His mom walked out before me so I slowed my steps and turned around.</p><p>Standing on my tiptoes, I kissed Asher and quickly ducked my head before he could get his arms around me. I ran out the door to his mom\u2019s truck. \u201cBye, honey. Have a good day,\u201d I yelled, looking over my shoulder and laughing. Asher was standing on the porch with arms crossed and feet planted apart. His dimple is out. I hopped up in the truck and shut the door. I heard Asher call Beast who ran over to him and sat at his feet. I waved as we backed out of the driveway. Asher didn\u2019t wave but I did get a chin lift so that\u2019s pretty much the same thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never thought I would have a front row seat to my eldest son falling in love,\u201d Susan said and I looked over at her dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said, looking out the window and trying to fight my smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, honey. I know so. You know, James grew up in this town. I moved here after college to work in the hospital. When I got to town, I was warned by dozens of women about James. They all said he was so good looking that he had a different woman in his bed every night. Well, I made it my mission to stay away from him. Why would I want a man who obviously wasn\u2019t faithful and never wanted to settle down? Then one night, I got a flat tire on my way home. A very handsome man pulled up and helped me get the spare on my car. I had no idea who he was until after he finished and introduced himself. When he said his name, I got out of there as fast as possible. The next day, I ran into him in town and he asked me out. I said no and he walked away. I thought that was it. But then everyday he would be somewhere that I was. He would ask me out I would say no. This went on for about two months. Then one day, I finally said yes but made him promise to never ask me out again. He agreed so we went out on one date. Next thing I knew, I was staying at his house, he put a ring on my finger, and I was planning a wedding. All of that happened in just a few months. And if you talk to his mom, she will tell you a similar story about her and James Sr. I think the Mayson men don\u2019t bother getting serious until they see someone that they can\u2019t live without.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Asher was already married,\u201d I reminded her. I liked Asher a lot but I was not going to get my hopes built on false dreams.</p> <p>\u201cHe was for about three months. I never met the girl and didn\u2019t even know she existed until a couple weeks after they were married when she answered the phone at Asher\u2019s apartment. I'm not a man but I would think that if I found a woman I was going to spend the rest of my life with, I would want my family to know about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we talk about something else?\u201d I asked, trying not to sound rude but wanting to change the topic. The thought of Asher in love with someone enough to marry her made my stomach turn.</p><p>\u201cSure, beautiful,\u201d she said, grabbing my hand and giving it a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered, squeezing her hand back.</p><p>We stopped for coffee on our way out of town then headed to Nashville for a day of shopping and manicures.</p> <p>Asher</p><p>Watching November pull away with my ma, I get that feeling in my chest, the same one I get every time November smiles at me. It\u2019s like taking a shot of whiskey. After the burn, you\u2019re left with the warmth. I wait till I can\u2019t see the truck anymore and drag my hands down my face. Beast barks, getting my attention.</p><p>\u201cCome on. We got shit to do,\u201d I tell him, walking into the house. Fuck me if I'm not starting to sound like her. She\u2019s always carrying on one sided conversations with the dog like she expects him to talk back.</p><p>I walk into the bedroom and see that she made the bed while she was in here getting ready. She left the bathroom light on so I go to turn it off. There is girly shit all over the counter. I wait to see if I feel panic, and none comes. Not that I actually expected it to. Shit, when she told me that she couldn\u2019t do casual, I had to laugh.</p><p>If I could put a ring on her finger right now, I would, but I don\u2019t think she would consider that to be slow. Grabbing my boots and socks, I head out to the living room and call Mike.</p><p>After what November told me last night about her childhood, I was done. I didn't care if her mom died, didn\u2019t care what I had to do but she was mine and I would never let her feel second best again.</p> <p>Remembering the tone in her voice when she opened up about her childhood\u2014the neglect and the verbal abuse\u2014had me in such a rage that I had to reminded myself that she was there with me and it would do neither of us any good if I got sent to prison so murder. We were in bed and November was lying on top of me as I played with her hair when I final asked the question I that had been nagging me.</p><p>\"Tell me about your mom.\" I said feeling her whole body go tight making my stomach clench knowing that whatever it was that she was about to say was bad so bad that she was not breathing and her nails where now digging into the skin on my arms</p><p>\"My mom was an illusion,\" She whispered her body getting closer like she was trying to press her way inside of him. \"She was one person to the world and then with me, she was someone completely different.\" I squeezed her to let her know to keep going.</p><p>\"When I was around seven, I had a school show coming up and was so excited because I had gotten the main part. I ran home to tell my mom, hoping this was something that we could share. She lived to be on stage and was always away following her dream so I couldn't stop thinking that she would finally be proud. She would finally see that I exist as more than just some kind of obligation. When I got home, she had already gone out so I went to Miss. B like I always did. I was so excited about the part I that I spent all night making sure I knew every line, word for word, so that when my mom got home she could see how hard I\u2019d worked. Later that night, my mom called Miss. B and told her she was going out after her performance and to just put me to bed. So, like always, she took me across the hall and put me to bed in my own room. It was the middle of the night when I was woken up being beaten with a broom. At first, I thought that someone had broken in and was trying to kill me until my mom started yelling about me not doing my chores. She kept hitting me over and over again. I remember begging her to stop. Finally, after what seemed like hours, she made me get out of bed and clean the house from top to bottom.\"</p><p>She took a breath and pushed closer to me. \"When I told her why I had forgotten about doing my chores, she told me that I wasn't allowed to do the play because I was too irresponsible. Then, she made me kneel on dry rice for an hour while apologizing for being so stupid and unappreciative. The night of the school play, my mom, who had never gone to a school function, made me go with her and watch another girl play the role that I had been chosen for. When the play was over, my mom dragged me backstage and gave flowers to the girl, hugging her and telling her how amazing she was.\" I could feel her tears wetting my skin. \u201cMy whole life she did things like that.\u201d She whispered her last word\u2019s so softly that I almost didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\"Why didn't you live with your dad?\" I ask, pulling her closer.</p><p>\"She told me he didn't want me either.\" I couldn\u2019t handle any more about her mom so I pulled her closer, rubbing her back until her breathing evened out.</p><p>\u201cAsher? Where\u2019s my daughter?\u201d I hear Mike ask on the third ring. When I met November at the strip club, I was only there to make sure the new guy we hired was doing a good job. I saw her with Mike at the bar and wanted to walk over and take her from him. Then Justin, a new bouncer, caught sight of her walking out to her car alone and was going to tell her about the rules, but I told him I would take care of it. I was pissed at myself for wanting her and disgusted with her for dating someone old enough to be her father.</p> <p>Obviously, the joke was on me. When I walked up to her and she turned her keys over in her hand to use them as a weapon, I was instantly proud. She was so small that it wouldn\u2019t take much to hurt her, but she didn\u2019t back down. Then she argued with me and I saw her cheeks flush. It took everything in me not to wrap her hair around my fist, press her against the car, and kiss her.</p><p>When Mike called from the other side of the parking lot, she said, \u201cOver here, Daddy,\u201d in a way that had me biting the inside of my cheek to avoid asking her what the fuck she was doing with someone as old as Mike.</p><p>Then Mike came over and patted me on the back and introduced November as his daughter. You could have pushed me over with a feather. One, I\u2019d known Mike my whole life and he never said he had a daughter. Two, she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. When she laughed at me, I swear I felt that shit in my soul. Then she shook my hand and electricity went through me, and I knew I had to get out of there. I said her name, turned around, and walked off. Then, a week later, I go to visit Gran and I see her there. I was in shock, and a dick, as usual. So what do I do? Force her to walk out with me then crowd her until she agrees to go out with me.</p><p>I knew she was as attracted me as I was to her. When I was standing in front of her and her eyes glazed over and her lips parted, I knew she was mine.</p><p>\u201cAsher?\u201d Shit, I spaced out.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out with Ma. They went to spend a girls\u2019 day in Nashville. You get any word on the break-in or have any idea who may have done it?\u201d I asked, putting on my boots.</p><p>\u201cNo. I made an appointment to have a security system put in on Monday. I have no idea who she could have made an enemy out of, and who would hate her enough to follow her to Tennessee from New York. That shit doesn\u2019t make sense. She hasn\u2019t dated much. Her mom kept her under her thumb. She got free when she went to college. That\u2019s when she got engaged. I think that situation fucked with her head so she stopped dating all together.\u201d I know it\u2019s irrational, but every time it\u2019s mentioned that she\u2019s been engaged, I want to find the fucker and slaughter him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she mentioned him. Do you think he may be trying to find a way to get her back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure. All I know is they were engaged and she called it off not long after he proposed. She never told me why it didn\u2019t work out, just that he agreed with her.\u201d He was fucking her mom and got caught. I'm sure he didn\u2019t have much choice but to agree. Not that I could tell Mike that shit.</p><p>\u201cWell, I called a buddy of mine who was part of F.A.S.T. with me in the corps. He works in New Jersey now and is in the DEA. He has a few friends on the force in New York he\u2019s going to check with about her case and see if there were any other crimes that happened in the same area that match what happened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I feel like I'm missing something.\u201d Yeah, I knew the feeling. Being beaten in New York, then the strange car at the rest area, and now the break-in here. Something was going on.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to bring out some motion lights and set them up around your place and do the same at mine. I don\u2019t like her staying at your house alone at night while you\u2019re at the club, so I'm going to keep her here with me. I would appreciate your agreement. She the most stubborn woman I have ever met, so the only way she\u2019s going to agree is if you tell her that she can\u2019t stay there unless you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? The only reason you want her staying with you is because you don\u2019t want her here at night by herself?\u201d I hear Mike chuckle through the phone. It\u2019s not the only reason I want her here. I like her in my bed, wrapped around me. She has the sweetest pussy that I\u2019ve ever tasted. She gets wild the minute I touch her, and I like knowing she\u2019s in my space, but once again, I'm not going to tell him that shit.</p><p>\u201cNever thought I would choose you for my baby girl, but fuck me if I'm not glad about this shit now.\u201d</p><p>I know that everyone judged my lifestyle before, but Jesus, I was single, and every woman I fucked knew that I was going to stay that way. Now, November is different. She isn\u2019t trying to impress me or get my money. She laughs at herself and has a good time no matter what we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s why I know she\u2019s it for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I married Joan, I felt like I was doing the right thing when she claimed to be pregnant. I was going to be involved in my child\u2019s life, regardless of how I felt about the baby\u2019s mother. It helped that she was hot and had a mouth like a fucking cyclone. Then, I was on my way home from an assignment, a man I considered a brother, stopped me before I went home and broke down.</p><p>First, I thought someone we knew died but then he told me that he slept with Joan. When I went home that night, I kicked her ass out and told her my lawyer would be in touch.</p><p>A week later, she came to me crying, saying that she miscarried the baby. I knew right then that she played me. When I asked her for paperwork from the hospital, she couldn\u2019t give me any. Fucking cunt.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll let her know that she can\u2019t stay here unless I'm here,\u201d Mike said, bringing my mind back in focus.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Mike. I\u2019ll hit you up later this week if I hear anything from New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, bud. Talk to you then.\u201d I hung up with Mike then grabbed my keys and a water bottle from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cJeep, Beast.\u201d I see him waiting at the front door when I get around the corner. I never thought I would want a dog again, but I like having him here. And I know how loyal he is to November. We just need to work on him knocking her down every time she lets him inside. That shit would not be funny if she were pregnant. An image of November, round with my child, filters through my head and I stumble into the wall.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I say out loud, leaning into the wall and trying to pull myself together. I take a few deep breaths then push away and walk to the door, stumbling out to my jeep. I open the door for Beast to jump in. I stand outside for a few minutes, letting the cool air help calm me. The fucked up part is that I'm not even afraid.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I say, shaking my head. Part of me wants to make her that way as soon as possible. Scrubbing my hands down my face.</p> <p>\u201cTrevor,\u201d I yell as I walk into my brother\u2019s house. I go into the kitchen and grab a beer and take a drink when Jen walks in. Now I know what the fuck my brother\u2019s been doing.</p><p>\u201cHi, Asher,\u201d Jen says, running her hand along my arm. I turn around and hold her wrist.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I drop her hand, taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cSo, the rumors are true? Never thought I\u2019d see the day that Asher Mayson was pussy whipped. Though, for the life of me, I don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for you to go, Jen,\u201d Trevor says, cutting her off while putting on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I thought that we could hang out for a while. You know, watch a movie or something...\u201d she says in a whine. I almost feel bad for this bitch. Then I remember that she\u2019s a bitch and will never be more than an easy fuck. The same thing she was to me.</p> <p>\u201cWhen have we ever watched a movie?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cYou drove out here to fuck. I gave you what you wanted and now you need to leave.\u201d</p><p>Shit, my brother was harsh, but then again, I never had to deal with kicking chicks out of my house. That was a lesson I learned early on. Unless you want them showing up at your house all hours of the day and night never invite them there.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Will you walk me out?\u201d she asks and I see my brother\u2019s face change, and I know exactly what he\u2019s thinking.</p><p>\u201cLook, Jen. You and I know this will never be anything more,\u201d Trevor says softly. I see her face go hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking joke,\u201d she says, poking him in the chest. \u201cI had to fake it every time we were together,\u201d she yells, her voice getting louder.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you kept coming back? Look, I don\u2019t have time for this shit. Now get the fuck out of my house and don\u2019t come back.\u201d I watch as my brother crosses his arms over his chest and glares down at her. Then, she turns and looks at me, and I know I'm next on her tirade.</p><p>\u201cI hope you know that your bitch is going to find out the way you guys treat women,\u201d she says, glaring at me. \u201cAnd when she leaves your ass, I will be there cheering her on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows how I treat bitches, and trust me, Jen, you were one of the biggest. Now, I suggest you get the fuck out of here like Trevor asked you to, or I will call the sheriff and have you removed.\u201d I watch her stomp to the counter and grab her bag, and hear her stomp down the hall. Then I hear the door slam.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, she\u2019s a pain in the ass,\u201d Trevor says as he scrubs his hands down his face. \u201cYou do know that the women in town are in a fucking tizzy because of your ass, right?\u201d he asks and I raise my eyebrow at him. \u201cSeriously, they think that now that you\u2019ve settled down, we\u2019re all going to follow in your footsteps and start handing out rings. I'm mean, if I had a November of my own, I might consider it, but there\u2019s only one of her and I don\u2019t see you being done with her anytime soon, so that doesn\u2019t give me much hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm never going to be done with her. And if by some chance this shit doesn\u2019t work out, she\u2019s off limits,\u201d I say, being one hundred percent serious. I have never cared if my brothers went after a chick I fucked. But if one of them even thought about getting with November, I would kill them, brother or not.</p><p>\u201cI fucking knew it.\u201d He clapped his hands. \u201cSo the Mayson curse is real. Fall in love on sight and all that bullshit.\u201d I wanted to laugh. From the time I was young, my father and grandfather told me and my brothers that we were cursed. They said that we would only find one love. When we met the woman who was ours, it would be like an explosion. Nothing else would matter but her. We all thought it was bullshit. Now I wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cThe moment I met her, I knew that she was the one, as cheesy as that shit sounds,\u201d I say, taking a slug from my beer.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Trevor says, looking stunned. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, man. She\u2019s fucking hot and funny.\u201d There were a lot of things that November was. Hot and funny were only a couple. She was also a good person and that was hard to find in a woman these days.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you ready to get this shit done, or did you call me out here to gossip with you?\u201d I ask, done talking about her. Part of me wished I was the only person who knew her. I didn\u2019t want to share her with anyone.</p><p>\u201cLet me get my boots and we can go. The truck is in the garage. It shouldn\u2019t take long to pull the engine.\u201d</p><p>I take a swig of my beer and watch my brother leave the room. I couldn\u2019t wait for this day to be over.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>I wake to a ringing off in distance. I know it\u2019s the alarm. I'm silently praying that Asher turns it off before I'm so awake that I can\u2019t fall back asleep. I cuddle deeper. He\u2019s pressed into my back. His arm leaves my waist, and finally, beautiful silence. His arm comes back around me, pulling me even deeper under him, and I feel his breath on the back on my neck.</p><p>The goosebumps he\u2019s causing are bringing me to the surface of consciousness. It\u2019s Monday, the day after shopping with his mom. I got back to his house at around eleven. He and Beast were waiting out on the porch for me when we pulled up. He kissed his mom then helped me carry all my new stuff into the house, where he threw them into his closet. Yes, threw, not set them down nicely. He swung his arm back and threw them through the open closet door. When he turned around, I could tell that he missed me as much as I missed him.</p><p>The next thing I knew, my clothes were gone. He picked me up, threw me onto the bed, and made slow love to me. It was so beautiful that it brought tears to my eyes. I was glad that the darkness hid them from him. Afterwards, he pulled me close and dragged the blanket over us. I had my head in the crook of his arm and his fingers were at my hip.</p><p>We both talked about our day. He told me that he helped Trevor pull an engine from a truck he was rebuilding. I never knew that you could pull an engine from a car, or truck, for that matter, and I really had no idea why you would ever do that. Our conversation went something like this:</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun with Trevor?\u201d I asked, running my fingers along the ridges of his abs.</p><p>\u201cNo, but we did get the engine pulled from his truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you take the engine out? Doesn\u2019t a car need that to run?\u201d Yes, I'm stupid, I know, but hey, I'm a New Yorker. We hardly drive. We take the subway or a taxi to most places, and if my car needs a mechanic, I take it to Juan and leave it with him. I don\u2019t hang around to see what he\u2019s doing while my car is in the shop, which is probably why my bill at the mechanic is always a lot...hmm. I could feel him laughing silently then he couldn\u2019t hold it and burst out in a loud laugh, and I started to get offended.</p><p>\u201cYeah, your car needs an engine to run. He just wants to put a stronger one in his truck.\u201d This fascinated me. I mean, who knew that you could change your engine and get a faster one?</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I whispered, thinking that I should get a faster engine for my bug.</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen,\u201d he said, looking down at me. Then he kissed the top of my head. I grinned into his chest, thinking it was funny that he thought he could boss me around. I seriously couldn\u2019t wait to pull up to meet him riding a motorcycle.</p><p>\u201cHow was it shopping with Ma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, let\u2019s just say that I will only be going shopping with her every few months. I felt like I should have prepared better. Maybe ran around Target a few times, or even went to the strip mall and marched into each of the stores a few times. She\u2019s a serious shopper, and if they had a competition, I'm sure she would come in first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s Ma,\u201d he said through his laughter. Then, I wrapped myself tighter around him, listening to his heartbeat and feeling him run his fingers through my hair. I fell asleep feeling like this was exactly where I was supposed to be.</p><p>I dozed off again, only to be woken by the sound of the alarm going off again. I felt his lips kiss my shoulder, and his tongue run up my neck just below my ear, where he kissed me again. Then he squeezed me to him. His warmth left me and I felt the cool air rush in behind me, and heard the alarm go off. I rolled over until I was lying where he had been, and pulled his pillow down and wrapped myself around it. I could hear the shower, and I opened one eye and looked at the time. It was dusk out, and the alarm said it was five thirty. I couldn\u2019t believe that he had to get up so early. I had to get up by nine so I could get ready and go to the lawyer. I saw the closet light come on and I lifted my head.</p><p>Asher was wearing a towel, and I watched in fascination as he pulled it off and pulled on a pair of black boxers that molded to his thighs and ass. He seriously had the most amazing body of anyone I had ever seen. He must have felt me looking because he turned around, smiled, and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep, baby. It\u2019s too early for you to be up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always wake up so early?\u201d I asked, cuddling back down into the bed.</p><p>\u201cDepends on the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d was all I was able to get out before I fell back asleep. I felt my hair slide off my neck and lips just below my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home around six, and I\u2019ll call you when I take lunch, baby.\u201d I felt him kiss me again, but I was too far gone to get any words out, so I grunted my agreement. I heard him chuckle then he kissed me again before he left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Standing with my hip resting against the side of Asher\u2019s kitchen sink, drinking coffee while watching Beast eat. More specifically, I was watching Beast eat out of a very nice dog bowl that was next to a very nice water dish, neither of which I bought. They were the large ones that held an endless supply of food and water so your dog could enjoy food and clean water whenever they wanted.</p><p>I had no idea when Asher bought them. All I knew was that he must have done it yesterday. Then I watched as Beast finished eating and walked to the sliding glass door. He lay down in a giant dog bed, that was also new, and proceeded to chew on a very large dog bone. I smiled and let the feeling of warmth run through me. He obviously liked my dog, and planned on us being here with him enough that Beast would need food and water dishes and a bed for when we came to visit. I wasn\u2019t ready to start staying over all the time. I mean, I was, but at the same time, I didn\u2019t want to over stay my welcome. I knew Dad had people coming out to put in a security system today, so I would be sleeping at home tonight without Asher.</p><p>On that thought, I went to his room and made the bed, cleaned up the bathroom where all my stuff had gathered then I collected all of my clothing from his closet and packed up. Then, I gathered Beast and we went to my dad\u2019s place so that he could go with me to the lawyer.</p><p>I was stunned. I mean, this kind of thing didn\u2019t happen to people every day. I was sitting across from Mr. Stevenson and I couldn\u2019t find my voice. My mouth was moving and I'm sure I looked like a fish out of water.</p> <p>He sat forward in his chair. \u201cAre you okay, darlin\u2019?\u201d Mr. Stevenson asked. It had to be a trick question. I mean, I was a millionaire. That was good, right? Everyone wanted to be rich. I just didn\u2019t know what to think about being told that I would be one million five hundred and thirty-six thousand dollars richer by the end of the month. Part of me wanted to tell him that I couldn\u2019t take it then the bigger part of me realized how many people I could help with that money.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2014I just need a minute to process this,\u201d I told him honestly.</p><p>\u201cTake your time.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him then over at my dad. He was holding my hand and his face looked shocked as well.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask a question?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, sitting back in his chair. He looked like he belonged in an old movie. He had on black slacks with a button up shirt but instead of a tie, he had one of those silver pendants that had two pieces of leather hanging from it. On his feet, he had cowboy boots, and I knew that he wore a cowboy hat because it was sitting on his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhy did they leave it to me and not my mom?\u201d Why would they leave me anything when I didn\u2019t even know them?</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure of their reasoning. A few weeks before the car accident, they came in and changed their will so that you would be the sole beneficiary of the estate at the age of twenty-eight. Now, your mother contacted me about their estate shortly after the death of her parents and I explained the situation to her. She was upset, but said she understood why her parents left their estate to you. I'm surprised that she never told you about this.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t surprised that she didn\u2019t tell me. We weren\u2019t close and she never talked about her parents. Maybe she didn\u2019t talk about them because they left me the money. That might also be why she treated me so poorly growing up. She felt that I took something away that should have been hers. I decided I was going to call her later and tell her that I was giving her half of the money. They were her parents and I'm sure they would want her to have some of it.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, baby girl?\u201d I turn towards my dad. His eyes are concerned, and I'm so lucky to have him. His love is unconditional. No strings, no stipulations. He just loves me. He doesn\u2019t even care that I now have money. And I know that if my mom was sitting where he is, she would be mentally spending every penny.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dad. I think I need to call Mom later and talk to her about this.\u201d I squeeze his hand. I could tell by the look on his face that he wanted to say something.</p> <p>\u201cI'm not sure that\u2019s a good idea, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I want to tell her that I'm going to give her half the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s your money. You are going to keep every fucking penny. That bitch is not getting one cent of that money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThey were her parents. No matter how you feel about her, they gave her life. I feel like they would have wanted her to have something from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, no. They left it to you, not her, and they did that shit for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby girl, I want you to think about this for a week. Seven days. Then, you decide what to do about it. But don\u2019t call her yet. Wait a week and see how you feel.\u201d I felt tears sting my eyes and I knew that my dad hated my mom for what she took away from him. I also knew he wanted me to make a good decision.</p><p>\u201cOkay, a week,\u201d I agreed, and he pulled me into his arms and hugged me close.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, baby girl. Never forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Daddy.\u201d I hugged him tighter.</p><p>\u201cOkay, November,\u201d Mr. Stevenson said, bringing my attention back to him. \u201cSince that is all out of the way, I'm going to have Nick call you in a few days, once I got all the papers ready to be signed. Once that\u2019s done, we can talk about the accounts and I can help you get things sorted, so that it\u2019s more manageable for you to handle on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d I told him. He stood, and Dad and I followed. Mr. Stevenson came around his desk and shook my hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d he said, walking us out to the front of the office where Nick was sitting behind a desk, typing away at a computer.</p><p>\u201cSon,\u201d Mr. Stevenson called to his son and his head lifted. \u201cI'm going to need you to pull all the papers for the Armsted estate then gather all the transfer papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. How are you, November?\u201d Nick asked. He had on a suit today, and he looked good in it. He also had on a pair of black rimmed reading glasses that made his eyes stand out. His hair was a little shaggier than the last time I saw him, and it fit him well.</p><p>\u201cI'm good. How are you?\u201d I asked, starting to get uncomfortable about the way he was looking at me. Today, I had on a pair of black leggings and a cream scoop neck sweater. I also wore black knee high wedge heels and the scarf I got from Liz\u2019s store.</p><p>\u201cGood. I was just getting ready to have lunch. Do you want to join me?\u201d His dad took a step back, and I felt awkward that he was asking me out in front of his father. Plus, he knew that I was seeing Asher, who had made it perfectly clear that I wasn\u2019t available.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, but I'm meeting Liz for coffee.\u201d His face fell and I felt so bad. I\u2019ve never liked hurting people\u2019s feelings. \u201cBut I'm sure she wouldn\u2019t mind if you joined us.\u201d</p><p>Even though I was sure that she would mind. She didn\u2019t seem like a people person. I was actually surprised that she even agreed to have coffee with me. Then an idea formed in my head. Nick was cute and Liz was pretty. Maybe they could get together.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He smiled and stood. He took off his glasses and laid them down then grabbed a file and handed it to his father, who looked shocked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in an hour. Do you want me to get anything for you while I'm out?\u201d he asked his dad.</p><p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d his dad told him. Mr. Stevenson turned towards me. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, November. See you next week,\u201d he said, smiling big. EEEKKKK!!</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too,\u201d I said, walking out the door. \u201cUm, dad. I\u2019ll see you at home, I guess,\u201d I said, almost wanting my dad to offer to stay. I didn\u2019t want Nick to get the wrong idea that this was a date or anything close to a date.</p><p>\u201cSure, baby girl. See you at home.\u201d We were all standing outside on the sidewalk a couple blocks away from Liz\u2019s store. I watched my dad walk to his car. His head was bent towards his boots, and he was shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cUm, we can just walk to get Liz, and then go to the coffee shop next to her store, if that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d I said, looking up at Nick.</p><p>\u201cSure, lead the way.\u201d He smiled and I smiled back, and then I pulled out my phone. I debated about calling Asher. I felt guilty and I didn\u2019t want him to find out that Nick was with me by someone else, but at the same time, I didn\u2019t want to call him in front of Nick, and have him freak out and get into an argument with him while on the phone.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you still seeing Asher?\u201d he asked and I put my phone away, deciding I would just call him later.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His eyebrows shoot together in surprise, and worry crossed his face. \u201cLook, November, I know you\u2019re new but you should know\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off before he could make me mad. \u201cWhat? That he has bagged almost every girl in town? Tell me something I don\u2019t know. Do I like knowing that?\u201d I asked, looking up at him. \u201cNo, but it is what it is, and I'm giving him a chance. He is sweet to me, and if there comes a time when he is not sweet to me, I will deal with it. Got it?\u201d I asked, narrowing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he said, his lips twitching. I was still looking at him when I was grabbed from behind and pulled off the ground. I screamed and start kicking, trying to throw a punch. I could hear someone telling me to calm down, but I couldn\u2019t stop fighting. I won\u2019t let myself be dragged down an alley and beaten again. I kicked, scratched, screamed, then arms wrapped around me, and I was being rocked back and forth. Someone was whispering to me that it was going to be okay. I started pulling myself together.</p><p>I opened my eyes and saw Nick standing further down the sidewalk with Cash blocking him. I took a breath and realized that I'm sitting on the ground. Not only that, but I was in someone\u2019s lap. I held my breath and lifted my head. Yep, it\u2019s Nico, and he has a bloody nose and a mark under his eye.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d I whispered. I swallowed hard and shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d I shook my head again, trying to clear the adrenaline.</p><p>\u201cDo not apologize,\u201d he said, framing my face, and I could feel the tears sliding down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Asher\u2019s going to kick my ass.\u201d He leaned in and kissed my forehead then pulled my face back into his neck. I let him hold me for a minute, and felt so embarrassed about what just happened.</p><p>\u201cI'm okay now,\u201d I told him, wiping my face on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cDid you just wipe your face on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I said, smiling into his shirt, remembering Asher and the fake blood.</p><p>\u201cJust checking,\u201d he mumbled. I look to see his lips twitching. His eyes scan my face and his thumb swept my cheek. \u201cHave you talked to anyone about what happened?\u201d I can\u2019t talk. I just shake my head.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you need to talk to someone.\u201d I swallowed and looked down. I felt tears pooling in my eyes again. \u201cAh fuck.\u201d He growled and hugged me tighter to him. Then he stood and pulled me with him, and Cash was there hugging me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, sis, you scared the fuck out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mumbled while I tried to smile. I liked that he called me sis. He pulled back and Nick stepped closer. Nico stepped in front of him then I saw the damage I caused. His shirt was ripped, his nose was bloody, and a few bruises under his eye.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I whispered. I walked to Nico and grabbed his hand. \u201cCome on, we have to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He stopped and pulled his hand away. He looked at me like I was crazy.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to go to the bathroom,\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>\u201cThis may have escaped you, but I have a dick. The only time I go into the bathroom with a chick is for a quick fuck, and that\u2019s not happening, so no, we don\u2019t have to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d I yelled. I grabbed his hand again and dragged him down the sidewalk. When we got to the caf\u00e9, I saw Liz. We made eye contact and her eyes almost popped out of her head.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey, I'm going to take Nico to the bathroom. I\u2019ll be right back. Can you order me a coffee and a cinnamon roll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake Nico to the bathroom? What am I, five?\u201d I heard him mumble beside me, and I giggled.</p> <p>\u201cUm, sure,\u201d she said, her eyes large from shock then I heard her gasp and looked behind me. Cash and Nick were walking in.</p><p>\u201cOh crap, Liz. Nico,\u201d I said, pulling his hand up, which I was still holding. \u201cCash and Nick, this is Liz. We will be right back. I dragged Nico with me down the hall and pulled him into the bathroom. I saw Liz give a slight wave to the guys and could tell that she wanted to bolt.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d I mumbled, standing him in front of the mirror. I went into the stall to get toilet paper.</p><p>\u201cWe have to make this fast before Liz bails on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you this bossy with my brother?\u201d Nico asked, his lips twitching. I smiled and shrugged my shoulders. He laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo, how do you know Liz,\u201d he asked as I wet the paper towel and started wiping the blood from his face.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know her. I just met her the other day when I went into her store. She seemed sweet and some of the Mayson boys\u2019 harem was there,\u201d I said, glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a harem.\u201d He smirked, so I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cYes, you guys do but anyway, they were rude to her, so I figured that if they didn\u2019t like her, I most likely would, no offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d He chuckled and I finished cleaning him up. Then, I turned toward the mirror and wiped the mascara off my face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need ice for your eye,\u201d I said to him through the mirror then turned to throw the garbage away. He ignored my comment and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cYou need ice,\u201d I repeated and he just shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said and my phone started ringing, saving him from a lecture. I pulled it out of my bag and saw Asher calling. Crap!</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I answered.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. I just freaked and beat up your brother,\u201d I whispered into the phone.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to kick his ass. What the fuck was he thinking, doing that shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. He was just joking around and I don\u2019t think he will ever do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard. So, how was the meeting with the lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...um...it was okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, this and that, typical lawyer stuff.\u201d I crossed my fingers, praying that he didn\u2019t ask me anymore about it. I wanted to tell him but money always changes people.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about this over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You can tell me tonight. Should we do takeout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm staying at my dad\u2019s tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNovember, you\u2019re not staying there. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep in the guest room upstairs. My dad will be in the next room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave dinner with Mike then I want you in my bed tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think we should have a break? I mean, we have been together all weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA break?\u201d he yelled and I knew that was the wrong thing to say. \u201cCareful how you word shit. Right now, November, I'm already pissed off about you being out with Nick then you say you need a break. I might get the wrong idea.\u201d</p><p>This is when I remembered that he can be a total jerk. \u201cAre you serious right now? Wait, don\u2019t answer that. I know you are,\u201d I yell back. \u201cI also told you that you have to trust me. That is not optional, Asher,\u201d I whispered into the phone, knowing my temper was going a little crazy. \u201cLiz is waiting for me. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d I hung up and turned my phone to silent. I walked to where Liz was sitting with Nick. Her head was bent, studying the coffee cup in front of her like it held the secrets to the universe. I felt guilty for leaving her out there for so long. She looked up as I sat down across from her.</p><p>\u201cI'm so sorry,\u201d I told her honestly. I felt bad that I made plans with her and they got completely messed up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d She smiled and looked over her shoulder at Cash and Nico, and I knew that she was in hot guy heaven. I laughed and she started laughing too. Yep, we were going to be great friends.</p><p>I looked up from her to see Nico and Cash walking towards us. Both were carrying coffee cups.</p><p>\u201cAlright, sis,\u201d Cash said, looking down at me. \u201cWe gotta go. We\u2019ll see you this weekend, right?\u201d His phone started ringing and he picked up with a, \u201cYo, yeah, hold on.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the phone in my direction and I knew it was Asher. I looked at it in his hand and felt like it was going to uncoil and strike out at me. Then, he shoved it closer and I had no choice but to take it from him.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever fucking hang up on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you at seven.\u201d Then the line was dead.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Cash asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll see,\u201d I told him truthfully, biting my lower lip. For the first time, I wasn\u2019t looking forward to seeing Asher.</p><p>After the guys said goodbye, I debated on telling Liz I had a headache. I no longer felt like visiting. I wanted to go home and crawl into bed and cuddle with Beast. But I stayed. Nick was really nice, no flirting, just chatting. Liz was watching him closely. They had gone to high school together but didn\u2019t know each other well.</p><p>After a while, we all said goodbye, and I told Liz to call me so we could meet up later in the week. I told Nick that I would talk to him when he got the stuff ready for me from his dad. Then, I got in my car and drove home.</p><p>I felt free. It was amazing. The landscape passed by quickly as I drove down a long stretch of country road. When I got home, my dad and uncle came out on the front porch and had me follow them around the side of the house to the garage. When we got there, I had no idea what was going on until they pulled the tarp off a shiny black motorcycle.</p><p>They explained that it was a 2011 Ninja 250r. It was small\u2014perfect for my height and weight. It also didn\u2019t have as much power as a bigger bike, so there was less of a chance of me doing damage to myself or someone else. I only half listened to them. I mean, I had a motorcycle. How flipping awesome was that?</p><p>Uncle Joe told me that one of his boys bought it for his son when he wanted to learn to ride. Now he was upgrading to a Harley so he was ready to sell it. I didn\u2019t care. I loved it. He also got me a white helmet with hot pink and black airbrush writing that says baby girl on the back.</p><p>I jumped up and down when he handed it to me. They showed me how to ride for over three hours after I changed into jeans, boots and a leather jacket. Then, they finally let me go out on the road. In the country, there was no traffic. You might come across a truck or two, but normally, you would be the only car on the road for miles at a time. It was perfect. I was in love and knew that I would be doing this often just to clear my head.</p><p>When I started up my dad\u2019s driveway, I saw Asher\u2019s jeep and my good mood left just as quickly as it came. \u201cGreat,\u201d I whispered to myself. I pulled up in front of the garage. I got off the bike, took off my helmet and shook out my hair. Asher walked up with Beast following behind him. He was wearing a red thermal and a pair of dark jeans along with his brown boots. He also wore a white baseball hat with black writing. I had never seen him in a hat before and he looked hot. Well, hotter than normal.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said and started pushing the bike into the garage. He took over and pushed it all the way in then took the cover from me and tossed it over the bike.</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess this is one more thing that I have to worry about?\u201d he asked, and even though I knew what he was talking about, I still asked.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bike,\u201d he said, crossing his arms over his chest and narrowing his eyes on me.</p><p>\u201cMy dad and uncle got it for me. I like riding it and I'm going to keep it.\u201d I crossed my arms over my chest, copying his stance and daring him to say something stupid like, \u201cYou can\u2019t keep it.\u201d Then I would have informed him that he was going to be the only thing not kept if he thought he could tell me that I couldn\u2019t have my bike.</p><p>\u201cJust promise that when you\u2019re on this shit, you\u2019ll always wear a helmet, jeans, boots, and a jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d I smiled and his eyes narrowed on my mouth.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me why you were out with Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t out with him,\u201d I said, completely exasperated. \u201cI went to his dad\u2019s firm, he asked me to lunch and I said no thank you and that I had plans. I felt bad, so I asked him if he wanted to go with me and Liz for coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh hum,\u201d he said, pulling one of the belt loops of my jeans, forcing me to take a step in his direction.</p><p>\u201cUh hum?\u201d I repeated with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you sleeping tonight?\u201d he asked, pulling me closer and dipping his head towards my neck.</p><p>\u201cIn bed,\u201d I answered but my brain was being dragged into an Asher fog with the way he kissed the skin below my ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat bed?\u201d he whispered as he bit my neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat bed am I supposed to sleep in?\u201d I breathed deeply as he started nipping on my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I moaned as he pressed into me.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are you sleeping, November?\u201d He growled and his hand fisted into the back of my head, his mouth hovering over mine. My eyes fluttered open. \u201cWhere are you sleeping, baby?\u201d he asked against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWith you,\u201d I whispered, feeling powerless against him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Always with me.\u201d My brain registers his words but before I can make him clarify what he means, his mouth is on mine and my brain goes deeper into an Asher fog. His kiss feels desperate, like he\u2019s branding me with it. When he pulled away, he pressed his forehead against mine. I ran my hand along his jaw and his eyes opened at my touch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he says and I see his cocky grin. He thinks that he\u2019s just gotten his way. I want to tell him that I have no problem sleeping with him. The only thing that worries me is that I can be a little clingy. My mom and my ex told me the same thing. They may have told me that so I wouldn\u2019t nag them about where they were going or how long they would be gone. But I know I'm a people person, and if I know someone is around, I want to be where they are. I worry that I might be what my mom and ex said I was, and I never wanted Asher to feel like I was crowding him.</p><p>\u201cWill you promise me something?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust promise that, when you start feeling like I'm around too much, you will let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he says, cupping my cheek. His thumb slides across my lower lip.</p><p>\u201cJust promise, okay?\u201d I say, feeling desperate for him to understand how much this means to me.</p><p>\u201cPromise, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I grin and he kisses my nose.</p><p>\u201cNow, do you want to eat here or do you want to pick up something on the way back to my place?\u201d I bite my lip, thinking about it, and his eyes drop to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. We\u2019re picking something up.\u201d He bends down and my belly goes into his shoulder and he carries me out of the garage.</p><p>\u201cUm, I have to go inside and get some stuff,\u201d I say from my upside down position.</p><p>\u201cYou have shit at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI packed everything.\u201d He stops and my feet hit the ground. Luckily, his arms came to my shoulders or I would have fallen on my ass.</p><p>\u201cYou packed everything?\u201d He growls.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to feel like I was suffocating you,\u201d I said in a huff.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that shit.\u201d His hands go to my neck, his thumbs sweep under my jaw then his face gets closer to mine. \u201cUnless I tell you that I want space, don\u2019t read into non-existing shit and create problems. I swear,\u201d he says, looking into the sky, \u201cif I don\u2019t want you around, I will tell you that shit straight out. No games, no bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper, never wanting to hear those words from him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now go pack your shit,\u201d he says and I glare at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to pack my shit. It\u2019s rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rude?\u201d he asks, tilting his head to the side. \u201cBaby, I promise you when I get you in my bed, I\u2019ll show you how much you like me being rude.\u201d That made me tingle in a couple different spots. I definitely wanted him to show me how rude he could be. \u201cJust for that look right there, I'm going to make you beg me to be rude to you.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God, I just had an orgasm standing outside my dad\u2019s house in the daytime. I look around, hoping no one saw me have a mini orgasm. I knew that I had to play this off, so I did what any woman would do,</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I rolled my eyes then ran into my dad\u2019s house as quickly as I could with his laughter following me the whole way.</p> <p>Asher</p><p>I watch November pull up in front of the club on that damn bike. I look over and see a group of guys watching the same thing as me. She puts the kick stand down takes the helmet off and shakes out her hair. She looks like a fucking wet dream sitting on that bike. Her legs are covered in tight denim with black boots laced up to mid-calf. She has a leather jacket on and it\u2019s zipped up half way, showing off a good amount of cleavage. I hear one of the guy whistles and her head comes up, spotting me.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d she calls and the guy goes to step in her direction. Her nose scrunches and I shake my head at him, walking toward my girl.</p><p>\u201cYou just had to ride the bike, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I ask, not at all surprised.</p><p>She smiles, shaking her head. \u201cUncle Joe would be disappointed if I didn\u2019t ride it,\u201d she says, lifting her leg over the seat and putting her helmet under her arm. I look at her and know she\u2019s right. Joe loves his boys, but neither of them ride. Now that his niece has shown an interest in riding, he feels like he has someone to share it with besides Mike.</p><p>\u201cDid you ride with him today?\u201d I ask, taking the helmet from her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we went out to the park and stopped for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say and kiss her nose. We walk inside the club past the group of guys standing near the door. It used to bug the shit out of me when men openly checked her out but not anymore. She never even notices. I spot Nico and Cash. They already have a table waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d November says to Cash and Nico. They both stand to hug her. \u201cWhere\u2019s Trevor?\u201d she asks, looking around.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s picking up Liz,\u201d I tell her and her eyes light up. I shake my head. I have no idea what\u2019s going on with Liz and Trevor. I know he likes her, but I think her innocent vibe is throwing him off. He doesn\u2019t know how to deal with a girl that has no experience. When he found out she needed a ride, he quickly volunteered to pick her up. Maybe they just need some time to get to know each other.</p><p>\u201cLiz is coming?\u201d Cash asks, rubbing his hands together. He\u2019s been fucking with Trevor every chance he gets. Anytime Liz is around and any guy even looks at her, Trevor looks ready to snap.</p><p>\u201cBe nice, guys,\u201d November says quietly, taking off her jacket and revealing the low cut shirt that she\u2019s wearing under it. I feel my pulse speed up and look around.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not cold, baby?\u201d I hint for her to put the coat back on. I know if I tell her to put the coat on, she\u2019s going to tell me where to shove it.</p><p>\u201cNah, I'm good.\u201d She smiles sweetly. Her eyes go over my shoulder and I see her body get stiff. I turn to see Becky making her way over to us.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I mumble, pulling out a stool, trying to get November to sit down.</p><p>\u201cAsher!\u201d Becky squeals, throwing herself at me. I remove her arms and hold her back.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she asks, looking around the table. Her eyes land on November and her face goes hard. \u201cOh, never mind. See you\u2019re still roaming the streets with the pussy peddler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I feel November stand beside me. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d she asks, trying to get around me.</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave, Becky,\u201d I say, blocking November. Cash and Nico are now standing on either side of November, showing where their loyalty lies.</p><p>\u201cYour daddy sells pussy.\u201d Becky snarls.</p><p>\u201cNo, my dad sells entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that some of the girls there sell pussy to their customers when no one\u2019s looking,\u201d Becky says, glaring at November.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your last name?\u201d November asks and Becky puts her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cHudson,\u201d Cash says. November looks at him then back at Becky.</p><p>\u201cSo, you were one of those girls who was selling pussy while no one was looking, weren\u2019t you, Becky Hudson?\u201d November smirks and Becky takes a step back. \u201cMy dad\u2019s club is clean unless trash like you comes in to dirty it up. But then, you know what happens to trash, don\u2019t you, Becky? It always gets thrown out. Don\u2019t talk about my dad\u2019s club again. You worked for him until you tried to make money on the side, and he threw you out like the trash you are.\u201d After landing her final blow, November walks to the bar.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re with a girl like her,\u201d Becky says, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go and don\u2019t come back,\u201d I say, turning to the bar. When I reach November\u2019s side, she\u2019s already got her Corona.</p><p>\u201cI hate women like that,\u201d she says, shaking her head and not looking up from her beer.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agree, thinking that I wasted a lot of time on women like that. \u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask, pulling her into my side and tilting her head back to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cI will be when I finish this Corona and can order another one,\u201d she mumbles against my lips and I smile against hers. I want to tell her so badly that I love her, but I keep telling myself to let her set the pace. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the table and enjoy the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>It is Christmas Eve and I\u2019m standing in the bathroom trying to finish getting ready to go to Asher\u2019s parents\u2019. It\u2019s been a month since I found out that I was a millionaire. The only person who knows about my inheritance is my dad. I finally agreed with him that I wasn\u2019t going to give my mom half the money. She hasn\u2019t even called since I\u2019ve been in Tennessee. I tried to call her and even left a couple messages but she never returned my calls. I'm sure if I would have mentioned the money, I would have gotten a call back, but I didn\u2019t want that to be the reason she reached out to me.</p><p>My other dilemma is trying to find a way to tell Asher about the money. Every time I am going to bring it up, I wonder if it will change our relationship. I don\u2019t think it will, but you never really know.</p><p>We\u2019ve been together for over a month and I still sleep in his bed every night, not that I have any choice in the matter. Anytime I mention staying at my dad\u2019s, he gets a look that tells me if I tried, he would drag me back to his house caveman style. But really, I don\u2019t mind. I love going to sleep with him every night and waking up to him every morning.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. You okay?\u201d Asher asks, coming to stand behind me, his hands going to my waist and his mouth at my neck. My hands are rolling my hot rollers into my hair. I haven\u2019t even gotten dressed yet. I still have on my tank top and sleep shorts. We got up early and had breakfast, and then crawled back into bed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whisper as the scruff from his jaw runs down my neck to my shoulder. \u201cUm, actually. I need to tell you something.\u201d I breathe deeply, hoping that I\u2019m doing the right thing.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d He bit my earlobe, distracting me.</p><p>\u201cI, uh...um.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, uh and um isn\u2019t saying much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re distracting me. I can\u2019t think when your mouth is on me.\u201d His head comes up and we make eye contact in the mirror. His dimple is out and he has a cocky grin in place.</p><p>\u201cYou like me distracting you with my mouth.\u201d He reminds me of something that I didn\u2019t need to be reminded of right now. Not when I\u2019m trying to tell him something serious. I glare at him in the mirror and he chuckles. \u201cOkay, baby. Tell me,\u201d he says, putting his chin on the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cI'm a millionaire.\u201d Okay, I didn\u2019t mean to blurt it out quite like that, but now it was out in the open. I feel his body tighten around mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks. I swallowed and bite my lip. There was no going back. I turned in his arms and put my hands on his chest.</p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s parents left me their estate and it\u2019s over a million dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you find this out?\u201d I really didn\u2019t want to answer this question. I looked over his shoulder towards the door.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me.\u201d I looked into his eyes again. \u201cWhen did you find out about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...I...\u201d I bite my lip and look away again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEyes!\u201dHe growled this time. \u201cWhen did you find out about this?\u201d I look into his beautiful eyes and see sadness there and my heart hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhen I went to the lawyer,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me then?\u201d he asks as he steps back, taking his warmth with him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want it to change us,\u201d I whisper again, looking down at the tiled floor of his bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cHave I ever given you that idea?\u201d he asks. I felt like a horrible person for not telling him from the start about the money. It was stupid to hide it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, looking up at him. I can tell that he\u2019s hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I haven\u2019t, and I have to say I'm fucking pissed that you would even think for one minute that money would change how I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it was stupid. I just wanted to make sure.\u201d His eyes narrow and I know that is the wrong thing to say.</p><p>\u201cMake sure of what? That I wasn\u2019t with you for your money? Jesus, what the fuck? I don\u2019t understand what goes on in that head of yours sometimes.\u201d That kind of hurts, but I know he\u2019s right. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked you to pay for shit. I never want you to pay for shit.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s true. Anytime I\u2019ve tried to pay for something, I would get the look that promised I wouldn\u2019t like what happened if I didn\u2019t put my money away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I know. I should have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have. I understand why you didn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t make me happy, but I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, wrapping my arms around his waist and laying my head on his chest.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t keep shit from me. I don\u2019t like knowing that you have kept that secret for over a month.\u201d Crap, I never thought about it like that.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d I whisper into his chest, feeling like a total dork.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you move in, we\u2019ll talk about your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My head jerked back so I could look into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me, and know that shit will be soon. I don\u2019t like you having to travel to your dad\u2019s every few days to go get clothes and shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsher,\u201d I say, glaring at him and putting my hands on my hips for the full effect. \u201cYou are not going to boss me into moving in with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be no bossing, baby. You want to move in. Don\u2019t you love feeding me breakfast in bed every morning?\u201d he asks and I shiver. Every morning, he has me for breakfast before he gets out of bed, and yes, I do love feeding him. \u201cDon\u2019t you like lazing on the couch, watching movies at night?\u201d I did love that, or just lying on him while he watches a game. \u201cDon\u2019t you love cooking in my kitchen?\u201d Yes, I loved his kitchen. It was my favorite room in the house. I loved baking in there, or just sitting at the counter with my kindle reading. \u201cDon\u2019t you love me fucking you whenever you need to be fucked?\u201d Um, yes! I bite my lip and look over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThose are just a few of the reasons why I won\u2019t have to boss you to move in with me.\u201d He had a point. He wouldn\u2019t need to boss me into it. It was just too soon. Maybe in a few months, but right now, I like knowing that I still have my dad\u2019s house to run to if I needed it.</p><p>\u201cCan we not talk about this right now? I need to get ready to go to your parents\u2019 house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we can wait to talk about it, but we will be talking about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cSomething to look forward to.\u201d He kisses my nose and gives me his dimple smile then leaves me to watch him walk away. I shake my head. He\u2019s such a jerk but I love him. Wait, what? I love him? Oh my God, I love him. Oh no, I love him. Crap! Oh my God, does he love me? I turn to look in the mirror. \u201cSo what, you love him. He doesn\u2019t have to love you back,\u201d I whisper to myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I jump and look through the mirror to see Asher watching me. \u201cUm, nothing. I just, um, burnt myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks, smirking, and I wonder if he heard me admit to myself that I love him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I'm fine, great, just fine.\u201d Great, now I'm blubbering like an idiot. He tilts his head and smiles. My heart starts thumping double time.</p><p>\u201cUh hum. I thought I heard you say something?\u201d he says, taking a step closer to me.</p><p>\u201cNope, not me. I didn\u2019t say anything. Maybe you heard the TV or something.\u201d I cross my arms over my chest.</p><p>\u201cThe TVs are off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, that\u2019s strange. Maybe you have a ghost,\u201d I say, tilting my head.</p><p>\u201cThis house is built on an old graveyard, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whisper, in shock. I hate ghosts. Not that I\u2019ve met any, but I don\u2019t like the idea of them. I watched the first Paranormal Activity movie and got so scared that I had to sleep with the lights on for a month. Let\u2019s just say my college roommate was not happy about that. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here,\u201d I yell. \u201cWe have to hire a ghost buster person to come get rid of it. Then, we have to bless the house, and if the ghost doesn\u2019t leave, we need to move.\u201d I was panting and Asher\u2019s lips were twitching. \u201cOh my God! This is not funny. We could end up dead, don\u2019t you know that? Haven\u2019t you ever seen the exorcist?\u201d I was yelling.</p><p>He threw his head back laughing. \u201cBaby, there is no ghost. I was kidding. The house is not built on a graveyard.\u201d</p><p>I smack him in the arm. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny. Why would you say something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna admit what you said when you were in here talking to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to myself,\u201d I snapped at him. \u201cI was talking to Beast.\u201d I'm a genius. I forgot about Beast. He\u2019s the perfect cover up.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cSo, what were you saying to Beast then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just that I love him and he\u2019s a good dog, even if he doesn\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, he loves you. Even though he thinks you\u2019re whacked.\u201d Does that mean Asher loves me? Wait, what the hell?</p><p>\u201cI'm not whacked.\u201d I growl at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you love me, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cW...wh... what?\u201d I stutter out, shaking my head. Then, he is crowding me against the counter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t piss me off, baby.\u201d He growls. I bite my lip to keep myself quiet. His eyes drop to my mouth and narrow. \u201cTell me that you love me.\u201d I start shaking my head and he holds my face between his hands. \u201cTell me you love me so I can say it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whisper in shock, searching his face to make sure he\u2019s telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cTell me, baby.\u201d I swallow the lump in my throat. \u201cSay it, baby.\u201d He lays his forehead against mine.</p><p>Squeezing my eyes closed, I whisper, \u201cI love you.\u201d My heart feels like it might beat out of my chest. I hear his sharp intake of breath then his hands fist into the hair at the sides of my head.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d I swallow then open my eyes. \u201cI love you too, baby. Jesus, I\u2019ve loved you since I saw your beautiful face standing at the bar in your dad\u2019s club. I knew then that you were it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a jerk,\u201d I remind him, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He smirks. \u201cI was pissed that I was gonna have to beat up Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say through my laugh.</p><p>\u201cI was going to have you one way or another,\u201d he says, biting my bottom lip. \u201cIf that meant beating up Mike, I was willing to do whatever was necessary to stake my claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d I giggle and shake my head in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worth it,\u201d he whispers. I feel my nose start to sting and a tear slide down my cheek. His thumb catches it. He kisses me softly and lays his forehead back against mine. \u201cNow I wish I had time to show you how much I love you. But if I did that, we would be late and I don\u2019t want to piss Ma off on Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>I got tingly and my nipples got hard. I want him to show me how much he loves me. He kisses me again, this time a little deeper, but not enough. When he pulls his mouth away, I want more. \u201cWe can be a few minutes late. I\u2019ll take the blame,\u201d I say breathlessly as I scrape my nails over his abs, watching his eyes grow dark at my touch. I lean forward and touch my mouth to his chest, running my tongue up to his collar bone. One of his hands fists in my hair and the other pulls me closer to him so I\u2019m on the edge of the counter. The hard length of him is pressed to my center. He takes my mouth in a hard, deep kiss, then his mouth leaves mine, traveling down my neck. I wrap my legs around his waist, pulling him closer. He puts my arms around his shoulders then picks me up, carrying me out of the bathroom. I fly through the air then my body hits the bed so hard, I bounce twice. I hear my hot rollers hitting the hardwood floors. Then my shorts and panties are off. His hands travel up my thighs, my legs falling open. \u201cI love this pussy, baby. So pink, wet, and mine.\u201d He growls the words against my clit, making my pulse race. He licks me from top to bottom. \u201cJesus, so fucking sweet,\u201d he says, licking me again. This time, his tongue circles my clit, not making contact. I whimper.</p><p>\u201cHush, baby.\u201d He licks me again, pulling my clit into his mouth. My hips shoot off the bed and my hands hold his head while my heels press into the mattress. He growls then throws both my legs over his shoulders and lifting my ass. His mouth is eating me like he\u2019s starving. My hips circle, pressing him deeper. I am close, so close.</p><p>\u201cAsher.\u201d I moan. \u201cPlease.\u201d My back bows off the bed and my eyes shut tight. My hands fist the sheets at my sides. I am searching for it. I am close. I feel it start then his mouth is gone. I whimper and he slams into me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I scream.</p><p>Asher looks down at me. \u201cGive me your mouth, baby.\u201d My head is righted and his mouth is on mine. I can taste the salty sweetness of myself in the kiss. I wrap my legs around his hips, running my hands up his back, feeling the muscles contract as he\u2019s pounding into me. \u201cI'm going to come,\u201d I say, shoving my face into his neck and biting down. My limbs go tight around him. \u201cNot yet. Together,\u201d he says, lifting my hips higher. \u201cAsher,\u201d I cry. \u201cFuck!\u201d he shouts, pounding harder. My head flies back. \u201cSo fucking beautiful.\u201d His words make me hotter. I bite my lip, trying to keep from coming without him. His hands leave my hips and travel down to my breast, pinching my nipples. I'm so close and trying hard to hold off my orgasm that I can taste blood from where I'm biting my lip.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d His words are like a trigger. I go off, feeling myself break into a million pieces. Two more stokes and he follows behind me, his mouth finding mine as he swallows my scream. I can feel myself convulsing around him. I tighten my limbs, holding him closer. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me.\u201d I breathe, not ready to be separated from him. \u201cNever, baby,\u201d he says, and I know that the emotion behind his words means more than just right now. He spends time kissing my jaw, neck and lips. After a few minutes, he slides out and I feel the loss of him right away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have to get ready, baby,\u201d he whispers, his lips close to mine.</p><p>I pout out my bottom lip. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna.\u201d</p><p>He grins and bites my lip. \u201cSorry. Ma would kick my ass if we didn\u2019t show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I continue pouting then I realize that my hair is going to take forever to fix. Plus, I have to find all the rollers and clips that flew out of my hair. \u201cYou ruined my hair, so I\u2019m not longer taking the blame for being late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou love me, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper, melting under him.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he mumbles. He kisses my nose then slides off the bed, pulling me up with him. \u201cYou need to hurry your ass up, baby, don\u2019t wanna piss Ma off,\u201d he says, smacking said ass.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I mumble, walking into the bathroom. My boyfriend is hot, he loves me, and I just had a really great orgasm. Even he can\u2019t piss me off right now</p><p>I look up to see Asher watching me. I'm sitting on the floor with his cousin\u2019s baby girl, Emma, holding her little hands as she bounces on my thighs. She is so perfect. Her cheeks are chubby and her little lips are so kissable. Holding her makes me want a baby of my own. I wonder if Asher even wants kids. He would be a great dad. I\u2019ve seen him with his family\u2019s kids and they love him. I look away, not wanting him to read my face. Emma giggles and grabs my hair, trying to pull it into her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cNo, sweet girl. You don\u2019t want to eat that.\u201d I untangle my hair from her hand then tickle her, making her laugh louder. There is nothing better than hearing a baby laugh. There is something so pure and beautiful about it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really good with her.\u201d The rough voice startles me, and I look up to see a guy I\u2019ve never met before standing over me.</p><p>\u201cUm, thanks,\u201d I say, wondering who he is. He\u2019s about as tall as Asher but more bulky. His black hair is a little long, but it works for him, wisping out around his face in a messy I don\u2019t give a crap kind of way. His tan skin makes the golden color of his eyes stand out more. He has full lips and a few days\u2019 worth of stubble on his jaw that is angled perfectly. He\u2019s not dressed up like most of the people here. He has on a pair of light jeans and a plaid shirt. I look away from him and back down to Emma, who is staring up at this guy, completely fascinated by him. I don\u2019t blame her. He is very good-looking. But he also has a vibe about him that seems almost dangerous.</p><p>\u201cKenton,\u201d the guy says.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d I say, looking back up at him.</p><p>\u201cName\u2019s Kenton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, nice to meet you. I'm November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty name. Never seen you before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine,\u201d Asher says, walking up, holding a beer.</p><p>\u201cShit, man. I didn\u2019t know you were here. How are you?\u201d They do a man hug and I stand, bringing Emma with me. When I get to my feet, Asher pulls me to him, tucking me under his arm.</p><p>\u201cI'm good. Ma would have my balls if I tried to skip out on Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Kenton chuckles, looking between me and Asher. \u201cSo, this is your girl?\u201d he asks in disbelief and I giggle. Everyone is always so surprised that Asher has a girlfriend.</p><p>Asher looks down at me and smiles. Then, he kisses the top of my head. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know how many hearts are breaking?\u201d he asks, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I know.\u201d I roll my eyes at him. I have become public enemy number one around here. You would think I went to the homes of all these chicks and personally stole their most treasured possessions.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you doing in town? Last time we spoke, you were heading out to Mexico on a case?\u201d Asher asks.</p><p>\u201cI got back yesterday. The trail went cold. I came home for Christmas and to see if I can find any new leads. If I can\u2019t find anything, I\u2019ll leave again after the new year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need your help with something while you\u2019re in town. I\u2019ll set up a time this next week when we can meet up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay? Is it Joan?\u201d Kenton asks. At the name Joan, Asher\u2019s arm tightens. I look up and see that his jaw is locked, and I wonder who Joan is. But before I can ask, Emma starts crying.</p><p>\u201cUm...I'm going to find her mom,\u201d I say, looking up at Asher.</p><p>\u201cSure, baby. Come back to me when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper as he kisses my temple.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you, Kenton,\u201d I say, smiling.</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me closely and shakes his head, smiling, then says, \u201cYeah, you too. I\u2019ll see you around, I'm sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I mumble, feeling uncomfortable and wondering who Joan is and why that name would make Asher upset. I find Emma\u2019s mom and we talk for a few minutes and exchange numbers. She lives a couple towns over and is around my age. I like her right away and would love to spend more time with Emma. I walk back through the crowd and see Asher still talking to Kenton. It looks serious, so I make my way to the kitchen to find Susan.</p><p>\u201cHey, do you need any help?\u201d I ask Susan after I find her in the pantry. She\u2019s standing on a ladder and it looks like it might fall over.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God.\u201d She turns, looking down at me. \u201cI need help getting some platters made up and set out. Are your dad and grandma here yet?\u201d she asks, going back to looking on the shelf.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. He said they were running late but they\u2019d be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Here, grab these.\u201d She hands me three trays. \u201cYou can help me until they show up.\u201d She smiles, stepping down from the ladder. We walk into the kitchen. Their kitchen is a galley style. It\u2019s long and updated, but closed off from the rest of the house so you can\u2019t see anyone unless they walk into it.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d I ask, setting the trays down on the counter.</p><p>\u201cSure, you know you don\u2019t even have to ask. I'm always here anytime you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. My voice is clogged from the lump in my throat. \u201cUm, who is Joan?\u201d Her face freezes and I'm not sure what that means.</p><p>\u201cShe was Asher\u2019s wife.\u201d Well, crap. That\u2019s not what I expected at all.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I whisper, having nothing else to say.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, Kenton mentioned her,\u201d I say, cutting wedges of cheese and placing them on the platter. Susan comes to stand next to me, moving my hair off my shoulder. I look over at her and she smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I smile and I know that it doesn\u2019t reach my eyes, but I'm praying that she doesn\u2019t say anything else. I really don\u2019t want to cry.</p><p>\u201cTalk to Asher about it if it\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promise her, knowing that it\u2019s time we talk about his ex-wife and why he got divorced. It\u2019s completely irrational that it bothers me, knowing that he loves me, but part of me wishes he didn\u2019t have a past. Well, at least one that he was married in. Stupid, I know. I was engaged, but I love him more than I ever thought possible. And now that I feel this kind of love, I realize that I didn\u2019t love my ex. He was a crutch. I wanted him so that I could start a life on my own, one where my mother didn\u2019t have any control. I'm glad that it didn\u2019t work out. I'm not glad that he slept with my mom, but our relationship wouldn\u2019t have been fair to him in the long run.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl.\u201d I turn and see my dad walking into the kitchen, my grandma following close behind him.</p><p>\u201cDaddy.\u201d I take two steps and his arms are around me. He tilts my face back with his hands on my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You look sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm fine. Just helping Susan.\u201d I smile. I don\u2019t want him worried about me. His eyes narrow, but before he can question me, Asher walks into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d He pats my dad on the back. He looks at me and his eyes narrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I'm just happy.\u201d I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fucking happy. You look sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, did either of you stop to think that I haven\u2019t had this before, and I'm just sad that I missed out on it for so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Asher mumbles, rubbing his hands down his face. My dad\u2019s eyes turn angry. Once again, I put my foot in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do on holidays?\u201d Dad asks. Crap, crap, crap. Me and my damn foot. When will I learn to keep it out of my mouth?</p><p>\u201cI went to a friend\u2019s. Can we please not talk about this and just enjoy tonight?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>My dad takes a deep breath while pulling my head to chest, kissing my hair. I lift my head and smile at him and see my grandma and Susan watching me closely.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to help Susan finish these platters,\u201d I say, pulling away from my dad and stepping in front of the platter I was making.</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby girl. I'm going to go get a drink. We can visit when you\u2019re done.\u201d Crisis averted. Yay!</p><p>Smiling, I look over at him. \u201cI\u2019ll find you,\u201d My dad smiles then and saunters out of the kitchen. If I had one wish, it would be for my dad to find a good woman to love. He deserves happiness more than anyone I know. Plus, my dad is good-looking. It confuses me that he hasn\u2019t had a relationship since my mom.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay, baby?\u201d Asher asks, pulling my back to his front.</p><p>\u201cI'm fine,\u201d I say, leaning against him.</p><p>\u201cI'm gonna finish talking to Kenton. I got worried that someone else was trying to steal you away when you didn\u2019t come back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo talk to him. I'm okay in here. When were done, I\u2019ll find you,\u201d I say, but I wanted to ask right then why he divorced Joan and why Kenton would ask if he needed to talk about her. But we would have plenty of time later to talk about her, and it was Christmas Eve. I really didn\u2019t want him to be upset.</p><p>\u201cOkay, love you,\u201d he says against my ear and goose bumps spread across my skin. He squeezes me then I feel his presence leave the kitchen before I can tell him that I love him too.</p><p>\u201cNice save,\u201d Susan says, making me jump.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I mumbled, and she started laughing.</p><p>\u201cJust promise that you will talk to him about Joan. I know that his history with her is bothering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d I say, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Joan?\u201d Crap! Of course, I forgot that my grandmother is here. She\u2019s like a damn ninja. She\u2019s constantly sneaking up on you when you least expect it, or she is so quiet that you forget she\u2019s there and say crap that isn\u2019t meant to be heard by her.</p><p>\u201cAsher\u2019s ex-wife,\u201d Susan shares, and I watch my grandma\u2019s eyes pop out of her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit. That\u2019s not what I thought you were going to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma,\u201d I scold her. She has the mouth of a sailor.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take that tone with me. I\u2019ve heard you pull up in that car of yours with that music you listen to, talking about bitches this and bitches that. And I know that your man cusses more in one sentence than I do in a day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, she had me there. Rap music did tend to use the word bitch a little too often, and Asher could curse even when there was nothing to curse about.</p><p>\u201cPoint taken,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you be upset that he had a life before you? I hate to remind you, but you were engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were engaged?\u201d Susan gasps. Geez, this day started out so perfectly, and every time I turn around, someone is talking about something that I don\u2019t want to talk about.</p> <p>\u201cI was, and then I found out that the guy was a total jerk and broke it off.\u201d I look over at my grandma. \u201cI'm not upset. I just want to understand why they split up.\u201d Grandma nodded her head in understanding.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do? I mean, why did you call off your engagement?\u201d Susan asks.</p><p>\u201cHe cheated,\u201d I say and hear my grandmother inhale. I never told my father why I called off the engagement, so he was never able to tell her, and since I\u2019ve been home, she has never asked.</p><p>Besides the idea of telling them that he cheated on me with my mom didn\u2019t sound like a conversation I wanted to have.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think that you should talk to him about it,\u201d my grandmother says like she just solved all of my problems and I smile, shaking my head.</p> <p>\u201cI'm going to talk to him, just not on Christmas Eve. We should be having a good time visiting with friends and family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a smart girl,\u201d she says, pinching my cheek like I'm five.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me and your grandma finish these and you go visit with everyone,\u201d Susan says, taking the knife and cheese away from me.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Asher whispered into my ear. It was Christmas morning. Both our families were over and most were still wearing pajamas. Somehow, everyone decided while they were drunk that we should all have breakfast and open gifts at Asher\u2019s house.</p><p>Making early morning plans while drinking is not smart. I made the coffee extra strong and put out aspirin as an appetizer before breakfast. The first person showed up at eight. Asher kissed me and got out of bed. I hid under the covers, hoping that everyone would forget I was even in the house. This only lasted about five minutes. Asher came back into the room and dragged me across the bed then tried to stand me up, but I was playing dead and slumped into him, not even opening my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cBaby, we gotta make breakfast.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo, all I want for Christmas is to sleep,\u201d I said, trying to cuddle into his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep later,\u201d he said while rubbing my back, but that was making me sleepier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be your bestest friend ever if you let me sleep.\u201d He started laughing harder.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I want you to be my best friend, I need help making breakfast for everyone. I'm pretty sure that last night you were jumping up and down while clapping, saying how much fun if was going to be to open gifts with everyone this morning.\u201d Crap, I did do that, but that was also after having four cups of eggnog, so I can\u2019t be held accountable for my actions.</p><p>\u201cI was drunk. It doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, so all the dirty things you said you wanted me to do to you last night don\u2019t count,\u201d he said, and I shoved my face deeper into his chest, hoping to block him out. I do not want to even think about what a drunk me would say to Asher.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. Tonight I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I cut him off. I didn\u2019t want to know what drunk me said. \u201cI'm awake,\u201d I blurted out. I ran to the bathroom and slammed the door before he could say anything else.</p><p>I made baked French toast and bacon. Asher made scrambled eggs that I swear could win awards. He uses whole cream and cheddar cheese. They melt in your mouth and each bite is like heaven. After we all ate, everyone was gathered around the tree. Asher pulled me into his lap so we could open gifts.</p><p>I had a hard time finding him something for Christmas, but since he was always on his phone at the job site, going through emails and putting together orders, I decided to get him an ipad mini. That way, he could have a bigger screen and wouldn\u2019t be going blind from looking at the small screen on his phone. Plus, I got him a case that has a built in keyboard, hoping that it would make his life easier when sending email and placing orders. I also got him a few shirts and a New York Yankees baseball hat, not that he loved the Yankees, but I loved him in hats and I'm a New Yorker, so it was necessary.</p><p>After everyone finished opening gifts, it took me a minute to realize that Asher didn\u2019t get me anything. I tried not to let this hurt my feelings but it did. He loved the ipad and was still playing with it as people started leaving the living room.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to go clean up breakfast,\u201d I mumbled to myself since Asher hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off his new toy since he opened it. I pulled myself up from where I was sitting between his spread legs.</p><p>\u201cCan you throw that shit in the closet for me, baby?\u201d he asked, not looking up from the stupid ipad. I was starting to wonder if it was water resistant.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I grumbled. I picked up the stuff that I got him, along with the gifts that I got from our families, to take back to the bedroom. I set my stuff on the bed then carried his crap to the closet. I debated just throwing it in there, but I didn\u2019t want to mess it up.</p><p>After about two weeks of me being at Asher\u2019s house, I cleaned out his closet, put all of his laundry away, folded his T-shirts and hung anything that needed to be hung. I also organized all of his shoes. I loved his closet. I turned on the light without even thinking. I set his new shirts on his shelf when I noticed my metal framed mannequin in the corner. I did a double take then saw a huge dressing table in the middle of the room with all my odds and ends on it, including a cool jewelry stand and a standing mirror with swirly legs that looked awesome.</p><p>Looking around, I noticed all my clothes and shoes were in his closet and there was a very cool chaise lounge chair in the corner with a small gift box sitting on top of it. My hands started shaking and I looked around, realizing that this was my Christmas gift and it was the most awesome gift that he could have ever given me.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d I heard him whisper as his arms circled my waist, pulling me back against him.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t talk. All I could do was nod my head. I was speechless. When I found my voice, I asked him, \u201cWhen did you do this? How did you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guys got here a few minutes after we left yesterday. They put up the new shelves, brought in the dressing island and the chair. Your dad and grandma brought over all your stuff and set it up before heading to Ma\u2019s for the party last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d I whispered. It was perfect. A dream closet. \u201cDid you pick out the jewelry stand and mirror?\u201d</p><p>I felt his silent laughter against my back. \u201cLiz picked them out for you. When I told her what I was doing, she talked my ear off about closets the whole time I was in her store. I will tell you, I don\u2019t know what it is with women and closets, but if the stomach is the way to a man\u2019s heart, a closet is the way to a woman\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and melted deeper into him. Liz had become a great friend and was slowly becoming more open with us. Except when Trevor was around, but I think that\u2019s because he\u2019s always growling at her. When she ignores him, it pisses him off. When she talks to him, it pisses him off, but when another guy tries to talk to her, that pisses him off even more. He normally ends up storming off, leaving Liz looking completely baffled and me laughing to myself. With the way he looked at her, I knew he was seriously into her. It was like watching a romance in the making, just waiting to see who\u2019s going to break first.</p><p>\u201cI love this closet. I loved this closet before I even really liked you,\u201d I told him truthfully.</p><p>He laughed, turning me in his arms. \u201cNow you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, or maybe I'm using you for your closet. Did you ever think of that?\u201d I asked, smirking up at him. He picked me up suddenly, making me squeal. Then I was on the chaise lounge with him lying on top of me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I breathed as his hand found my breast and the other went to the back of my thigh.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to prove that you\u2019re not using me for the closet,\u201d he says, his fingers tracing the back of my thigh and around the front of my sleep shorts, and underneath the edge. Then he slowly traced my seam with his finger. My hips lifted automatically, trying to get more contact.</p><p>\u201cPeople are here.\u201d I moaned.</p><p>\u201cThen you better be quiet, baby,\u201d he whispered into my ear, his fingers running over my clit, circling twice then dipping down, filling me. I bit down on his shoulder, one hand going under his shirt to his back and the other to his bicep, holding on. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet. Jesus, I wish I could taste you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I begged, my face coming out of his neck. I love his mouth. I wanted his mouth on me.</p><p>\u201cMy greedy girl. You know I love your pussy, baby, but I can\u2019t. The minute I get my mouth on you, I\u2019m going to want to fuck you and I can\u2019t do that knowing your dad\u2019s in the next room.\u201d</p><p>I whimpered. His words were turning me on even more. His fingers slid slowly in and out then his thumb moved over my clit and I felt myself begin to fall apart, his mouth catching my moan. I pulled him closer, wrapping myself tighter around him. My eyes were squeezed shut and I could still feel myself spasming around his fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I whispered, opening my eyes. I watched in fascination as Asher brought his fingers to his mouth and licked them clean. That caused another spasm. Then his mouth was on mine, kissing me deep and wet. When he pulled his mouth away, we were both trying to catch our breath. \u201cMaybe I'm using you for amazing orgasms,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d He chuckled and kissed my nose. I felt my face go soft.</p><p>\u201cNo, I'm definitely in love with you.\u201d I whispered my confession. It still amazed me that this guy, who seemed so rough around the edges, was always soft with me.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d Tears stung my nose and I took a deep breath.</p><p>Asher picked up the wrapped box on the chair and handed it to me. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYour other gift.\u201d He smiled his cocky grin and I couldn\u2019t help but to roll my eyes. I slowly unwrapped the silver paper and lifted the lid on the small jewelry box. My heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest with the anticipation.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I whispered, staring down at the most beautiful necklace I had ever seen. Two silver hearts intertwined, becoming one, similar to an eternity symbol. I took it out of the box and held it in my hand, not sure if he even knew the significance of the design. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I said, still whispering. I looked up and he was watching me closely.</p><p>\u201cWill you put it on me?\u201d I asked, handing it to him. My hair was already up so I turned my back to him and he placed the necklace around my neck then clasped it. I felt his lips on the back of my neck. My hand went to the hearts and I pulled it away from my chest, looking down at it. He pulled me around to face him again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he said and I started crying. He pulled me into his lap and I shoved my face into his neck, absorbing his smell. \u201cBaby, why are you crying?\u201d That\u2019s a good question. I had no idea why I was crying. I just felt really emotional.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d I sniffled, wiping my face on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cDid you just wipe your snot on me?\u201d</p><p>I started giggling. \u201cNo, just tears. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh hum,\u201d he mumbled and kissed the top of my head. I pulled my face away from his chest and looked into his beautiful eyes. I\u2019m so lucky. \u201cSo, now that you have your stuff here, baby, you know that means you\u2019re officially moved in, right?\u201d</p><p>I'm in complete shock. He totally tricked me into moving in. Actually, come to think of it, he tricked my dad. He got his way without having to fight with me about it. I loved staying there, but I liked having a backup plan.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You bossed me and got your way, and I didn\u2019t even notice you were doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t boss you, baby. I told you that you would want to live with me.\u201d He was right, as mad as it made me. I wanted to be there as badly as he wanted me to.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think this is too soon?\u201d I mumbled, shaking my head.</p> <p>\u201cFuck, no.\u201d</p><p>Okay. He was sure about this. Me, on the other hand, I was not so sure. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to go bad because we\u2019re so new. I feel like this is moving so fast. I'm worried that it\u2019s just because it\u2019s new to you and you don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re asking. Like you\u2019re going to lose interest sooner or later and I\u2019ll be heartbroken, and stuck moving out of a house that I love when I knew it was too soon to move into it in the first place.\u201d</p><p>His hands moved to my neck, his thumbs were under my jaw, tilting my head back so he had full eye contact. \u201cYou\u2019re pissing me off.\u201d Eeek! He looked pissed. Crap. \u201cI'm a grown man. I know what I want out of life. I know who I want in my life. You\u2019re not in my head, you don\u2019t know how I feel, so stop trying to make choices for me,\u201d he says, shaking my head gently. \u201cI'm trying to slow down for you. For me, going fast would be you wearing a ring instead of a necklace. Trust me, I'm taking it slow, as slow as I can.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, I knew that he was telling the truth. The thing that he didn\u2019t know was that, if he asked me to marry him, I would say yes, no questions asked. From the moment I saw him, I wanted him. Granted, I thought he was a big jerk after he spoke, but I still wanted him. When my apartment was broken into and he was there with me, taking care of me and making sure I was safe, I knew then he was really a good man. Then the way he talks to me and looks at me, well, that sealed the deal.</p><p>\u201cI love you. You\u2019re it for me. I knew from the moment I met you that I was done for. I like having you here and I don\u2019t see that changing, unless you don\u2019t feel the same as I do? Then you need to tell me that so I can convince you that you do,\u201d he says, smirking at me. I wondered if he felt the same about his ex. Did he love her?</p><p>\u201cDid you love your ex-wife?\u201d I blurted out, feeling his body stiffen under me. \u201cNever mind, I'm sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have asked you that.\u201d I tried to escape off his lap.</p> <p>His eyes narrowed and he took a deep breath. \u201cYou can always ask me anything,\u201d he says, pulling me deeper into him and pressing my head into his warm chest. \u201cI never loved her. I thought I was doing the right thing. We had been sleeping together for about a year and I knew that I didn\u2019t want anything serious with her. She always hinted at more, but I knew she wasn\u2019t the one. I did care about her, but I wasn\u2019t in love with her. I had been gone for a month and when I got back, she was waiting for me outside my apartment. She told me she was pregnant and that it was mine. I knew that I had to do the right thing. I never wanted my kid to grow up in a house where I didn\u2019t have access to him or her twenty-four seven, so I did what I thought was right at the time. I told her that it would work out and we would get married. That way, she would have insurance for all the medical bills, and I would have full access to my child, and maybe I would grow to love her. She claimed to be around three months. When I was leaving to go out with my squad, I was gone for two weeks, give or take. We had been married for a month and she moved in right away. When I came back from an assignment, a friend of mine stopped me before I could go home. He told me that she had slept with him and that he was sorry. I went home and confronted her about what she had done. She didn\u2019t deny it. She said she was trying to get me jealous to make me realize that I loved her. It didn\u2019t work. I kicked her out and told her that my lawyer would be in touch. A couple days later, she came by and told me that she had lost the baby. I asked for proof and she never showed me any. To this day, she tries to contact me every once in a while. I don\u2019t take her calls, but she has been known to show up out of the blue. Kenton knows about her after she claimed to have lost the baby, he did some digging for me. He found out that she never went to the doctor for any kind of treatment during the time she claimed to be pregnant. I guess she thought I would knock her up after we got married and I would never be the wiser. She didn\u2019t count on me staying wrapped up even after she claimed to be pregnant and I had a ring on her finger. Something in the back of my head didn\u2019t feel right. I never fucked her without protection and I'm thankful to this day that I listened to my gut.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe that someone would do that. Claiming to be pregnant just to manipulate someone else was disgusting. \u201cI'm sorry that she did that to you,\u201d I whispered, running my fingers along the underside of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI am too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what does she want when she tracks you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t give a fuck and I don\u2019t take her calls. I want nothing to do with her I have Kenton keep track of her and what she\u2019s up to. Some people are unstable she\u2019s one of them. Plus a few years ago she showed up in town and started taking shit I lost a good friend because of her.\u201d Well, I was no longer worried about how he felt about his ex. I hated her and what she did to him, and if I ever saw her, I might beat the crap out of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you had to go through that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven shit like that can teach you the best lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat lesson did you learn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cGood lesson?\u201d My head came up when my phone started ringing from the bedroom. \u201cI should get that. It might be Tia.\u201d I kissed him and climbed off his lap to answer it. Being Christmas, I knew that I could expect a few phone calls from my friends in New York. When I finally got to my phone, it had stopped ringing so I flipped it open to see who the call was from. It was a New York number that I didn\u2019t recognize, but the person left a voice mail. I put my phone to my ear to listen and had to fight the urge to throw it across the room when I heard my ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cHey, I...um, just wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas. I know it\u2019s been awhile, but I wanted to tell you that I love you and miss you, November. I know I messed up.\u201d There was a long pause and I thought he hung up then I heard a deep breath. \u201cI hope you can forgive me. I miss you. Please call me back.\u201d My face must have said it all. Next thing I knew, my phone was out of my hand and Asher had it to his ear. He took it away and looked at it, and then pressed a button and put it back to his ear. I knew he was listening to the voice mail I just heard. I watched in fascination as his jaw clenched and I could hear my phone cracking in his hand.</p><p>\u201cEasy with my phone, Hulk.\u201d He looked down at me and I smiled. He ignored my grin, took the phone away from his ear then threw it onto the bed. He used his other hand to pull out my hair tie and threw that behind him, and then wrapped my hair around his fist.</p><p>\u201cYou are not calling that piece of shit back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not calling him back,\u201d I repeated. I never planned on it. Actually, I wanted to know how he got my number and why he was calling me at all. The only thing I could think was that he called my mom and asked her for my number.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck is he calling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d I said, looking over his shoulder and wondering the exact same thing. He tugged my hair and I looked back at him. \u201cI have no idea. I haven\u2019t even talked to him in two years. After I found out what he did, I changed my number and avoided him like the Ebola virus.\u201d I watched his eyes go soft and his lips twitch.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you avoid your mom?\u201d I took a breath and told the truth.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to forgive her. I wanted a mom who loved me. I felt like if I forgave her for what she had done, maybe she could forgive me for whatever it was that I had done to make her hate me so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything to her. She was selfish and doesn\u2019t deserve to have a daughter that is as kind and forgiving as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I whispered. \u201cShe has always hated me. I was never good enough. I don\u2019t know why she is the way she is but it doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t crave her attention or love. It\u2019s not easy growing up having your only comfort provided by people who are paid to take care of you. All I wanted my whole life was to feel wanted. Until I met my dad when I turned eighteen, I never felt like I belonged to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou belong now. Not only do you belong to your dad and his family, you belong to me and mine. And one day, you will belong to our kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids?\u201d I asked, shocked.</p><p>\u201cKids. I told you, I'm going slow for you. But you\u2019re going to be my wife, and as soon as we sign the marriage license, I'm working on getting you knocked up.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at him. \u201cYou have this all planned, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah.\u201d He smiles. I smile back. His happiness is contagious. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you waddling around, knowing that I got you that way.\u201d My eyes narrow. He smiles. \u201cThat you are my life, and that you\u2019re carrying a life that we created inside of you.\u201d I felt faint. Even though he said I would waddle, and no woman wants to ever hear that they waddle or are going to waddle, it was still the most beautiful thing anyone had ever said to me.</p><p>\u201cHow many kids do you have in mind?\u201d I asked softly, wrapping my arms around his neck. His hands slid to my waist and under my shirt. His thumbs running along my sides, causing goose bumps to break out.</p><p>\u201cTwo boys and three girls. The boys need to come first so they can protect their sisters, especially if they look like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if we have a girl first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I'm going to buy a few more guns.\u201d</p><p>I started giggling. \u201cYou do know how hot you are, right? I mean, if we have boys, I'm going to have to buy stock in Trojan just to make sure that they are always protected. Either that, or invest my money into a medical company so that they can invent men\u2019s birth control.\u201d He started shaking his head, chuckling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI like that you keep saying we,\u201d he said softly, his eyes warm. \u201cNow I know you see a future with me.\u201d He smiled his cocky smile and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re very bossy and completely cocky.\u201d His lips twitched, but what he didn\u2019t do was disagree with me. I had to admit, it was a total turn on that he was so sure about us. It put my mind at ease. I didn\u2019t worry that I was thinking things were more serious than he thought they were. He kissed my nose then my lips softly.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to see if Ma needs help. I\u2019ll make sure that everyone is going to be ready to go to your dad\u2019s soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I stood on my tiptoes and kissed him quickly then walked into the bathroom and shut the door. I listened to Asher leave the bedroom. Once I knew the coast was clear, I pulled a towel down from the shelf, shoved my face into it, and screamed at the top of my lungs while jumping up and down. I couldn\u2019t believe that I was getting everything that I had ever wanted. I had a man that loved me, a great job, and a giant family. I knew that I was lucky.</p> <p>I remember spending Christmas in New York, watching the Macy\u2019s parade then going to Tia\u2019s family\u2019s house for the day. If they weren\u2019t around, I would make dinner for myself and camp out in bed with a good book while my mom was with her friends or whatever guy she was seeing at the time. Now I had friends and family who would always be around to spend holidays with.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>The doorbell is ringing and Beast\u2019s barking woke me suddenly. I roll to the clock and see that it\u2019s just after ten in the morning. I can\u2019t think of anyone who would be here this early, unless it\u2019s the postman and he\u2019s dropping off a package.</p><p>I crawl out of bed and find Asher\u2019s shirt that he took off last night. I slip it over my head and find my sleep shorts lying on the floor. I pull them up quickly, noticing that they\u2019re getting a lot tighter. I'm still half asleep because I got home late yesterday.</p><p>I had been out on another all day shopping adventure with Susan. This trip was much better than the last, only because I needed to get stuff for an Easter egg hunt that I was going to be putting on at the nursing home. Hearing kids laughing and having a good time makes me happy, so I want parents to bring their kids and let them go into the patients\u2019 rooms and get an egg and some candy.</p> <p>With Asher gone on job sites more often, I am starting to feel bored. I work for my dad and Liz, plus I took on a few other small clients in town. But even with the extra work I am doing, I still have plenty of free time.</p><p>First, I started going to the gym. I was working out so much that I had definition where I never thought I would and I was losing tons of weight. Then, one day Asher looked at me and actually complained.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I loved your body. I loved having something to grab onto. I loved how soft you were. I know that you want to be healthy, but I miss the softness.\u201d</p><p>His voice was soft and the look in his eyes said that he loved me no matter what, but that he missed the way I looked. And I don\u2019t know any woman who would not want their man to tell him that they shouldn\u2019t lose weight. I really didn\u2019t care. I wasn\u2019t working out to lose weight. I was doing it out of boredom, but I was happy to hear that he liked my body the way it was.</p><p>That night, I may have gone a wee bit overboard. I hadn\u2019t been on a diet, but I had been watching what I was eating. So, that night, I made homemade chicken Alfredo with garlic bread and asparagus. For dessert, I made apple cobbler with vanilla ice-cream. There were more than three days\u2019 worth of calories in that meal, but it was so worth it. In the middle of eating, Asher started laughing at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sound like you\u2019re really enjoying your food,\u201d he said, watching me take a bite of apple cobbler.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, leaning over to give me a very sweet vanilla apple kiss.</p><p>After dinner, I was sprawled out on top of Asher, him still inside of me his hands running along my back. Our breathing returned to normal and I broached the subject of money. \u201cSince I'm living here now, we should talk about how we\u2019re going to divide the bills for the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine. I take care of you. You use your money to buy clothes or groceries for the house, unless I'm with you. Then, I\u2019ll pay. Also, you\u2019re going to need a new ride soon. That thing you call a car is not safe. There are too many deer around here. If one runs in front of you, your car will be totaled. If I'm lucky, I will just be visiting you in the hospital. If I'm not, I\u2019ll be visiting you at the cemetery. I don\u2019t want that shit, so we need to go to the dealer that I got my jeep from and we can pick you out something.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head from his chest, looking down at him. There were a few things that pissed me off, so I was deciding what pissed me off the most before I opened my mouth. I was sated, I had three orgasms and I was in a chill mood, so I was trying really hard not to flip out.</p><p>I watched his eyes roam over my face. \u201cThis is non-negotiable.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed at his words and my temper flared. \u201cReally? So how I spend money and what car I drive is non-negotiable?\u201d I asked, just to make sure that we were on the same page.</p> <p>\u201cYep, we might as well get all this shit out of the way,\u201d he said, rolling so I was under him. I felt him slide out of me and I couldn\u2019t help the mewl sound that I made at the loss of him. He kissed my nose and bit my bottom lip. The kiss started to get good when I pulled away.</p><p>\u201cWhat shit?\u201d I asked before he had a chance to put me in an Asher fog, where I unknowingly agree to everything he says.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need the money that your grandparents left you. When we have kids, you can put it in a college account for them, but I make enough money to take care of you, me, and any kids we have.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, calming myself before I started to yell at the top of my lungs. \u201cI love you, but you are not paying my way. I have taken care of myself for a long time. We need to come to an agreement that we can both live with,\u201d I said in a tone that was a lot calmer than I felt.</p><p>\u201cWe're starting a life together. If you never got that money, we would still be living the same way we do now. I'm not selling my land or building a new house somewhere else. This was my dream. I knew when I built this house that the woman who I fell in love with would live here with me, and my kids would grow up here on this property. I don\u2019t need more. I have a good car, toys in my garage, and money in the bank. I was planning for you before I even knew who you were. I never wanted to be millionaire. Money does shit to people\u2019s heads. I like your head the way it is. We don\u2019t need it.\u201d Well, he had a good point. Money did mess with people. We were happy and I had never even touched the money from my inheritance. But I knew the money could do some good. I wanted a swimming pool badly. I also wouldn\u2019t mind getting a new car with the money, and maybe a boat. I have always loved the water and have wanted to try skiing. The only thing with that was if I sucked at water skiing, we would be stuck with a boat we didn\u2019t use.</p><p>\u201cI have few requests before I put the money away for our future children,\u201d I said, shaking my head.</p><p>He gave me a crooked smile and kissed my nose again. \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I'm paying for my own car, if I decide to get a new one.\u201d He started to talk, but I covered his mouth with my hand. He narrowed his eyes, but I carried on like I didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cSecond, I would like a swimming pool, and third,\u201d I said loudly before he could cut me off or talk over me. \u201cI would like a boat, but only if it can be returned if I end up not liking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you\u2019re getting a new car whether you want one or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\u2014\u201d I started, but he cut me off with a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cSecond, we can have a pool put in, as long as it\u2019s childproof. And when we have kids, they have to take swimming lessons. And third, I have a boat so you don\u2019t need to think about borrowing someone\u2019s boat to test it out.\u201d</p><p>I squeal, doing a happy dance. \u201dWow, that was easier than I thought,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cBut I want to confirm that I'm paying for my new car when I decide to get one, and the swimming pool when it\u2019s put in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no!\u201d I said, rolling him to his back. I was looking down on him, making sure I had his full attention. \u201cI will pay for that stuff, Asher, or I\u2019ll buy you a gift every week, and I will make sure they are extravagant and expensive. Trust me, you don\u2019t want to test me. I'm thinking along the lines of a unicorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it. This is my land, my house. I pay for the pool. And I hope to God that you know that unicorns aren\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that hurt. \u201cSo, I'm just a guest. I'm not living here with you? I'm not the woman that you plan on having a family with? If that\u2019s the case, let me know so I can pack my stuff. I don\u2019t want to be in the way when the one you plan on sharing your life with shows up. And who knows? Money is power. I'm sure I can convince someone somewhere that unicorns exist, and that they should locate one for me.\u201d</p><p>I watched as his face became hard and his jaw started to tic. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t mean it that way. You\u2019re my woman. I take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I'm your woman, as you put it, then you\u2019re my man. Relationships work both ways. They give and take. It\u2019s called compromise. I need to feel like I'm doing something for you. I won\u2019t be happy thinking that I live here with you for free. You take care of me, make me feel safe, give me a home and unconditional love, and I don\u2019t do anything for you? I won\u2019t live here feeling like I'm not bringing anything to the table. That\u2019s not me. I need to feel like I'm pulling my weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, don\u2019t you see it\u2019s the other way around?\u201d he asks with both his hands holding my face. \u201cAll I have to offer you is stability and love. I have nothing else. If you left me tomorrow, some other guy would be there giving you the same thing I do. You\u2019re beautiful, funny, smart, kind. And the sex, fuck me, sex with you is off the charts. If you left me\u2014Christ!\u201d He closed his eyes, shaking his head. \u201cIf you left me, I would never be able to find another you. Someone who fills my life with the beauty that only you give me.\u201d</p><p>Okay, I couldn\u2019t help it. I started bawling like a giant baby. I laid my head on his chest, wrapping myself around him. Trying to get as close as I could without crawling inside of him. I no longer cared about the pool or the car or anything else to do with money.</p><p>\u201cI feel the same,\u201d I said through a sob. \u201cYou are an amazing man, Asher James Mayson, and you better not ever forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby,\u201d he whispered and I felt his lips at the top of my head. His arms were around me, holding me tightly against him. I was so comfortable that I knew I could easily fall asleep that way. \u201cI only want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d My heart was full. There was no room in it for sadness or anger. I felt happy and loved. Even when I was arguing with him, I felt unconditional love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was in that moment that I decided to do something with the money my grandparents left me. I love the place that I now called home. And I wanted to do something that would benefit others. Something to share the love that I felt. And hopefully give someone else a piece of that love and happiness. I knew that there were people who lived in the area that were struggling. I also knew that they took donations each year for community projects and child outreach programs. I needed to find things to fill my time with. The spring and summer months were his busy seasons. The days were longer, the weather was nicer, and I knew Asher would be working longer hours. He and his team just won the bid on a new development, so they were all excited about that and the amount of money it would bring in. But I knew that come June, he would be a lot busier, so I needed to keep myself occupied.</p><p>The pounding started to get louder, taking me out of my head and bringing me back to reality.</p><p>\u201cI'm coming! I'm coming! Hold your horses!\u201d I shout while I running to the front door. I push Beast out of the way so I could get to the peep hole. When I look out, I see a young guy holding flowers. \u201dWhat the heck?\u201d I mutter to myself. I open the door and the man standing there smiles and holds out a bouquet of roses.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, my eyebrows coming together in question. Asher has given me flowers in the past, but he has never given me roses. He has always brought them home to me. I\u2019ve never received a delivery.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a delivery for November,\u201d the guy says, looking up at me from where his head was bent, reading over the paper in his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I say, and before I can get anything else out, he shoves a clipboard into my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou need to sign where the Xs are.\u201d</p><p>I signed by the two Xs. When I look up, he smiles and takes the clipboard, putting it under his arm. He handed me the flowers then walked off. I set the flowers on the island and look for a card but can\u2019t find one. I know the flowers are from Asher because he is the only person who would send me flowers. I walk back to the bedroom to find my phone.</p><p>Once I have my cell phone, I send Asher a quick text.</p> <p>Me: Thanks for the flowers.</p><p>There is no reply right away, so I set the phone down and jump in the shower. I am blow drying my hair and drinking coffee with I hear my phone signal a message.</p><p>Asher: Didn\u2019t send anything\uf04c</p><p>Me: Oh? Maybe my dad sent them.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl.\u201d He answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad. Um, I was wondering if you sent me flowers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a delivery this morning of roses and Asher didn\u2019t send them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t send anything.\u201d</p><p>My breathing started to pick up and I knew my dad heard it through the phone. \u201cI'm sure they are from someone you know,\u201d he says quietly. I'm not as sure as he is. I feel paranoid, but after the roses that someone left me at my dad\u2019s house, there is always a nagging in the back of my head telling me that something bad is going to happen to me again.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you\u2019re worried. Don\u2019t worry so much. Nothing has happened since the break-in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I'm acting crazy,\u201d I tell him. Flowers are not a big deal.</p><p>\u201cIf you feel unsafe, just tell me and I will be over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad. You\u2019re right. I'm fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, baby girl. I'm going to go to sleep. My phone is on if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad. Love you,\u201d I whisper, feeling like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, baby girl.\u201d He hung up and I called everyone else I knew who might send me flowers. No one did.</p><p>Asher: Was it your dad???</p><p>Me: He said no. I called around and no one else sent them.</p><p>Less than a second later, I get a response.</p><p>Asher: I'm calling Dad now.</p><p>Me: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary.</p><p>Asher: Dad will be there in 5. I'm on my way. Stay inside and lock the door.</p><p>Me: I'm fine. Stop worrying. Its making me freak.</p><p>Asher: Rather you be paranoid.</p><p>I hear the car pull up and I jump off the couch from where me and Beast are cuddling, and run to the front door. I look out the peep hole just as Asher\u2019s dad is getting out of the police cruiser. I open the front door and step out onto the porch, and heard the crinkle of paper under my bare foot. I bend and pick it up. It is a plain card-size envelope. I can feel the weight of the card inside. I start to open it when it is snatched out of my hand.</p><p>I jump and let out a startled yelp. I had been so caught up in the envelope, I forgot about Asher\u2019s dad. \u201cCrap, you scared me,\u201d I say, looking up at Mr. James.</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cI got that when you screamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t scream,\u201d I defended myself. I had become close with all of Asher\u2019s family. His parents had taken me in as one of their own. And his brothers treated me like I was the little sister they had missed out on having. Now they made up for lost time by picking on me and torturing me on a regular basis. Sometimes Asher got annoyed with them, but most of the time, he would join in on the fun of pissing me off.</p><p>Mr. James smiled like he thought I was funny then looked down at the envelope. The smile left his face quickly and his eyes came to me. \u201cI hope you made sure to look out the peep hole before you came outside.\u201d His tone became serious.</p><p>\u201cI made sure,\u201d I mumbled, hoping that this was nothing serious. I didn\u2019t want to start living my life looking over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in and you can show me what you got and tell me about the person who dropped them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to open that?\u201d I ask, pointing at the letter.</p><p>\u201cWhen we get inside.\u201d</p><p>We walk into the house and I close and lock the door behind us as we turn to go into the kitchen. Mr. James is standing at the kitchen island in front of the flowers. I notice that he now has on a pair of gloves. His head is bent and he is looking at the open card.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He holds it up for me to see. On the front of the card was a picture of Manhattan at night. When he opens it, I stumble back and my stomach drops. I am looking at the words written in bright red ink.</p><p>Coming events cast their shadows before</p><p>I had a vision in the summer light\u2014</p><p>Sorrow was in it, and my inward sight</p><p>Ached with sad images. The touch of tears</p><p>Gushed down my cheeks he figured woes of years</p><p>Casting their shadows across sunny hours.</p><p>Oh, there was nothing sorrowful in flowers.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap.\u201d I cover my mouth and run to the hall bathroom to throw up the piece of toast that I had for breakfast and the coffee that I drank. I feel a cool rag on my neck and a hand rubbing my back.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Mr. James asks and I can hear the anger in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, flushing the toilet. I take the rag off my neck and wipe my mouth with it. I look up into his eyes and can tell he is pissed off. I just hope he isn\u2019t mad at me for bringing this kind of trouble to his son\u2019s front door. \u201cI'm so sorry,\u201d I say, putting my face into my hands. I couldn\u2019t figure out why this was happening to me. I felt him pull me in for a hug.</p><p>\u201cWe will figure it out. We won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why someone\u2019s doing this to me,\u201d I cried into his shirt. I hate it more that Asher is dealing with too. If something happened to him because of me, I don\u2019t know what I would do. \u201cCan you give me a minute?\u201d I ask, pulling out of his hug and wiping my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSure, darling.\u201d</p><p>I shut the bathroom door, turn around to the vanity, and look at myself. My eyes are blood shot. I tie my hair up quickly and turn on the cold water then start splashing my face. I need to brush my teeth, but I'm not ready to leave the safety of these four walls. I know once I walk out that door, I'm going to be asked more questions that I don\u2019t have the answers to. I rinse my mouth a few times then jump up on the counter and try to think of anyone who would do this to me. I can\u2019t think of anyone that I wronged or anyone that dislikes me enough to try and kill me, or stalk me to another state and harass me. Then I start to wonder where they have been during the last few months. Nothing has happened since a week before Thanksgiving. Not that I missed them, but why did they go away, and why are they back now?</p><p>\u201cNovember!\u201d Asher bellows from the front door. I hop off the counter and start to open the bathroom door when it is shoved open and hits me in the head.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I cry, my hand going to my forehead where the door hit me.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ! Baby, are you okay?\u201d I didn\u2019t know if I was alright. I knew my head hurt a lot. Who the heck opens a door with that much force? \u201cLet me see,\u201d he says, pulling my hands away from my face. \u201cFuck!\u201d he shouts and I know from the look on his face that I don\u2019t want to see it. I now have a headache on top of all the other crap. \u201cI'm sorry, baby. I'm so fucking sorry.\u201d He looks really upset. Jeez, it hurt, but it wasn\u2019t bleeding. How bad could it be? I turn to the mirror and want to laugh. I have a bright red and purple mark in the center of my forehead. I look like Harry Potter. I start to giggle and Asher\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cThis shit\u2019s not funny. I could have really hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d I snap. \u201cWhat the heck are you? The incredible hulk or something? Seriously, who opens a door to a bathroom like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad pointed out that you were in here. I didn\u2019t even think. I just had to make sure you were okay.\u201d</p><p>Now I feel bad. \u201cSorry, it just hurts,\u201d I say softly, feeling like a total bitch. He always worries. Even when I'm safe, he worries, so now that I'm in danger I might as well handcuff myself to him.</p><p>He kisses the mark. \u201cSo, why were you laughing?\u201d he asks, wrapping me in hug.</p><p>\u201cI was laughing because I look like Harry Potter.\u201d His eyes come back to my face and his lips twitch. I glare at him. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to have to give myself bangs to hide it so I don\u2019t have to listen to your stupid brothers and the jokes they\u2019ll make about it,\u201d I say, pointing to my forehead.</p><p>\u201cThey love you.\u201d They did, I knew they did. We had become great friends. I knew if Asher wasn\u2019t around, I could count on any of them to help me out with whatever was wrong. And they were not perverted, just brotherly. For that, I was thankful. Now Sven, he was a different story. He made me uncomfortable. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because he was handsome, or if it was just him as a person. Sometimes the way he looks at me or the words he uses makes it seem like he is coming onto me. But I saw him in action when me and Asher met him and the guys at the bar. I know that when he comes on to a girl, he doesn\u2019t hold anything back. He is over-the-top aggressive and women still swarm him like a hive to honey. One day, when he meets a girl he\u2019s serious about, she\u2019s going to have to be really strong in order to deal with his personality.</p><p>\u201cI know they love me,\u201d I grumble.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Mr. James asks from outside the door. I step away from Asher and open the door and Mr. James looks down at me. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he asks, looking up at Asher. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I just need to put some ice on it and take some aspirin,\u201d I say, stepping around him.</p><p>\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either because your son is the incredible hulk or he has a thing for Harry Potter,\u201d I say over my shoulder. I laugh when I hear Asher groan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d Asher says, picking me up and setting me on the counter, removing me from where I was standing in front of the fridge. \u201cThe door hit her when I shoved it open to get to her.\u201d I watch him go the drawer and grab a baggie then back to the fridge. He fills it with ice then wraps it in a kitchen towel and brings it to me and presses it to my head.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, honey,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, baby. I'm sorry your day sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He kisses my temple then looks over to his dad, but his eyes stop on the roses that are sitting on the counter.</p><p>\u201cSome guy delivered those?\u201d he asks. I swallow and look at Asher\u2019s dad. He hadn\u2019t told him about the card. Mr. James looked at me then at Asher. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d Asher asks his dad.</p><p>\u201cWhen I pulled up, November came outside and found a card.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Asher asks and I can see his body expanding, muscles bunching under his shirt. Mr. James hands Asher the card that is now inside of a gallon zipper bag. The card is open so you can see the inside and outside of it. Asher looks at the front for the second and sees that it\u2019s a picture of New York then he flips the bag over and I can tell that he\u2019s using all of his control to not rip the thing in half. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d Asher grunts out. He sounds wild and nothing like himself.</p><p>I pull my phone out and Google the words that are written in the card. \u201cThe poet who wrote on my living room wall also wrote this poem,\u201d I tell Asher and Mr. James.</p><p>\u201cWe know the other poem is called November. What is this one called?\u201d Asher asks.</p><p>\u201cAnticipation,\u201d I tell them and get a shiver down my spine when I read them the poem.</p><p>'Coming events cast their shadow before.'</p><p>I had a vision in the summer light\u2014</p> <p>Sorrow was in it, and my inward sight</p><p>Ached with sad images. The touch of tears</p><p>Gushed down my cheeks:\u2014the figured woes of years</p><p>Casting their shadows across sunny hours.</p><p>Oh, there was nothing sorrowful in flowers</p><p>Wooing the glances of an April sun,</p><p>Or apple blossoms opening one by one</p><p>Their crimson bosoms\u2014or the twittered words</p> <p>And warbled sentences of merry birds;\u2014</p><p>Or the small glitter and the humming wings</p><p>Of golden flies and many colored things\u2014</p><p>Oh, these were nothing sad\u2014nor to see Her,</p><p>Sitting beneath the comfortable stir</p><p>Of early leaves\u2014casting the playful grace</p><p>Of moving shadows in so fair a face\u2014</p><p>Nor in her brow serene\u2014nor in the love</p><p>Of her mild eyes drinking the light above</p><p>With a long thirst\u2014nor in her gentle smile\u2014</p><p>Nor in her hand that shone blood-red the while</p><p>She raised it in the sun. All these were dear</p><p>To heart and eye\u2014but an invisible fear</p><p>Shook in the trees and chilled upon the air,</p><p>And if one spot was laughing brightest\u2014there</p><p>My soul most sank and darkened in despair!\u2014</p><p>As if the shadows of a curtained room</p><p>Haunted me in the sun\u2014as if the bloom</p><p>Of early flow'rets had no sweets for me,</p><p>Nor apple blossoms any blush to see\u2014</p><p>As if the hour had brought too bright a day\u2014</p><p>And little birds were all too gay!\u2014too gay!\u2014</p><p>As if the beauty of that Lovely One</p><p>Were all a fable.\u2014Full before the sun</p><p>Stood Death and cast a shadow long before,</p><p>Like a dark pall enshrouding her all o'er,</p><p>Till eyes, and lips, and smiles, were all no more!</p><p>\u201cThat sounds a lot more threatening than the last poem he left,\u201d Asher says, looking at his dad. I look toward Mr. James and notice that his face is blank. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need November to tell me about the delivery and anything that she can remember from when she was attacked in New York. I also need to know if either of you have noticed anyone out of place or someone who made you uncomfortable.\u201d I look from Asher\u2019s dad to him and see that his body is still ready for attack. I lean forward on the counter and grab his shirt at the back and drag him toward me. Once he\u2019s close, I wrap my arms around his middle and lay my head on his back. I feel his hands rest on top of mine then he takes a deep breath and his body relaxes.</p><p>\u201cI need to go out to the car and get my note book. When I come back in, we can talk.\u201d</p><p>Asher turns, facing me and pulls me closer to him. \u201cI'm really sorry about this,\u201d I mumble into his chest, letting his smell relax me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize about this. It isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should lea\u2014\u201d</p><p>The words are not even out of my mouth before he cuts me off. \u201cDon\u2019t even fucking think about leaving me.\u201d His arms go super tight around me like he is expecting me to vanish into thin air. \u201cI will track your ass down and drag you back here. I want you to listen to me.\u201d His hands hold my face, and his lips come closer to mine. \u201cDad is on this. I'm on this and now I'm putting Kenton on this. We will find out what\u2019s going on and who is doing this. And while we\u2019re doing that, you will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would die if something happened to you because of me,\u201d I whisper my biggest fear and then do a face plant into his shirt.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he says, running his hand down my back. \u201cThe worst thing that could happen is if you left me and I had no way of knowing that you were okay. I won\u2019t let anything happen to you and I will make sure that nothing happens to me either. Do you think that I would let something happen to myself, knowing that there are about six guys that I know waiting to take my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re crazy, right?\u201d I ask in all seriousness. Only he would say one of the reasons he was staying safe is so random, non-existing guys don\u2019t try to take me away.</p><p>\u201cNo, I'm selfish. I know what sleeps next to me every night. You are mine, November. Until the day you leave this earth, you are mine. And I take my responsibility very seriously.\u201d What could I say to that? Before I say anything, his dad comes in the front door carrying a notebook and a file.</p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get started,\u201d Mr. James says, setting his stuff down on the island and pulling out the stool to take a seat. Asher kisses my forehead then jumps up next to me on the counter, grabbing my hand.</p><p>I tell them about the delivery then about the attack. Then I remember the roses that had been outside the apartment door when I got home from the hospital. I had never gotten flowers, and my mom would get them all the time from whatever man she was seeing, so I assumed they were for her. I took them into the apartment and left them on the counter. I never even thought about them again until that moment.</p><p>\u201cWhite roses,\u201d I whisper to myself.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Mr. James asks.</p><p>\u201cWhite roses were left outside my apartment door after I was attacked. But I don\u2019t think they were for my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Mr. James asks, and I remember my mom\u2019s shocked face when she opened the card.</p><p>\u201cThe card said, \u2018I'm sorry.\u2019 We both assumed they were from the guy she was seeing, the one that took me to the hospital. That he was sorry for what happened to me. But I remember she seemed shocked by the apology. Like, I don\u2019t know, that he wouldn\u2019t do that, you know? Like he wouldn\u2019t apologize. When I was packing my car later that evening, the same boyfriend who I thought the flowers were from stopped by to drop off Beast. He had kept him while I was in the hospital. He didn\u2019t want him to end up at the shelter. He made me pinky promise him that if I was going to give Beast away, he got first dibs. I remember thinking that he was a really good guy and hoping that it would work out for him and my mom. He hugged me then got in his car and left. I thought that maybe he was busy. I left a few minutes after he did, so I'm not sure what happened with him and my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm gonna need your mom\u2019s number, and the contact information for the detective in New York who was working on your case,\u201d Mr. James says, and I nod my head in agreement.</p><p>\u201cI have a friend who\u2019s been looking into things,\u201d Asher says, and I look over at Asher. I never knew this. We talked about what happened to me, but he never told me anything about someone looking into it.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d I ask, wondering when he had asked someone to look into it.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d That was all he said while pulling me closer so he could kiss my forehead.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cWhen were you going to tell me about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that I should know about things like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know now.\u201d I narrow my eyes and he brings my hand to his mouth, kissing my fingers that are wrapped around his. \u201cNothing has happened in the last few months. We were not even sure if the break in had anything to do with what happened in New York.\u201d That is a good point. We didn\u2019t know anything. I don\u2019t even know why I cared. I was grateful that he was looking into it.</p><p>\u201cHave they come up with anything?\u201d I ask, hoping that some detective was using his skills so I didn\u2019t have to live my days worried about my life being in danger, or worse, having Asher or either of our families in danger.</p><p>\u201cNothing new. They know it was an isolated incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do they have any idea why this is happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think someone is stalking me?\u201d I ask, looking at Asher then his dad.</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure what\u2019s going on. And before I jump to any conclusions, I need to talk to the florist who delivered the flowers and ask about the person who placed the order. Then I need to contact your mother and find out what she remembers from the night of your attack. I also need to contact the officer who was handling your case and see if there are any cases are similar to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsher already found that out. They said it was isolated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they did, but he was talking about the attack. I'm talking about the flowers and the messages,\u201d Mr. James says.</p><p>\u201cSmart.\u201d I smiled at him and he shook his head, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, I want you to be extra cautious when you\u2019re out. I also need you to make a list of people that you have dated. There might be someone who wasn\u2019t ready for your relationship to be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s simple. I dated my ex fianc\u00e9 and Asher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean anyone you went out with, even if it wasn\u2019t serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and it was only my ex and Asher. I never dated in high school. My mother wanted me to work, and if I wasn\u2019t working, I had to be home. I met my ex during my sophomore year of college and I dated him until I caught him with my mother. After I broke it off with him, I needed time and I was never really interested in anyone, so I didn\u2019t date. Before the attack happened, my boss made me sign up for a dating service, so I did that, but I haven\u2019t even checked the activity of that account.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you have the account information?\u201d Asher asks and I can see his jaw tightening.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s in my phonebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you didn\u2019t think about closing the account since we met?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and looked at him, wanting to determine if he was being serious.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even thought about it.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve been keeping me busy,\u201d I shout, throwing my hands in the air. \u201cI'm sorry if I haven\u2019t thought about a dating site that I didn\u2019t even want to be a member of.\u201d</p><p>I hear Mr. James laugh from across the kitchen and I look up at the same time as Asher. Mr. James put his hands in front of him in a stay back gesture and laughs harder. I laugh, and Asher\u2019s eyes come to me.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...no?\u201d My answer sounded like a question, and I start laughing louder.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about laughing at me, baby?\u201d he asks. I see the look in his eyes, so I jump off the counter and start to run to get away from him. Sadly, his legs are longer and his speed faster, so I didn\u2019t have a chance to escape before I was lying on the floor and his big body was pinning me down, tickling me.</p> <p>My head is thrashing back and forth. I am begging him to stop and then Beast comes over, not to help me, but to assist Asher in his torture. He is licking my face while Asher tickles my ribs.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to close the account?\u201d</p><p>He keeps up the tickling. \u201dYES!\u201d I screech my agreement about the dating site. \u201cPlease stop. I'm going to pee.\u201d I was finally able to say a full sentence. He stopped immediately. I jumped up and ran to the bathroom without looking back. When I am walking back toward the kitchen, I hear Asher and his dad talking.</p><p>\u201cI want this shit done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Kenton and ask him to make November a priority. You can always send her to him to keep safe.\u201d Hmm, that\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve been wondering what Kenton did, but every time I ask about it, I get the run around.</p><p>His laugh held no humor. Then he answered, \u201cHe met November at the Christmas party and was getting ready to go in for the Kenton kill when I told him she was mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe would never cross that line and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I know is that I want this shit done.\u201d He growled. \u201cI'm too selfish to send her away. I wouldn\u2019t be able to function knowing she was staying with Kenton.\u201d I heard him take a breath. \u201cIf things escalate, I\u2019ll take her to the cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cousin is a good man. He\u2019s also one of the best at what he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck. You were not there. You didn\u2019t see the way he looked at her. I know Kenton better than anyone. And unless something else happens, she stays here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour jealousy could end up getting her hurt,\u201d His dad whispers and my heart starts beating double time.</p><p>\u201cI would never let anything happen to her. I have my fucking reasons for not trusting anyone with her.\u201d I needed to quit eavesdropping, but it was like I was glued in place. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. The only thing we know is she was attacked in New York. That may not have anything to do with what\u2019s happening here.</p><p>\u201cThe card shows the New York City skyline. I think whoever is doing this knows her from New York. We don\u2019t know if the attack and the things happening here are connected, but since she\u2019s been in Tennessee, she has had two separate instances where she has been left poetry. The thing is messy. We just need to clean it up and put the pieces together. I'm going into town to the florist. I\u2019ll call and let you know if I find out anything from them.</p><p>I could hear the frustration in Asher\u2019s voice. In the meantime, I'm gonna talk to my friend in Jersey and tell him about what happened today.\u201d</p> <p>I walked out of my hiding place in the hall just as Mr. James was opening the front door. He tipped his head in my direction, his eyes soft on me. \u201cI want you to be extra careful.\u201d I could tell that his tone was not that of the sheriff, but as a man who cared about me like a daughter. \u201cIf you\u2019re out, you need to watch who\u2019s around you. If anyone makes you feel even the slightest bit of unease, you go somewhere where there are a lot of people and call me or one of my boys. As I told Asher, this whole situation is a mess. I just need to see if I can dig anything up that will straighten everything out. In the meantime, stay safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for everything.\u201d I walk to him and hug him around the waist. He gives me a one-armed hug, his other arm full with his notebook, his plastic bag with the card inside, and a coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cI'm sure Susan is going to be stopping by soon and will want to see for herself that you\u2019re safe.\u201d He was not wrong. Susan was a momma bear and very protective of her cubs. Since being brought into the family, she has taken me under her care and made it known far and wide that if you messed with me, you would have to deal with her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I murmured. My real mother might not want me, but Susan loves me and she is better than anything I could ever ask for in a mother. Asher\u2019s brothers are always giving me a hard time, telling me I am a suck up. I don\u2019t care. Asher hooks me around my waist, pulling my back to his front.</p><p>\u201cTalk to you soon, Dad,\u201d Asher says, shuffling us to the door as his dad closed it behind him. He locks it and turns me around, his hands framing my face. \u201cYou okay?\u201d I can see the worry in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI'm fine. I just want to know who is doing this and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, baby,\u201d he says, laying his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cIs it me, or is that poem totally creepy?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think it means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, baby,\u201d he said quietly. I wrap my arms tighter around him and hold on. I can tell he hates this more than I do.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I call over my shoulder as I walked out of Temptations.</p><p>\u201cBye, honey,\u201d Liz calls through the open door of her shop. I got up early to meet Liz for coffee and to explain to her about what happened yesterday. She knew I received flowers yesterday because I had called her, and everyone else I knew, to see who sent them. She, like everyone else, said didn\u2019t send anything and asked why. I couldn\u2019t explain the situation to at the time. Plus with each phone call, I got more and more scared and was too freaked out to tell anyone about what happened. Then Mr. James showed up and we found the card. So, I knew it was more than just a nice gesture from a friend.</p><p>After Mr. James left, Asher dragged me into the office, sat me at the desk, got my phone book and had me log onto the online dating site. He dragged me out of the chair, sat down, and pulled me into his lap. I poked around on the website and looked at any communications that I had received from guys. I clicked on my profile and the picture that I had used. I grunted a few times while reading some of the information I posted. We went to the section where people who contacted me left messages. I was surprised by the amount of inquires I received. Some were normal, others disturbing. The normal ones were just, would you like to have dinner with me questions. Others were, would you like to meet to have sex? Those surprised me. I never knew people used the internet for one night stand type of situations.</p><p>Once he was satisfied that no one from the website was stalking me, he canceled my account. I sat quietly in his lap the whole time while he was clicking away on the computer, fighting the laughter that was getting ready to explode out of me. When he was done and the computer was shutting down I turned to look at him. \u201cAll mine.\u201d He grunted and I could no longer hold it in. I started laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a caveman,\u201d I said kissing him.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. I'm so sorry,\u201d I apologized to the person I bumped into.</p><p>The woman mumbled and her body bent to pick up a file. \u201cYou need to watch where you\u2019re going.\u201d I knew that voice. My body froze.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I whisper in complete shock as her head came up. Her hair was different, a little longer. I could see a few wrinkles around her eyes. She probably had to cut back on her Botox treatments now that I wasn\u2019t there to help her with money.</p><p>\u201cNovember,\u201d she said and gave a curt nod, but didn\u2019t say anything else. She was wearing her usual gear. Black, wide leg slacks, a lavender blouse that I knew was real silk, and shiny black dominatrix shoes. Well, that\u2019s what I called them. The heel looked like it could be used as a weapon. I also knew that those shoes had a red bottom.</p><p>One of her ex-boyfriends bought them for her before his wife found out that he was keeping a woman on the side. She told him that if he continued on with the affair, she was going to take him to the cleaners. That was the last gift he gave my mother and the only thing she kept. All the jewelry and expensive handbags he bought for her got pawned. Well, any jewelry or handbags that anyone bought for her went to the pawn shop. She never kept anything except clothing unless it had the tags. Then, she would either get the money back or get a store credit for the item and find something else that she liked more.</p><p>\u201cMom, what are you doing here?\u201d I ask, starting to freak out. I don\u2019t want my dad to see her and I really don\u2019t want my grandmother to see her. I look around to see if there is anyone out that I know, and lucky for me, the streets are quiet.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s good to see you too,\u201d she snaps. Her tone says that it isn\u2019t good to see me too.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I'm just surprised. I mean, I tried to call you and you haven\u2019t returned any of my phone calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou abandoned me for your father. He wanted nothing to do with you and you still left me for him.\u201d Great, now how do I deal with this? My dad didn\u2019t abandon me. My mother kept me from him, but I really don\u2019t want to get into an argument with her in the middle of the town square. Word travels fast in this town and I don\u2019t want my family to know that she had even been in the city.</p><p>\u201cMom, please. I didn\u2019t abandon you. You know what happened to me. I couldn\u2019t stay in New York anymore.\u201d</p><p>I watch her roll her eyes, completely disregarding my attack. \u201cThat kind of thing happens every day in the city, November. Don\u2019t be such a drama queen.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. I want to scream in her face. I know that bad things happened in the city. I lived there my whole life. I watched the news, and read the paper. But it didn\u2019t happen to someone else. It happened to me, her daughter, someone that she was supposed to love and look after. \u201cMom, I could have died. I could have been raped. You heard what the police said. And trust me, I know that bad things happen, but I didn\u2019t feel safe there anymore.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question. Why are you in town? Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and presses her lips into a flat line before answering me. \u201cEverything is fine. I had to see the lawyer in town for something that doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d I am kind of curious about her meeting with the lawyer, but I\u2019m not going to ask her about it. I want her to leave before anyone sees her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take a breath, hoping that the answer to my next question is a big no. \u201cAre you in town for long?\u201d</p><p>She looks around and scrunches up her face in disgust. \u201cNo, it was a one day trip. My flight leaves in a few hours.\u201d Well, thank God for small favors.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d That was all I could say. I wasn\u2019t sad that she was leaving.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you fit in here with these people,\u201d she says, looking down her nose at me. The words \u201cthese people\u201d was said like they were, in fact, not people at all, but a secret alien race trying to take over the world. She takes a step away from me, pulling her bag closer to her body like I\u2019m planning on ripping it out of her hands and taking off down the street with it. I almost laugh. I look down at what I am wearing and I do fit in here. I have on a pair of dark jeans and long sleeve black shirt with a puffy pink vest over it. And on my feet, I have a pair of plain black boots. I look normal. Not New York upper west side normal, but Tennessee normal.</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smile.</p><p>She huffs out a breath then looks around. Obviously, I didn\u2019t give her the response she wants. \u201cI need to go,\u201d she says and I feel tears sting my nose. Stupid, I know, but she is the only mother I have and I hate that we aren\u2019t close. For my whole life, I wished for her to act like she cared about me. It killed me each time she proved that she never would.</p><p>\u201cOkay, have a safe fight,\u201d I mumble, realizing that I\u2019m not a kid anymore. I don\u2019t have to explain to people why my mother was never around like all the other kid\u2019s moms. Realizing that I have family and friends here, people who love me, gives me strength. She has no part in my life. I don\u2019t need her. With that thought in my head, I walk around her, down the sidewalk to my car, get in and call Asher.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. I'm in the middle of something. Can I call you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Uh...um...that\u2019s not necessary. I just wanted to tell you I love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay? You sound freaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm great, actually. Really, really great,\u201d I tell him truthfully. I know happiness because of him, his family, and mine.</p><p>He is quiet and I hear him take a breath. \u201cLove you too, baby.\u201d His voice sounds gruff.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I whisper, closing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he whispers back. He is quiet a minute then he tells me, \u201cI\u2019ll see you at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper again.</p> <p>\u201cLater.\u201d He chuckled and that made me giggle.</p><p>\u201cYeah, later.\u201d I hang up before I am an even bigger dork. I look in my rearview mirror and see my smile. I am going home. Home. To a home I have with Asher and Beast. I put my car in reverse and drive.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whine to Asher, who is behind me in bed. It\u2019s Saturday and he\u2019s been trying to get me up for the past hour. I'm ready to strangle him.</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d He laughs, shoving his face in my neck.</p><p>\u201cAsher, I'm telling you right now, if you don\u2019t leave me alone, I'm going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very nice.\u201d He chuckles.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Go away. Geez, you have three brothers and a boat load of friends. Can\u2019t you find someone else to bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not going to ask one of them to shower with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I yell. \u201cGo away. I'm sleeping.\u201d I shove my head under my pillow, trying to block him out.</p><p>\u201cYou sound awake to me.\u201d I hear his muffled reply and I can tell he\u2019s smiling just by the tone of his voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d I roll over and straddle him. His face lights up and he smiles. I smile back then grab my pillow and hold it over his big, stupid face. His hands run up my sides and start tickling me. When I finally call mercy, we\u2019re both breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cNow, are you going to shower with me?\u201d he asks, his eyes shining with laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou are seriously relentless, you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like showering with you.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>I shake my head and start laughing. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You like getting off in the shower.\u201d</p><p>His face goes serious and I hold my breath. \u201cNo!\u201d His voice is a low. \u201cI like taking care of you. I can fuck you anytime. I'm not always able to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>I feel my face go soft. I swallow against the lump in my throat then lift my head, pressing my mouth to his. \u201cLet\u2019s go shower,\u201d I whisper against his lips.</p><p>He carries me to the bathroom and takes his time taking care of me. Then, I take care of him. It\u2019s beautiful.</p><p>Standing at the kitchen counter, I watch Beast eat while I finish my coffee. Asher walks around the corner wearing his overwashed jeans that hang low on his hips, no socks, and the T-shirt he\u2019s going to put on is in his hand. My mouth goes dry. I squeeze my hand into a fist at my side to avoid reaching out and running it down his chest and abs. He shakes his head and I know he knows what I'm thinking. It is really unfair. No one should have that much power over another person.</p><p>Once he reaches me, he bends over and kisses me softly. Then, he kisses my nose and grabs a mug from behind me to make himself a cup of coffee while crowding me against the counter. His jaw has a few days of stubble that makes his face look more rugged, and something about that look makes my tummy melt. I can\u2019t help myself, so I run my fingers from his hair, down the side of his face, feeling it prickle against my fingers. I remember how it feels when it rubs between my thighs. I squeeze my legs together and drop my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d I nod my head, but don\u2019t say anything. I'm happy, more than happy. Some days, I wake up and wonder how I spent the first twenty-five years of my life. I had no clue what real happiness was. Or maybe that was happiness, and now I'm living in bliss. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re really in your head. What\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks, taking a bite of a bagel.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I grin. \u201cSo, what are we doing today? Can we go riding?\u201d I ask excitedly.</p><p>\u201cNo, someone\u2019s coming over in an hour,\u201d he says, wiping his mouth.</p><p>\u201cO...kay,\u201d I say slowly, waiting for him to tell me who is coming over. He doesn\u2019t say anything, just smiles. \u201cSo, who is it?\u201d I ask after he still doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not going to tell me who it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he says, putting his cup and plate into the sink without rinsing it. He starts to walk away, so I clear my throat to get his attention. When he looks at me, I nod my head in the direction of the sink and he raises his eyebrows. So, I nod my head in the direction of the sink again. \u201cDo you have a tic, baby?\u201d he asks, his mouth twitching.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cI'm not your maid, Asher.\u201d He straight out smiles, giving me the dimple, then walks to the sink, takes his plate and cup out, still without rinsing them, and places them in the dishwasher. \u201cYou have to rinse it before you put it in the dishwasher,\u201d I tell him, feeling and sounding like a total nag.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dishwasher,\u201d he says slowly, walking towards me.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2014\u201d Before I can get the words out, his mouth is on mine. The kiss is deep, wet, and so yummy, that when he pulls his mouth away, my hands are wrapped around his neck and my legs are around his hips. I'm in an Asher fog so deep that he could tell me that it\u2019s not a dishwasher, but a microwave, and I would agree with him completely.</p><p>My eyes flutter open. He\u2019s looking down at me with a cocky smile and mumbles, \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d Then, he squeezes my ass in his hands, sets me on the counter and leaves the kitchen, putting on his shirt as he goes.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d I whisper. Beast looks at me, grunts, then walks to his dog bed and lays down, completely disappointed in my lack of willpower. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d I mumble to my dog. He lets out a breath and shuts his eyes, completely dismissing me. \u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d I say, still mumbling. I hop off the counter, take Asher\u2019s dishes from the dishwasher, rinse off the cream cheese so it doesn\u2019t harden onto the plate, rinse out the cup then place them both back in the dishwasher. The whole time, I'm smiling.</p><p>I go to the bedroom to get dressed. I pull on a pair of leggings and choose a loose, off-the-shoulder cream shirt, and throw a black open front, oversized sweater on over it. I know Asher says he loves my body, but I need to stop eating everything that is placed in front of me before I need a whole new wardrobe.</p><p>Yesterday, I had to lie down to button my jeans, and let\u2019s just say walking around all day and having my toes tingle from lack of circulation is a hazard to myself and those around me. I flop down on the bed, exhausted from getting dressed. I'm so tired that I feel like I could sleep for the next week. I close my eyes just to give them a rest. I feel a feather light touch run down my cheek. My eyes open slowly and I see Asher\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cTime to get up, sleepy head. Our guest is here.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and stretch. \u201cOkay, who is it?\u201d I grumble, thinking that this guest better be awesome enough for my sleep interruption.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d He smiles and pulls me out of bed. He tucks me under his arm and walks us out to the living room where there is a guy about Asher\u2019s age. He\u2019s wearing jeans and a black shirt with the words, Crystal Clear Pools and Spas written in white on the breast of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I screech and start jumping up and down. My tiredness is a long forgotten memory. The guy takes a step back and looks nervously to Asher for help.</p><p>Asher starts laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t mind her, Jack. She does this when she gets excited.\u201d I look at him and I can see he\u2019s thinking about when he told me he was taking me four-wheeling. I bite my lip when I see his eyes turn hungry.</p><p>Jack clears his throat. \u201cNice to meet you, November.\u201d He sticks out his hand and I place mine in his.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Jack,\u201d I say then take a step back. \u201cSorry about scaring you. I\u2019m just so excited,\u201d I mumble, slightly embarrassed by my outburst.</p><p>Asher pulls me back into him and his arms wrap around me, his chin resting on top of my head. I feel his body shaking with silent laughter behind me. \u201cI think he got that, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I say quietly, wondering if it would be rude to elbow him in his ribs in front of a guest. I give Jack a big smile after I see him shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you guys know the type of set up you want?\u201d Jack asks, looking between us.</p><p>\u201cUm, it has to be childproof,\u201d I say, remembering Asher\u2019s pool requirement.</p><p>Jacks eyebrows shoot up. \u201cYou havin\u2019 a baby, man?\u201d he asks and I wonder if it\u2019s normal in Tennessee to ask a stranger that you\u2019re going to be working for such a personal question. In New York, that question would surely get you fired, maybe even shot.</p><p>Asher must feel me go still, because he starts talking. \u201cMe and Jack have been friends since high school, baby. He used to spend every summer break with my family up at the cabin. Now he owns the pool and spa company with his old man and does jobs for us when we have a client who wants a pool put in on their property.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod my head, thinking someone should shoot me. Asher\u2019s friend, and not some stranger, saw me jumping up and down being a dork.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you havin\u2019 a baby?\u201d Jack asks again.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Asher says, squeezing me. I don\u2019t know if his words or the lack of oxygen is responsible for the dizziness I'm feeling.</p><p>Jack nods his head. \u201cAlright, so the only request you have is child safety?\u201d he asks, looking at me.</p> <p>\u201cUm...\u201d I know nothing about pools except how to swim in one. This isn\u2019t as fun as I thought it would be.</p><p>\u201cYou want a Jacuzzi, a grotto, a deep end?\u201d he asks, looking at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I repeat, feeling like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cYou got any books or pictures of work you\u2019ve done that we can look at for ideas?\u201d Asher asks and I'm thankful that he\u2019s smart. I sag into him with relief and he kisses the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course. Let\u2019s go to the table.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d I ask as we make our way into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cCoffee would be good, if you got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I pour him a cup of coffee and get one for me and Asher as well. I set out sugar and cream on the counter then take a seat between Asher and Jack.</p><p>\u201cSo these are some of the pool designs we did last year.\u201d He pulls out three pictures. The first one looks like a tropical paradise. It has tons of flowers and plants around it. The pool was bright blue with sand color cement surrounding it. The second is a plain, bean shaped pool with an area for chairs and a table. The third is large and has two areas for sunbathing. It had a Jacuzzi that you could get to from inside the pool by walking up a set of stairs, or you could get to it from outside the pool area. It also had a shallow end that you could lay in and the water would only be about five inches deep. If you had kids, you could stay with them in that area.</p><p>\u201cI love this.\u201d I point to the third picture.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d Asher says, indicating at the first picture.</p> <p>\u201cWell, we can incorporate what you both like into your pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cSo, when can you start?\u201d Asher asks, and I turn my head so fast that I'm surprised it doesn\u2019t fly across the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think we should discuss price?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh yeah,\u201d I say in a duh tone.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re getting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the pool, babe, but I also like diamonds. I still wouldn\u2019t buy one without knowing the price,\u201d I say quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI would,\u201d Asher says with a completely straight face, causing me to do a double take.</p><p>\u201cI guarantee the price is competitive,\u201d Jack cuts in. \u201cAnd you\u2019re getting the family discount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...oh.\u201d It\u2019s all I can say.</p><p>\u201cSo, when can you start?\u201d Asher asks again and I shake my head. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s normal to make this kind of decision in less than twenty minutes. The prices of pool installations that I saw in my research online were twenty thousand or more. That seems like a lot of money to spend in just by looking at three pictures.</p><p>\u201cIt should take a week or so to get the permit then we can break ground. After we start to dig, it should take about six to eight weeks to finish. You guys should be swimming by the time the weather really changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s so fast,\u201d I say, smiling at Jack. He smiles and shakes his head, looking over my shoulder at Asher.</p><p>\u201cYou get it?\u201d Jack says, looking at Asher. I look at Asher, wondering what the heck he\u2019s talking about. He pulls me close and kisses my temple.</p><p>\u201cAlright, man. Send me the blueprints,\u201d Asher says, standing. \u201cLet me know when you get the permit and are gonna break ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later this week,\u201d Jack says, putting all of his stuff back in his folder.</p><p>\u201cNext weekend is Gran\u2019s birthday. Everyone will be expecting you.\u201d Asher changes the subject and reminds Jack of the upcoming celebration.</p><p>\u201cI'm driving to Atlanta with Meg this week, but we should be back in time for the party unless her family convinces her to stick around through the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack asks, shoving his folder under his arm and walking towards the front door.</p><p>\u201cBring Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring Meg?\u201d Jack repeats.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why not?\u201d Asher shrugs like it\u2019s no big deal.</p><p>\u201cYou hate Meg,\u201d Jack says, looking at me. I shrug. I have no idea who Meg is or what her history is.</p><p>\u201cNo, I hated that Meg was a friend and she believed the bullshit that bitch fed her about having my child. Then, I was pissed that she confronted me in front of people in town about abandoning Joan after I knocked her up without ever asking me about it first. To top it off, she told Joan where I lived, so when I got home from a public blow out with Meg in town, I got to deal with Joan sitting on my front porch waiting for me.\u201d Wow, I didn\u2019t like Meg very much right now either. How could you claim that someone is your friend then believe a stranger over them?</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re tellin\u2019 me you\u2019re over that shit?\u201d Jack asks, looking like he understands why Asher was mad. I think anyone would understand why Asher was mad.</p><p>\u201cNo, I'm tellin\u2019 you that I know it\u2019s not easy to choose sides, and that I'm willing to work on my relationship with Meg so you don\u2019t have to choose.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked relieved. I could understand that. I'm sure it\u2019s not easy loving two people who don\u2019t get along. \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll be there for the party,\u201d he says, opening the front door. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d I say as the door closes behind him.</p><p>Once Asher locks the door, I yell, \u201cWe\u2019re getting a pool!\u201d And I launch myself at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I'm getting summers full of you in nothing but a bikini,\u201d he says, giving me the dimple.</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d I scrunch up my nose. \u201cI have never worn a bikini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not getting in the pool without one.\u201d He looks at the ceiling, smiles then looks back down at me. \u201cI will make an exception for you if you\u2019re in your birthday suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, you will,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cHow generous of you.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d I screech from my now upside down position.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to make sure your birthday suit still fits, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I smile as he carries me to the bedroom and shows me his birthday suit. Let\u2019s just say that his fits him perfectly. I didn\u2019t ask how mine fit, but I did note that he wasn\u2019t complaining.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it. I looked at the calendar again, thinking that something had to be seriously wrong. But every time I counted, I came up with the same thing. I was not only late, I was L-A-T-E, as in three months of no period. I knew that my pants were fitting tighter, but I had also been eating like a pig. Now I knew the reason why I had been eating like a pig and the reason for my tightening clothes. If I was correct, I was three months pregnant.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I whispered into the top of the desk where my head had landed with a loud thud. I was on the shot. I had been on the shot since I was sixteen and my mother forced me to get on birth control. She quickly found out I wasn\u2019t very responsible with taking the pill, so she made my nanny take me to the hospital where they offered me different forms of birth control. I chose the shot only because I never had to think of it again after I got it. Obviously, I didn\u2019t think about anything. I didn\u2019t think about the fact that I hadn\u2019t had a period in three months. I didn\u2019t think about my clothes becoming tighter. I didn\u2019t think about feeling tired. I thought about nothing. If I hadn\u2019t been planning on getting my shot prescription refilled, I wouldn\u2019t of thought about the fact that I hadn\u2019t had my period. I would have ended up on that show where the girl says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was pregnant until I felt the baby coming out of my vagina.\u201d No woman wants to think that she\u2019s so out of tune with her body that she doesn\u2019t realize that another human is growing inside of it. I started to laugh, and then a sob came out.</p><p>What was Asher going to think? Seriously, we had only been together for a few months. I needed to buy a test. I needed proof. I let my head thud on the desk a few more times, hoping that it would put my brain cells back in order. I called Asher and told him that I was leaving the club, got in my car, and began the mission of getting proof.</p><p>I called Liz to go with me to Target. Her job was to provide a distraction if we came across anyone that we knew while in the store. Lord knows, if anyone from town saw me buying a pregnancy test, they would assume that I had gotten knocked up on purpose and rumors would run rampant.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re late?\u201d Liz asks, looking over at me.</p><p>\u201cLate is an understatement,\u201d I tell her as we walk down the aisle of the store. It\u2019s ironic that tampons and pregnancy tests are located in the same section.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you going to do if it\u2019s positive?\u201d She holds up a box, reading the back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know he loves you so I'm sure everything will be okay.\u201d She gives me a reassuring smile. I smile back and pick out a test. I thought about putting it in my purse until we reached check out, but I really didn\u2019t want to get arrested for shoplifting, so I put it under my arm, trying to hide it. Going towards the front of the store, my worst fear is realized. Trevor walks around the corner.</p><p>\u201cHey, sis,\u201d he says, trying to give me a hug, but the test is still under my arm and I don\u2019t want it to fall out, so I half pat his back. \u201cLiz,\u201d he says, smiling, and I watch her face turn pink.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask, looking around, trying to come up with a plan to abort the mission.</p><p>\u201cI came with Cash. He\u2019s picking up a cable for his TV.\u201d He looks between me and Liz. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asks and I look at Liz, hoping that she would think of something since my mind has gone blank.</p><p>\u201cTampons,\u201d Liz blurts, and I notice a few people stop and look at us as she covers her mouth. Trevor seems taken aback for a second then he laughs, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you guys get back to that.\u201d He bends over, kissing my cheek, then reached over and tugs a piece of Liz\u2019s hair. Without another look, he turns around and walks away.</p><p>\u201cTampons,\u201d I hear Liz whisper to herself. I start giggling. \u201cYou owe me huge for this,\u201d she says, groaning. After Trevor is out of sight, I run to check out with Liz following behind me.</p><p>\u201cYou guard the door while I take the test,\u201d I tell Liz walking into the small stall.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you need me,\u201d she says from the other side.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I whispered. There it is. The proof I wanted is right there in black and white. Okay, white and pink, but it is there in my face, proving that I'm an idiot. I\u2019ve taken four tests, all different brands, so I know they couldn\u2019t all be wrong. When I bought the first one and it came out with a giant plus sign, I left the stall that I had been holding up in. With Liz following behind me, we went and bought water from the coffee shop and a few more tests. Now all the tests have been taken and they all say the same thing. I had my proof. I shove the boxes and all except one of the tests into the little garbage can that hangs on the wall in the bathroom stall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant!\u201d Liz squealed with excitement. I want to be happy, but I\u2019m afraid about Asher\u2019s reaction. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a girl. They always have so many cute girl things. So, what now?\u201d she asks, looking at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI...um, need to make a doctor\u2019s appointment. I need to have them confirm it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm pretty sure that the four tests you\u2019ve taken confirm it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I mean, I need them to tell me that everything is okay, and that I haven\u2019t harmed the baby over the last few months.\u201d</p><p>Liz must have read the look on my face because she pulled me into a hug. \u201cHey, everything is going to work out,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>We decided to wander around Target. I needed time to think. I needed to figure out what the heck I was going to say to Asher. There was no way I could keep this from him. I didn\u2019t want to keep this from him. I wanted his support. I needed him to tell me everything was going to be okay.</p><p>By the time we got to check out, the cart was overflowing. I knew how I was going to tell Asher that I was pregnant. Even if we didn\u2019t plan this, I wanted it to be special. I also bought a few pairs of pregnancy pants with the stretchy material at the waist. My jeans were becoming so tight that I had to lie down to button them. I had been avoiding buying a bigger size. I didn\u2019t want to admit to gaining weight. Now I knew I had to wear something bigger. It couldn\u2019t be healthy for the baby to be squashed inside of me like that. Liz and I walked around the baby aisles looking at clothes, bedding, and toys. There were so many cute things and Liz\u2019s excitement started to rub off on me.</p><p>I was sitting at the island in the kitchen when I heard Asher\u2019s jeep pull up. I had been trying to read, but my mind was so busy going over all the outcomes of the news I was getting ready to announce, that I ended up reading the same page about five times already. The minute that Asher walked through the door, I wanted to throw up. That had never happened before. Normally when he walked through the door, I wanted throw myself at him. My stomach was in knots, and I was having difficult time breathing.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d he said as he walked to me, kissing my forehead. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, and I started to tell him, but then I smelled nothing but the paint that was splattered on his clothes. I ran to the bathroom. Apparently, the baby didn\u2019t like that smell. My hair was lifted out of my face and off my neck and then a cold cloth was laid there. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, even though I didn\u2019t feel better. My nerves were shot. \u201cCome shower with me.\u201d He didn\u2019t give me a choice. He picked me up, my head laying on his shoulder and my arms going around his neck. He sat me on the vanity in our bathroom then started the shower. I hopped off the counter and started brushing my teeth, watching him in the mirror as he got undressed. I knew I needed to do this now before I completely chickened out, or ended up in an Asher fog where I would forget everything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I told him and took off out of the bathroom before he could stop me. I went to the kitchen and picked up the box that I had wrapped. I shoved the test that was in my purse in the back pocket of my jeans. Once I was back in the bathroom, he only had on his boxers and was standing in front of the mirror, so I hopped back up on the vanity and handed him the box.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, looking at the box that was wrapped in yellow paper.</p><p>\u201cJust open it,\u201d I said with my stomach in my throat.</p><p>He unwrapped it then set it down on the counter to open the lid. I watched his eyebrows come together in confusion. Unless he remembered the conversation we had about kids, he wouldn\u2019t know why there was a box of Trojan condoms and a little kid\u2019s pink gun in the box. He stared into the box for what seemed like an eternity then his head came up and his eyes looked wet.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean what I think it means?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head. He swallowed and shook his head. I leaned forward, taking the test out of my back pocket and handing it to him. His hand came up, his fingers wrapping around it. His head bent and there was no way for him to misinterpret the words pregnant that were on the screen of the test. \u201cFuck me,\u201d he whispered and I couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking. His eyes were still locked on the test in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d I whispered after he still didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI'm on birth control. I don\u2019t even know how this happened.\u201d I watched him drop the test into the box and close the lid. I was becoming more nervous. He didn\u2019t look at me. He hadn\u2019t said anything. He picked up the box and left the bathroom. I knew it was too soon. I knew it. I knew it. Oh God, what was I going to do? I put my head in my hands and tried to control the tears that I knew were coming. We needed to talk about this. Then, I needed to figure out what to do with myself.</p><p>Abortion was out of the question, and I couldn\u2019t live my life knowing that my child was out in the world being taken care of by someone else. It had to be okay. We had to be okay. The thought of being without him made me sick. I needed to pull up my big girl panties and talk to him about this. I pulled my head away from my hands and started to get off the counter to go track him down. I was starting to get pissed. He married someone he didn\u2019t love because she said she was pregnant with his child. He told her that it would be okay. He was supposed to love me. He needed to tell me right now that it would be okay, or I was going to walk away, regardless of how broken my heart would be.</p><p>I jumped back when Asher walked back into the bathroom. His hands went to my shirt and then it was gone. I was so surprised that I couldn\u2019t form words. Then, my jeans were coming down and I was standing in my bra and panties.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d I whispered, not knowing what the hell was going on with him. His face was blank, his eyes determined. Then, my panties were gone along with my bra. I was sitting back on the vanity before I even had time to think. \u201cWhat the heck are you doing?\u201d I pushed at his chest. He grabbed my hand, holding it between us.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you need to stop. We need to talk about this.\u201d My voice was getting louder. I tried to shove him again. He didn\u2019t move. My heart was racing, my breathing escalated. I noticed that he wasn\u2019t even looking at me. His eyes were on my hand that he was holding. I looked down and my breath caught in my throat. On my left ring finger was a beautiful diamond ring. The center stone was round and surrounded by tons of smaller diamonds that traveled down and around the band. My hand flexed in his and he finally looked at me.</p><p>His voice was gruff when he spoke. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to see you wearing nothing but my ring since I bought it for you. Knowing that, like the ring I put on your finger, I'm the only one. The only one who will ever see you in nothing but my ring. The only one who will wake up to your beautiful face every day for the rest of my life. The only one who will make love to you. The only one who will make babies with you.\u201d I watched his eyes get wet. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how happy I am that you are carrying my child.\u201d</p><p>His face came closer to mine. \u201cI know that it\u2019s fast, but this is right. We are right. You are the only one for me.\u201d He kissed me deeply. When he pulled away, he laid his forehead against mine. \u201cTell me that you\u2019ll marry me,\u201d he whispered against my mouth.</p> <p>Tears started to fall from my eyes. I couldn\u2019t ask for a more perfect proposal. \u201cYes.\u201d I shoved my face into his throat, wrapping myself around him. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d He picked me up, carrying me into the shower. He put me under the spray, taking his time to wash my hair. Then, he took his time washing me from head to toe, paying special attention to where his child was now growing. I helped him wash, and then we got out. He wrapped me in a towel and tied one around his waist. He picked me up again, carrying me to the bed where he sat me on the edge, my feet hanging over the side. He dropped to his knees in front of me. He opened my towel, his fingers traveling down the sides of my breast along my ribs down to my waist. His fingers resting on my sides, his thumbs moving over my lower stomach. His eyes met mine and the look of pure love that I saw shining made me hold my breath.</p><p>\u201cIt amazing,\u201d he whispered, \u201cto know that my purpose in life is sitting in front of me.\u201d His hands moved to hold my face. Holy crap, I can\u2019t believe that he just said that. Before I could even tell him I loved him, his lips touched mine, traveled along my jaw and down my neck.</p><p>My hands go to his head and mine falls back. His hands are along my sides, to my thighs first up, then down. Heat was pooling between my thighs with every touch. I whimpered when his mouth found my nipple and he gave it a firm tug. Then he sucked deep. My back arched and I moaned loudly. His hands traveled up my inner thighs, his fingers finding my center. \u201cSoaked.\u201d His fingers moving through the wetness he was creating, passing over my clit. I felt the heat building, but it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>\u201cAsher.\u201d I whimpered. His mouth left my breast and he pulled my face to his. He sucked my bottom lip into his mouth, dragging it through his teeth. My mouth opened under his. His fingers were still slowly sliding through my wetness. Two fingers were filling me. My head flew back and my nails dug into his scalp.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His fingers were suddenly gone. My head came up and I watched as he pulled my other nipple into his mouth, bit down, and then dragged it through his teeth the same way he did my lip. He kissed the tip of my nipple. Then, his fingers were again moving through the wetness. I knew I was drenched. He licked down my stomach around my navel. Finally, I could feel his breath against my clit. I spread my legs wider, not caring that I was becoming desperate.</p><p>\u201cAsher.\u201d I moaned as I watched his tongue licking me from bottom to top then circling my clit. I was on the edge. I knew that once his mouth focused on that one spot, I was going to explode.</p><p>\u201cJesus, is it possible that you taste sweeter?\u201d He groaned, licking me again and circling my clit. Then, he filled me again with two fingers at the same time. He latched onto my clit. My whole body came off the bed with the force of my orgasm. I could feel the walls of my pussy contracting, sucking his fingers deeper as he sucked my clit. I saw stars. My thighs tightened around his shoulders. My hands were holding onto his head. He kissed my inner thigh, above my pubic bone, along my stomach, up to each breast. His hands moved under my arms, pulling me deeper onto the bed. One of my legs was straight, the other bent, resting on the back of his thigh. My hands went to his jaw. His hand wrapped around his cock and he filled me.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I moaned, loving the sensation of him filling me. I opened my eyes to see his were closed tight. I circled my hips and his eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d His voice was firm. He grabbed my hips, stopping my movement. He kissed me softly and pulled out just an inch and slid back in. I bit my lip to keep myself still. His hands moved to my thighs spreading my legs wider. He pulled out so just the tip was still in, and slammed in so hard that my breath hitched. Then, he slid out and started a slow pace while kissing me. His hands were pinching my nipples then traveling down, pressing against my clit. My hands were traveling up his back, my mouth and tongue kissing and licking whatever I could reach. Then I felt it start. It was slow and deep and I knew that I couldn\u2019t hold back. My mouth found his and I held his face close to mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I moaned against his mouth. My thighs wrapped tighter around him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop.\u201d He didn\u2019t. His pace increased, his strokes deeper, and I felt him grow. I knew he was close too.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, baby.\u201d He grunted, one hand fisting into my hair while his other was traveling between us, pinching my clit and setting me off. My whole body tightened around him, pulling him deeper inside of me. I moaned into his mouth as he groaned into mine. I could feel his strokes start to slow and turn lazy. He kissed me all over my face and down my neck. \u201cI get this for a lifetime,\u201d he whispered into the skin below my ear.</p><p>I tightened my arms and legs around him. \u201cLove you, babe,\u201d I whisper against his shoulder. He rolls to the side, taking me with him.</p><p>\u201cLove you, baby,\u201d he says against my hair. Closing my eyes, I cuddle deeper into his chest and fall asleep. My stomach growls so loud that it wakes me from my doze. I can feel Asher\u2019s silent laughter against my cheek. \u201cSounds like both my babies are hungry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I mumble. I know I need to eat, but seeing the expanse of his chest in front of me, I can\u2019t help but want something else that has nothing to do with food.</p><p>I'm rolled to my back and Asher is hovering over me. His eyes are watching his hand travel down my throat between my breasts. \u201cI'm excited for these to get bigger,\u201d he says, palming both my breasts.</p><p>He smiles up at me and I shake my head and giggle. Then, his hand starts to move again and he stops gently on my stomach, which has become slightly rounder over the last few months.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to be a dad.\u201d He shakes his head in disbelief. His eyes focus on his hands as he gently rubs my belly. Then, he kisses me right below my navel. His eyes meet mine and I see nothing but the same happiness I feel reflecting back at me. The mood is completely broken when my stomach gives another loud growl. We both start laughing.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Daddy\u2019s going to feed you,\u201d he says into my stomach. We get out of bed and I pull on one of his shirts and a pair of panties. He pulls on a pair of baggy sweats that hang low and give the most amazing view of his abs. I hear him clear his throat. I look up and he\u2019s smiling.</p> <p>\u201cI'm going to waddle and you\u2019re going to walk around looking like that?\u201d My hand moves up and down, indicating everything that is him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re carrying the life we made together inside of you. Your body growing to take care of our child is amazing. I can\u2019t wait to see you with a big belly,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cI mean, you already know that, but I'm glad that you\u2019re happy about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy is not the word I would use to describe how I feel, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whisper. \u201cThis is bliss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, walking towards me. \u201cThis is bliss.\u201d His hands frame my face and he softly kisses my nose then my lips.</p> <p>I wake up feeling the sun warm the skin of my back. Last night, after Asher fed me a toasted peanut butter and jelly sandwich, we lay in bed and talked about the sex of the baby. I said I wanted a girl. Asher was still stuck on having a boy first. Really, I don\u2019t care what I have as long as he or she is healthy. I smile into my pillow, thinking about the ring on my finger, the child growing inside of me, and the man who put both of them there. I pull my hand out from under my pillow and hold it up in front of my face, watching the light reflect off the gems. The diamonds are shining so bright that I could go blind by looking at them.</p><p>\u201cYou awake, baby?\u201d I scream and almost fall out of bed from flipping over at the sound of his voice. \u201cJesus, what the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scared the crap out of me.\u201d I say, holding the sheet to my chest. \u201cI thought you were working today?\u201d I look at the clock and see that it\u2019s ten thirty.</p><p>\u201cTook the day off so we could go to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor?\u201d I ask, confused.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant and need to get checked out. Your appointment is at one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...yeah, of course.\u201d Yikes, I knew I needed to go to the doctor, but hadn\u2019t even thought about calling to set up an appointment. \u201cYou just beat me to it,\u201d I say, playing it off and grabbing the shirt at the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cCome to the kitchen. I made you some tea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTea?\u201d I ask in disgust. I'm sure my face shows how revolted I am at the idea of tea. \u201cI only drink tea if I'm sick,\u201d I say, shaking my head at him.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. I took four tests yesterday to prove it,\u201d I snap. First, he offers me tea then he reminds me that I'm pregnant. Seriously?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t drink coffee when you\u2019re pregnant,\u201d he says softly, and I realize that I just sounded like a total bitch. It must be the hormones.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Asher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he starts laughing, \u201cit\u2019s the truth. No coffee when you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a rule? Where did you see this?\u201d I ask, starting to panic. This can\u2019t be true. What was I going to do if I couldn\u2019t drink coffee?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in that book that you brought home yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you check Google?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he says again, shaking his head, and I can tell he\u2019s fighting a smile. \u201cWe can ask the doctor today and see what he says about it. But for now, come eat something so we can shower and get ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I grumble, getting out of bed. Once I ate breakfast and showered we headed out to the doctor\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go,\u201d the doctor says, pointing at the screen beside my head. We had been at the doctor\u2019s office for a while. First, they ran a urine test to confirm what I already knew. Then, we had to wait for the ultrasound machine to free up. Now, I am looking and listening to our baby. Tears start to pool in my eyes from the overwhelming emotions I\u2019m feeling. I can see little arms and legs and the heartbeat is so loud in the background, it drowns out all the other noise. Asher is squeezing my hand so hard that I lost the feeling in my fingers. He has a look of amazement on his face. He bends his head and kisses my nose, smiling. The doctor types some information into the computer then clicks several times on the screen.</p><p>\u201cFrom the measurements, I would say you\u2019re about fifteen weeks along,\u201d he says, looking at me. I immediately feel guilty for not knowing sooner that I was pregnant.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay? I mean, is he healthy?\u201d Asher asks.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was on the shot and had no idea I was pregnant,\u201d I blurt, not wanting him to think that I'm going to be a horrible parent.</p><p>\u201cYou would be amazed at the number of times I\u2019ve heard that story. It\u2019s not as uncommon as some might think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I was so glad I wasn\u2019t the only one this had happened to.</p><p>\u201cReally!\u201d He chuckles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re far enough along to know the sex, if you would like to find out?\u201d he says, looking back at the screen.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I bite my lip and look at Asher. He nods his head, so I take that as a yes.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s have a look,\u201d the doctor says, moving the wand around a bit. \u201cI hope you like the color pink.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I whisper, looking up at Asher\u2019s pale face. \u201cBabe, are you okay? You look sick,\u201d I say, trying to sit up. I didn\u2019t expect this from him. He seemed so excited.</p><p>He swallows and shakes his head. \u201cI'm having a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say slowly, hoping that he isn\u2019t going to start freaking out. I need him to be together. I didn\u2019t even remember that I needed to make an appointment. I didn\u2019t know that I couldn\u2019t drink coffee until he told me. He had to be the one to hold it together.</p><p>\u201cLook at you.\u201d His hand frames my face, his eyes roam all over me. \u201cJesus, God is fucking playing a joke on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. I was not a good guy before you. God is getting even.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help it, I start laughing. I grab his face and look into his worried eyes. \u201cHoney, you\u2019re going to be able to pick out the bad boys from a mile away. She will be a total daddy\u2019s girl, and you will keep her safe. I love you, okay?\u201d</p><p>He takes a deep breath and kisses me, bringing his hand to my stomach where we know our daughter is. His eyes come back to me. \u201cI keep thinking that this is all a joke, that no one should ever be this happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I laugh, shaking my head. It feels unreal.</p><p>\u201cSo, I read in that book that you should wait to tell people until you\u2019re twelve weeks. We\u2019re past that so who do we want to tell first?\u201d he asks with a smile.</p><p>\u201cMs. Alice,\u201d I say right away. She has been so happy since me and Asher got together. I know that she will be excited to hear that we\u2019re having a baby.</p><p>Asher smiles and I know that I chose the right person.</p><p>I was standing in front of the barbecue. I had the lighter in my hand and was getting ready to set the stupid pregnancy book on fire. It\u2019s been four weeks since we went to the doctor and confirmed that I was pregnant. Everyone has been so excited. When we told Ms. Alice that we were having a girl, I thought she was having a seizure. She started jumping around in her chair, clapping and mumbling incoherently. Then she told me that I needed to go to her old house and pick up all the stuff for the baby\u2019s room. I looked at Asher and he shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>After we left Ms. Alice, we went to my dad\u2019s house and told him that he was going to be a grandfather. I think he almost fainted. Then he called my grandmother, uncles, and cousins, and had everyone come over so we could share the news. For Asher\u2019s mom, I sent her a dozen pink balloons and a card telling her that she was going to have a granddaughter. When she called me screaming into the phone, I knew that she was happy. She made us promise not to tell James or her boys until that evening at dinner. When Asher stood up at the table and announced that he had, as he said, knocked me up, I thought I would be bruised from the amount of hugs I got from everyone. After that, the book started to make appearances like Chucky. Two days after dinner with his family, we went to Ms. Alice\u2019s house to see what she was talking about. We found a beautiful antique baby bed, dresser and changing table that she had put up in the attic. They all needed to be refinished but even with the paint chipping and peeling, I could tell they would be beautiful. I told Asher that I wanted to repaint them but he\u2019d read in the book that strong chemical fumes weren\u2019t good for the baby. But he promised to get his brothers to help him refinish them in time, so I agreed without a fight. A week later, when all of Asher\u2019s extended family came over for a big barbecue to celebrate our news, I had been getting ready to dig into a delicious looking tuna steak, when it was taken from right out under my fork. Asher told me that I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat it due to the mercury in the meat. Again, I wasn\u2019t happy about this, but I wasn\u2019t going to risk anything happening to our baby, so I had a piece of chicken instead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Last week, I had been outside looking around the area where they started digging for the pool, when Asher ran outside like the house was on fire. I stumbled and almost fell into the hole when he caught me and made me go back inside, saying that they had sprayed some kind of chemical in the area and I couldn\u2019t be in the backyard. Once again, I agreed, but was noticing that the list of things I couldn\u2019t do was becoming quite long. Then, this morning, I was on the phone with the salon in town, making an appointment to get my highlights touched up and to have a manicure and pedicure, when the phone was yanked out of my hand and Asher proceeded to tell the salon that I had to wait until after I had the baby to get my hair done, but that I could get a mani pedi. Then he kissed me senseless, and left the room before I could clear the fog and yell at him. Now he was out somewhere on the property, and I was on the back porch in front of the grill with a lighter and the book that seemed to be the root of all my problems. I was ready to kill him. I loved him, I was over the moon that he was happy about this baby and I knew that he meant well, but I swear, he wouldn\u2019t be happy unless the doctor put me on bed rest for the rest of my pregnancy. The doorbell chimes and I look down at the book. I sigh and put everything down, planning on coming back to it as soon as I get rid of whoever is at the door.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d I tell Beast as I go into the house through the sliding door. I walk through the living room and looked out the peep hole. I can\u2019t believe my eyes. How the heck did she find me? I looked out the peep hole again, just to make sure that I\u2019m not seeing things. Nope, not seeing things. My mother is standing on the other side of the door. I get off my tiptoes and take a step away from the door.</p><p>\"Who's at the door, baby?\" Asher asks loudly from behind me. I jump and spin around, putting a finger to my lips and using the universal symbol for \u2018be quiet.\u2019</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d he asks again. This time, his eyes are narrowed. The doorbell rings again and my mom yells through the closed door.</p> <p>\"I can hear you in there.\"</p><p>\"Crap,\" I hiss, glaring at Asher for blowing my cover. He walks to the door and unlocks it before I have a chance to block it or tackle him to the ground.</p><p>\"Can I help\u2014\" Asher starts to ask but my mom cuts him off.</p><p>\"Where\u2019s November?\" my mom snaps.</p><p>Crap! Crap! Crap!</p> <p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Asher asks in a low growl.</p><p>\"Her mother.\" The air changes and I can feel the angry energy beating against my skin and it is all coming from Asher.</p><p>\"What the fuck are you doing here?\u201d he asks and I know this is going to go badly. I bend my head under Asher\u2019s arm that is holding the door open.</p><p>\"Mom, what are you doing here?\" I say and her eyes come to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been calling you and you haven\u2019t answered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to Tennessee because I haven't answered my phone?\u201d I ask in disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I came here because your fianc\u00e9\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d she says and my eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cHer fianc\u00e9 is standing right in front of you.\u201d Asher growled, taking his hand off the door and pulling me into his side.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out where I lived?\u201d I ask, completely ignoring the fact that she said my ex was in the hospital. I hope that he isn\u2019t going to die or anything, but I\u2019m not going to go to New York to sit at his bedside.</p><p>\u201cThe boy from the lawyer\u2019s office told me.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Asher when his voice rumbled. \u201cNick?\u201d My mom nodded. \u201cI'm going to fucking kill him.\u201d Asher was pissed.</p><p>\u201cI'm her mother. Why wouldn\u2019t he tell me where she lived?\u201d she snaps, looking at Asher then back at me. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you returned any of my calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I saw you, Mom, you made it clear that you were not interested in having a relationship with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my daughter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, and you have never acted like my mother.\u201d What the heck is going on? I feel like I\u2019m in the twilight zone when I see tears form in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been worried.\u201d My eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really going on?\u201d Just then, my cell phone rings in the kitchen. I look up at Asher in a silent plea for him to not let her in. He nods and I hope that we are on the same wave length. I walk to the kitchen and pick up my phone, seeing that it is Mr. Stevenson.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cNovember, this is Tom Stevenson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mr. Stevenson. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be better, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sorry to hear that,\u201d I mumble, looking toward the front door to make sure Asher hasn\u2019t let my mom in.</p><p>\u201cSorry to do this, but something just came up and I'm leaving my office in twenty minutes. If you can come now, I will put through the transfer. If not, we\u2019re going to have to reschedule for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, but I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I say, confused.</p><p>\u201cLike I explained to your mother this morning, I know that your signature is on the transfer papers, but I or a notary public has to witness you signing the documents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cThey have your signature, but from your tone, I take it that you didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper again, moving down the hall so I can talk without my mother knowing. \u201cYou said they have my signature?\u201d I ask, making sure I heard him correctly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He pauses and I can hear papers shuffling in the background. \u201cI double checked when I got the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I mumble into the phone, realizing why my mother is really here. \u201cShe\u2019s here right now,\u201d I say quietly, more to myself than to Mr. Stevenson.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI'm calling James. Keep her there,\u201d he says, hanging up.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say to dead air on the phone. I look down the hall, trying to come up with a plan to keep my mom here until Asher\u2019s dad arrives. I consider going outside and slashing her tires, but figure that might be a little extreme. Then, I thought about sicking Beast on her, but if she hurt my dog, I would be really upset. So, after a few more non options passed through my head, I decide to just invite her in and ask her if she would like something to drink. I leave the hallway.</p><p>When I reach the kitchen, I can see over the Island that Asher is sitting on the couch with his hands resting on top of his head. My mom is sitting on the coffee table in front of him. \u201cI guess we weren\u2019t on the same wave length after all,\u201d I mumble to myself. Asher\u2019s eyes come to me as soon as my feet hit the tile floor in the kitchen. He shakes his head. I narrow my eyes. My mom looks at me, smiles, and I see she has a gun in her hand pointed at Asher.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I scream as I start running into the living room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer or I\u2019ll shoot him,\u201d she says and I stop at the edge of the living room. My heart is pounding as if it\u2019s going to jump out of my chest. I look at Asher. His eyes are on me and he looks worried. His eyes drop to my stomach and they close, but not before I see pain flash across them.</p><p>\u201cAs I was telling your boyfriend here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFianc\u00e9.\u201d Asher growls, glaring at my mom. I almost laugh. Only he would stop a crazy person with a gun to clarify our relationship status.</p><p>\u201cAs I was telling your fianc\u00e9,\u201d my mom says, glaring back at Asher. Then she looks to where I'm standing. \u201cYou need to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I ask even though I know where she wants us to go. I just need to stall for time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d she says, standing. \u201cBefore we go though, you need to tie him up. I don\u2019t need him coming after us.\u201d She pulls some rope out of her bag. \u201cThis was for you, but it looks like we\u2019re going to use it on him instead,\u201d she says, throwing the rope at me. I catch it midair and look at Asher, trying to find a way to get out of this. \u201cCome on, come on. We don\u2019t have all day.\u201d She motions to him with her gun. I walk slowly towards Asher. I don\u2019t want to do this. Tears start to fill my eyes. I can\u2019t tie him up.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I sobbed, stopping a few feet from where he\u2019s sitting.</p><p>\u201cEither you tie him up or I\u2019ll shoot him.\u201d</p><p>I started sobbing. My breath hitches. \u201cBaby,\u201d Asher whispers, his hands start to come towards me. The gun goes off. \u201cKeep your hands where I can see them,\u201d my mom yells as I scream. Asher placed his hands back on his head with a look of pure rage on his face.</p><p>\u201cTie his hands behind his back and to his ankles. Do it now or I shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm so sorry,\u201d I cry as Asher places his hands behind his back.</p><p>\u201cBe strong, baby, for both of us,\u201d he whispers, and I know he\u2019s talking about our daughter.</p><p>\u201cI will, I promise,\u201d I whisper. I don\u2019t want her to know that I'm pregnant. The day I started wearing the pregnancy pants I bought from Target, my baby bump showed up. Normally, I would wear something more form fitting to show it off. Thankfully, today I have on an oversized tee and leggings because we were lounging around the house. I worked on tying his arms behind his back then he lay with his chest to the couch and I tied his hands to his ankles. I am glad that he has on sweats and a long sleeve shirt so the rope doesn\u2019t rub his skin. When I finish, my mom walks over to the couch and tests the knot I tied.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she says, waving the gun in the direction of the door. My brain starts to panic. Asher\u2019s house is in the country. Who knows where his dad is or any of the other officers that work in the area. I have no idea how long it would take until someone shows up, but I can hear Beast scratching at the back door, trying to get in. I wish that I wouldn\u2019t have locked him out there. \u201cCome on. We need to go. You already held me up by not running to the car when I told you Chris was in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need shoes,\u201d I tell her, hoping that it will buy me some time.</p><p>\u201cI saw flip-flops outside the front door. You can wear those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to be doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not going to tell you again. Get in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say calmly. I could tell that she was starting to panic. We walk outside and Beast runs around the corner of the house. He jumps through the air, landing right in the middle of my mom\u2019s chest. The gun in her hand went off right before it flew through the air.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d I yell, running for the gun. My mom is yelling for Beast to get off her. I fall to the ground, landing on my hip. I feel pain shoot up my side. I\u2019ve got my finger around the trigger of the gun just in time to see my mom grab a hold of Beast\u2019s mouth and start to pull his jaw apart. \u201cLet go of my fucking dog!\u201d I scream at the top of my lungs while trying to stand. I aim a warning shot near where she is lying on the ground. Her hands fly above her head. Beast stands above her, growling down into her face.</p><p>\u201cNovember!\u201d Asher yells from inside the house. I can hear the worry in his voice and I know that he wants me in there, but I can\u2019t leave my mom alone until Asher\u2019s dad shows up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI'm okay! We\u2019re okay!\u201d I yell back, taking a shaky breath. The sound of a car coming up the drive is music to my ears. I watched Mr. James pull over the hill in his police cruiser, and for the first time since my mom showed up, I can feel that knot in my stomach disappear.</p><p>\u201cNo, No, No, No,\u201d she starts chanting, her head thrashing back and forth on the ground. I can hear Asher yelling from inside the house and know that I need to go to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Mr. James asks, running up with his gun drawn and pointed at my mom.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say shakily. \u201cAsher\u2019s inside. He\u2019s tied up. She made me tie him up,\u201d I cry. The gun in my hand starts shaking. It feels like it weighs a hundred pounds.</p> <p>Mr. James\u2019 face is soft and full of worry when he holds out his hand to me. \u201cGive me the gun, darlin\u2019, and go untie my boy,\u201d he says quietly. I hand him the gun and start stumbling my way into the house. My hip is killing me from where I fell on it. I open the door and see Asher on his knees. He has gotten the rope off of one of his ankles. His eyes come to me and he falls backwards onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he roars and I run over to him. I realize it would be easier to untie him if I had a knife, so I stumble into the kitchen then back to him. He rolls to his side and I cut the rope around his wrist. Before I can do anything else, his arms are around me. I didn\u2019t even realize that I\u2019m crying until he starts wiping away the tears running down my face. \u201cBreathe, baby,\u201d he whispers, rocking me back and forth. One hand is on the back of my head, holding me to his chest, and the other is on my stomach where our daughter is.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014was\u2014s-s-so scared.\u201d I sob. \u201cBe...Beeasst saved me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re safe.\u201d He repeats those words over and over into my ear.</p><p>I take my face out of Asher\u2019s chest as Mr. James walks in with another officer. \u201cWe have her in th\u2014\u201d He looks down at us and his face pales. \u201cCall a fucking ambulance!\u201d he shouts over his shoulder. I look down and see that Asher\u2019s sweats have blood on them.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I cry. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d I try to get up. Asher\u2019s face is as white as a ghost and he starts shaking his head, pulling me closer. \u201cLet me go. We have to see where you\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, it\u2019s not me.\u201d His face is etched in worry. He picks me up and I start to squirm. Then I realize I feel wet between my legs.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper, looking at Asher. \u201cNo,\u201d I repeat, begging him to tell me that this is not happening. That I'm not bleeding.</p><p>\u201cI'm taking her to the hospital. It will be faster if I drive her,\u201d he says to his dad, but it feels like a dream. This cannot be happening.</p><p>\u201cI'm driving. Get her in the cruiser,\u201d Mr. James says quietly. I feel us moving but I'm numb. No tears, nothing. I don\u2019t even know if I'm breathing. All I can think about is our daughter.</p><p>I hear the sound of beeping. My eyes flutter open. I can see the white of the hospital ceiling and everything that happened yesterday comes back to me. When I got here, my dad and grandmother arrived ten minutes later. He was ready to go down to the local jail and kill my mother. My cousins and uncle had to physically restrain him so he didn\u2019t get arrested. The police still had to come in to take our statements, but from what I understand from Asher\u2019s dad, my mom had been trying to find a way to get the money my grandparents left for a very long time. My ex-fianc\u00e9 was her boy toy long before I met him. She said they had been sleeping together for two years when she came up with the plan that he would date me, get me to fall in love with him, ask me to marry him, then something else. She didn\u2019t say what that something was, but it would happen to me. He would get the money and they would start a life together. Unfortunately for her, that plan fell through when I found out they were sleeping together.</p> <p>Apparently, my grandparents left strict instructions that, if I was to die before I had any heirs, the money was to be donated to different charitable organizations. My mother had been scheming for a long time trying to get me out of the way. I guess she was on a roll during her questioning, and told the police that she set up the attack that happened to me in New York with the hopes that I would be left in a coma when it came time for me to receive my inheritance.</p><p>She figured that if I was in a coma, she would automatically be granted power of attorney and would have access to the money when it became available. Then she could transfer it to herself. She also admitted that she sent the flowers to me and paid the kid who dropped them off a few hundred dollars to get my signature on the transfer papers that she took to the lawyer.</p><p>I move my head to the side and look over to where Asher is asleep. He always looks peaceful in his sleep. His mom brought him another pair of sweats yesterday when she showed up, so he could get out of the one\u2019s that were covered in my blood. His ankle is crossed over his fleece covered knee. He has on a black thermal that is so tight, I can make out every detail of his chest. His hands are intertwined and laying on his abs. His sleeves are pushed up, the tattoos on his arm on full display. His jaw is darker than normal. He never shaves over the weekends. He worked from home yesterday, so he\u2019s extra scruffy.</p><p>Over the last few weeks, his skin has turned the color of caramel from working out in the sun. I bet a lot of women drive by his job sites just to see him without his shirt on. I know he takes it off to work, at least, occasionally. His tan is everywhere. He\u2019s always beautiful, but asleep, he\u2019s stunning. I wonder if I will ever get tired of looking at him.</p><p>My hand absently moves to my stomach. When I feel a slight flutter, I say a silent prayer that my daughter is okay. They were worried yesterday when they saw how much blood I lost. After lots of tests, the doctor found out that my cervix was bleeding due to the way I fell when I went for the gun. When I continued to bleed, they decided to keep me overnight for monitoring and put me on bed rest for a few weeks. This morning when they came to check on me, the bleeding had stopped and her heartbeat was stronger. The night doctor said that everything should be fine as long as I don\u2019t push it. He also told me that I could be released as soon as my doctor showed up to sign me out.</p><p>\u201cYou awake?\u201d Asher asks softly and I smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, looking over at him. His eyes have dark circles under them from being awake most of the night, harassing anyone who came into the room with a million and one questions.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asks, sitting up and placing his hand over mine.</p> <p>\u201cBetter. Tired, but much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He smiles and kisses my hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go get a coffee?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cNah, I'm good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, seriously, you look exhausted. Go get a coffee, walk around, and see if you can track down my doctor. This bed is really uncomfortable and I would like to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t have that machine at the house,\u201d he says, pointing at the monitor for our daughter\u2019s heartbeat. I look over at the machine and watch as her heartbeat thumps away. Then, I look back at him and can tell that he\u2019s still worried.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor won\u2019t let me leave if he thinks it\u2019s too risky,\u201d I tell him softly.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby,\u201d he says, bringing my hand to his mouth and holding it there after kissing my fingers. \u201cI could have lost you both yesterday,\u201d he says so quietly that I almost don\u2019t hear him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. We\u2019re here and we\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I heard that gun go off outside, I thought that my life had ended. I thought I was never going to see your face again, or be able to see our daughter take her first breath. And I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to survive without you here with me. I would take my life in order to go wherever you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d I whimpered, shaking my head. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s selfish,\u201d I cry. \u201cOther people love you and count on you, not just me. No matter what happens to me, promise that you will never give up on life. That you will always fight to be happy. I'm not your only happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re my bliss,\u201d he says, smiling, but I can\u2019t smile back. This is too serious.</p><p>\u201cPromise me that you will never give up on life, no matter what, Asher. Promise me right now, because we have a daughter that is going to need you no matter what happens to me.\u201d His eyes look so lost, but I won\u2019t let him say stupid things like that. I wouldn\u2019t be happy without him either, but I would still fight to live because I know he would want that for me. \u201cWould you want me to follow you?\u201d I ask quietly, knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t say things like that,\u201d I beg.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, baby,\u201d he says, pulling me into his arms. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what I would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it. We\u2019re here and we\u2019re safe. Just promise that no matter what, you won\u2019t leave our daughter behind if something happens to me.\u201d I start to cry uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he finally says, and I curl into his side and fall asleep.</p><p>I'm sitting in my hospital bed waiting for my doctor to show up and discharge me after he decided to keep me for one more night. Asher went to the house to get me something to wear and to drop off Beast. I hear the door open and look up.</p><p>\u201cNovember?\u201d Chris is standing at the door of my hospital room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask, scooting back in the bed.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were in the hospital. I wanted to check on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you I was in the hospital?\u201d He doesn\u2019t answer, but walks into the room, shutting the door behind him. I press the call button for the nurse.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to come back to me,\u201d he says, looking sad.</p><p>\u201cYou slept with my mom.\u201d I will never forget that. Seeing them together was burned into my brain forever.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I'm sorry about that, but once I started to fall in love with you, I left you clues so that you would catch us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to have a clean start with you. I just didn\u2019t know that after you caught us, you would ignore me completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI repeat: You slept with my mom. That\u2019s not something that is easy to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispers, looking at his shoes.</p><p>\u201cThe police are looking for you,\u201d I tell him and pray that one of the nurses comes in soon.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know about the attack in New York. I didn\u2019t know she was going to do that to you,\u201d he says the words quickly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. My pulse speeds up when he looks at me again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching her.\u201d He looks around. \u201cShe\u2019s been in town for a while now. I wanted to warn you. I tried to scare you into going back to New York, but instead you decided to stay here with that guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you try to scare me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBroke into your apartment and left you notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poetry?\u201d I ask, just to clarify.</p><p>He nods, looking around again. \u201cWe need to leave soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you need to leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that you need help,\u201d I say, as I see Kenton looking through the crack in the door.</p><p>\u201cI love you. We were getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease just leave. I'm happy. Can\u2019t you be happy for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t we happy?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cChris,\u201d I say softly, \u201cwe were a lie that you and my mother cooked up. You were my first everything, and it was all a lie so you both could collect money that I didn\u2019t even know I was going to receive.\u201d</p><p>His eyes close like he\u2019s in pain, his head tilts toward the ceiling. I watch out of the corner of my eye as Kenton steps into the room, gun drawn.</p><p>\u201cI loved you though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove isn\u2019t like that, Chris. I'm sorry. I hope you get help so that one day you will know what love is but that isn\u2019t love.\u201d</p><p>His eyes meet mine and I can see the sadness in them.</p><p>\u201cI want you to put your hands on your head and turn around slowly,\u201d Kenton says. Chris\u2019s head swings in his direction. When he registers the gun in Chris\u2019s hand, Kenton\u2019s hands go to his head. Then his gaze comes back to me.</p> <p>\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head and watch Kenton pull cuffs out of his pocket and attach them to Chris\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Asher\u2019s voice cracks through the room like thunder. He looks me over then takes a step towards Chris. Kenton blocks him.</p><p>\u201cSee to your girl,\u201d Kenton says quietly. I can tell that he\u2019s having a hard time not beating the crap out of someone. I think anyone would do for him right now after everything that happened yesterday. Me being in danger today is playing havoc with him.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, baby?\u201d he asks, taking a step towards me.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I nod my head as he pulls me into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d I whisper into his chest.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agrees.</p><p>Epilogue</p> <p>\u201cAgain, again!\u201d Emma screams as Asher picks her up again, tossing her through the air and into the pool. He\u2019s been doing the same thing for the last ten minutes. I look around for someone to help me at eight and a half months pregnant. It\u2019s hard to get my ass out of our lounge chairs unless I roll out, get on my hands and knees then stand. There are too many people around for me to do that today without really embarrassing myself.</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d I look up to see Kenton standing over me.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d I moan. \u201cI swear, this little girl is going to be a dancer,\u201d I tell him and watch as he smiles.</p><p>\u201cThe pool turned out awesome,\u201d he says once he pulls me up. I look around. He is not wrong. The pool is amazing. It has a hot tub that is connected to it, along with so many flowers and plants that you would think we were in the jungle.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jack did an amazing job,\u201d I say and look over at him. \u201cSo, where is Christen or Tina or Lisa or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d he says, cutting me off.</p><p>I start to giggle and feel my belly bouncing with my laughter then I feel a kick that\u2019s so hard, I stop immediately and grab Kenton\u2019s hand and pull it towards my belly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he started. Then, his eyes get big and drop to my stomach. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, now imagine that on your bladder.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so amazing,\u201d he says and his hand starts to rub my belly.</p><p>\u201cNow, I know that it\u2019s obvious by the huge ring on her finger that she\u2019s taken, but if you happened to miss that, you definitely can\u2019t miss the fact that she\u2019s obviously pregnant.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and see Kenton looking at Asher with something that looks a lot like envy in his eyes. I know he doesn\u2019t want me, but I think deep down he wants his own family.</p><p>\u201cYeah, both those are hard to miss,\u201d he says, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, man?\u201d Asher asks him while pulling me into him.</p><p>\u201cGood. Busy. I'm seeing someone and things are good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one someone?\u201d I ask, knowing his history. Since I\u2019ve been around, there has been someone different at each event.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just one.\u201d He smiles and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d I whisper, laying my head on Asher\u2019s chest. He doesn\u2019t look like someone in love though, so I wonder if he\u2019s just trying to settle down because he is lonely. \u201cYou should invite her next time we all get together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, leave the man alone. He just said he\u2019s seeing someone, not that he is picking out a ring.\u201d</p><p>I scrunch up my nose at my husband. \u201cFine,\u201d I grumble. His eyes go soft and he puts his mouth to mine. The kiss is sweet and soft. \u201cI'm going inside then I'm going to visit Ms. Alice,\u201d I whisper, biting his lower lip.</p><p>Once, I'm done in the bathroom, I track down Ms. Alice. She\u2019s sitting in the baby\u2019s room. It was finished yesterday with the help of Nico, Cash and Trevor. They were over most of the night, laying carpet and touching up the walls. I look around and can see all the love that went into making this room special for our daughter. I know that she\u2019s going to have more love than she will know what to do with.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Ms. Alice says and I agree. It is beautiful. The walls are a very light blue with flowers that shoot up from the base with clouds and butterflies. Meg and Liz spent a week coming over every day when they got off work to paint every flower and butterfly on the walls. Asher and his brothers sanded down every piece of furniture that we picked up from Ms. Alice and stained the wood a dark brown. The bedding is a quilt with pink and white checkers. It looks like a fairytale baby room. I think, what really means the most is that everyone helped make it beautiful. \u201cYou know that I never had a girl and Asher\u2019s mama didn\u2019t have a girl either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cI'm excited that this house is going to have a little girl in it. I think all those boys needed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet girl. They\u2019ve never really been around little girls to know how precious they are. I think when this little one comes, she\u2019s going to turn their lives upside down, and they all need it. Each one of them needs to see that all women were once precious little girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I agree quietly. \u201cBut I think they all know how precious women are from you and Susan. They\u2019re just waiting for the right woman to come along and show them how precious they are.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and pats my cheek. \u201cSmart girl.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, kissing her cheek, \u201cI'm going to go find my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to have a real wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I honesty haven\u2019t thought about it. After I got out of the hospital, me and Asher went right to the court house and got a marriage license. I was wearing sweats and sneakers and so was Asher. We just wanted to be married. The wedding didn\u2019t matter to me. \u201cMaybe, after the baby gets here, we can have a small ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice. She can be the flower girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah and Beast can be the ring bearer,\u201d I say, laughing. \u201cMaybe me and you can start planning something small. I'm sure Mama Susan would like to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she thinks of you as a daughter and would love to help you. Shoot, if you let her, she would probably take over the whole thing for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might just let her do that.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cAlright, go find your husband before he starts running around the house, yelling for you and scaring all the guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back and check on you soon. Do you want a piece of the baby shower cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I'm on a diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, lord.\u201d I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s a new guy that\u2019s kind of cute. I need to watch my girlish figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm leaving,\u201d I say, laughing and walking out the door, trying to get the image of Ms. Alice and a man, any man, out of my head.</p><p>\u201cHey, sis, you\u2019re leaking,\u201d Nico says and I look down at the water pitcher in my hand. I don\u2019t see it leaking, but I do see water running down my legs and onto the floor at my feet. I look back at the pitcher then back at my feet, and then I realize that it\u2019s time.</p><p>\u201cI... I'm, well, I think my water broke,\u201d I tell him and he looks like he may fall over.</p><p>\u201cYour water broke?\u201d He stumbles back.</p><p>\u201cOh crap!\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Cash asks.</p><p>\u201cMy water broke and Nico is freaking out,\u201d I tell him, waving a hand in front of Nico\u2019s face. Then I look at Cash and he looks the same as his brother. \u201cCome on. You can\u2019t be serious?\u201d I groan.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Trevor asks and I don\u2019t even tell him. What\u2019s the point? He\u2019s just going to freak and I don\u2019t have time to deal with them.</p><p>\u201cYour water broke?\u201d Trevor says from behind me and I notice that he sounds normal, so I stop and look at him.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I need to find your brother. Will you help me without going comatose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He shrugs like it\u2019s no big deal, and his other two brothers aren\u2019t standing four feet away staring into space. He grabs me around the waist then slides his arm under my thigh, lifting me. I scream and hold onto his neck for dear life.</p><p>\u201cI could have walked,\u201d I tell him, digging my nails into his back.</p><p>\u201cThis would be easier if you would retract your claws there, kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Put her down,\u201d Asher says when he sees us come through the backdoor.</p><p>\u201cHer water broke. I'm taking her to the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour water broke?\u201d he asks in the same tone as Nico and Cash.</p><p>\u201cAsher James Mayson, if you freak, we\u2019re going to have so many problems, especially after you shoved that damn baby book down my throat every day for the last nine months. You know everything that is going to happen. You cannot be surprised by any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to burn it,\u201d he reminds me of my failure. When we finally got home from the hospital and the guys came over for dinner that weekend, they decided to grill steaks and found the baby book still inside the grill, safe and sound, not even slightly damaged by the horrible rains that we had for two days before. He brought the book inside, set it at the island, then went back out to the grill, never saying a word about it.</p><p>\u201cThat book is like the damn Chucky doll,\u201d I complain and dig my nails into Trevor\u2019s neck again when the first contraction hits.</p><p>\u201cHoly mother of God, that hurt!\u201d I say, breathing deep and looking at Asher.</p><p>\u201cGo get her stuff. I\u2019ll take her to the car,\u201d Trevor tells him.</p><p>\u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm taking you to the car.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPut me down right now!\u201d I yell and he sets me on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Susan asks, walking around the corner to the living room.</p><p>\u201cMy water broke and all of your sons, except Trevor, turned comatose at the mention of it. I need to get my bag and get to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far apart are your contractions?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just had my first one, so I don\u2019t really know. I haven\u2019t timed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was one minute and fifty-six seconds ago,\u201d Trevor says. Asher glares at him.</p><p>I walk to the couch and sit when I feel another contraction coming on.</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re less than three minutes apart. We really need to get to the hospital,\u201d Trevor says and I'm wondering what the hell is going on.</p><p>I look up at him and he shrugs. \u201cThat book has been around a lot,\u201d he says, pointing to Asher. \u201cHe carries it with him everywhere, even to job sites. When I was bored a few times, I read it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLord, save me,\u201d I say, looking up to the ceiling then back to Asher, who\u2019s still just standing there.</p><p>\u201cAsher, unless you want your brother to take over for you, pull it together,\u201d I tell him, waddling out to the car.</p><p>Nine grueling hours later, July Heaven Mayson, came into this world screaming.</p><p>I walk into the living room and look at the couch. Asher is lying on his back with July lying in just a diaper against his bare chest. One of his big hands in holding her bottom, the other is on the back of her head. She\u2019s facing me, her hand resting against her chin. Her eyes are the same color as her father\u2019s. His eyes are closed. I walk towards them and Asher\u2019s eyes open and the smile that comes across his face is devastating. It\u2019s a look of pure bliss, the look of someone who is right where they are supposed to be in life and is so overwhelmed with happiness that it comes through every time they smile.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d he says. \u201cHow was your nap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I smile. \u201cWas she fussy when you tried to give her the bottle?\u201d I ask, knowing my daughter is picky and only wants the breast.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head, smiling. \u201cTrevor came over for lunch and he got her to drink from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, super Trevor saves the day again, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Liz came with him so I think he was showing off.\u201d He laughs and I know he\u2019s right. Liz slipped a few days after July was born and said something happened, but never said what it was. When I tried to press her about it, she closed up and turned as red as a beet. Since then, they had kind of been avoiding each other. A few weeks ago, something else happened, and now there is no Trevor without Liz.</p><p>\u201cI'm sure,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes. \u201cBut if your brothers are trying to use our daughter to pick up women, I will kick their asses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick their asses,\u201d he says, patting her bottom and he\u2019s not lying. He\u2019s one scary daddy bear. The other day, some woman came up to us and started to put her hand near July, and he freaked out about germs and hand sanitizer. The lady stood there in shock the whole time. Then he walked away, shaking his head, like she was the crazy one.</p><p>\u201cSo, should we get ready to take her to Grandma\u2019s?\u201d I ask, excited about a date with my husband. Since July came home two months ago, we haven\u2019t had any time alone, and I was very much looking forward to it. Not that I wanted to be without my daughter, but I was ready to have mommy and daddy time.</p><p>\u201cI already packed everything up,\u201d he says, smirking, and I laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm going to go shower.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShower, huh?\u201d he says, and his eyes turn hungry.</p><p>\u201cYes, shower. You have to watch our daughter so you can\u2019t join me. I bend over and kiss her head of dark hair, and then kiss my husband and whisper against his lips, \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you more, baby,\u201d he says back.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go to Nashville and have dinner?\u201d Asher asks from the driver\u2019s seat. We just dropped off July to his mom and dad. We\u2019re kid free for a few hours.</p><p>\u201cHave you gone skinny dipping?\u201d I blurt.</p><p>I watch as his dimple appears. \u201cYou wanna go skinny dipping, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say softly. I have always wanted to try it, but since the pool was finished and July was born, there hasn\u2019t been time or opportunity.</p><p>We pull into our driveway fifteen minutes later, and before Asher can even get his door open, I\u2019m in the house, running across the living room and pulling my dress over my head. Then I dive into the pool in my bra and panties. I surface and watch as Asher takes off his shoes then jeans. He\u2019s going kind of slow, so I decided to hurry him along. I unclasp my bra and toss it in his direction. He jumps into the pool with his boxers still on.</p><p>When he surfaces, he\u2019s right in front on me, pulling me to him under my arms. \u201cIf we\u2019re skinny dipping, these are kind of in the way,\u201d he says, running his hands down my waist to the top of my lacy booty panties.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I smile.</p><p>Then his hands fist the sides, ripping them off and tossing them out of the pool. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d His mouth meets mine and his hand goes between my legs, his fingers hitting the perfect spot. My legs wrap around his hips, my arms around his neck, and my head falls back from the stimulation of his fingers. His lips run along my neck, licking and biting their way down to the tops of my breast. He stops and his hand fists my hair, pulling my mouth back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou have too many clothes on,\u201d I tell him, trying to shove down his boxers. I finally get them off him, wrapping my fist around him and stroking. I bite my lip when two fingers fill me.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I moan. My head falls forward into his shoulder then I'm out of the pool, sitting on the edge. His hands are at my inner thighs, spreading my legs wide, then his mouth is attacking me. \u201cOh my God,\u201d I whisper, holding his head to me. Right when I know I'm going to come, he stops and pulls me back into the water, impaling me on him. \u201cAsher!\u201d I scream in shock. I feel myself convulse around him.</p><p>\u201cI love your pussy, baby,\u201d he says against my ear. I whimper as he uses his hands on my ass to slam me down onto him. My hands pull his mouth to mine. The kiss is so hungry that when I feel his teeth bite into my lower lip, I lose it.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to come,\u201d I say against his mouth, and just as I feel myself starting to fall apart, he lifts me off him and turns me around so I have to grab onto the side of the pool. He slams into me from behind, holding onto my hips using the weightlessness of the water to lift me effortlessly. His hands slide from my waist to my chest, and his fingers roll and pinch my nipples. His mouth travels from the back of my neck up to my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna make me come, baby. Your tight, wet pussy is squeezing me and going to make me come. And when I come, I want you to come with me, so I need you to touch yourself for me.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head. I don\u2019t have the strength to say anything. When my fingers roll over my clit, my head falls back on his shoulder, my mouth finds his, and then I explode. My body is tingling from head to toe. My fingers dig into the wall at the edge of the pool. My orgasm is so huge that I see stars and can\u2019t breathe. I hear Asher groan behind me and I know that he followed me with his own orgasm. \u201cI don\u2019t know how, but I swear your pussy gets sweeter every time I fuck you,\u201d he says in a husky whisper right next to my ear.</p><p>We\u2019re out of the pool lying on one of our loungers, me sprawled out on top of Asher, his hand\u2019s running up and down my back.</p><p>\u201cI want another, baby,\u201d Asher says softly to the top of my head. His hands slowing move up and down.</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d I ask, not that I\u2019m surprised. He loves our daughter and is amazing with her, but she\u2019s only two months old and I want to enjoy her for a little while longer.</p><p>\u201cI want our kids to be close like me and my brothers. And I also miss you being pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou miss me complaining about everything, late night store runs, foot massages and my weight gain?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI never complained, and you already know how I felt about your belly. Something about you waddling around with my baby inside you was fucking sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a strange one, Asher James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, pulling me up his body. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give me another baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I'm going to give you another baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d He smiles, giving me the dimple. \u201cLet\u2019s get started,\u201d he says against my mouth and we did get started. It took a few tries, but two months later, I found out I was pregnant. A few months after that, we found out we were having a girl. Five girls later, Asher gave up on his dream of a boy.</p><p>Seventeen years later</p><p>\u201cYou listen to me, young lady,\u201d I hear Asher say. \u201cYou are not going on a date. You\u2019re only sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d I hear our daughter cry, and I know that she\u2019s giving him the puppy dog eyes. Each of our five girls had perfected the puppy dog eyes by the time they were old enough to talk. I shove my face into my pillow so they can\u2019t hear me laughing through the open door. I keep listening, but all I can hear now is mumbling. This lasts awhile. Then Asher walks into our room, closing the door behind him. His face is blank as he sits down on the bed, takes off his shoes, then stands, and takes his shirt off. After seventeen years, his body is still amazing. He looks at me and I see so much love in his eyes that it makes it hard to breathe. The pillow is still against my face with my eyes peeking out over the top of it.</p><p>So, what did you say?\u201d I ask in a muffled voice.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going on a date on Friday,\u201d he grumbles and I fall back in bed, laughing so hard that tears are streaming down my face.</p><p>Yes, this is bliss, I think to myself. </p> </body></html>"]
