A red rage. An aneurysm-inducing rage. A going-postal rage.</p><p>And the worst part? His wife, his helpmate, his lover, his partner, his...everything\u2014goddammit, Libby was his everything\u2014didn\u2019t give two shits about his foul mood.</p> <p>Not. Two. Hot. Shits.</p><p>Which enraged him further.</p><p>\u201cWalk it off, Quinn,\u201d Libby McKay tossed over her shoulder, letting the young buck lead her deeper into the crowd on the dance floor. The last thing Quinn saw was the sassy head shake of her sassy new hairdo.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna fuckin\u2019 kill him. See how goddamn happy his hands are after I break \u2019em off at the wrists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Q, will you sit the hell down? People are starin\u2019 at you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet \u2019em look.\u201d</p><p>His brother Ben hissed, \u201cScrew that. Get your dumb ass back to the table or I\u2019m leavin\u2019 and you can hoof it home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe worth it to punch that sonuvabitch in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t bailin\u2019 you outta jail neither.\u201d</p><p>Quinn scowled, reluctantly following Ben back to the booth. He drained his cup of beer and poured another from the pitcher. Mostly foam. Didn\u2019t it just figure even the beer wasn\u2019t cooperating with him tonight?</p><p>\u201cYou gotta stop doin\u2019 this, man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoin\u2019 what? Drinkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you mean quit comin\u2019 to Ziggy\u2019s to watch my wife dance with every good-for-nuthin\u2019 loser in this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that.\u201d Quinn slammed his empty cup down. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country. I live in this goddamned county. I got just as much right to be here as she does.\u201d</p><p>Ben jerked the pitcher away before Quinn dispensed a refill. \u201cIt\u2019s been three months since you and Libby separated, Q. Face it. Maybe it\u2019s time you moved on. Looks like she has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. If Libby is so all fired up to \u2018move on\u2019 then why the hell hasn\u2019t she hired a lawyer and filed for divorce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably waitin\u2019 \u2019til school gets out and she has more time.\u201d</p> <p>His answer resembled a growl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so surprised.\u201d Ben poured himself a cup of foam. \u201cYou guys\u2019ve been headed down this road for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tellin\u2019 me you were just rollin\u2019 along, mindin\u2019 your own business and wham! Her demand of \u2018I want a trial separation\u2019 came from left field?\u201d</p><p>Quinn hated\u2014 hated\u2014talking about this kind of touchy feely crap with anyone. \u201cAll married couples hit rough patches. I thought it\u2019d blow over. It always has before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore?\u201d Ben choked on his beer. \u201cThis ain\u2019t the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time she\u2019s kicked me outta my own damn house.\u201d Three fucking months he\u2019d been living in tin, eating out of tin and sleeping alone in absolute misery.</p><p>\u201cSo you been goin\u2019 to counseling and shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Did she ask you to?\u201d</p><p>Sort of. Quinn knew he and Ben weren\u2019t talking about the same type of professional help Libby had suggested. He hedged. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d ya say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. You are one stubborn sonuvabitch. I can see why Libby is tired of it and booted your ass.\u201d</p><p>Stubborn sonuvabitch. A familiar phrase. His normally sweet-tongued wife had hurled those words at him as she\u2019d hurled a suitcase full of his dirty clothes on the front porch. \u201cFuckin\u2019 great. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re takin\u2019 her side, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn, man, no offense, but you suck as a husband.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment flared. Libby\u2019d said that much too. \u201cHow the hell do you know? You\u2019ve been married what, zero times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mean I can\u2019t see when something ain\u2019t workin\u2019,\u201d Ben countered. \u201cObviously your marriage ain\u2019t doin\u2019 so hot. I\u2019d be more\u2019n happy to offer you red-hot tips to fire it back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTips from the guy whose last relationship barely passed the one month mark? This oughta be interestin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo skin off my nose if you\u2019re too proud to accept help. But even as a single guy, I\u2019m aware bein\u2019 a good husband is more than bein\u2019 a good provider.\u201d</p><p>Yep. Quinn\u2019s spouse had also tossed that phrase at him. But the irony was that street ran both ways.</p><p>Libby ought to realize there was more to being a good wife than having supper on the table, maintaining a spotless house, and cramming his dresser drawers with clean clothes. Not that he\u2019d say that to her, knowing how much it\u2019d hurt her feelings. Why hadn\u2019t Libby realized how deeply it\u2019d cut him when she\u2019d carelessly flung those same words in his face? He sighed. \u201cGo ahead, Ben, wow me with your golden marriage tips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, you have to stop takin\u2019 Libby for granted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never taken her for granted. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine then. You gotta show her how much she matters to you. You gotta...woo her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoo her?\u201d Baffled, Quinn stared at his brother. \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAct like you did when you were dating. Bring her flowers, wine and dine her with candlelit dinners, take her to the movies. Spend time just makin\u2019 out and tryin\u2019 to cop a feel in the truck.\u201d</p><p>Quinn leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019m reminding you I\u2019ve been with Libby for fourteen years. We started dating when we were sixteen. I married her the month after she graduated from college. We\u2019ve been man and wife for nine years. So I\u2019m a little rusty on my wooin\u2019 skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s past time to brush up on \u2019em, Q. Because if you don\u2019t use \u2019em on her, you\u2019re gonna need to use \u2019em on someone else.\u201d</p><p>Shame burned and he dropped his gaze to the table. \u201cThen I\u2019m doomed. I never done any of that romantic crap with her.\u201d Or any other woman. Libby was the first girl he\u2019d dated. The first and only woman he\u2019d had sex with. The only woman he\u2019d ever wanted. The only woman he\u2019d ever loved.</p><p>And I\u2019m about to lose her.</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d Ben prompted.</p><p>Quinn shook his head. \u201cLibby\u2019s always been practical. That\u2019s one of the reasons I fell for her. She didn\u2019t need any of the superficial junk other girls did. She didn\u2019t expect me to be a rodeo star or go to trade school. She knew I\u2019d never leave here because ranchin\u2019 is in my blood. She was fine with that. She wanted that life...or so I thought.\u201d</p><p>Things\u2014no, Libby had changed in the last year. It had started out with small modifications. New furniture, repainting a room or two, hanging new draperies, trying out new recipes from faraway places.</p><p>Then she\u2019d started dropping hints about them doing \u201ccouple\u201d activities.</p><p>When Libby had returned to her job as the school librarian after summer hiatus, she went on a diet and lost twenty-five pounds. He\u2019d always loved her curvy body, but she seemed happier thinner. She\u2019d tossed out her old duds and bought new ones. Gone were the long denim skirts, loose shirts, bulky sweaters, baggy sweats and oversized T-shirts she\u2019d worn for years. Ditto for neutral colors.</p><p>No, Libby\u2014his Libby\u2014began wearing tight, low-cut jeans. Clingy blouses that accentuated her ample chest. Short skirts in vivid colors. Just as he was wrapping his head around those changes, she\u2019d trotted off to Denver for a professional makeover. She\u2019d chopped her long, honey-brown hair into a short, trendy cut and added blondish-red highlights. She\u2019d never worn much makeup, so it\u2019d shocked Quinn to see her freckles covered, her lips glossy red and black eyeliner emphasizing her blue eyes.</p><p>At that point he\u2019d begun to worry, wondering if she\u2019d met a man she was trying to impress.</p><p>When Libby asked him how he liked the \u201cnew\u201d her, Quinn replied honestly: He\u2019d liked the old her just fine.</p><p>A day later he was living in the horse trailer.</p><p>\u201cDammit. You aren\u2019t even listenin\u2019 to me, are you?\u201d Ben demanded.</p><p>Quinn ignored the taunt and focused on Libby sashaying off the dance floor. The smile she allotted her dance partner didn\u2019t reach her eyes like it did whenever she danced with him. Her shoulders were bunched up to her ears. Her normally graceful body movements were forced. Unnatural. She looked as if she were merely going through the motions.</p><p>Just like him.</p><p>The truth hit Quinn as viciously as a horse hoof to the head. He\u2019d gone about dealing with this misstep in their marriage the wrong way, expecting Libby to come to him. He had to fix it, to man up, take the bull by the horns, grab the tiger by the tail, climb on the horse that threw him, reclaim what was rightfully his. Clich\u00e9d phrases, but truisms to lead him in the right direction\u2014the only direction\u2014straight back to her.</p><p>\u201cQuinn? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I ain\u2019t been right since she kicked me out, Ben. Dammit. I miss her something fierce.\u201d</p><p>Ben froze. \u201cAh shit, Q, you ain\u2019t gonna start with that, I love you man, kinda drunk talk, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d Quinn shoved the pitcher aside and propped his elbows on the table. \u201cBut I have been listenin\u2019 to you yammer on, and you\u2019re exactly right. I\u2019ve gotta do something. And you\u2019re gonna help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp you do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me come up with a plan to win my wife back.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cSecond shelf on the bottom row.\u201d</p><p>The seven-year-old girl shook her head, bouncing her blonde corkscrew pigtails. \u201cHuh-uh. I looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the librarian. You always help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time is different, sweetie, because your teacher wants you to find the book. It\u2019ll improve your alphabetizing skills.\u201d Libby resisted her impulse to smooth the girl\u2019s puckered brow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wish you were my teacher, Mrs. McKay,\u201d she announced before flouncing away.</p><p>I wish I had a little girl just like you.</p><p>Libby briefly squeezed her eyes shut. Don\u2019t go there. She had enough issues and failures to deal with, thank you very much, starting with the demise of her marriage to Quinn McKay.</p> <p>Damn stubborn man. What would spur him into action? To get across this wasn\u2019t a game? This was their life hanging in the balance.</p><p>Quinn hadn\u2019t balked at her demand of a trial separation. He\u2019d taken it in stride and blithely continued his day-to-day life on the ranch, content to hole up in the horse trailer until she \u201ccame to her senses\u201d.</p><p>Three months had gone by and they were at an impasse.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help Libby hadn\u2019t spoken directly to her husband in that time frame. Her involvement with their ranching operation made their lack of daily communication a real dilemma. Being the efficient sort, she\u2019d created a schedule for ranch business and bill paying, and for personal issues, such as when Quinn could use the shower and the washer and dryer in the house.</p><p>The system worked, but it forced them to leave each other notes. His were terse and to the point. Hers were polite and filled with detailed explanations. Which pretty much summed up their marriage in the last year or so.</p> <p>But Libby still loved Quinn. She missed him like crazy. Yet after last night, she questioned whether love was enough. Why wouldn\u2019t he fight for her? For them? Why was it solely up to her to enact the changes they both so desperately needed?</p><p>If you\u2019re so eager for change, why haven\u2019t you signed the legal complaint paperwork the attorney gave you that\u2019s been in your desk for a month?</p><p>Good question.</p><p>But at least she\u2019d made an effort to test her wings and gauge if walking away from him for good was a possibility. Bored and lonely, Libby had started hanging out with her single female coworkers at Ziggy\u2019s, a bar which catered to a younger crowd than the other honky-tonks in the area. Getting hit on by eager, hot cowboys did wonders for her self-esteem, even when she\u2019d only flirted, danced and accepted the occasional free drink.</p><p>Then Quinn began showing up. He\u2019d hunker down in a booth, drinking beer, sometimes alone, sometimes with his brother. Quinn never approached her. He just watched her.</p><p>Until last night.</p> <p>Quinn\u2019s clipped, \u201cGet your goddamn hands off my wife,\u201d had instilled a tiny seed of hope. Libby secretly wished for Quinn the Barbarian to hoist her over his shoulder and cart her out of the bar. She fantasized her he-man would be in such a lust-filled state to have her, he\u2019d fuck her against his dirty pickup, not caring who might see him staking his claim.</p><p>Afterward, he\u2019d race them home and make mad, passionate love to her for days on end. In their bed.</p><p>On the kitchen table. In the shower. Up against the corral. All the while confessing his undying love for her. Profess he\u2019d been a fool. He\u2019d do anything to keep her and guarantee her happiness for the rest of their lives.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t happened. Libby had to face reality\u2014it probably never would. Last night Quinn had simply muttered and walked away. Given up. Dashing her idiotic, girlish romantic dreams of reconciliation.</p><p>Tears fell as she reached for the file folder in the back of the drawer. She pulled out the sheaf of legal papers titled Complaint. Libby scrawled her name on the bottom line, dated it and crammed the whole works in a manila envelope.</p><p>The rest of Mrs. Rich\u2019s rambunctious second-grade class barreled into the library. Libby hastily set the envelope on her desk and put the whole thing out of her mind.</p><p>A sage-scented breeze stirred Libby\u2019s hair as she exited the school hours later. Exhausted, she juggled a bag of books and her car keys, so she didn\u2019t notice the man leaning against her car until the tips of his boots were within view.</p><p>Libby raised her chin. Her heart whomped when her gaze caught familiar blue eyes.</p> <p>Quinn.</p><p>Even after fourteen years together, just seeing him set her pulse racing. Quinn was the stereotypical Wyoming rancher, more rugged looking than classically handsome. He\u2019d maintained the same stocky build as in his younger years, although it appeared he\u2019d dropped weight since being forced to cook his own meals. But it looked good on him. Everything looked good on him.</p><p>His face was smoothly shaven. The fresh scent of his aftershave, mixed with the aroma of his sun-warmed skin, drifted toward her, swamping her with longing.</p><p>Damn him.</p><p>To top it off, Quinn had worn her favorite shirt, the one she\u2019d bought him for Christmas, navy blue with pearl-snap buttons and white stitching around the pocket flaps. The cut of the material showcased his wide shoulders and broad chest. The sleeves hugged his muscled biceps, every bulge earned the hard way from manual labor required to run a ranch. The dark fabric emphasized his coloring, his blackish-brown hair, the long, thick, sooty lashes surrounding his mesmerizing blue eyes.</p><p>Those intense eyes locked onto hers. Quinn gave her the unsure smile she hadn\u2019t seen in ages. Her heart thumped harder.</p><p>\u201cHey, Libby. You, ah, look good. Real good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. What\u2019re you doing here?\u201d A panicked thought crossed her mind. \u201cDid someone die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He paused. Frowned. Seemed highly flustered. \u201cIt\u2019s sorta sad you\u2019d think that\u2019s what it\u2019d take to get me to come around.\u201d</p><p>Libby shrugged. \u201cYou haven\u2019t come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough. But last time I checked, the roads run both ways, darlin\u2019 wife.\u201d</p><p>She notched her chin higher. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach did a swoopy roll. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He kept leaning against the driver\u2019s side door, hands jammed into the pockets of a new pair of dark blue Wrangler jeans, his going-to-town boots crossed at the ankles. \u201cI\u2019m here \u2019cause I\u2019m waitin\u2019 for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>For a second, his shoulders tensed. Then he pushed away from the car and ambled toward her.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t like you dancin\u2019 with other men.\u201d</p><p>Taunting him usually had no effect. No matter how pissed off he might be, Quinn McKay never caused a scene. Never acted improper or impulsive in public, which was why his outburst in the bar last night had thoroughly confused her. Hell, he rarely acted improper or impulsive in private. So, she couldn\u2019t help the flip, \u201cOh. Is that all?\u201d to see if she could goad him into another heated reaction.</p><p>\u201cNo, that ain\u2019t all. I\u2019m also here to remind you that you\u2019re my wife and I don\u2019t share what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>A chill skittered through her at his possessive tone. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you cared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought wrong. Now dump your stuff in the back of the truck and get in. We\u2019re goin\u2019 home.\u201d</p><p>Libby\u2019s jaw dropped. The book bag hit the dirt. Her temper skyrocketed and her voice escalated. \u201cJust like that? You think after three months of ignoring me and our problems that you can just show up and... command me? I\u2019ve got news for you buddy, not happening. Too little, too late.\u201d</p><p>A heavy pause lingered. She expected him to remind her to lower her voice. She didn\u2019t expect him to lower his head until her face was shadowed beneath the brim of his ever-present cowboy hat.</p><p>\u201cWrong answer. Better late than never is my new creed.\u201d Quinn peered into her eyes so closely she felt his breath fanning her lips. \u201cI agreed to give you the space you demanded, Libby. Now I can see that was a fool-headed mistake on my part. So you\u2019re gonna rectify it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy givin\u2019 me the second chance I deserve.\u201d Quinn lifted his hand to her face. It shocked her to see that strong, capable hand trembling. He dragged the back of his rough-skinned knuckles down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. When was the last time Quinn said that simple word to her? And meant it?</p><p>Libby stared at him, puzzled, yet unable to squash that last bit of hope. Was she seeing new determination in the eyes of the man she\u2019d loved most of her life? A man she swore she knew straight to the bone?</p><p>\u201cLibby?\u201d</p><p>The soft, gruff way he\u2019d spoken her name as a question, not a demand, tore at her resistance. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpend the weekend with me. Just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happens come Monday morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it one day at a time and see how it goes from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I agree to the weekend, you\u2019ll give me time to think it over next week? No matter what happens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I promise. No pressure.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. She\u2019d be in Cheyenne at the state librarian\u2019s conference next week. It\u2019d allow her physical and emotional distance from him, and time to put it all in perspective, no matter how the weekend turned out.</p><p>You\u2019ve got nothing to lose. This is the chance you never thought you\u2019d have.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Come home. I, ah, managed to fix supper.\u201d A sheepish smile was there and gone again.</p><p>\u201cNuthin\u2019 fancy, just fried potatoes and sausage. But I sure would like to share a meal with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Libby kept her gaze steady and retorted, \u201cJust as long as you understand that sharing a meal doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll be sharing a bed, Quinn McKay.\u201d</p><p>Quinn\u2019s hand dropped and he stepped back. \u201cI wasn\u2019t tryin\u2019 to... I never thought...\u201d He smiled with deliberate slowness. \u201cHell, Libby, if I woulda wanted to be in our bed again, I woulda said so up front. You probably don\u2019t believe me, \u2019cause you seem to think the worst of me these days, but I didn\u2019t fix a quick supper in exchange for a quickie.\u201d</p><p>Heat climbed up her neck, setting her face aflame. She\u2019d jumped to the wrong conclusion. Again. Not that Quinn pointed out her faults and failings like she\u2019d freely done with his.</p><p>In his understated, gentle way, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you back at the house.\u201d He hopped in his mud-covered truck and roared away.</p><p>Quinn had set the kitchen table with their wedding china before he\u2019d left for town. He snagged a beer from the fridge, but hesitated before popping the top. Would Libby attribute his openness and willingness to talk to alcohol? Probably. He slid the Budweiser back on the top shelf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dishes washed, counters cleaned, he had nothing to do but wait. He\u2019d gotten used to his own company in the evenings in recent months. Didn\u2019t mean he liked it.</p><p>After turning the burner to simmer, Quinn snuck upstairs and stood in the doorway to their bedroom.</p><p>The same faded wedding ring quilt adorned the brass bed. The usual explosion of pillows were piled at the head and the extra wool blanket dangled off the foot.</p> <p>The room smelled the same, Libby\u2019s cherry-almond hand lotion and a hint of wood from the cedar-lined closet. If Quinn peeled back the bedcovers, he\u2019d catch a whiff of Libby\u2019s apple shampoo and the underlying musky-sweet fragrance of just Libby.</p><p>He stared mindlessly, trying to remember the last time he and Libby had made love in that bed. In the months prior to their separation, they may as well have been sleeping in separate rooms.</p><p>A memory came to him, leaving him as breathless and embarrassed as he\u2019d been at the time. Missing his wife, feeling adrift and lonely, Quinn had mustered the guts to cross the invisible line running down the center of the mattress, only to have Libby literally give him the cold shoulder. Tired of being rejected, he hadn\u2019t bothered trying to touch her at all, in bed or out, for the next six months.</p><p>Initially, he\u2019d blamed their lack of intimacy on a multitude of things, exhaustion, familiarity and laziness. It\u2019d seemed weird to experiment with crazy new sexual positions when the old standbys worked so well. They both got off and wasn\u2019t that the point of sex? Besides, the red-hot-have-to-have-you-now passion had cooled into something more comfortable over the years. Which wasn\u2019t all bad until that comfort factor had turned into a sexual snooze-fest.</p><p>But Quinn refused to take all the blame for their fizzling\u2014rather than sizzling\u2014sex life. Heaven knew Libby rarely initiated lovemaking, but left the seducing up to him. Sure, once he\u2019d stoked her fires she was a generous and enthusiastic lover, not particularly adventurous, but then again, he wasn\u2019t exactly the hanging-from-the-chandelier wild sex type either.</p> <p>If he were completely honest, things had fallen apart on the sexual front when they\u2019d decided to try for a baby. At first it\u2019d been fun, the carefree let\u2019s-have-sex-all-the-time romps. But three years after Libby had stopped taking the pill, she still wasn\u2019t pregnant.</p><p>So his practical, organized wife had drawn elaborate fertility charts. Detailed lists of when they could\u2014and couldn\u2019t\u2014make love. First, she\u2019d tossed his tighty whities and bought boxer shorts to keep his balls from getting overheated and inadvertently lowering his sperm count. Then, she\u2019d purchased bottles of vitamins and cheerfully watched as he swallowed every blasted horse-sized pill. When that had no effect, she\u2019d modified their diet and limited their alcohol intake. Finally, she\u2019d insisted on sex in the missionary position only. After he ejaculated, she\u2019d prop her hips under three pillows and stay in that pose for at least half an hour...while he wandered off to watch TV. Alone.</p><p>Eventually, sex had become just another one of his daily chores. Charts, cycles, basal temperatures, books and articles on conceiving a baby were the topics of discussion\u2014but only at home. When another two years had passed and she hadn\u2019t filled the heirloom bassinet with a bundle of joy, Libby had suggested they schedule an appointment with a specialist dealing with infertility.</p><p>Quinn had flat-out refused. First, because they weren\u2019t that old. Making a baby could still happen the old-fashioned way, given time. Libby was just impatient. True, part of his refusal was masculine pride\u2014no man wants to hear he\u2019s got problems with his Johnson. The other part of his refusal was personal. It seemed his relationship with his wife was no longer based on love, but on his capability, or incapability, as a breeder.</p><p>Quinn had told Libby he was perfectly content to spend his life with her, just her, and he wasn\u2019t basing his present or future happiness on whether the stick turned pink or blue every month.</p><p>That\u2019s when things had gone downhill.</p> <p>So Quinn had lied to Ben when he claimed he hadn\u2019t seen the separation coming. He just hadn\u2019t known how to handle it, so he\u2019d done nothing to prevent it. He\u2019d been floating along, hoping like hell Libby would come around.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t. In fact, she hadn\u2019t been around at all.</p><p>Too little, too late.</p><p>Like hell. He might\u2019ve been slow on the uptake, but he was good at playing catch-up. Damn good.</p><p>The sound of Libby\u2019s car crunching on the driveway brought Quinn out of his reverie and he headed downstairs.</p><p>Her arms were overloaded with bags and Quinn rushed forward. \u201cLemme help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you want me to put them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDining room table is fine.\u201d</p><p>Libby arranged her belongings to her liking before she looked at him.</p><p>God, she was pretty. Old hairstyle or new haircut, barefaced or all made up, it didn\u2019t matter. One glimpse into her eyes was all he needed to see the real Libby. His Libby.</p><p>She bristled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t a man admire his wife?\u201d Quinn let his gaze roam over her sweet face and linger on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI thought we were gonna eat.\u201d</p><p>Staring at her made her nervous. Interesting.</p><p>\u201cWe are. Go on in and have a seat. I\u2019ll dish up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is odd, you waiting on me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo more odd than you lettin\u2019 me do it.\u201d</p><p>That retort brought forth the cute wrinkle on her forehead and no additional comment.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Soon as Quinn sat across from Libby, she frowned and started to get up. Quickly, but gently, Quinn placed his hand on her forearm. \u201cWhat do you need? I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA napkin.\u201d</p><p>He reached behind him for the wicker container and kept hold of her arm. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. So what\u2019s been happenin\u2019 in the world of books?\u201d</p><p>Libby clutched her fork. \u201cYou really interested or are you just making conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m interested, Lib, I\u2019ve always cared about what you do at the school.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied with his answer, she said, \u201cI\u2019m gearing up for the summer reading program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetcha already got quite a few kids signed up for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, actually I do. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Quinn gave her a noncommittal shoulder hitch. \u201cBecause you\u2019re you. You never do anything half-assed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, my, aren\u2019t you full of compliments tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reckon I owe you more than three months\u2019 worth so I\u2019d better start makin\u2019 up for lost time.\u201d He swept his thumb over the smooth skin on the back of her wrist. \u201cThat okay with you, darlin\u2019 wife?\u201d</p><p>She squirmed at his term of endearment but didn\u2019t try and shake off his hand, much to his surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to you acting this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta get used to it. Maybe I\u2019ve realized the error of my ways and I\u2019m a changed man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you behaved like that last night at Ziggy\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how you behaved.\u201d</p><p>Quinn chewed slowly and swallowed. \u201cYou lookin\u2019 for an apology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m sorry that sonuvabitch who had his paws all over you didn\u2019t spend all goddamn night pickin\u2019 his teeth up off the floor after I knocked \u2019em clean outta his mouth.\u201d</p><p>Libby stammered, \u201cB-but, you didn\u2019t do anything! You just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Ben said he wouldn\u2019t post bond if I beat the snot outta that snot-nosed punk. With you and me on the outs, I figured I couldn\u2019t count on you for bail money either, so I let Ben drag me away, against my will, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not apologizing?\u201d</p><p>Quinn flashed his teeth. \u201cFor actin\u2019 like a man and for protecting what\u2019s mine? Hell no.\u201d He leaned closer. \u201cDoes that shock you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. Lord, Quinn, that was completely out of character for you, cussing, threatening a guy and causing a public scene.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s because I keep that side of myself to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Should he answer? Could he?</p><p>Yes. No more hiding. Balls to the wall.</p><p>\u201cQuinn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019d scare you worse than it does me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly a delicate flower,\u201d she retorted. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve known you all my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Then did ya think I\u2019d go with my original impulse of draggin\u2019 you back home by the hair and provin\u2019 to you just who has the right to put his hands all over you?\u201d</p><p>Libby\u2019s amazing blue eyes widened, not with reproach but with...interest.</p><p>Goddamn if his cock didn\u2019t take notice.</p><p>Quinn grinned at her. \u201cEat your supper \u2019fore it gets cold.\u201d</p><p>They managed normal conversation for the remainder of the meal. Afterward, they even washed the dishes together, something they hadn\u2019t done since the first year they were married. Over coffee and cake, Quinn said, \u201cI have plans for us for tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlans to do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d He sipped the last of his coffee and added, \u201cA romantic surprise.\u201d</p><p>Quinn read the emotions warring on Libby\u2019s face. The need to question him further. The disbelief of his casual use of the word \u201cromantic\u201d. But mostly he saw a response that\u2019d been a long time coming\u2014</p><p>hopeful curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>Thank you, Jesus. \u201cI\u2019ll come get ya at twelve-thirty. It starts at one o\u2019clock. We can ride together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t telling me where you\u2019re taking me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Libby smiled. \u201cYou know it\u2019s gonna drive me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?

We were good together, weren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHas every year of our marriage been pure hell for you, Libby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. No. Not even close.\u201d Libby started to say something else but snapped her mouth shut, choosing instead to fiddle with the lace edging on the placemat.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Quinn stood. He ached to stay, but he\u2019d left her enough to mull over for one night.</p><p>On the porch, he paused to absorb the beauty of the place they called home. Dusk had fallen, turning the sky purple-gray and dusting the tree line in the distance with fluffy pink clouds. A brisk breeze rattled the bird feeders. The dark, ripe scent of wet earth filled his lungs. It seemed as if he\u2019d taken his first real breath in months.</p><p>The heat of Libby\u2019s body behind his made him turn around very slowly, even when his heart raced like a snared rabbit\u2019s. With forced casualness, Quinn said, \u201cOh, one other thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis.\u201d Quinn cupped her face in his hands. He pressed his mouth down, allowing his lips to reacquaint themselves with the softness and shape of hers beneath his. One smooth brush of his lips morphed into a dozen drugging kisses. At the insistent glide of his mouth, teasing nips of his teeth, tiny flicks of his tongue, Libby\u2019s lips parted on a soft sigh.</p><p>His tongue slipped inside and her flavor burst in his mouth, sweet coffee, sweet Libby and sweet temptation. It\u2019d been an eternity since he\u2019d kissed his wife this way, a slow seduction. A promise. A renewal of intent.</p><p>Quinn tilted her head, kicking the kiss from lazy exploration to undeniable hunger. For her. Only ever for her. A wet, wild reunion of dueling tongues, stuttered breaths and the powerful slide into passion they\u2019d either forgotten or had denied themselves.</p><p>Despite the heat and the sense of yearning, he kept their bodies apart, because what was blossoming between them again was too important to rush.</p><p>Tonight. Tomorrow all bets were off.</p><p>He forced himself to break the kiss. His hands fell away and he buried his nose in her apple-scented hair. \u201cI miss talkin\u2019 to you. Touchin\u2019 you.\u201d He kissed the start of her jawline beneath her ear. \u201cI miss the way you smell. The way you taste. The way you feel. Goddamn, I miss the everything of you, Libby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn, I...\u201d</p><p>His body was primed for action and it took every bit of willpower to step back from her. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna apologize.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>Damn, if that admission didn\u2019t cause his cock to jerk with hope. Especially when he saw her gaze drop to the bulge beneath his zipper.</p><p>Double damn. Definitely time to go. \u201cGood night, Libby. Sweet dreams.\u201d He smiled cagily and melted into the shadows.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea where he\u2019s taking you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Libby peeked out the kitchen window, feeling silly for watching for Quinn\u2019s truck to barrel up the drive. She hadn\u2019t done that for years.</p><p>\u201cAnd you just agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Jillian sighed. \u201cSis, no offense, but the last time Quinn surprised you, he brought you home a new crock pot.\u201d</p><p>Libby stuck her tongue out at the receiver. She loved that damn crock pot. Jilly didn\u2019t understand it\u2019d been an incredibly sweet gesture on Quinn\u2019s part because he so rarely acted spontaneously. \u201cHe\u2019s trying, Jilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s about damn time.\u201d</p><p>Usually Jillian\u2019s constant yakking was impossible to ignore, but today, Libby easily tuned her out.</p><p>She had more important things to tune into. Like the steamy kiss that\u2019d knocked her sideways last night.</p><p>Man. She\u2019d forgotten Quinn could kiss like that. She\u2019d forgotten she could kiss like that. She\u2019d definitely forgotten how arousing a simple kiss could be, as evidenced by the soaking wet condition of her panties when she\u2019d stumbled back into the house on wobbly knees.</p><p>And Libby couldn\u2019t help but notice Quinn\u2019s erection. Kissing her had the same effect on him\u2014a good sign\u2014since the man hadn\u2019t touched her for three months prior to their separation.</p><p>Six long months without physical intimacy. Half a year without her husband paying attention to her at all.</p><p>To cope with his apathy, she\u2019d tried a few changes around the house, dropped some weight, updated her hairstyle, makeup and wardrobe. A confidence-boosting bonus she\u2019d hoped would increase her physical attraction to her mate. But when she\u2019d marshaled the courage to ask Quinn how he liked the \u201cnew\u201d her, he\u2019d responded he\u2019d liked the old her just fine.</p><p>Quinn probably hadn\u2019t meant his remark in an unflattering way, but it\u2019d stung nevertheless. In response, she\u2019d lashed back at him like she\u2019d never done, said hurtful things and then kicked him out.</p><p>And speak of the devil; the man was kicking up a cloud of dust as he zipped up the gravel driveway.</p><p>\u201cCan I offer you some advice\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut Jillian off mid-sentence. \u201cQuinn is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLibby, will you listen to me before you hang up?\u201d</p><p>No. But Jillian would blather on anyway. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvoid talking about the baby issue. If you really want your relationship with Quinn to have a fair shot, it needs to only be about your relationship as man and wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bring up his refusal to take fertility tests or the years you\u2019ve spent trying to get pregnant to the exclusion of everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfair, Jilly. You make it sound like that\u2019s all I\u2019ve cared about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly been all you\u2019ve talked about for the last several years,\u201d Jilly gently chided. \u201cI know I\u2019m the only person you\u2019ve trusted with your frustration about your inability to conceive, so my view might be skewed.\u201d</p><p>Libby opened her mouth to argue, but a teeny germ of guilt sprouted. Only in the last twelve months she hadn\u2019t been obsessing about babies because she\u2019d been obsessing about what\u2019d gone wrong between her and her husband. She\u2019d figured by letting the big issue drop, they\u2019d be able to focus on the smaller ones.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t happened either.</p><p>She let her disquiet build as she watched Quinn hurry into the horse trailer.</p><p>\u201cLibs? You there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sorry. I\u2019m still here.\u201d Pause. \u201cWas I really that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be hard for you to hear, but yeah, you were. Sometimes I understand why Quinn didn\u2019t protest too much about the separation. It\u2019s been a rough couple years on both of you.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach lurched. If she\u2019d been so blatantly single-minded why hadn\u2019t Quinn said anything to her?</p><p>Because his unwillingness to talk about anything was the reason you asked for the separation.</p><p>But Quinn hadn\u2019t always been like that.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019s grown tired of discussing the same old things and silence was his only defense.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that to hurt you, Libs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t mention it before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t my place, honey. It was Quinn\u2019s. And we both know he wouldn\u2019t say shit if he had a mouthful.\u201d</p><p>Libby fought the urge to curl into a ball and weep. \u201cLord. How did everything get so screwed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Good luck.\u201d Jillian hung up.</p><p>Quinn exited the horse trailer and Libby caught her first glimpse of his clothes. Gray sweatpants. A faded brown and gold University of Wyoming Go Pokes! T-shirt, tennis shoes and a \u201cgimme\u201d ball cap from the local Yamaha dealership.</p><p>Whoa. Quinn never dressed casually, especially if he planned on being seen in public. Some kind of proper public cowboy attire had been hardwired into the man\u2019s DNA. Did that mean he\u2019d planned a private outing?</p><p>He bounded up the steps like an eager pup and barged right in. \u201cHeya, Libby. You look great.</p><p>Ready?\u201d</p><p>A compliment right off the bat? The man really was trying. \u201cYeah. Just let me grab my purse.\u201d</p><p>Familiar warmth spread inside and outside her body from his hand caressing the small of her back as he followed her down the porch steps.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>Quinn smiled and opened the truck door. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Inside the pickup, he patted the bench seat. \u201cScoot over. I wanna relive those times when we were first dating and you practically sat on my lap.\u201d</p><p>Touched by his request, she slid next to him until they were matched thigh-to-thigh. \u201cIs this a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as a man can be on a date with his wife of nine years.\u201d</p><p>Libby turned. His face was mere inches away.</p><p>\u201cBein\u2019s you are my wife, I\u2019m entitled to steal a kiss.\u201d Quinn angled his head and gently brushed his lips over hers one time. Then he straightened up and started the truck.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d burst out before she could stop it.</p><p>\u201cYou were expectin\u2019 something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping for a kiss like the one from last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLibby, darlin\u2019, you can kiss me like that anytime you want. Any. Damn. Time. At all. And it don\u2019t gotta stop at kissin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, Quinn had gotten his point across in his usual low-key manner. She bumped him with her shoulder. \u201cMaybe I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d He kept his hand on her thigh during the drive to Sundance.</p><p>Quinn parked in front of the Sandstone Building. It housed three separate businesses, all run by women who\u2019d married into the McKay family. Macie McKay ran Dewey\u2019s Delish Dish, Skylar McKay owned Sky Blue, and her sister, India, owned the tattoo shop, India\u2019s Ink, which were housed together in the same space, while AJ McKay operated Healing Touch Massage. It was too late to eat lunch so Libby couldn\u2019t fathom why they were here. A panicked thought struck her. \u201cAre we getting a tattoo?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed. \u201cYou oughta see your look of horror.\u201d</p><p>She noticed he hadn\u2019t answered her question. \u201cAre we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Quinn offered a wicked smile. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve got a hankerin\u2019 to tattoo my initials on your sweet little ass?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuinn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It is a sweet little ass.\u201d</p><p>Married nine years and the man could still make her blush. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>He stroked the back of his knuckles down her heated cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s been part of the problem in recent years, ain\u2019t it? Neither one of us is sayin\u2019 what we really mean, or meanin\u2019 what we say.\u201d</p><p>Libby closed her eyes and basked in his tender touch.</p> <p>\u201cI wanna fix this between us, Libby.\u201d</p><p>Me too.</p><p>Two solid raps startled them both. Quinn rolled down his window. \u201cHey, Cord, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust makin\u2019 sure you didn\u2019t get cold feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Cord grinned. \u201cGood. Took a bit of finagling, but we made room. See you two in there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn where?\u201d Libby asked.</p><p>\u201cHealing Touch.\u201d Quinn rolled up the window. \u201cAJ is offerin\u2019 a class on sensual massage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou signed us up for a class so I could learn to give you a...sexy massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go jumpin\u2019 to conclusions again. I signed up so I could learn to give you a sexy massage.\u201d</p><p>Talk about being completely pole-axed. \u201cWhen did you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday. There was, ah, a last minute cancellation so I lucked out and they squeezed us in.\u201d</p> <p>Last minute cancellation. Right. She\u2019d bet a hundred bucks he\u2019d strong-armed his way into getting a spot in that class\u2014an example of McKay nepotism at its finest. But she couldn\u2019t help being impressed.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>Quinn stayed quiet so long she was afraid he wouldn\u2019t answer. \u201cIn the last year or so you were pretty hell bent on us takin\u2019 some \u2018couples\u2019 classes together. I\u2019ll admit I was kinda a jerk about it, so I thought I\u2019d make it up to you and learn a new skill to boot.\u201d He focused his gaze out the windshield. \u201cPlus, I like touchin\u2019 you. Thought this\u2019d be a good reminder for me. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>How had she forgotten the thoughtful side of this sweet, sweet man? Libby curled her fingers around Quinn\u2019s jaw, turning his face toward her. She smashed her lips to his, kissing him crazily, kissing him like he\u2019d asked her to. Thrown off balance, she eased back and whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Inside the massage studio, chairs were lined up in front of a projection screen. All the seats but two were occupied.</p><p>Good Lord. They knew everyone in the room.</p><p>The owner of the hardware store and his wife held court in the front row. Dixie, proprietor of the Golden Boot, and her hubby of fifty years, sat next to Darnell Broken Nose, a board member of the Crow Agency and his wife, Leela. Libby expected Quinn to pull his ball cap down over his eyes out of embarrassment, but he nodded to the men and directed her to the two empty chairs.</p><p>Gorgeous, blonde and enormously pregnant AJ McKay stepped front and center. \u201cGood to see everyone this afternoon. First we\u2019ll watch a twenty-minute film on basics of massage and then we\u2019ll get to the hands-on portion of the class.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIf anyone has questions at any point, don\u2019t hesitate to ask.</p><p>And if you tend to be a little shy\u2014\u201d she looked directly at Quinn, \u201c\u2014I\u2019ll be happy to answer questions in private.\u201d</p><p>The lights dimmed. The movie rolled. Libby expected soft-core porn or worse, a thinly disguised instruction manual, but the video struck a good balance between sensuality and the how-to aspects of massage.</p><p>After the video ended, Cord unfolded four padded tables and four six-foot high privacy screens, positioning one in each corner of the narrow room.</p><p>AJ walked through the maze, stacking towels, and draping sheets over each screen. \u201cNext, I\u2019ll demonstrate tricks and techniques on my guinea pig\u2014I mean my helpful husband\u2014before I turn you loose to experiment on your own.\u201d She directed them to a massage room at the back of the building.</p><p>A shirtless Cord was stretched out on a padded table. AJ affectionately swept her hand up his spine.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>Cord grinned over his shoulder and focused on the swell of her belly. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious I\u2019m always ready for you, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>AJ dribbled oil on Cord\u2019s naked back, but the look she leveled on him said she\u2019d make him pay for that suggestive remark later, guaranteed.</p><p>Libby bit back a grin. The dynamics in the huge McKay family still fascinated her, even after being part of it for more than a decade. She got a huge kick out of how easily AJ led gruff Cord around by the nose.</p><p>The aroma of sandalwood and lemon filled the room. \u201cFirst and foremost, there is a pronounced difference between giving your partner a sensual massage and a deep tissue massage.\u201d She dug her thumbs into the base of Cord\u2019s spine and followed the line up to his neck. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to cause your partner any discomfort. The amount of pressure used isn\u2019t as important as a strong and steady touch.\u201d</p><p>In order to see AJ, Quinn leaned over Libby\u2019s shoulder. Libby had a devil of a time focusing on AJ\u2019s instructions when Quinn plastered his male hardness against her backside. Her blood raced. Her face heated. Her palms sweat. She\u2019d be a horny basket case by the time Quinn actually put his hands on her.</p><p>\u201cThe other aspect of sensual massage is setting the mood. If you have children, you\u2019ll want to plan this for when you have an hour of uninterrupted time. In most houses, the bed in the bedroom is the easiest place to set up. Music isn\u2019t necessary, but I\u2019ve found it can be both relaxing and arousing. Candles are good. They provide light, scent and ambience. Plain white cotton sheets are a smart choice. They can be warm or cool to the skin. And if you get carried away with the oil they\u2019re easy to clean. But the single most important thing to bring is a positive attitude. Making your partner feel good shouldn\u2019t be a chore. It should be a sensual enjoyment for both of you.\u201d</p><p>When Quinn whispered, \u201cAmen,\u201d in Libby\u2019s ear, a tremor of desire rippled through her.</p><p>AJ demonstrated a few more techniques and then dismissed everyone back to their areas.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suppose we\u2019re gonna do now?\u201d Libby asked when they were alone behind the partition.</p><p>Quinn held up a sheet with a cat-who-ate-the-mouse grin. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to strip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown to nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else does strip mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all those people are out there\u2014\u201d</p><p>He eliminated the distance until they were a breath apart. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me. No one else matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have a problem getting buck-ass nekkid with the family banker in the next cubicle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I knew it was gonna lead to you puttin\u2019 your hands all over me. Damn, do I love havin\u2019 your hands on me.\u201d</p><p>When had closed-mouthed Quinn McKay become such a silver-tongued devil? \u201cYou don\u2019t play fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m playin\u2019 for keeps.\u201d Quinn smooched her nose. \u201cYou want my help gettin\u2019 undressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we were home I wouldn\u2019t allow you a choice. But I\u2019ll do the gentlemanly thing, just this one time, and step outside. Whistle when you\u2019re ready for me.\u201d</p><p>Whistle. Right. And what the heck did he mean by doing the gentlemanly thing just this one time? Did Quinn plan on showing her a more verbal, more commanding side?</p><p>Libby shivered and it had nothing to do with being naked.</p><p>Quinn fought the urge to pace. He wasn\u2019t nervous so much as antsy, because after two steamy kisses, he was raring to crank up the sexual heat with his delectable wife.</p><p>AJ moved to the center of the room. \u201cOnce your partners are set, I\u2019ll come around with a bottle of oil.</p><p>This\u2019ll be your last chance to ask questions before I shut off the lights, turn on the music and leave you to your own devices.</p><p>\u201cOnce everyone is settled, I\u2019ll be in the backroom for the duration of your massage experimentation time, so you\u2019ll have no interruptions from me\u2014or anyone else\u2014within your private areas. Remember, there is no right or wrong way. Sensual massage is highly personal and having a good technique isn\u2019t nearly as important as having fun and an open mind.\u201d</p><p>The table creaked and Libby swore.</p><p>Quinn spoke through the curtained panel. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean am I naked,\u201d she said in a hushed tone, \u201cthen yes. Throw me that extra sheet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He tossed it over the partition.</p><p>Loud instrumental music started and the lights clicked off. AJ sauntered up with her usual sunny smile. She popped her head around the partition and her smile slipped. \u201cOh. Umm. That\u2019s great, Libby.</p><p>You\u2019re all set.\u201d AJ whirled on Quinn and hissed in his ear, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell her she only had to take off her shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>AJ whapped him on the arm, but her eyes twinkled. \u201cTypical McKay man. Here\u2019s your oil. Put it to good use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to.\u201d</p><p>Quinn skirted the privacy panel and sucked in a harsh breath. Lordy, look at that. Libby\u2019s bare, toned arms were stretched above her head. Save for the sheet covering her lower half, her sexy, freckled back was completely exposed and his for the taking.</p><p>She lifted her head. Her eyes darted past the partition. \u201cQuinn, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust us, remember?\u201d He uncapped the oil and drizzled a thin line across her shoulders and spine in a T-shape. \u201cI\u2019ll start at the top and work my way down, is that all right with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is. Keep that in mind later.\u201d When his hands touched her skin, his cock went hard as a brick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, she was so feminine. So warm. So perfectly supple.</p><p>So his.</p><p>At first, Quinn feared he\u2019d freeze up. But faced with Libby\u2019s naked body spread out in a sumptuous feast, when he\u2019d been starving for her for months, something instinctual kicked in.</p> <p>Lust.</p><p>He swept his fingertips through the oil, hoping it\u2019d lessen the abrasiveness of his callused hands. He played connect the dots with her moles and freckles, promising himself he\u2019d use his tongue next time. Once the oil glistened across her torso, he began to rub it in.</p><p>If her sighs and moans were any indication, he must\u2019ve been doing something right.</p><p>Quinn worked his thumbs into the tensed muscles stretching across her back, rounding to the bottom of her shoulder blades. Then he gradually moved down her spine, a vertebra at a time. When he reached the sexy dimples above her ass, an area he remembered as highly sensitive, he decreased the pressure. His touches became playful. As Quinn drew ever-widening circles, she arched into his teasing caresses.</p><p>\u201cQuinn\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Instantly, his mouth was by her ear. \u201cSomething you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No. I...I wanted to tell you I love the way you\u2019re touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He smiled against her damp neck and rained kisses along her nape, pleased as punch when gooseflesh broke out beneath his questing lips.</p><p>Quinn continued his sensual assault. His hands mapped her every tempting curve, his fingers soothed every quivering muscle. When he finished tormenting one area, he\u2019d scatter openmouthed kisses over each inch of bared flesh before focusing his attention on the next trembling section.</p><p>When he completed his final pass to those alluring dimples, he caught a whiff of Libby\u2019s arousal. A primal male need slammed into him. His chance of tamping it down vanished, especially when he noticed her hips bumping up to meet his every touch.</p><p>Libby faced the screen, almost as if she was hiding her reaction from him.</p> <p>Oh hell no. That wouldn\u2019t do at all.</p><p>As Quinn put his lips to her ear, he traced the crack of her ass down to where her body was warm and sticky. He groaned in her hair. \u201cLemme touch you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Libby\u2019s shoulders shot up.</p><p>Quinn pushed them back down. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we aren\u2019t supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t supposed to what? Ain\u2019t no rules but mine. This is my show, remember? Raise your hips higher so I can reach your sweet spot.\u201d</p><p>She had a moment of hesitation before she complied.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Quinn slid his first and middle fingers through the sweet cream pouring from her sex, combining it with the oil, swirling the mixture up. After a few concentrated strokes, he slipped his fingers into her pussy, letting her clit rest on the bony section at the base of his thumb.</p> <p>\u201cOh. That does feel really good.\u201d</p><p>He wiggled his fingers around the snug channel, satisfaction filled him at seeing her writhing and trying to force his fingers deeper.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Quinn was in a fog of lust. His need to prove he could still satisfy his mate became a single-minded pursuit.</p><p>At her whispered plea, \u201cFaster,\u201d Quinn lost it. Pumping his fingers inside her, he growled in her ear,</p><p>\u201cI wanna fuck you like this, darlin\u2019 wife. Face down on the dining room table, no foreplay, just hard, fast fucking. Poundin\u2019 into this pussy until you scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. God. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it to me, Libby. Come around my fingers. Prove to me you love the way only I can make you come.\u201d</p><p>Libby gasped.</p><p>\u201cSsh. When we\u2019re home you can cause a ruckus, but this time be quiet.\u201d He whispered, \u201cAnd don\u2019t that just make our naughty little secret so much raunchier, knowin\u2019 you gotta be still when your whole body is buckin\u2019 for release?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn...I\u2019m gonna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome. Now.\u201d</p><p>Another gasp escaped Libby\u2019s sweet mouth as her orgasm exploded. Quinn felt it everywhere, a rhythmic pulling around his fingers, a steady throbbing where her clit pressed into his hand, even the skin on her back pulsed the same cadence. He stared greedily as her climax inundated her.</p><p>On a final sigh, Libby slumped to the table.</p><p>Quinn removed his hand from between her thighs and loomed over her. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you taste.\u201d He placed his fingers inside his mouth and sucked noisily. Then he traced her lips with his wet fingers. \u201cTaste yourself.\u201d</p><p>Heat flashed in Libby\u2019s eyes. Keeping their gazes locked, she parted her lips, sucking his fingers to the knuckles. Quinn growled at feeling her hot little tongue swirling around the rough skin. He withdrew his fingers, flipped her over, and took her mouth savagely.</p><p>The kiss was out of control from the start. After several blissful minutes, Quinn managed to find his sanity before they fucked right there in AJ\u2019s massage studio. He slipped his lips free from hers and placed them against her ear. \u201cGet dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done here, Libby. Get dressed. Fast.\u201d He drew in a deep breath. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>In such close proximity, he felt\u2014rather than saw\u2014her nod. Unable to control his need for her or his raging hard-on, he presented his back to her, trying like hell to ignore the sexy sounds of her uneven breathing and the rustle of her clothing.</p><p>Libby cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He clasped her hand and ushered her outside without another word.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The wind whistled, blowing leaves and debris around their feet. Although Libby\u2019s mind was hazed with pleasure, she hated that Quinn was dragging her off like a disobedient child.</p><p>She dug her bootheels into the sidewalk and jerked them to a stop.</p><p>Quinn whirled around.</p><p>Everything feminine inside her cheered at his scorching look. His gorgeous blue eyes were nearly black, not from rage, but from passion, which increased her determination to set things straight before they took another step\u2014literally or figuratively.</p><p>Testily, he said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you haul me out of there so damn fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>Yippee, he was back to one-word answers. \u201cWere you embarrassed about what just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was hot as hell.\u201d Libby\u2019s gaze dropped to the front of Quinn\u2019s sweats. Bingo. Damn impressive tent. She smirked. \u201cAre we leaving because you have a hard-on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Libby, will you get in the goddamn truck so we can talk about this at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Quinn stared at her as if she\u2019d morphed into a three-eyed, green-tentacled alien life form.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s okay for you to get me off in public, but I can\u2019t return the favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Libby grabbed him by the shirtsleeve and towed him around the corner of the building. Luckily, this side of the two-story brick structure faced an empty lot. She pressed her back against the sandstone bricks and tugged him. Well, she tried to tug him, but the solidly built man wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeducing you. Fair\u2019s fair, Quinn. I wanna get you off. Right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, woman, what\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten into me, remember whose fingers were in who?\u201d Libby wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cHoist me against this wall and rub your cock on me until you come.\u201d</p><p>She could picture her husband mentally compiling a list of pros and cons. \u201cWe\u2019re outside. Anyone could see us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLibby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Can you blame me for wanting more of the wild man I met behind the curtain?\u201d Libby rubbed her lips over the baby-smooth line of his jaw and he angled his head, allowing her better access to all the tasty spots. \u201cYou\u2019ve held back with me, Quinn. Sometimes you\u2019ve shown me a glimpse of that beast inside you. If we\u2019re really going to try and make this work, no more secrets between us. No more politeness. No more PC behavior. No more hiding behind a mask.\u201d</p><p>He squinted at her. \u201cIf I lower my mask, you\u2019d better be prepared to lower yours too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means I wanna see some of the shine worn off the perfect rancher\u2019s wife halo you wear like a tiara. Hell, I\u2019d love to knock that crown right off your pretty, proper little head.\u201d</p><p>There was the opening she\u2019d longed for. Masks off, gloves off, the real down and dirty side to each of them, squaring off with no rules. She said, \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Quinn\u2019s eyes took on a predatory look. \u201cMake doubly sure you mean what you\u2019re sayin\u2019, \u2019cause once I let that cat outta the bag, it ain\u2019t ever goin\u2019 back in. I\u2019ve got some dark edges I\u2019ve never explored, Libby.</p><p>Be one-hundred-percent sure you can handle \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>For a split second, Libby\u2019s determination wavered, seeing the steely glint of danger in her husband\u2019s eyes. But she\u2019d loved him long enough to know he wouldn\u2019t physically hurt her. In fact, he\u2019d probably hidden those rough edges to protect her. Silly man.</p><p>Meeting his gaze dead on, she gave him an unequivocal, \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. Now show me, dammit.\u201d</p><p>His answering snarl was decidedly feral. Quinn clamped his mouth to hers as he clapped his hands on her ass and boosted her against the building.</p><p>Libby circled her legs around his hips as he lined his cock to the top of her cleft, rocking his pelvis, so the length, from root to tip, rubbed perfectly on her pubic bone. He groaned in her mouth and kissed her harder.</p><p>Yes. This was what she\u2019d wanted. His uninhibited response. A chance to crack the gentlemanly cowboy mantle that weighted him down like a yoke.</p><p>His every grinding stroke hit her clitoris. Her sex swelled and wept and gloried in the friction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quinn ripped his mouth free and nestled his cheek beside hers. \u201cBeen so long. God, Libby. I\u2019m already there.\u201d His rhythm never faltered, even through his short and choppy breaths. \u201cLift your shirt. Pull my sweats down so I can come on your belly.\u201d</p><p>Those gruff words alone would\u2019ve been enough to get her hot again, but she was already past the point of no return. Libby reached between them. The head of his cock poked up past the waistband of his sweatpants. He\u2019d gone commando. Handy. She briefly touched the sleek maleness before aligning the weeping tip above her belly button. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>The thrusts were hard and fast. Quinn\u2019s head snapped back with enough force his hat fell to the dirt.</p> <p>Libby shamelessly watched pleasure contort her husband\u2019s face as he came with a low moan. His pelvis kept pumping until warmth spurted across her stomach. With the constant abrasion to her clit, another quick orgasm erupted that left her gasping and selfishly wanting more.</p><p>Quinn stilled and slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>Rather than break the moment, Libby swirled her fingertips through the come dripping down her belly. She brought the slickly coated fingers to her mouth, licking at the salty offering. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>His powerful gaze never wavered. Not even when she traced the seam of his lips with her wet fingers and demanded, \u201cTaste.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation Quinn drew her fingers deeply into his mouth and sucked.</p> <p>Her sex clenched. Her blood seemed to sizzle and pop beneath her skin. Who was this wild man? She managed a raspy, \u201cQuinn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, darlin\u2019 wife. Home. Now.\u201d He gently deposited her on the ground. Hat on, their clothes somewhat back in order, he guided her to the truck.</p><p>On the road home, Quinn reached for her hand, but didn\u2019t urge her to sit next to him. Nor did he speak, which caused a heightened sense of sexual awareness in the confines of the silent cab. Her stomach flipped whenever the coarse pad of Quinn\u2019s thumb stroked the pulse point on the inside of her wrist.</p><p>After he\u2019d parked in front of the house, Quinn turned off the engine, but didn\u2019t attempt to get out of the pickup. He lounged against the door. Not in a relaxed manner, but tensed, like a coiled snake about to strike.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His very hungry, very male gaze executed a methodical sweep of her body, from the tip of her nose to the toes of her boots. \u201cStrip.\u201d</p> <p>Not the response she\u2019d expected. \u201cRight here? In the truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Here\u2019s that darker edge, Libby. I ain\u2019t foolin\u2019 around when I say take off your damn clothes.</p><p>Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a striptease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like. I don\u2019t care just as long as you get nekkid. Fast.\u201d</p><p>The demand was so unlike Quinn.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t this what you wanted? To witness the dark side of your lover you suspected he kept hidden from you?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Libby tentatively unbuttoned her blouse. Once she\u2019d taken it off, she looked to him for further instruction.</p><p>\u201cAll of it. Bra, jeans, thong.\u201d He grinned. \u201cHave I mentioned how much I love seein\u2019 nuthin\u2019 marring that sweet ass except a single string? Them bright pink ones are my favorite.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. She\u2019d assumed he hated the changes she\u2019d made in the last year, since he hadn\u2019t said a word, good, bad or otherwise. Seemed she\u2019d been mistaken.</p><p>What else had she been mistaken about when it came to her husband?</p><p>\u201cLibby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m doing it.\u201d First, she yanked at her boots. She\u2019d been in such a hurry to leave the massage studio she\u2019d pulled her boots on over her jeans. After peeling off her socks, Libby glanced over at him.</p><p>\u201cBra next. I wanna see your tits bouncin\u2019 and swayin\u2019 as you\u2019re wigglin\u2019 outta them skin-tight jeans.\u201d</p><p>Her face flamed at the mental picture he\u2019d painted. \u201cQuinn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised. You gotta remember how much I love your tits.\u201d He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cOr am I gonna have to give you a very intensive refresher course? \u2019Cause I am so all over that.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. She couldn\u2019t believe how hot his dirty talk and highhanded behavior made her. Her thong was soaked. She rubbed her thighs together as she sought the bra clasp in the middle of her back. Libby slipped the satin straps down her biceps. Once her arms were freed, she playfully flung the lacy bra in Quinn\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cGod, I forgot how pretty your nipples are.\u201d Quinn licked his lips. \u201cGet them britches off.\u201d</p><p>Libby rested her shoulders on the door and wiggled her hips. As her fingers made quick work of the button and zipper, she hoped her cottage-cheese thighs wouldn\u2019t jiggle as much as her boobs. She shimmied the denim and her underwear down her legs, past her knees and calves, kicking them to the floorboard.</p><p>Quinn didn\u2019t utter a peep. Libby stayed motionless, red-faced, heart pounding, blood racing, perched naked as the day she was born, on the front seat of his truck, in broad daylight.</p><p>\u201cLibby. Darlin\u2019, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She slowly elevated her chin. Quinn\u2019s face glowed with pure male heat. And his eyes. Lord, his indigo eyes were filled with such love and need, that her soul nearly burst.</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful. You\u2019ve always been the most beautiful girl in the world to me. That hasn\u2019t changed in fourteen years. The way I feel about you hasn\u2019t changed. It never will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat said...\u201d He distractedly adjusted his cock. When he realized she\u2019d been staring at his crotch, his palm repeatedly stroked the bulge between his legs. \u201cOh, little wifey mine. I\u2019m likin\u2019 this naughty side of you. I like it so much, in fact, that I\u2019m gonna give you fair warnin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, Quinn removed his hat. Stripped off his T-shirt. Toed off his shoes and socks.</p><p>But he left his sweatpants on.</p><p>\u201cFair warning about what?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cFair warnin\u2019 that after you run into the house, I\u2019m gonna be hot on your heels. And when I catch you, I\u2019m gonna fuck you right where you stand.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thumped a whole lot faster.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to let the cat outta the bag and here I am, more than ready to pounce.\u201d</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cSo if I\u2019m the cat, I guess that makes you\u2014\u201d his gaze swept over her impatiently, \u201c\u2014the mouse.\u201d</p><p>Ah hell, she was so screwed.</p><p>And she loved every second of it.</p><p>Quinn showed his teeth in a ravenous smile. \u201cNow\u2019s your chance. Run little mouse, run.\u201d</p><p>Libby opened the truck door just as Quinn lunged at her. Modesty forgotten, she raced up the walkway naked.</p><p>Three. Two. One.</p><p>Quinn leapt out of the truck.</p><p>He ignored the burn and sting of the concrete on his bare feet. His focus was on one thing.</p><p>Libby.</p><p>Finding her. Fucking her. Marking her. A possessive, red haze, more animal than man, fogged his neural pathways. Every pounding footstep echoed in his head as a mantra: mine mine mine.</p><p>He tore up the porch steps and shouldered aside the front door. The kitchen zipped by in a blur. He sprinted past the dining room table into the front room.</p><p>No. Wait. He stopped. Backtracked in mind and body. There she was, trying to blend into the wall separating the three-season room from the living room.</p><p>Silly woman. She\u2019d never been a wallflower in his eyes. She\u2019d never blended. She\u2019d always been the only one who\u2019d stood out in every crowd. From the first moment he\u2019d seen her.</p><p>Find her. Fuck her. Mark her.</p><p>Mine mine mine.</p><p>Quinn growled and advanced on her.</p><p>Libby remained utterly still. He ripped off his sweats and stood naked and fully aroused before her.</p><p>He slapped his hands on the wall above her head, but she didn\u2019t flinch.</p><p>He planted his mouth next to her ear. \u201cI found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d Quinn rubbed his cheek over hers, marking her with his scent.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine. Only. Ever. Mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that too, Quinn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you also know how I wanna fuck you, little mouse?\u201d Quinn let his lips trail to where her pulse jumped frantically in her throat.</p><p>\u201cAh. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you. You\u2019re gonna be face-first against this wall. Me rammin\u2019 into that sweet, wet, hot, tight pussy from behind, takin\u2019 what belongs to me. And when I can\u2019t hold back another second?\u201d He flicked his tongue across the hollow of her throat. \u201cThen I\u2019m gonna pull out and come all over your back.</p><p>Just like I came all over your front.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered a sound of pure need.</p><p>Quinn spun Libby forward, positioning her arms above her head, flattening her palms to the wall. He curled his hands around her hips and angled her pelvis for easier, faster, deeper entry.</p><p>He slid his right hand over her swollen pussy lips and used the thick cream to stroke her clit. \u201cYou\u2019re drippin\u2019 wet thinkin\u2019 about what I\u2019m gonna do to you.\u201d</p><p>Another moan. Louder.</p><p>\u201cGonna be fast, hard and dirty, darlin\u2019 wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>Quinn kept his hold on the front of her body as his left hand aligned his cock. He thrust to the root with one sharp snap of his hips.</p><p>Tight. Hot. Wet. Damn. It was good to be inside her. It was damn good to be home.</p><p>\u201cOh. God. Yes.\u201d Her hoarsely spoken words shattered what little restraint he had left.</p><p>He slammed in. Withdrew quickly and rammed in again. Over and over. Setting a pace that robbed him of reason and the ability to do anything but sate his need for her by fucking her.</p><p>Sweat dampened his hair and trickled down his spine. Blood pounded in his head, his throat, his heart.</p><p>His groin was on fire.</p><p>A familiar tightening at the base of his cock signaled he\u2019d reached the end point. Four, five, six, ball-bruising thrusts and he withdrew from Libby in time to take himself in hand. He jacked his cock hard and aimed at her lower back, groaning at every hot burst of come exploding from his dick. He watched each spurt dotting her skin and a primal roar arose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Soon as the final shot was over, he pressed his belly to her back, spreading his fluid between them.</p><p>\u201cQuinn. I-I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d Gripping her left hip in his left hand, he used his right fingers to rub her distended clit. No teasing touches. He focused every bit of attention on that pouting bundle of nerves.</p><p>Libby gasped. \u201cYes. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Come for me. Show me you can still come undone at my touch.\u201d</p><p>Powerful contractions pulsed beneath his finger and Libby threw her head back. Quinn latched onto the sweet spot at the nape of her neck and suckled strongly, gifting her with a mark.</p><p>She bumped her pelvis in time to the throbbing pulses until they stopped. Then she sighed dreamily.</p><p>He whispered fiercely, \u201cYou\u2019re mine. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p><p>After a minute or so, she wiggled her butt. \u201cGood thing, because I think we\u2019re stuck together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppears so.\u201d Lightly, he said, \u201cYou mind bein\u2019 stuck with me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond right away.</p><p>Quinn waited, even though it damn near killed him.</p><p>Libby released another long sigh. \u201cI\u2019m finding the idea of being stuck with you more appealing than I imagined a day ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can work with that. Hang on.\u201d He turned her and slipped his right arm behind her knees, cradling her to his chest as he lifted her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cQuinn! I\u2019m too heavy for you to carry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you ain\u2019t. Now hush up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Sheer grit helped him scale the flight of stairs. He paused in front of their bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cWith you carrying me, I feel like a bride again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna treat you like a new bride. \u2019Cept better, \u2019cause this time around I\u2019ll have the benefit of years of experience as a bridegroom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what will you do with those years of experience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse them to please my darlin\u2019 wife.\u201d Quinn adjusted his stance. \u201cOnce we cross this threshold, it\u2019ll be like we\u2019re startin\u2019 over.\u201d</p><p>She wiped a bead of sweat from his temple. \u201cWhy, Quinn McKay. That was downright romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m tryin\u2019. So what say you, bride of mine? Shall we christen the marriage bed?\u201d Then Quinn saw tears swimming in her pretty eyes. \u201cHey, now. None of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. You\u2019re so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet? Woman, it rips my guts out to see you cryin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven happy tears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny kind of tears.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cThen take me to bed and see if you can\u2019t turn my tears into screams of pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, I can do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The instant Quinn deposited her on the bed, Libby yawned. Lord. She\u2019d been through the wringer the last few hours. Emotionally. Physically. Her body was relaxed from the massage, as well as sated from the hot, fast orgasm. The cool sheets against her heated skin induced a strong wave of sleepiness.</p><p>\u201cI saw that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour yawn.\u201d Quinn propped a hip on the mattress next to hers. \u201cTired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh.\u201d She yawned again.</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cLiar. Why don\u2019t you take a little catnap?\u201d</p><p>Libby allowed a quick smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean a little mouse nap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a complaint about our game of cat and mouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. \u2019Cause that was the best time I\u2019ve had in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other in silence until Quinn tenderly swept a hank of hair from her forehead. He kept floating his knuckles up and down the side of her face.</p><p>Such serious eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cRest up. I ain\u2019t nearly done with you. Not even close. Not by half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, maybe you oughta rest up too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I need a break so I can get it up later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I just don\u2019t want to nap alone.\u201d Libby impishly nipped the inside of his wrist. \u201cI miss how you used to hold me all night. Like you couldn\u2019t bear to be away from me for a single second, even in sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems a long time ago, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lifetime. Come to bed, Quinn. Remind us both of what we\u2019ve been missing.\u201d</p><p>He stood and dove over her, almost bouncing her off the mattress.</p><p>Libby shrieked, thrilled by his playful side.</p><p>In one fell swoop, Quinn wrapped himself around her, tucking her head to his chest so their naked bodies were entwined. He pulled the quilt up and bussed her crown.</p><p>The steady thump thump thump of his heart lulled her into a sense of peace.</p><p>An insistent circle drawn around the tip of her nipple woke her. Warm, supple lips drifted over hers in a seductive tease, bestowing fleeting kisses, interspersed with firm-lipped nips.</p><p>Libby opened her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m just gettin\u2019 started.\u201d Quinn kissed the corners of her mouth and traced the seam with the point of his tongue.</p><p>Libby parted her lips, an invitation for a more thorough kiss. He gently sank his teeth into her bottom lip and tugged. When a whimpering moan rumbled from her throat, Quinn didn\u2019t just kiss her, he inhaled her. His hands were on her breasts, his cock was slapping her belly, his tongue was thrusting against hers in a full-body kiss.</p><p>Then his mouth left a hot trail down her neck, straight to her cleavage. He glanced up at her from beneath lowered lashes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait \u2019til you woke up so I could get my mouth all over these, because damn, do I love your tits. I\u2019m gonna take my time refreshing my memory of them.\u201d He rubbed his face over the plumped mounds cupped in his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long, Lib. God, I miss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but I miss bein\u2019 with you, nekkid or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>She understood his difficulty in admitting the tiniest show of need. Softly, she said, \u201cI know,\u201d and threaded her fingers through his silky hair.</p><p>He bent his head and lapped at her left nipple. Never using his whole mouth, never sucking, just licking in a delicate manner. The pad of his thumb swept the lower swell of the other breast in an erotic arc.</p><p>He switched to her right nipple and did the exact same thing. Slowly. Sensually. Systematically.</p><p>No doubt, Quinn planned to torture her.</p><p>He placed his mouth on the top of her breast and sucked. Hard.</p><p>Libby gasped.</p><p>Quinn only broke the tight suction to apply the same stinging bite to the other side. A dark gleam of satisfaction filled his eyes when he angled back to admire the love-bruises.</p><p>That\u2019s when the real assault began. Quinn suckled and nipped and licked, using his teeth, his fingers, his breath until she writhed in abandon. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her plea and flicked his tongue rapidly over the right nipple, blowing on the wet tip until it puckered into a tight point.</p><p>Just when Libby couldn\u2019t take any more, that wickedly talented mouth traveled south. He paused to trace the indentation of her navel. He scattered kisses from hipbone to hipbone, letting his soft hair tickle her belly.</p><p>\u201cQuinn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d He lifted his head. \u201cHand me a pillow so I can prop your hips higher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna see you. All of you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if he hadn\u2019t seen her privates before. Yet her inborn sense of modesty caused her to waver.</p><p>He nuzzled her mound. \u201cDon\u2019t you want me to eat my fill of your sweet pussy? You used to like it.\u201d</p><p>His tongue wiggled an inch or so down her cleft. \u201cOr has it been so long you don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember. I just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen grab a pillow. Now.\u201d</p><p>Another glimpse of that darker edge. She tossed him a pillow and raised her hips while he placed it under her butt.</p><p>\u201cMove your legs apart. I need room to work.\u201d</p><p>Libby hoped after he arranged her she\u2019d feel less like she was getting a pelvic exam and more like she was about to receive the most amazing oral sex of her life.</p><p>\u201cWe seemed to have lost our momentum, darlin\u2019 wife.\u201d The bed jiggled as Quinn scooted down until his head disappeared between her legs.</p><p>After one long, wet lash of his tongue, Libby said, \u201cI definitely remember.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against the tender flesh and the vibration sent her belly muscles rippling.</p><p>With her hips propped up, Quinn\u2019s hands were free to roam. He stroked the inside of her thighs while his tongue drew feather-light circles around her clit. Then he\u2019d back off, his growling noises heightened her excitement as he lapped at the juices dampening her entrance.</p><p>Quinn knew exactly how to make her body hum. So it surprised her when he asked, \u201cWhich feels better? This?\u201d Using firmed lips, he opened and closed his mouth over her pussy lips and clit in little biting increments.</p><p>\u201cOh, I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about this?\u201d His fingers pulled back the hood covering her clitoris and he randomly flicked just the very tip of his tongue over the hot spot.</p><p>An electric tingle shot straight up her center. \u201cWhoa. Where\u2019d you learn that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured maybe it was time for this old dog to learn new tricks.\u201d He paused. \u201cIf I did something you didn\u2019t like, or if you wanted more of something you did like, you\u2019d tell me, right?\u201d</p><p>Did he think his...technique was off? Lord. She\u2019d never had any complaints about his oral talents. In fact, it\u2019d always scared her that he instinctively could catapult her into pleasure in no time flat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had Quinn suffered a crisis of faith in his skills as a lover? Was that somehow her fault?</p><p>You\u2019ve been so focused on the results of sex\u2014creating a baby\u2014you\u2019ve forgotten the best part of sex is creating lifelong intimacy with the person you trust above all others.</p><p>Libby gazed at him. When had their marriage become only about what she wanted and needed? What about Quinn\u2019s wants and needs?</p><p>\u201cLib? Darlin\u2019, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the lump of guilt stuck in her throat. Quinn deserved better than the little he\u2019d been getting from her. Sobering, to consider she had just as much changing to do as she\u2019d expected from him\u2014</p><p>maybe more. Those changes wouldn\u2019t happen overnight for either of them, but she\u2019d do her part, starting right now.</p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong.\u201d Libby\u2019s voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you. Being with you like this.</p><p>Whenever you put your mouth on me I can\u2019t think of anything else but how great you make me feel.\u201d</p><p>Quinn\u2019s eyes shone with male pride. He slapped his palms on the inside of her thighs and his dark head descended.</p><p>Libby held her breath. Every muscle in her body clenched in anticipation of the next swipe of his wet tongue.</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. I can feel the tension vibrating off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not tension, Quinn. It\u2019s lust. I don\u2019t need new tricks. I just need you.\u201d</p><p>An animalistic snarl was her only signal she\u2019d pushed him to the brink.</p><p>No gentleness, just hunger. His single-minded, unyielding pursuit of her pleasure sent her body into overdrive. Dizzy from the sensations bombarding her, Libby closed her eyes, lost in the burning brand of his skilled mouth, the sweet suction, the bruising grip of his fingers. With her every shallow breath, Quinn\u2019s musky aroma filled her lungs.</p><p>Two fingers slipped into her sheath, curling behind her pubic bone, and she bowed off the bed.</p><p>He flickered his tongue over her clitoris in short, fast stabs as he rubbed her innermost tissues with his fingertips. Not in and out, but in the sweetest, erotic internal caress.</p><p>Before she\u2019d gotten used to the feeling of fullness from those clever, fondling fingers, her blood gathered in the hot spot beneath his dancing tongue. \u201cQuinn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019ll get you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck harder.\u201d</p><p>He did.</p><p>She clutched his hair. The orgasm flooded her, a throbbing, take-her-breath-away seizure of pulsing bliss. A drawn out, \u201cOh God,\u201d escaped as she arched hard into him, thrashing against the sheets and rolling her hips into his face.</p> <p>He kept his mouth suctioned to her clit until the pulses slowed.</p><p>She flopped into the mattress with a final groan. Her body twitched as he gently lapped the super-sensitized areas of her sex, and she swore she felt him grin against the crease of her thigh when she sighed again.</p><p>Libby peeled her eyes open, pushing herself up on her elbows. \u201cWhat other new tricks did you learn?\u201d</p><p>Quinn laughed and gave her one last deliberate lick. \u201cNow where\u2019s the fun in tellin\u2019 you? I\u2019d rather show you. Later. First,\u201d he crawled up her body with an unholy gleam in his eyes, \u201cyou\u2019re gonna return the favor.\u201d</p><p>Libby licked her lips and looked at his cock.</p><p>\u201cYou can use that pretty little tongue on me later. I\u2019ve got something else in mind right now.</p><p>Something I\u2019ve fantasized about doin\u2019 for a long time. The old me was too polite to ask. The new me, well...he\u2019s a bit more demandin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>He straddled her belly and slid his knees next to her armpits. \u201cI wanna feel these tits cushioning my cock as I\u2019m slidin\u2019 it here.\u201d The tip of his index finger drew a line from the hollow of her throat down through her cleavage.</p><p>Libby wasn\u2019t gawking at him as if he were the biggest pervert on the planet, but frown lines appeared between her eyebrows, which meant she was thinking hard.</p><p>\u201cShocked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just wondering if you thought I was so prissy that I wouldn\u2019t want to try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLibby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought it up, so answer the damn question.\u201d</p><p>The old Quinn would\u2019ve clammed up. The new Quinn got right in her face. \u201cWhat would you have said, darlin\u2019 wife, if I would\u2019ve demanded to fuck these luscious tits? Not only that, I wanna come all over them. There\u2019s something mighty appealin\u2019 about seein\u2019 my sperm dotted all over your pretty freckled skin.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cSo, you didn\u2019t ask me because you were waiting to fulfill that particular fantasy with another woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d Jesus. Was his even-keeled Libby acting all pissed off because he hadn\u2019t asked her?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your wife, Quinn. I\u2019ve been your lover for fourteen years. Why couldn\u2019t you ask me or tell me what you want from me in bed?\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, he snapped, \u201cBecause of the way I was raised. It ain\u2019t exactly easy for me to look my wife in the eyes and demand the sexual stuff that\u2019s out of the norm. Especially when we\u2019ve been told that wantin\u2019 that kind of kink is just plain wrong.\u201d</p><p>What he didn\u2019t say\u2014what he\u2019d never say because it\u2019d hurt her beyond repair\u2014is in the last few years, when they were trying for a baby, the only place she wanted his sperm was in her baby channel. She\u2019d stopped giving him handjobs or blowjobs, unless it led to him sticking his dick in her and filling her with his seed.</p><p>Libby stared at him. A dozen different expressions crossed her face. None of them good.</p><p>Ah crap. Sexual playtime was obviously over. His cock had gone soft. His hopes had gone south. He scooted back, but she clamped her fingers into the top of his thighs, keeping him in place.</p><p>Quinn heard a muttered stupid tumbling from her pursed lips. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we\u2019ve both been so stupid. Full of pride. Listening to other people\u2019s viewpoints, and not deciding our own.\u201d Her grip on his legs turned into a caress. \u201cI\u2019ve been so insistent on being a \u2018proper\u2019</p><p>wife to you that I\u2019ve actually not been any kind of wife at all, least of all the kind of wife you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLibby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out. And you\u2019re so worried I\u2019m gonna think you\u2019re a pervert that you\u2019re afraid to ask me to take a walk on the wild side of sex with you.\u201d Her gaze roamed his face. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, half-worried, half-hopeful of where this conversation was headed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be like that between us any more. No more tiptoeing around what we want because it might be considered dirty. I want sex to be fun and raunchy and spontaneous like it\u2019s been today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re bein\u2019 honest, I don\u2019t always wanna be the one to get things goin\u2019 in the bedroom.</p><p>It\u2019d be good if you touched me without me havin\u2019 to ask.\u201d</p><p>Libby beamed a decidedly naughty smile. \u201cDid you like me dragging you around the corner and demanding you get your rocks off on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen bring your cock closer so I can suck on it. Once that bad boy is hard, let\u2019s see how it feels sliding between my tits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I wanna fulfill your every fantasy, Quinn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn. Hearin\u2019 nasty talk comin\u2019 from that sweet mouth is a fuckin\u2019 turn on, Lib.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d slid her hands up until they were curled around his ass. She urged him forward. \u201cGimme.\u201d</p><p>Quinn leaned until he could grip the brass rails of the headboard. He kept enough space so he could look down and watch the show.</p><p>And what a show his sexy wife put on for him. His cock had already started to stir, but it was still soft enough she could get the whole thing in her mouth. The warmth and wetness of Libby\u2019s mouth surrounding his dick...nothing like it in the world. Nothing. It was sheer heaven.</p><p>Libby\u2019s little humming noises sent chills up his shaft and vibrating through his body. After teasing him to distraction, she released his erection. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed it. You\u2019re as good at it as you ever were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could get used to this sweet-talkin\u2019 side of you, darlin\u2019 husband.\u201d Libby stretched her arms above her head, fully aware he was watching how her breasts swayed with the sensual movement. \u201cNow what?</p><p>Do you wanna get right to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably be a good idea to use some lube.\u201d Quinn reached toward the nightstand drawer where they stashed the K-Y, and Libby nearly knocked him off the bed when she scrambled upright.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I can reach it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we won\u2019t need any.\u201d She tugged him back on top of her. \u201cLet\u2019s just do it like this.\u201d</p><p>His funny feeling intensified when he noticed the guilty expression his wife wore. \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you wanna get started? Since this has been a longtime fantasy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But I want the K-Y.\u201d He dodged her wandering hands and his fingers connected with the drawer handle.</p><p>\u201cQuinn. Wait.\u201d</p><p>Stay calm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the drawer, Libby?\u201d He\u2019d lose his fucking mind if he found an opened box of condoms.</p><p>Absolutely lose his fucking mind.</p><p>\u201cI can explain.\u201d</p><p>Keeping his eyes on his wife, Quinn jerked the drawer open.</p><p>She turned her head toward the opposite wall.</p><p>He inhaled deeply before he looked. He didn\u2019t move for the longest time. \u201cWhen did you buy this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. My sister did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJilly thought this might come in handy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Libby raised her chin to the level he deemed stubborn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHas it come in handy?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Rather than demand her response, Quinn picked it up and turned it on.

I was curious and horny and I burned through an entire sixteen pack of batteries in the first week. Happy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it make you happy?\u201d Quinn tossed the tube of K-Y on the bed and moved over her so they were face-to-face. \u201cIs this piece of vibrating plastic better than the real thing?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt takes the edge off, but it\u2019s...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpersonal. Mechanical. Not you.\u201d She gave him a considering look. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d The grin he\u2019d been hiding bloomed. \u201cI\u2019d been tryin\u2019 to figure out a way to bring up sex toys to spice up our sex life long before our...break. I\u2019m happy to see you\u2019re good with it.\u201d Quinn lowered his head, reviving their desire with a steamy kiss.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Libby whispered against his mouth, \u201cYou ready to fulfill your fantasy?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Quinn rolled her so she was on top.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to ride me so I can test out your new toy.\u201d</p><p>Libby blushed.</p><p>\u201cYou already know how much I love to see certain parts of you bouncin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Her whole body seemed to flame with embarrassment.</p><p>He brushed his finger over the hot spot on her cheekbone. \u201cInterestin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can still make you blush. I\u2019ll probably try to turn your cheeks bright red when you\u2019re an eighty-year-old lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think we\u2019ll still be together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I can\u2019t imagine my life without you, Libby. These last few months have been pure hell.\u201d</p><p>Even though Libby was buck-ass nekkid, she seized the opportunity to talk, since it appeared Quinn was in a rare mood to do just that. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like you cared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. No. I cared, I was just...\u201d Quinn frowned and a minute or so passed before he spoke again. \u201cI can see where you\u2019d get that idea, bein\u2019s I took off right after you kicked me out to help Ben and my cousins with calvin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought after you returned from living at Ben\u2019s for three weeks you might\u2019ve been ready to hash it out.\u201d</p><p>Quinn\u2019s eyes searched hers. \u201cWanna know the real truth?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, even when her stomach pitched.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say to you. I ain\u2019t ever been good at sharin\u2019 my feelings and shit. I thought if I ignored it, maybe it\u2019d work itself out.\u201d He scowled. \u201cStupid, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNa\u00efve, maybe. Our problems didn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I guess those problems never seemed that bad to me.\u201d</p><p>That comment floored her. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t like one of us was cheatin\u2019. Or one of us was drinkin\u2019 too much. Or we were bein\u2019 physically or verbally abusive. Or that we\u2019d gotten in debt up to our eyeballs. Hell, I didn\u2019t think much beyond that our problem was us just bein\u2019 stuck in a rut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you figure we\u2019d get out of that rut?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOr were we just supposed to sit and spin our wheels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter that than burnin\u2019 rubber tryin\u2019 to get away.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna fight with you, Libby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t wanna sweep this under the rug anymore, Quinn.\u201d</p><p>He mumbled and looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said this is typical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical?\u201d She braced her hands on his chest and got in his face. \u201cExplain that.\u201d</p><p>His focus snapped back to her. \u201cWe\u2019re nekkid. In bed. I had a fuckin\u2019 hard-on to rival a fencepost, we were all set to have hot, fun, wild sex with toys, with extra lube and trying new positions...and now all you wanna do is talk, talk, talk.\u201d</p><p>Stung, she retorted, \u201cYeah? You think ignoring the important stuff and having wild, kinky sex is gonna fix it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell can\u2019t hurt, and at least we\u2019d be havin\u2019 sex for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. You ain\u2019t gonna deny that in the last year, even before you demanded a separation, we weren\u2019t havin\u2019 sex on a regular basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex on a regular basis?\u201d she repeated inanely. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so all-fired important to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex is a big part of the important stuff we need to discuss. At least it is to me. You\u2019re all for talkin\u2019</p><p>about what\u2019s bothering you, and yet, whenever I tried to bring up what\u2019s bothering me, you changed the damn subject.\u201d</p><p>When she froze in shock, he moved her off his body.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair. My unwillingness to talk about sex was in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Forget it.\u201d He rolled sideways and perched on the edge of the bed with his back to her.</p><p>What\u2019d just happened? Everything had been going so well. \u201cQuinn?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Libby forged ahead anyway. \u201cWhat makes you think that sex isn\u2019t important to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the last several years sex is important to you as long as you\u2019re gettin\u2019 what you want out of it, and out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby.\u201d He stood. Without looking at her, he said, \u201cI need to check cattle,\u201d and booked it out of the room, apparently not caring that he was completely naked.</p><p>Stunned, and a little heartsick, Libby slipped on her robe. She went to the window and opened the blinds.</p><p>A few minutes later, a bare-chested Quinn exited the house and plopped on the porch steps. He yanked his old boots over his gray sweatpants in angry, jerky movements. He stalked to the truck, grabbed his T-shirt from inside the cab and pulled it on over his head. Then he slapped on his ball cap, climbed in and roared off.</p><p>Needing something to do besides pace, or wait to see if Quinn returned to the house, or if he preferred the cramped horse trailer to her lousy company, Libby went downstairs.</p><p>Darkness enveloped the big, bold Wyoming sky by the time Libby heard the porch screen slam. The table was set and ready, but supper had gone cold. Would Quinn fight with her? Or pull that silent macho crap and ignore her? At this point she didn\u2019t know which she\u2019d prefer.</p><p>Wrong. She wanted his fire. His anger. His honest reaction. Because his words spurred her to take a longer, deeper look at her actions and inactions over the last few years and she hadn\u2019t liked what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>Consequently, she\u2019d been staring out the kitchen window, nursing a glass of whiskey for the better part of an hour. She didn\u2019t turn around when he entered the kitchen.</p><p>The silence between them was absolute.</p><p>Who would be the first to break it?</p><p>Quinn said, \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d at the same time she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>They both laughed, but it was forced laughter.</p><p>Quinn approached her. Her heart sped up.</p><p>Slipping his arms around her waist, he rubbed his face in her hair. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe probably oughta talk about it, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could just get drunk.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThere is that option. Might be less painful initially, but guaranteed we\u2019d pay for it in the mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do we start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere we left off.\u201d Libby drained the last of her whiskey. \u201cWhere the problems began. Jilly warned me about bringing up the baby issue, or lack thereof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJilly? What\u2019s she have to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called and offered me some free advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take it for what it\u2019s worth. Nuthin\u2019. Besides, I\u2019m the one who brought it up. And not in a nice way neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a nice way to tell me that I seriously screwed up everything with my quest for a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLibby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me get this out, okay?\u201d Would this confession be easier if she wasn\u2019t looking into his all-knowing eyes? Probably not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna pretend that I was aware that I was driving you away when I became obsessed with getting pregnant. After you stormed away a couple hours ago, it was like a light bulb went off in my head and I saw everything in a whole different light. I didn\u2019t like what I saw.</p><p>\u201cIt was all about me. My body. What I wanted. What I needed.\u201d Tears gathered in her eyes when she considered how selfish she\u2019d been. How much she\u2019d hurt him and without knowing it.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>Suck it up. You made the bed, you can lie in it.</p><p>\u201cAnd the truth is you were one hundred percent right when you said I cared only about your sperm, not about sex. Making love with you or to you didn\u2019t cross my mind if it didn\u2019t have...purpose. Sad to admit that mindset would\u2019ve stayed even if I had gotten pregnant, because I would\u2019ve focused all my attention on the baby. You suffered either way. God, Quinn, what kind of horrible, self-centered wife does that make me? And yet, I justified my attitude because I blamed you for not being interested in whether we got pregnant or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t see the big rush, Libby. It wasn\u2019t like we were too old then or even now. It\u2019s just...well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of me wondered if you were in some sort of competition with your sister. She popped out four babies with no trouble. Then every time she came over with the kids, it was like she was rubbing them in your face. Jilly always was hinting around maybe one or both of us had problems with our, um, plumbing, so to speak.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How much weight had Libby given to Jilly\u2019s suggestions regarding fertility issues? A lot. After all, with four pregnancies under her belt, Jilly was an expert. She just wanted to help. Why had Libby confided her fears to her sister instead of her husband? God. She\u2019d been such an idiot on so many levels.</p><p>\u201cLibby?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t face him when she blurted, \u201cI spent years feeling like a failure as a woman because I couldn\u2019t pop out a little McKay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t like the McKay name is gonna die out with the way my cousins are reproducing like rabbits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But I was constantly fielding questions from relatives about when you and I were going to start a family since we\u2019ve been married a while. If I hedged, then they asked if we were having marriage problems or reproductive issues. It was a stick poking an open wound you didn\u2019t even know I had.\u201d</p><p>Libby felt him wince.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so damn sorry. To be honest, it hurt that you wanted a kid more than you wanted me. Part of the reason I refused the fertility tests was I was afraid you\u2019d leave me if I was the reason you weren\u2019t pregnant.</p><p>Sounds selfish, don\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>No more selfish than what she\u2019d done.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cJesus, Libby. I\u2019m such a prick. Not talkin\u2019 to you. Lettin\u2019 you think the worst of yourself, makin\u2019 you handle all that family shit alone, when I didn\u2019t know the half of it. No wonder you booted my ass.\u201d</p><p>The resentment she should\u2019ve felt was strangely absent. It felt good\u2014freeing\u2014to be brutally honest, to air all their dirty laundry. They had nothing else to lose, because they were damn close to losing it all.</p><p>\u201cLook. We both were wrong. We both made mistakes. We both closed down and dealt with our issues separately, rather than together. We didn\u2019t have fidelity, financial or substance abuse issues, but our issues were big enough to cause a rift in our marriage.\u201d</p><p>Quinn didn\u2019t say anything, which wasn\u2019t surprising. He\u2019d said more than she\u2019d expected.</p><p>Still, she\u2019d been carrying the burden for quite some time, so she might as well get it all off her chest.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I realized I probably wouldn\u2019t ever get pregnant, I created a new me\u2014Libby McKay 2.0. I fixed up the house, jazzed up the meals, pursued new interests and stopped thinking about babies entirely. I thought if I wasn\u2019t a frumpy, chubby, boring ranch wife, you\u2019d want me again.\u201d</p><p>Quinn spun her around so fast spots danced in front of her eyes. \u201cWant you again? I\u2019ve always wanted you. Jesus. You think that\u2019s how I see you? Frumpy? Chubby? Boring?\u201d He shook her slightly. \u201cDammit. I see you, Libby, not a fuckin\u2019 brood mare! You are the smart, funny, sexy, hard-workin\u2019 girl that knocked me for a loop when I was a dumb kid of sixteen. A woman I\u2019ve always known is too good for the likes of me. A woman I pledged my life, heart and soul to. A woman I love with every goddamn bone and breath in my body. What don\u2019t you understand about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up. We\u2019re done talkin\u2019.\u201d His mouth crashed down on hers and he kissed the living daylights out of her.</p><p>Arms, legs, hands, fingers clashed and collided as they tried to touch each other everywhere, all at once. The wet, hot kiss overwhelmed her until she could only cling to him and experience the spectacle of her calm, cool and collected husband totally out of control.</p><p>Quinn ripped his lips from hers. \u201cNow. Goddammit. I need to prove...to show you how much I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTable.\u201d He untied the belt on her robe, pushed it to the floor and groaned satisfaction she was still naked.</p><p>\u201cBut the dishes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck the dishes.\u201d Quinn turned, jerked the corners of the tablecloth until all the plates and silverware crashed together and rolled to the opposite end of the table. \u201cProblem solved.\u201d</p><p>Libby grabbed his face in her hands and kissed him, needing that connection as he lifted her on the kitchen table.</p><p>The woman absolutely pushed his limits of restraint today...and he\u2019d never been happier in his frustration.</p><p>Quinn needed to get inside her. Now now now pounded in cadence with the blood throbbing in his cock.</p><p>Libby twisted her hand in his T-shirt, stopping him. \u201cThis gone. I wanna feel your skin on mine.\u201d</p><p>Yank. Off it went. He latched onto her hips and pulled until her legs hung off the table. He jerked his sweatpants to the tops of his boots and his cock went sproing like it was spring-loaded. He circled the opening to her pussy once and plunged inside to the root.</p><p>She hissed. Her upper body bowed up and she slid up half a foot from the force of his thrusts.</p><p>He scooted her back down. \u201cGrab onto the edge. Hands above your head. Like that. Oh hell, yeah, exactly like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re watching my tits bounce, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Quinn laughed and drove into her hard. \u201cUh-huh. Goddamn that\u2019s sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as long as you aren\u2019t so busy watching you forget what you\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that, darlin\u2019 wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking me until I scream.\u201d</p><p>The noise leaving his throat was half-grunt, half-snarl and all possessive male. He obliged her with thrusts that rocked the table and his legs quaked from the strain.</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He gave her everything he had. A heart-thumping, sweat-inducing, hip-pounding, teeth-grinding, primal mating. As he anchored her hips, his avid gaze moved from the steady bounce of her breasts to where they were joined. It was hot as sin to see the wet proof of her excitement coating his dick as he pulled out, then feeling the tight clasp as he slammed home. Again and again and again. Every thrust seemed to bring him deeper into her.</p><p>When he noticed Libby biting her lip, he leaned over her. \u201cYou okay? Too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She arched into him. \u201cYour chest hair on my nipples drives me crazy. And God, you\u2019re hitting the exact spot pressed against me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Quinn clasped their hands together so they were matched palm to palm. \u201cFly apart for me.\u201d He added a little grind at the end of his upstroke and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, more\u2014 yes! \u201d</p><p>His hips began to piston, each stroke brought forth more sweat and more labored breaths and a more desperate race to the finish. When Libby squeezed his hands and cried out, Quinn felt that deep, rhythmic pulsing of her body sucking at his cock like a separate mouth.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he let himself fall into the moment. As his cock emptied, he was reminded how perfect it felt being with Libby, naked in body and soul. Quinn buried his face in her neck and clutched her tightly, silently swearing to never let her get so far out of his reach again. \u201cGod, I love you. Don\u2019t ever leave me...I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. I know. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here. We\u2019re both here.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d leveled their breathing and their heart rates returned to normal, she shuddered beneath him. He raised his head to peer into her eyes. \u201cCold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith two hundred pounds of hot rancher on top of me? Hardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I too heavy?\u201d</p><p>Libby shook her head.</p><p>He kissed each nipple and pushed upright. Studying her face for signs of pain, he slowly pulled out.</p><p>\u201cSore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And even if I was, I wouldn\u2019t mind. Because you just fulfilled one of my fantasies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? On the kitchen table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hot damn.\u201d After Quinn tugged his sweatpants in place, he helped her sit up and noticed her eyes darted to the pile of dishes beneath the rumpled tablecloth. \u201cSorry I ruined supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. Being with you, having you look at me like that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you used to. Like I was everything.\u201d</p><p>Quinn rested his forehead to hers. \u201cYou are everything to me. You always have been. I\u2019m sorry it got to the point where you ever doubted that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>The moment, while brief, seemed to reinforce a connection between them Quinn hadn\u2019t realized was broken.</p><p>Libby\u2019s stomach rumbled.</p><p>\u201cSince I wrecked supper, and you\u2019re clearly starving, can I take you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, I\u2019m a mess. By the time I get myself cleaned up, every place within thirty miles will be closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do look kinda mussed. But it\u2019s a well-fucked, well-kissed kinda mussed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn McKay!\u201d</p><p>He loved that indignant tone, mostly because it was all for show. \u201cTell you what. Let\u2019s go to the Tasty Treat Drive-in. We don\u2019t have to get out. I can sneak a couple kisses between feeding you curly fries. Like we used to.\u201d He nibbled on her lips. \u201cAnd we might finally christen the damn truck after six years.\u201d</p><p>Libby leaned back. \u201cWe\u2019ve had sex in your truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>She appeared to be thinking. \u201cShoot. I thought after some big McKay bash you and I...\u201d Libby looked him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWe did. But that was my old red Dodge years ago, not this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remembering the first time we had sex in your pickup.\u201d</p><p>He cringed. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you ever had sex with me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it sure as hell wasn\u2019t romantic. Woulda been better if we\u2019d waited and done it in my bed rather than on a pickup bench seat in the middle of a damn pasture. You deserved better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to be with you.\u201d A wistful look crossed her face. \u201cSometimes I think we\u2019ve come so far...and then I look at you and still feel like that unsure sixteen-year-old girl.\u201d</p><p>That jarred him. \u201cUnsure about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, unsure on why you picked me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe McKay boys\u2019 reputation for preferring wild girls. I\u2019ve never been wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t ever been like my cousins when it comes to skirt chasin\u2019. Didn\u2019t interest me.\u201d He allowed a small grin. \u201cOn the other hand, I\u2019m likin\u2019 that you\u2019re finally gettin\u2019 wild with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, you could\u2019ve had any girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t want any other girl besides you, Libby. Then or now.\u201d</p> <p>Libby\u2019s gaze roamed his face. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>Quinn knew she wasn\u2019t referring to their supper plans. A temporary break from the issues would do them both good, so he deliberately misunderstood her. \u201cSoon as you slip on some clothes, we\u2019re headed to the Tasty Treat.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened. Closed.</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She hopped off the table. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sharing my chocolate malt with you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p> <p>\u201cWanna another bite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m stuffed. I shouldn\u2019t have eaten all those mozzarella sticks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to indulge once in a while.\u201d</p><p>Libby stirred the dregs of her shake. \u201cI worked damn hard to lose weight. Overindulgence will pack those pounds right back on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I haven\u2019t said so, you look good. Real good. Damn good.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou weren\u2019t very complimentary when I asked you that same question three months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can apply my earlier \u2018I was a prick\u2019 comment to that response too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did you say that?\u201d</p> <p>Quinn sighed. \u201cI thought you were fancyin\u2019 yourself up because you were fixin\u2019 to dump me.\u201d</p><p>Her hand froze on the straw. \u201cAnd then I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold me you wanted a trial separation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Quinn, oh damn. That\u2019s not why I...\u201d Good Lord. With all the mixed signals they\u2019d been sending each other it was a miracle they\u2019d managed to stay married as long as they had.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t add anything else, Libby shoved the empty cup on the dash and scooted closer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that now. It\u2019s over and done with.\u201d Quinn slapped his thighs. \u201cClimb on over here and sit on my lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe gonna kiss and make up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Or maybe I just wanna cop a feel in the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll see if you get to second base, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hopin\u2019 for a grand slam.\u201d Grinning, he adjusted the seat.</p><p>Libby balanced on one knee and swung the other over his left leg, placing her hands on his shoulders as she lowered onto his lap. Then she took his hat off.</p><p>Quinn flexed those scarred, callused hands she loved so much across her upper back and slowly pulled her toward him.</p><p>Eyes locked, bodies pressed together, each inch they moved closer built anticipation higher. Heated breath mingled, lips softened, hearts raced.</p><p>A whisper apart, Quinn cocked his head and let his mouth sink into hers. He teased, tempted, nibbled, drawing out the kiss until Libby shook with need.</p><p>The moment was as erotic as it was familiar.</p><p>She allowed her hand to wander over his jaw, cheeks, temple and forehead. She raked her fingers through his hair. Gently biting at his mouth, dipping her tongue between his parted lips and slicking it across his teeth. When he opened wider, she dove in, offering him the same reckless passion he\u2019d shown her.</p><p>A satisfied groan rumbled from Quinn\u2019s throat.</p><p>Giddy, feeling freer than she had in ages, she touched, stroked and rubbed against her husband until they were both panting. Frantic. Aroused.</p><p>Three raps on the passenger side jolted them out of the moment and the crotch-grinding kiss. They squinted at the interloper through the steamed-up windows.</p><p>Vaudette Dickens. President of the Presbyterian Ladies Guild, neighbor to the Charles McKay family for years...and Quinn\u2019s mother\u2019s best friend.</p><p>Quinn swore under his breath.</p><p>Libby began to slide back, but Quinn stopped her retreat with a terse, \u201cStay put.\u201d</p><p>He offered Vaudette a smile and leaned sideways to roll down the window. \u201cMiz Dickens. I\u2019m surprised to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet you are, Quinn McKay.\u201d Her eyes narrowed behind thick-lensed glasses. \u201cWho\u2019s that with you? Libby?\u201d</p><p>Libby wanted to snap, \u201cWho else were you expecting?\u201d but she managed a civilized, \u201cYes, it\u2019s me, Miz Dickens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness. I thought you two were separated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. Were. Anyway, we\u2019re workin\u2019 it out,\u201d Quinn said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. Does your mother know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, with the way you two are carrying on, by tomorrow morning everyone will know you were fogging up your truck windows at the Tasty Treat.\u201d</p><p>Mostly courtesy of Vaudette\u2019s lips, Libby thought.</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d Quinn drawled.</p><p>Vaudette\u2019s shoulders snapped straight. \u201cI was looking out for your best interests. I popped over here because I was certain some wild teenagers were out joy riding in your truck and I wanted to give them what-for before I called the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow why on earth would you think something like that?\u201d</p><p>She motioned to Libby still perched on Quinn\u2019s lap. \u201cBecause I expected such behavior from hormonal teenagers, not from a longtime married couple. Goodness, aren\u2019t you two a little old to be necking in the Tasty Treat parking lot at ten o\u2019clock on a Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>Quinn smirked at Libby. He smoothed a piece of hair behind her ear. \u201cGod, I hope not. A man\u2019s entitled to kiss his wife, whenever and wherever he pleases.\u201d</p><p>Libby bit her lip to keep from laughing at Quinn\u2019s double meaning.</p><p>Vaudette let out a gasp that managed to be both indignant and chiding.</p><p>\u201cBut we appreciate your concern, Miz Dickens. And you\u2019re right. I reckon we oughta take this someplace more private.\u201d He looked at Vaudette and winked. \u201cTell my mother I said hello,\u201d and he cranked up the window.</p><p>Libby lost it. She buried her face in Quinn\u2019s neck to muffle her laughter.</p><p>\u201cDamn busybody.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cThe gossip won\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet \u2019em gossip. I could give a damn.\u201d He frowned. \u201cThis ain\u2019t gonna affect your job at the library, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing my husband in public is hardly a firing offense.\u201d She brushed her lips over his. \u201cBut fucking my husband in public is a different story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna fuck me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. You got me all hot and bothered. I\u2019m thinking about the positions we didn\u2019t try today because we were too busy talking.\u201d Libby traced the inside of his ear with her tongue and gently blew across it. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk anymore.\u201d</p><p>He started the truck with her still on his lap.</p><p>\u201cQuinn! You can\u2019t drive like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? Bein\u2019 horny as hell with a hot woman bouncin\u2019 on my pole as we hit every damn pothole on Main Street?\u201d He grinned. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>She whapped him on the chest before returning to the passenger side.</p><p>He wiggled his hat back on his head and threw the gearshift in reverse.</p><p>When they hit the outskirts of town, Libby casually asked, \u201cSo, since you didn\u2019t get to fulfill your fantasy earlier today, do you have any others you wanna share with me?\u201d</p><p>Quinn shot her a sideways glance. \u201cWhat\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no problem sharing a fantasy, but you go first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He shifted in the seat. \u201cI wanna fuck you while you\u2019re wearin\u2019 nuthin\u2019 but them tight, black suede chaps with the long fringe runnin\u2019 down the sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a simple man. Your turn.\u201d</p><p>Libby wondered how he\u2019d react to her fantasy. Would he get angry? Go along with it? Think it was weird? Or stupid?</p><p>\u201cLib?\u201d he prompted. \u201cNo more secrets, remember?\u201d</p><p>She blurted, \u201cLet\u2019s pretend we\u2019re strangers. You picked me up in a bar after we slow danced and shared a couple of smokin\u2019 kisses. You\u2019re taking me back to your place to have your wicked way with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna do this now? Tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And when we get home\u2014I mean there\u2014I wanna spend the night in the horse trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. But if we were strangers and so hot to have each other, I bet you\u2019d be sittin\u2019 closer to me.\u201d</p><p>Relieved at his willingness to play along, she slid next to him. She flipped the radio on low and Dwight Yoakam crooned a mournful song about love gone wrong. Quinn wrapped his arm around her shoulder and lazily rubbed her bicep.</p><p>Libby stroked the corded muscle of his thigh beneath his soft sweatpants. With every sweeping pass her fingers drifted higher, lingered longer. She\u2019d forgotten how much she loved touching him and hearing the soft catch of his breath whenever she did something he liked.</p><p>She glanced at him. Quinn\u2019s knuckles on the steering wheel shone white in the dashboard lights.</p><p>Talk about tense. What could she do to relax him?</p><p>A naughty idea popped up. Smiling, she hid her face in his neck. \u201cMmm. You smell good.\u201d</p><p>His answer was a low groan.</p><p>Encouraged, Libby continued nuzzling his throat, letting her fingers wander until they reached the swelling between his thighs. She traced the length of his erection. The only barrier between his cock and her hand was a thin piece of fleece. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dragging openmouthed kisses to his ear, she whispered, \u201cHelp me slide these down so I can touch you bare.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Quinn gripped the back of the seat with his right hand and lifted his hips.</p><p>Libby hooked her fingers in the waistband and pulled the sweatpants down to his knees. She curled her hand around the girth of his cock and squeezed.</p> <p>He hissed. Loudly.</p><p>Hmmm. What other noises could she elicit from her normally silent cowboy?</p><p>Still kissing his neck, she played with his cock. Feathering touches from tip to root, circling her thumb through the pre-come to tease the sweet spot below the head.</p><p>After giving his jawline one last nip, she lowered her face into his lap and replaced her hand with her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus, woman, what are you doin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Libby scooted back slightly for a better angle and cranked her head around. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know I must be doing it wrong. You want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you might say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, I never thought you\u2019d...\u201d He looked down at her. \u201cYou\u2019re a wild one, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d When Quinn kept staring at her, she reminded him, \u201cEyes on the road, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, shit. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>She worked him over. Licking the head with little whips of her tongue, then pulling him into her mouth an inch at a time until her lips were against the base. She breathed through her nose, filling her lungs with the musky scent that was uniquely Quinn. Then Libby released all that male hardness, loving the sleek feel of his tight skin moving backward across her tongue.</p><p>A muttering curse sounded above her, but she paid no attention. She kept the deep-throating rhythm, letting her saliva coat the shaft. The darkness, the heat rolling from his body, the constant wet glide of her mouth on his rock-hard cock, soaked her panties to the point she knew Quinn smelled her arousal.</p><p>She loved this. His sense of surprise. The confidence she could please him. But mostly she reveled in the knowledge that passion this intense still existed between them.</p><p>Quinn\u2019s hand had somehow landed on her head. His hips were bumping up, a signal he was close to blowing.</p><p>Libby switched to shallow strokes. Lightly holding his dick at the root, her hand moved up to meet her mouth moving down. She applied more suction to the head.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, that feels so fuckin\u2019 good.\u201d</p><p>She hummed around his cock as her head bobbed faster.</p><p>\u201cOh hell yeah, baby, almost there.\u201d</p> <p>Sexual power raced through her. Libby wanted his climax. She wanted to taste it, to bathe in it, to glory in it, because goddammit, she\u2019d earned it.</p><p>\u201cUh. Fuck. There it is.\u201d Quinn groaned, his fingers increasing the grip on her hair.</p><p>His cock throbbed against her tongue with each hot spurt. She swallowed, keeping her lips wrapped tightly around the head until the very last pulse.</p><p>He sighed. His body went slack against the seat. After a bit, he said, \u201cThat was amazin\u2019. \u2019Cept, I almost wrecked the truck. Twice.\u201d</p><p>Flush with success of pleasing her man, she gave his cock one last kiss and lifted her head. She gazed out the window and noticed they were about a mile from the turnoff home.</p><p>Quinn reached for her hand. He opened his mouth. Snapped it shut. Apparently he was too stunned to talk.</p><p>Good. That was the type of silence she preferred from him.</p><p>They parked alongside the horse trailer. In the darkened truck, Quinn stayed still. Libby wanted to crawl out of her skin at the renewed tension.</p><p>\u201cI want you like crazy.\u201d</p><p>A shiver raced up her spine at his husky tone.</p><p>\u201cBut I want you on my terms. So if you get outta this truck and follow me into that trailer, we\u2019re gonna do things my way. Everything. No arguin\u2019. If you wanna back out, say so now.\u201d</p><p>Practical Libby would demand to know the parameters. But tonight, she wasn\u2019t Libby. She was a temptress who\u2019d given a stranger a blowjob in his pickup. Plus, she was damn curious to know what Quinn meant by his \u201cterms\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI put myself in your capable hands.\u201d</p><p>The wicked smile that\u2019d charmed her since high school lit up Quinn\u2019s face. He opened the glove box and snagged a folded red bandana.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you using that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blindfold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn toward the window. Might feel a slight pinch.\u201d He knotted the material at the back of her head.</p><p>\u201cThere. Can you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come around and help you out.\u201d Quinn aimed to keep her off balance, so he didn\u2019t kiss her, talk to her, as he piloted her into the trailer.</p><p>Once they were inside, he plastered his body to hers so completely that a single grain of wheat wouldn\u2019t have fit between them. His kiss was a flat-out, I-love-you, I-need-you, I\u2019m-gonna-fuck-your-brains-out mark of passion and possession.</p><p>Her whimper was his sign to move to the next stage. While unbuttoning her blouse, he spoke just below her ear. \u201cKick off them shoes, ditch the britches. I want you naked.\u201d</p><p>She stripped in record time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gettin\u2019 good at that.\u201d Quinn balled her clothes up and whipped them in the corner. He let his hands meander down her neck, across her collarbones, over those incredible breasts and sweetly rounded belly to her curvaceous hips. She looked damn fine. Felt damn fine too.</p><p>Gooseflesh broke out across Libby\u2019s skin.</p><p>He stroked the area between her hipbones. A leisurely caress of his rough flesh against the suppleness of hers. Gradually, he allowed his fingertips to brush the hair covering her mound. He trailed nibbling kisses from the bottom of her earlobe to her shoulder as his fingers traced her cleft. \u201cYou taste so sweet here. And I\u2019ve got a hankerin\u2019 to feel nuthin\u2019 but your velvety-soft, bare skin against my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna shave you. Every bit of hair gone so you\u2019re smooth as a ripe peach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cBut, I-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the adventurous type in the truck. I\u2019ll be extra careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen okay.\u201d</p><p>Quinn unfolded a chair and situated Libby with a pillow behind her upper back, close enough to the small table and counter that she could hold on. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>In the small bathroom, he soaked two washcloths in hot water and grabbed a new razor. Shame he didn\u2019t have an old-fashioned barber\u2019s kit with a lathering brush. The tickle of the bristles on her naked sex would heighten her senses. With shaving cream, razor and towels in hand, he returned to his naked wife.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t budged.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t jump, this is just a hot towel.\u201d Quinn laid the steaming cloth across her mound. He filled a plastic bowl with warm water and dropped to his knees.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs more. Scoot down. That\u2019s it. You comfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs comfortable as I can be, naked, blindfolded, with my privates flapping in the breeze and a man wielding a razor staring at me.\u201d</p><p>Quinn laughed and slathered on shaving cream. \u201cDon\u2019t look that way to me. You look sexy as all get out.\u201d He held the razor aloft and said, \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flinch.\u201d He made the first pass of the razor down the outside of the left side of her sex. A quick rinse and he shaved the next section.</p><p>\u201cThat tickles.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at her. \u201cIs it makin\u2019 you hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was already hot from what happened in the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked havin\u2019 my cock in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>Libby blushed. \u201cYeah. I liked surprising you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you did.\u201d Quinn swished the razor and bent closer. \u201cYou also fulfilled another one of my longtime fantasies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought we was only sharin\u2019 one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, why didn\u2019t you tell me that was your fantasy before tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I woulda said, \u2018Libby, I want you to suck me off some night while we\u2019re zipping down the road in my truck\u2019 you\u2019d have said yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. You never know unless you ask. Hey, we\u2019re not supposed to be using names. We\u2019re strangers, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistake. Hang tight, I wanna wipe you down before I get to the delicate parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually really glad I\u2019m blindfolded.\u201d</p><p>Quinn smiled. \u201cI am too, because I\u2019m drooling like a fool, seein\u2019 all this pretty pink flesh that\u2019s gonna be mine for the takin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything for a while. Quinn wanted to be done so he could bury his face in her. So he could lick and lap at the cream he saw welling in the opening to her sex, but he forced himself to stay slow and steady.</p><p>She said, \u201cI can feel your breath on my delicate parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty soon it\u2019s gonna be my tongue on those parts. All of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it when you talk dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll make sure to whisper naughty sweet-nuthin\u2019s in your ear as I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 you. Almost done.</p><p>Scoot down a little more and tilt your hips so I can see your ass crack.\u201d</p><p>A tiny gasp. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to shave me...there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure am. You get the whole treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, \u2019cause darlin\u2019, you ain\u2019t seen nuthin\u2019 yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, you\u2019ve seen everything,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m seein\u2019 is makin\u2019 my mouth water and my dick hard.\u201d</p><p>He rinsed the washcloth and cleaned her until not a bit of hair or shaving cream remained. After the last swipe, he washed his hands and dumped everything in the sink.</p><p>Quinn crouched in front of her. He rubbed his cheek over the top of her cleft, losing himself in her softness and warmth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Libby made a surprised noise.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It feels...Bare. Super-sensitive. Put your mouth on me. All over me. God. Everywhere. Like you promised.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ain\u2019t lettin\u2019 you outta my bed until mornin\u2019. We clear on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>He helped her to her feet and they shuffled to the single bed inset into the wall. \u201cStep up.\u201d</p><p>She stretched out flat on her back. Quinn ditched his clothes and turned off the lights before climbing in.</p><p>After giving her a quick peck on the mouth, he kissed straight down her torso. Quinn used the tip of his tongue to trace her silky smooth pussy lips. He burrowed his tongue inside that hot, clenching channel then retreated to lick every hairless inch of her pussy. Damn. He could stay there for hours, coaxing the sticky sweetness from her body and gorging himself on her juices. On just her. His lover. His best friend.</p> <p>His wife. His everything. Not a stranger, his Libby.</p><p>\u201cThat feels so... Oh, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He used his thumbs to hold her open as he focused on her clit. His tongue strokes were fast, relentless and accurate.</p><p>She gasped, \u201cYes!\u201d and held his head in place as she orgasmed against his mouth, making those sexy little squeaking moans that ratcheted his lust to a whole new level.</p><p>Soon as Libby settled down, he growled, \u201cAgain. Come for me like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWrong. And this time, you\u2019re gonna scream.\u201d</p><p>A sense of sexual power consumed Quinn, as she did just that.</p><p>As Libby was coming down from another climax, he untied the blindfold and flipped her on her belly.</p><p>\u201cMy turn. Get up on your hands and knees.\u201d</p><p>Quinn followed the arc of her spine with his tongue from her nape to her tailbone. He parted those sweet cheeks and kept going down the downy crack of her ass. His wandering tongue met the bud of her anus and he painted it with wet swirls.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d Her whole body shook.</p><p>He\u2019d never done that before, but damn if she didn\u2019t like it. So he did it again. He ventured past merely licking the sweet rosette and wiggled his tongue inside the pucker.</p><p>Goddamn, he wanted in there, the one place she\u2019d balked at allowing him access. No more. He\u2019d marked her everywhere else; he\u2019d mark her there too. He\u2019d fuck that virgin channel with his fingers, his tongue and his cock.</p> <p>Keeping his finger pressed to that tight hole, Quinn warned, \u201cI\u2019m gonna take you here, darlin\u2019 wife.</p><p>Not tonight, but soon. You want that, don\u2019t you. Wanna experience my cock slidin\u2019 into your ass.\u201d</p><p>Libby just moaned.</p><p>\u201cRight now I\u2019m gonna fuck you like this.\u201d He yanked her hips back and impaled her.</p><p>Jesus. She was so wet and hot and making such sexy sounds, greedily pushing her body back into his.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and attempted some semblance of control.</p><p>\u201cQuinn, don\u2019t you dare hold back. You\u2019re not gonna break me. More. Harder.\u201d</p><p>Her plea cut his last thread of restraint. Quinn fucked her without pause. Fucked her through another orgasm. Fucked her hard enough that she\u2019d have bruises on her backside from the grip he maintained to keep her from skidding across the sheets. The sheer force of his thrusts set his knees on fire.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t stop. He couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Sweating, shaking, Quinn was helpless in the haze of passion, indebted to the woman who gave herself over to him so freely, the woman who still had the power\u2014and the desire\u2014to rock his world.</p><p>When Libby looked at him over her shoulder and said, \u201cBaby, let go,\u201d he did, saying her name as a benediction as he came until his balls were empty.</p><p>She collapsed face-first on the bed, dislodging his cock.</p><p>Quinn\u2019s dizziness subsided after he braced his hand on the wall and took several deep breaths. He lowered himself next to her.</p><p>Libby turned her head and blinked at him.</p><p>No smile. No flip remark. Maybe he had been too rough with her. He smoothed his hand down her damp, naked back. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be what you need if you don\u2019t let me see all sides of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLibby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what scares me?\u201d</p><p>Being married to a man who fucked you until your elbows and knees were raw with sheet burns?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat after this weekend we\u2019ll revert to the way it was between us before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t\u2014I won\u2019t. We won\u2019t. But havin\u2019 wild sex a coupla times a day ain\u2019t gonna be the norm for us either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her eyes searched his. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ve accomplished anything besides proving that sex between us can be fantastic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked more in the last twenty-four hours than we have in the last twenty-four months. Is every little thing ironed out? No. But I reckon there\u2019s lots of stuff we ain\u2019t gonna see eye-to-eye on, even if we talk about it for the next fifty years. As long as we have open discussions, no accusations, no holdin\u2019</p><p>back, no ignorin\u2019 the problem, then I think we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than okay. We\u2019re gonna be better than we\u2019ve ever been. And that\u2019s a promise.\u201d Quinn wrapped her in his arms and kissed her forehead. \u201cYou plum wore me out today. Let\u2019s get some sleep.</p><p>We\u2019ll talk more in the mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Libby tried to roll over but a warm, dry hand on her stomach held her in place.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, darlin\u2019. Ain\u2019t a lotta room on a twin bed to be thrashin\u2019 around. I gotta say, I much prefer it crowded with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo last night and yesterday wasn\u2019t a dream? I won\u2019t open my eyes and wake up in my queen-sized bed alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a dream.\u201d Quinn\u2019s lips brushed her ear. \u201cI\u2019m hopin\u2019 to make yesterday\u2019s events a new reality in our queen-sized bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She stretched, loving the feel of his legs tangled with hers and their bodies pressed together.</p><p>\u201cDoes my \u2018night with a stranger\u2019 fantasy include breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, if you don\u2019t mind blueberry Pop-Tarts, \u2019cause that\u2019s about all I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we shower and get dressed up at the house, I could cook us up eggs and toast. I think there\u2019s deer sausage left in the deep freeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you offering to wash my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your front.\u201d Quinn\u2019s hands slid up to cup her breasts. \u201cAnd every place in between.\u201d</p><p>He started biting her neck and she squealed, so they only heard the last couple rings of his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cThought I left that damn thing in the truck,\u201d Quinn muttered. He climbed over Libby and snatched the phone from the tiny table where it\u2019d started ringing again.</p><p>\u201cHello? Hey, Ma. Nah. Because I didn\u2019t feel like goin\u2019 to church, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>Libby withheld a groan. As much as she liked Quinn\u2019s mother, Violet McKay had a tendency to forget Quinn wasn\u2019t a teenager but a grown man. Since she and Quinn had been together since their teen years, she treated Libby the same way.</p><p>Quinn said, \u201cNope, Ben\u2019s takin\u2019 care of it this weekend. Because Libby and me are spendin\u2019 time together. What\u2019s that? I didn\u2019t tell you because it ain\u2019t your concern.\u201d He sighed. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Ooh, pissing off Mama McKay? That was a first. Libby heard the woman\u2019s rapid fire reprimand on the other end of the phone from five feet away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019re workin\u2019 on it.\u201d Pause. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what Vaudette Dickens told you. It ain\u2019t none of her concern neither.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. Vaudette had been a busy bee; it was only nine-thirty in the morning.</p><p>\u201cMa. Ma! Look, I know you think you mean well... Butt out. This is between me and my wife.\u201d</p><p>Pause. The floorboards squeaked as Quinn paced. \u201cJesus. Please tell me you didn\u2019t take it upon yourself to ask her that.\u201d Pause. \u201cBecause it ain\u2019t none of your goddamn business. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the Lord\u2019s Day; you had no right. No right.\u201d Pause. \u201cFine. Put him on the damn phone.\u201d</p><p>Libby\u2019s stomach cartwheeled. She\u2019d never heard Quinn speak to his mother so harshly. Never. She crawled out of bed and laid her cheek between his shoulder blades, wrapping her arms around him. His body shook, not from cold but with fury.</p><p>\u201cDad? No, you listen. I don\u2019t give a good goddamn if she claims she meant no harm.\u201d Pause. \u201cHuh-uh. This is your first and only warning. Back off. Both of you.\u201d Quinn clicked the phone shut and threw it on the floor.</p><p>His breathing was rapid and shallow. His body both hot and cold. He didn\u2019t say anything or move to dislodge her arms, so Libby clutched him tightly, hoping it might calm him down.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. I swear to God, I didn\u2019t know. What kinda husband does that make me? Dammit, how could I not have seen it?\u201d</p><p>Libby stepped back. \u201cWhat was that phone call about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother chewed me out for not bein\u2019 in church. She demanded to know why Vaudette Dickens found out we were back together and why I hadn\u2019t bothered to tell her first. She expected me to deny the rumor we were acting \u2018obscene\u2019 in public last night. Then she asked if we were done bein\u2019 separated and when she could expect grandkids, \u2019cause she\u2019d been waitin\u2019 a long time and she was tired of nagging you about quittin\u2019 your job and us startin\u2019 a family.\u201d</p><p>He spun around. His eyes were black with rage and his lips were drawn into a thin white line. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been hounding you about grandkids because she ain\u2019t said a single word to me. Not one word. Ever.\u201d His eyes frantically searched hers. \u201cShe makes a big deal about it to you, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Libby nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if I would\u2019ve said, \u2018Quinn, your mama\u2019s been demanding answers on why I\u2019m not pregnant yet\u2019, we both know you would have brushed it off. If I had complained every damn time she did it, you would\u2019ve thought I was being overly sensitive and brushed it off too.\u201d</p> <p>Guilt flashed across his face.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad at first. But as the years wore on, her comments became a little sharper. I didn\u2019t want to cause family problems or make waves so I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Libby, I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry. So damn sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t control her. I\u2019ll admit I was jealous when your cousins started having babies. It embarrassed me at McKay functions hearing your mother complaining to the other women in the family that she didn\u2019t have a grandchild to spoil yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, she never said a fucking word to me. Sayin\u2019 sorry doesn\u2019t seem like enough. No wonder you resented me. No wonder you wanted to rid yourself of me and this overbearing family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour mother didn\u2019t cause our marital problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that, but her behavior, coupled with my ostrich-like mentality, didn\u2019t help matters.\u201d He blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have a lot to talk about, but you\u2019re right. Let\u2019s take a break. No more discussions about babies, fertility tests, mixed signals, meddling mothers and sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while. Look, we can\u2019t solve anything in two days, and with the resentment and confusion on both our parts, some issues we weren\u2019t even aware we had...frankly, I\u2019m too emotionally raw to deal with any of it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen. And I ain\u2019t sayin\u2019 that because I\u2019m hopin\u2019 you\u2019ll forget about it. I know we have to talk about this. Sooner, rather than later. But when we\u2019re ready...well, I ain\u2019t opposed to talkin\u2019 to a fertility doctor to see if there is something wrong, if that\u2019s still what you want.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling a little misty eyed, Libby walked straight into Quinn\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My head is spinning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go up to the house and lay down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe for a bit. Then can we just hang out at home today? Screw around. Take the four wheelers out, maybe snuggle up and watch a little TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d wanna do something more exciting.\u201d</p> <p>She pushed back and looked at him. \u201cIs that what you think? I have to be doing something new and exciting all the time? I find being on the ranch with you...boring?\u201d</p><p>Quinn gave her a half-shrug and ducked his head.</p><p>Another truth hit her. \u201cI\u2019ve hurt you by letting you believe you and our home weren\u2019t enough for me anymore.\u201d Libby rubbed the tips of her fingers over his morning whiskers. \u201cOh Quinn. Oh, honey, that\u2019s not why I wanted the separation. I\u2019d hoped if we were apart we\u2019d miss each other. We\u2019d be forced to communicate beyond \u2018What\u2019s for supper?\u2019 and \u2018I washed your coveralls\u2019 and we\u2019d work harder to stay together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it worked? Us spendin\u2019 the weekend together?\u201d</p><p>Libby laid her head on his chest and listened to his heartbeat. So strong. So steady. \u201cWe\u2019re off to a damn fine start.\u201d</p><p>Quinn stayed silent a beat too long and Libby knew she hadn\u2019t given him the answer he wanted.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She shuffled the papers as the printer spat them out. \u201cResearch.\u201d</p><p>Why did she look so guilty? \u201cCan I see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Libby asked, avoiding his question.</p><p>\u201cAlmost eight. Why?\u201d</p><p>She unplugged the printer cable and powered down her laptop. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be fun to play cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be up for a game of strip poker.\u201d Quinn waggled his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking a game of hearts and you were thinking with a hard-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. All the smokin\u2019 hot sex yesterday, in the shower this mornin\u2019, and my mind is runnin\u2019</p><p>on one track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold that thought. And get your money out. After I\u2019ve finished packing I\u2019m gonna whip your butt in poker.\u201d</p><p>Quinn froze. \u201cFinished packing for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Cheyenne tomorrow for the state library conference, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d told you.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMust\u2019ve slipped my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long you gonna be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll week. There\u2019s two days of training and then the actual conference. I\u2019ll be back Friday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>He flipped the station to an outdoor hunting channel and stared at the screen without seeing it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I oughta go with you.\u201d</p><p>Libby kissed his forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t scowl, it\u2019ll give you wrinkles. Besides, Cheyenne wouldn\u2019t be fun for you, stuck in the hotel all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the nights of hot motel sex would make up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assigned a roommate.\u201d</p><p>Quinn hated when she went to conferences. She was too damn busy during the day to call him and too tired at night. He was lucky if they talked one time.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of... I have to leave at the crack of dawn, so I\u2019d better get going.\u201d She flounced out of the room.</p><p>That sucked. He dropped his head back on the couch and gazed at the ceiling. Had Libby deliberately misled him?</p><p>You two weren\u2019t exactly talking before last Friday.</p><p>True, but they\u2019d done a helluva lot of talking since then. Then he remembered her insistence they not make promises for the future beyond the weekend, because she might need more time to think it over.</p><p>Evidently, Libby always intended on taking that time, in Cheyenne\u2014whether he liked it or not.</p><p>Quinn didn\u2019t like it one little bit.</p><p>But he\u2019d damn sure give her something to remember him by before she left. He managed to cool his heels for ten minutes before he went upstairs.</p><p>The suitcase was open on the floor. The suit bag was spread out across the bed. Both were almost full.</p><p>Quinn leaned against the doorjamb and watched Libby scurrying around.</p><p>She finally noticed him. \u201cWhy are you skulking in the doorway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t a man appreciate his wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet-talker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tryin\u2019. How much packing you got left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost done. Just have to pick shoes, but I\u2019m tempted to take one pair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d He ambled toward the closet.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Libby paid no attention to him as she mumbled and pawed through her dresser drawers.</p><p>Her side of the closet contained fewer clothes. It was easy to find what he wanted. Quinn unhooked the heavy material from the metal hanger. After she\u2019d zipped up the suit bag and set it next to the suitcase on the floor, he tossed the pair of black suede fringed chaps on the bed.</p><p>She slowly turned around with an odd look in her eyes. \u201cUmm. I think those are inappropriate for a librarian\u2019s conference, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing you ain\u2019t wearin\u2019 \u2019em for nobody but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn\u2014\u201d</p><p>He loomed over her in a half a heartbeat. \u201cPut them on. No arguin\u2019. No panties. No shirt. No bra. No socks. No boots. Just the chaps. I\u2019ll be back in five minutes. You\u2019d better be undressed and ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for whatever I tell you to do.\u201d</p><p>Libby blinked at him. A few seconds passed and she nodded.</p><p>Quinn retreated to the bathroom. Seemed an eternity before he trekked back down the hallway to their bedroom.</p><p>She was sitting on the bed and jumped up the instant she saw him. \u201cWas I supposed to be standing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine.\u201d Quinn shut and locked the door. He closed the blinds. Turned off the overhead light and flipped on the bedside lamp. Rolled back the quilt, exposing the sheets. Then he faced her. Crowded her, really. \u201cHands by your sides.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the arms she\u2019d crossed over her chest.</p><p>\u201cLord almighty, lookit you.\u201d And what an eyeful Quinn got. His wife made his pulse race and his cock hard. \u201cTurn and let me see the view from the back.\u201d</p><p>It appeared Libby might argue, but she swiveled her hips, tossed her head and twirled around.</p><p>\u201cHoly mother. That\u2019s the sexiest damn sight I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d The leather hugged her legs. The cut of the chaps highlighted her rounded, naked ass. The thick strap spanned the curve of her lower back and brought to mind bondage games he\u2019d salivated over in porn flicks, but hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d ever get the chance to try. He\u2019d like to tie her up. Bind her hands in all sorts of tempting ways\u2014above her head, behind her back, in front where the ropes would rub against her\u2014</p><p>\u201cQuinn?\u201d</p><p>His gaze whipped to hers. Another time he\u2019d remind her of his expertise with ropes. A small smile crept up. \u201cLemme see you shakin\u2019 that badonkadonk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna see your ass swingin\u2019 and the fringe flappin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it, Lib. Make me wild to get my hands and mouth all over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor being a man of few words you sure do use them well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a new man, darlin\u2019 wife.\u201d</p><p>At first, her hands were clutched into fists by her side, but eventually she hitched her shoulders back and raised her arms. Cupping each elbow, her arms created a square above her head. Libby twitched her hips side-to-side, adding a quick snap at the end, causing the fringe to slap against the leather and her skin.</p><p>Quinn groaned at the erotic swish-swish-snap sound. \u201cKeep goin\u2019. I\u2019m gettin\u2019 all kinds of worked up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Libby widened her stance, performing a bump-and-grind routine that\u2019d cause a stripper envy. She rolled her pelvis as she shimmied forward and peeped at him upside down from between her legs. She cooed, \u201cHow\u2019m I doing, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely makin\u2019 me wild. Stand up and face me.\u201d</p><p>She spun around. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see. Be still.\u201d He idly dragged his index finger from the tip of her chin, down the flushed skin of her throat, through the valley of her cleavage, zigzagging over her ribs and stomach. He traced the leather strap between her hipbones and her flesh quivered.</p><p>Libby trembled when he fell to his knees.</p><p>Quinn admired his handiwork from the previous night\u2014her completely bare-shaven pussy. He passed his palms down the outside of her thighs. The fringe tickled her legs as he followed the sensuous curves to her ankles.</p><p>When he allowed his hands the same leisurely journey back up, she emitted a soft moan. Brushing his lips across the swell of her belly, he murmured, \u201cTell me what you want. I\u2019ll do anything you ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want.\u201d</p><p>His let his hair tease the underside of her breasts, knowing it drove her crazy as he feathered butterfly kisses over her lower torso. \u201cSay the words, Libby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your mouth on my...sex. Suck my clit. Use your hands and your tongue, just...make me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit on the edge of the bed. Lay back. Close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>The bed bounced she hit it so fast.</p><p>He withheld a smile as he grabbed the lube and her vibrator out of the nightstand drawer. He scooted between her legs, bent his head and tasted her.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>Another pass of his tongue. Quinn licked and teased, rubbing his face all over her smooth skin.</p><p>Evidently the sensation of his wet mouth and cooling breaths across her hot flesh, coupled with soft tongue flicks and the rough scrape of his evening beard, quickly drove Libby to the edge.</p><p>\u201cQuinn. Please.\u201d</p><p>As he zeroed in on her clit, he began to lightly massage her anus. She tensed up, like she always did.</p><p>This time instead of backing off, he said, \u201cRelax. Lemme make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, she did relax.</p><p>With every suck and lick, Quinn swirled his finger a little deeper inside her back channel, while he thrust his thumb in and out of her wet pussy. When Libby began pushing down on his hand, he suctioned his lips around her clit and slid his middle finger in her ass as she started to come.</p><p>It was hot as hell, feeling her throb against his tongue as her interior muscles contracted around his finger and thumb.</p> <p>After the pulses subsided, Libby opened her eyes. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>He took his time tasting the dips and hollows of her body, steeping his taste buds in the sweet and salty flavor of her skin. Against her throat, he said, \u201cDid you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. You could probably persuade me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlip onto your belly.\u201d Once Quinn had her stretched out at an angle across the bed, he followed her spine with his tongue. \u201cYou got what you wanted. Now it\u2019s my turn. I wanna slide my cock in that virgin hole and fuck you.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a harsh breath. \u201cAre you giving me a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m claimin\u2019 this part of you I\u2019ve waited for, for years.\u201d His teeth tugged on her earlobe.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it. You liked my finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but there\u2019s a difference between one finger and your cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t exactly hung like a bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t think. I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re ready, and when you are, I\u2019ll go slow.\u201d He kept kissing everywhere his lips could reach, brushing his clothed body against her bare skin. \u201cCome on, darlin\u2019, I\u2019m dyin\u2019 here. And if you were honest with yourself, you\u2019d admit you\u2019re just as curious as I am.\u201d</p><p>Libby lifted her head to look at him. \u201cI swear to God, if it hurts\u2014\u201d</p><p>The rest of Libby\u2019s protest was lost in Quinn\u2019s demanding kiss. He seduced her, inflamed her, brought her back to the magical place where desire ruled.</p><p>She ripped her mouth free with a gasp. \u201cDo it before I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t have to tell him twice. He hopped up and stripped. He liberally coated his fingers, staring greedily at the rounded globes of her ass and the hidden pink hole as he greased up his cock.</p><p>When she attempted to push to her hands and knees, he hiked her hips into the air and pressed her chest against the mattress. \u201cStretch your arms above your head.\u201d</p><p>Quinn climbed on the bed and squirted a dollop of lube on the rose-colored pucker. He swirled his index finger around, waiting for her to clench.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>While stroking the expanse of her naked back with his free hand, he inserted his finger deep, to the webbing.</p><p>Libby hissed.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it just feels...different from this angle.\u201d</p><p>After squeezing out more lube, he added a second finger.</p><p>Her body stiffened slightly but the muscles surrounding his fingers remained loose.</p><p>\u201cSo sexy, so hot, so damn tight.\u201d Quinn leaned forward and nibbled on her shoulder blades as he carefully stretched her. When she rocked her ass back onto his fingers, he knew she was ready. \u201cGive me your right hand.\u201d She slid her arm down and he placed the vibrator in her palm. He turned it on. \u201cI wanna see you usin\u2019 this as I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>Libby made a sound that was half-moan, half-gasp as her hand disappeared between her legs.</p><p>Quinn pressed his cock against the opening and gently pushed the head past the ring of muscle.</p><p>Despite his need to pound into her, he stopped. Took a breath. As a man of few words, Libby wouldn\u2019t expect a play-by-play and he was too far gone with lust to indulge in dirty talk.</p><p>Holding her soft butt cheeks in his hands, he watched his cock disappear into her ass an inch at a time.</p><p>Oh sweet Jesus, that was good. He waited a minute to savor claiming the last piece of his wife\u2019s virginity and giving her the last of his.</p><p>Vibrations inched closer to his balls as Libby stroked the vibrator over her slit. The buzzing sensation sent tingles up his spine. Straight up his dick. He pulled out little by little, leaving just the tip of his cock hugged by her flexing muscles. Then he slid deep until her anus was snug against the wider base of his shaft.</p><p>Two, three more times, he drove in and out, the warning slow slow slow screamed in his head, warring with the ever louder harder harder harder. Quinn managed to keep the pace steady even when sweat dripped into his eyes. He clenched his teeth, his fingers and his ass cheeks against the need to pound into that tight channel with everything he had.</p><p>\u201cQuinn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding back, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t hurting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. Take me how you want.\u201d</p><p>With a noise similar to a snarl, Quinn unleashed the beast inside him. He withdrew and slammed into her with enough force to send her grasping for purchase on the slippery sheets. Over and over. Without pause. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s so good.\u201d</p><p>Each pounding thrust had Quinn climbing the precipice to that elusive point of pleasure. The tight clasp of her untried passage, the buzz of the vibrator, the visual of Libby\u2019s body stretched out before him as he\u2019d always dreamed. He fucked her hard enough the bed shook.</p><p>Libby\u2019s orgasm hit. She screamed.</p><p>The high-pitched feminine wail was one of the sexiest sounds Quinn had ever heard.</p><p>When she bore down on his cock, and her body attempted to suck his pulsing sex deeper, Quinn lost his thin grip on control. He rammed in to the hilt as his balls lifted and he bathed her channel with his seed.</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut as her body milked every hot spurt, each blast of heat burst from his cock like a pipeline of liquid fire.</p><p>Eventually, the primitive roar in his head lessened. Even when he could think and breathe again, his heart kept a rapid thud-dunk-adunk as he eased out of her.</p><p>After kissing the back of her head and murmuring sweet nonsense, Quinn retreated to the bathroom, cleaned himself up, and brought back a warm washcloth to do the same for her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move much. She didn\u2019t look at him. He didn\u2019t know whether that was a bad or a good sign.</p><p>After he\u2019d tossed the washcloth aside, he rolled her over. Finally, she opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey. You all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired.\u201d Her jaw cracked as she yawned. \u201cMan. I\u2019m not used to two days of raunchy sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplaints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a single one. I liked that. I didn\u2019t think I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Libby sat up and reached for the covers. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta be up early tomorrow. You coming to bed?\u201d</p><p>Quinn toyed with the lace on the pillowcase. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d be sleepin\u2019 in the horse trailer again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was rough with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to be rough with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts, silly man. Of course I want you here. No more regrets, no more holding back.\u201d She touched his face. \u201cI want to be everything you need, Quinn. Everything. In bed and out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now come in here and warm me up.\u201d</p><p>He slid between the sheets and spooned behind her. \u201cI missed sleepin\u2019 with you, Lib.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you missed?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I don\u2019t got time to tell you everything I missed. It\u2019d take hours.\u201d He let his lips follow the outside shell of her ear. \u201cDays maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet.\u201d</p><p>After a bit, he whispered, \u201cI love you like crazy, Libby McKay. I ain\u2019t ever lettin\u2019 you get away from me again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Late Thursday morning, Quinn was wrenching on an old tractor outside the barn when a Crook County sheriff\u2019s car pulled up. He wiped his hands on a rag and squinted at the familiar driver.</p><p>His cousin, Cam McKay, had signed on as a deputy after his return from Iraq. The door opened and all six-foot-five inches of Cam unfolded from the vehicle.</p> <p>\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d Quinn said.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019, Q,\u201d Cam replied, slamming the door.</p><p>Cam\u2019s limp was noticeable as he ambled over. Quinn focused his attention on Cam\u2019s face rather than his disability. \u201cOut makin\u2019 the rounds today, Deputy McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish. Is Libby around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. She\u2019s at a conference in Cheyenne all week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat explains it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplains what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Cam held up an envelope. \u201cWhy I\u2019m serving you with papers from Ginger Paulson, Attorney-at-Law.\u201d</p><p>Quinn\u2019s stomach pitched. \u201cYou\u2019re shittin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Sorry.\u201d Cam passed over the envelope. \u201cThis part of my job sucks worse than dodging bullets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get this?\u201d Quinn asked as he ripped the flap open.</p> <p>\u201cFirst thing this morning. I grabbed it soon as it was dropped off. I figured you\u2019d rather get it from me than from Sheriff Turnbull.\u201d Pause. \u201cUnless you plan on shooting the messenger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly. Ain\u2019t your fault and my gun is in my truck.\u201d Quinn didn\u2019t know squat about legal procedure, but he had a pretty good idea what kind of papers were inside the envelope. The rag fell to the ground as he scanned the document.</p><p>A Summons and Complaint, filed by Ginger A. Paulson, Attorney-at-Law, on behalf of Libby Adams McKay, Complaint. Dated...Tuesday morning.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>Quinn\u2019s face grew hot, his eyes smarted. He felt like he\u2019d been bucked off a bull\u2014breathless, blindsided and stupid.</p><p>\u201cQ? Buddy, you okay?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t look at his cousin. The pity in Cam\u2019s eyes would do him in. \u201cNo. I\u2019m about as far from fine as a man can get.\u201d Spilling his guts. Nice. Maybe he oughta throw himself in the dirt and start bawling too.</p><p>\u201cLook, I ain\u2019t tryin\u2019 to be a dick, or to stick my nose in, but Ben made it sound like you and Libby had gotten back together last weekend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought we had.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Finally, Quinn glanced up and waved the paper. \u201cThis ain\u2019t some kinda mistake?\u201d</p><p>Cam shook his head.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Libby since she\u2019s been in Cheyenne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce. She\u2019s always so damn busy at those conferences she don\u2019t have time to call.\u201d Come to think of it, when he\u2019d called her Tuesday night, she had acted more distracted than usual.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because you showed her your darker side. It scared her and she\u2019s rethinking whether she wants to spend her life with you.</p><p>No. Libby had wanted to see it. Hell, she\u2019d demanded to see it.</p><p>Then why with all your sharing of feelings and hours of lovemaking didn\u2019t she tell you she loved you?</p><p>His heart nearly stopped.</p><p>Surely Libby had uttered those three little words at some point over the weekend.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>He\u2019d said them to her, but now that he really thought about it...his wife hadn\u2019t reciprocated. Not one time. Why not? Was this past weekend a way to get him to open up before she leveled the killing blow to their marriage?</p><p>No. Libby wasn\u2019t a cold, vindictive woman\u2014even when the divorce petition clutched in hand suggested otherwise. So what in tarnation was going on with her?</p><p>Only one way to find out.</p><p>Quinn\u2019s boots kicked up dust as he raced to his pickup.</p><p>Cam called out, \u201cHey! Where you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheyenne.\u201d Within two seconds, his cousin jerked him around and got right in his face. Damn. Cam was scary fast and stealthy, even sporting a fake leg. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you go, Q, if you\u2019re planning on doing something stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Cam, you think I\u2019d ever hurt her? I love her. She\u2019s everything in the damn world to me.\u201d</p><p>His younger cousin gave him a hard cop stare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve hurt her enough. Only stupid thing I\u2019m doin\u2019 is standin\u2019 here, tellin\u2019 you what I oughta be tellin\u2019</p><p>her.\u201d</p><p>Cam grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to hear. Drive safe.\u201d</p><p>Four hours later, Quinn hit the state capital. The parking lot of the Sheraton was jam-packed. He rolled the papers up and shoved them in his back pocket.</p><p>Inside the convention center, he checked the electronic display board listing class times and rooms.</p><p>Librarians roamed the halls. Mostly females. Luckily in Wyoming no one paid attention to just another man in a cowboy hat.</p><p>He paused outside the door to Conference Room B and took a deep breath. Rounding the corner, he scanned the women congregated around the beverage station and scattered in groups of twos and threes.</p><p>Bingo. There she was, looking pretty as a picture in a clingy purple pantsuit, chatting with a lady twice her age and half as tall.</p><p>Quinn strode toward her.</p><p>Libby glanced up when ten feet separated them. Her eyes widened. \u201cQuinn? What on earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to see you too, darlin\u2019 wife.\u201d</p><p>The older woman tittered.</p><p>Color rose in Libby\u2019s cheeks. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I got hold of some interestin\u2019 papers today and I wanted to talk to you about them.\u201d He slipped his arm around Libby\u2019s stiff shoulders and smiled at her companion. \u201cMa\u2019am. If you\u2019ll excuse us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>He sensed Libby fuming as he attempted to steer her out of the room. She dug in her heels. \u201cI\u2019m busy.</p><p>This is not the place to discuss this.\u201d</p><p>Quinn placed his lips near her temple. \u201cWrong. Unless you want me to hoist you into a fireman\u2019s hold and drag you outta this room, you\u2019d better keep movin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She jerked back. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d After a couple seconds of her indecision, Quinn flashed his teeth at her. \u201cFine. If that\u2019s the way you wanna play this.\u201d He bent down, intending to throw her over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo! Wait.\u201d Libby grabbed his hand and hustled him out the side door. She kept dragging him along at a good clip until they reached a deserted corridor. She whirled around, hands on hips. But he could tell she wasn\u2019t really mad, just...worried.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened between us last weekend?\u201d Quinn asked. \u201cWas it only about sex?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t one last tumble before you moved on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoved on? Why in the world would you say that? You were there, Quinn. You know how everything changed between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I thought it was a change for the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. It is.\u201d</p><p>Quinn reached into his back pocket and held out the rolled-up papers. \u201cThen how in the hell can you possibly explain this?\u201d</p><p>Libby\u2019s eyes darted away. \u201cIt was supposed to be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never done anything like that. I thought it\u2019d be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun?\u201d he repeated. \u201cSince when is a surprise divorce fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Quinn waved the papers. \u201cA signed document from Ginger Paulson, Attorney-at-Law, starting the divorce proceedings at your request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme that.\u201d Libby snatched the papers and unrolled them. All the blood drained from her face and she wilted against the wall as she flipped through the pages. \u201cNo. No. No! This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did it?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cLibby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast Friday, I\u2019d given up hope. I thought you didn\u2019t care\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember that conversation. We\u2019ve been through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know this part. Earlier that day I signed the Complaint paperwork. I put it in my outbox, intending to mail it...and then you were waiting for me in the parking lot. Since I was out of town this week, someone at the school must\u2019ve thought they were doing me a favor and sent it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t what I wanted.\u201d Libby looked at him beseechingly. \u201cYou have to believe me. I forgot all about it. Especially after we spent the weekend trying to work things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we work things out, Libby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>Relief like he\u2019d never felt swept through him. \u201cSo if you would\u2019ve gone into the library on Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have ripped this into shreds.\u201d Her chin wobbled. \u201cGod, Quinn, I\u2019m so sorry. You probably were thinking all sorts of horrible thoughts about me.\u201d</p><p>Quinn pulled her into his arms. \u201cNever. I was just mighty confused and needed to get to the bottom of it straightaway, since we talked about not keepin\u2019 things from each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hopped in my truck and headed for Cheyenne right after Cam dropped it off this mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cousin delivered this to you?\u201d She cringed. \u201cThat oughta be fodder for the McKay gossipmongers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince it was official business, I doubt he\u2019ll say anything.\u201d He swallowed his pride. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t mind reassurance from you that it ain\u2019t gonna be grist for the mill.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her face up to look at him. \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike...do you still love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I still love you. I never stopped loving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>Libby stood on her tiptoes and peppered his face with kisses. \u201cI love you. Love, love, love you, with my heart, my soul, my everything. Quinn McKay, you are my everything, and if you think for one moment I\u2019m ever letting you go, after all we\u2019ve been through\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quinn dipped his head and kissed her. For a good long time.</p><p>When they broke apart, she murmured, \u201cMy roommate is in a class right now. Wouldn\u2019t it be fun to mess around? Especially when there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll get caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like my kinda fun.\u201d Fun. That reminded him. \u201cWhat did you mean when you said you thought it\u2019d be a fun surprise and we\u2019d never done anything like it?\u201d</p> <p>Color tinged her cheeks. \u201cOh. When I saw those papers, I thought you\u2019d found the tropical island</p><p>\u2018couples only\u2019 getaway packages I\u2019d printed out on Sunday. I wanted to tempt you into taking a real vacation, just you and me, the sand and the sea.\u201d</p><p>Quinn brought her hand to his mouth and kissed her knuckles. \u201cIs that another one of your untold fantasies? Jetting off to a tropical island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if it\u2019s jetting off with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the week after you get outta school for the summer, we\u2019ll hop on a plane and be sippin\u2019 drinks on the beach by sunset. You can call it a fantasy. I\u2019ll call it our second honeymoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? You\u2019d do that for me? Even though you hate to fly?\u201d</p><p>Quinn touched her, the woman he\u2019d loved most his life, the woman who was his everything, the woman who loved him enough to give him a second chance. \u201cLibby, I love you. I\u2019d do anything for you. I wanna make you happy. I want us both to be happy. Not just for a week, or for a weekend, but for the rest of our lives. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Libby stepped back and gave him a wicked grin. \u201cRight after we test the bounce factor of the mattress in my room.\u201d</p><p>Yep, he was really grateful for second chances.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Six months later</p> <p>Libby barely made it to the toilet before she threw up.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Damn flu.</p><p>She managed a sip of water. The liquid stayed down for a change. Good. She wiped her mouth and let the sink cabinet hold her up, hoping she could climb back in bed before Quinn returned home from checking cattle.</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019d pop to her feet and walk those twenty steps to their bedroom. In a second. She just needed to rest her eyes for a minute or two.</p><p>\u201cNappin\u2019 in the bathroom again?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open, giving her an instant case of vertigo. Dammit. She\u2019d dozed off. Worse, he\u2019d caught her dozing off.</p><p>Quinn crouched down, his face lined with concern. \u201cLibby\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you ain\u2019t. You need to go to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the flu, Quinn.\u201d When he scowled, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s flu season. I work with coughing, hacking, feverish kids every damn day. Do the math. I\u2019m bound to get sick a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have done the math, which is why I know it ain\u2019t the damn flu.\u201d He stood and stalked out of the bathroom.</p><p>Libby yelled, \u201cI am not going to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Crap. She hated arguing with him. It\u2019d been a rarity since their reconciliation, but not because they weren\u2019t communicating. They talked all the time. In fact, her formerly strong, silent type of husband had become downright chatty. Libby wasn\u2019t complaining. She\u2019d never been happier and Quinn felt the same.</p><p>Their life wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was damn close.</p><p>Now, if she could just get over the flu that\u2019d been hanging on for the last month.</p><p>Paper rustled and she looked up at Quinn leaning in the doorway. A white pharmacy bag dangled from his hand. She managed a wan smile. \u201cYou went to town and got me medicine? That\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I went to town and got you a pregnancy test.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach lurched. She crawled to the toilet and threw up again.</p><p>Quinn held her hair back and wiped her face. After he situated her on the floor, he stretched out across from her. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>When the queasiness subsided, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not pregnant. I\u2019m never pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant is pregnant. I recognize the signs.\u201d</p><p>Indignantly, she snapped, \u201cI am not a heifer! You cannot judge me by the way I twitch my backside or behave erratically whether or not I\u2019m pregnant for the first time.\u201d To Libby\u2019s utter dismay, she began to cry.</p><p>\u201cAh hell. Take a deep breath or else you\u2019ll be right back hangin\u2019 over that toilet after gettin\u2019 so worked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Shit. Shit. I hate to bawl. I hate to whine. I hate to throw up. I hate that I\u2019m sitting on the damn bathroom floor again doing all three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d He ripped off a chunk of toilet paper and handed it to her. \u201cLib, what\u2019s really goin\u2019</p><p>on?\u201d</p><p>She sniffled and blew her nose. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He paused, but his silences no longer made her nervous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...things are so good between us now. I don\u2019t want anything to wreck it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think havin\u2019 a baby could do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe wanting one so badly did before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it wasn\u2019t the only thing that caused our problems. We\u2019re different now. We\u2019re probably better prepared to deal with all the issues involving a baby. So maybe there was a reason we didn\u2019t get this gift until we were both ready to handle it.\u201d</p><p>Libby stared at him. \u201cYou really think I could be pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Quinn took her hand. \u201cCome on. Indulge me. I believe in my gut and in my heart we\u2019ll be fine no matter what the stick says.\u201d</p><p>She did too. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Quinn cracked open the pregnancy test kit, read the directions a billion times and watched her like a hawk so she didn\u2019t screw it up. In all the years she\u2019d locked herself in the bathroom and conducted multitudes of pregnancy tests, this was the first time she\u2019d involved Quinn in the process.</p><p>They left the urine-soaked stick on the back of the toilet and Quinn set his watch.</p><p>Holding her close, he gave her a reassuring kiss on the top of her head and murmured, \u201cI love you.</p><p>Nothin\u2019ll ever change that. Baby. No baby. Don\u2019t matter as long as I have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same. I love you. God, I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>The watch beeped.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d she answered.</p><p>They held hands as they peered at the indicator.</p><p>Finally, Quinn said softly, \u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d</p><p>The results window read...a plus sign in big, bold type.</p><p>Not the flu after all.</p><p>Libby didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I\u2019ll probably freak out once it sinks in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll make two of us, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean, three of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree. Right. God. A baby. We\u2019re havin\u2019 a baby.\u201d His body went ironing board rigid. \u201cNow that we know, get your butt back in bed, pretty mama. I\u2019m callin\u2019 Doc Monroe and you\u2019re goin\u2019 to see her first thing tomorrow. But today you need to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. I\u2019m gonna make sure you don\u2019t move, even if I hafta hogtie you to the headboard. \u2019Cept I know how much you love bein\u2019 tied up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo arguin\u2019, Lib, I mean it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAre you gonna be one of those hovering, overbearing husbands who obsesses about every little thing during this pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>A beat passed. \u201cI reckon so.\u201d</p><p>Libby leaned into him, grateful to have him standing behind her, holding her up, in every possible way. \u201cI can live with that.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
