It was early summer and past ski season, but the little town of Clyde still managed to pull tourists from the larger neighboring towns. Not to mention, Friday was local\u2019s night when all the residents of Clyde decided to let their hair down and imbibe a little.Callie Colter slid another drink down the bar to a waiting customer then loaded up her waitress\u2019s tray with a round of draft beers and sent her back into the crowd.</p><p>Taking advantage of the momentary lull in the action, Callie leaned back against the counter and surveyed the mass of people packed into The Mountain Pass. The live band pounded out a raucous country song that had the dance floor filled to capacity with people line dancing. A skill Callie had never felt it necessary to learn. Nor had she the ability. She had the rhythm of a slug.</p><p>And really, the whole line-dancing thing? She was still scarred from having to watch a really hokey George Strait movie\u2014courtesy of her brothers.</p> <p>Her mother swore Callie was the cosmopolitan one in the family. Callie had been all over the world, but the reality was she was a homebody at heart and there was no better place than the sanctuary of her family\u2014as oddball as it was.</p><p>And so here she was, licking her wounds and brooding about asshole males. Quite amusing when you considered she had three\u2014yes three\u2014fathers and three brothers, and none of them fell under the asshole label, and no, she wasn\u2019t being biased. It didn\u2019t mean the rest of the male population didn\u2019t suffer the disease though.</p><p>She reached down to wipe her hands on the towel hanging from her waist when the music stopped. She glanced up to see the drummer motion to her that they were taking five. She nodded and set about getting the band members a round of beer.</p><p>\u201cHello, Callie.\u201d</p><p>The husky voice whispered over her ears and sent chill bumps down her neck. She froze, her hand still on the tap.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t be. No way Max was here in her little town, in Dillon\u2019s bar.</p><p>She yanked her hand back and swore when beer foamed over the glass. Then she whipped her head up, sure she\u2019d imagined that voice.</p><p>A pair of hunter green eyes fringed by a set of dark lashes that would make a female weep in envy stared penetratingly back at her. She stared, mouth open, at Max Wilder who stood arrogantly across the bar like he expected her to fall at his feet or squeal in delight to see him.</p><p>It would be a cold day in hell before she\u2019d do either.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes, and he must have gotten some hint of the welcome he was about to receive because he held a hand up as if to ward her off.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk, Callie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened in surprise. She leaned forward and crooked her finger for him to come closer. Eyeing her warily, he bent toward her and looked like he was about to speak again.</p><p>She balled her fist and swung as hard as she could. His head snapped back, and pain exploded in her fingers.</p><p>He grabbed at his jaw and staggered back. \u201cSon of a bitch! Goddamn, Callie, give me a chance to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got two seconds to get the hell out of my bar or I\u2019m calling the cops. And did I mention that my brother\u2019s the sheriff?\u201d</p><p>Carl, her bouncer, thrust his huge body between Max and the bar, blocking Callie\u2019s view. \u201cYou heard the lady. Beat it.\u201d</p><p>Callie craned to see around Carl. Still rubbing his jaw, Max took a step back, his eyes glittering as he stared at Callie.</p><p>He glanced sideways at the mountain that was Carl then back to Callie and lifted one brow. \u201cDo you honestly think that he\u2019ll keep me from you?\u201d</p> <p>Callie frowned. Carl bristled and took a step in Max\u2019s direction. Max didn\u2019t look overly worried\u2014a fact that worried Callie plenty.</p><p>Max was a badass. It wasn\u2019t that he looked like one. He wasn\u2019t overly muscled and didn\u2019t have a tree trunk for a neck like Carl did. But he was fast and unafraid. He knew he was a badass, which made him even more of one in Callie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>His jaw was set in a tight line that made him look stubborn. She\u2019d seen that look often enough. She\u2019d also tasted that strong jaw. She\u2019d licked a path from his mouth to his ear and nibbled at all parts in between. She could still feel the faint rasp of his beard on her tongue, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>She\u2019d also witnessed what happened when Max got pissed off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me call my brother, Max. You can\u2019t think it\u2019s worth spending the night in jail.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared for a moment as his gaze bore into her. He ought to know that she didn\u2019t make empty threats. She could be just as stubborn as he was. Lord knew they\u2019d butted heads often enough, and she\u2019d never backed down. Except in the bedroom. Always in the bedroom.</p><p>Heat flushed through her body, and she hoped to hell the neon lighting around the bar disguised her blush. The last thing she wanted to do was show any sign that he\u2019d flustered her with his sudden appearance.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t finished,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it\u2019s not. I have nothing to say to you, Max.\u201d</p><p>For a minute she actually thought there was genuine pain in his eyes that had nothing to do with the fact she\u2019d hit him in the face. Which was absurd given that he\u2019d fucked her over, not the other way around.</p><p>She flexed her fingers and rubbed at her hand as Carl escorted Max out the front door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you have anger management issues, Callie,\u201d Paul Woodrow drawled as he leaned against the bar next to her.</p><p>Callie scowled at the part-time bartender. Nice of him to show up now. If he\u2019d been to work on time, she wouldn\u2019t have been here when Max came in.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t throw him through the window.\u201d</p><p>Paul chuckled. \u201cGood thing. Dillon wouldn\u2019t be happy if he had to replace more glass.\u201d</p><p>She shook her aching hand and turned to the side to collect herself. She was more shaken by Max\u2019s appearance than she\u2019d like to admit. Seeing him again after so long had been a complete shock. Why would he turn up now? He didn\u2019t even grovel. He\u2019d practically ordered her to talk to him. As if.</p><p>Max didn\u2019t yell orders. He never raised his voice. He didn\u2019t have to. She\u2019d been more than happy to do anything he wanted. She cringed and squeezed her eyes shut. Yeah, she\u2019d been more than happy to accommodate him, and all it had gotten her was a healthy dose of stupid.</p><p>She opened her eyes to see Paul eyeing her curiously as he made drinks. She frowned and turned away. A few months before, right after she\u2019d slunk home to crawl under a rock, she\u2019d thrown a smart-ass college kid through the front window of the bar.</p><p>The upside was that people were reluctant to start shit when she was tending bar. The downside was that now her family watched her even closer for signs she was going to start barking at the moon or frothing at the mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Callie?\u201d Carl asked sharply.</p><p>She glanced up. \u201cYeah. No big deal. I took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to call Dillon?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and frowned. \u201cI took care of it. No reason to bug Dillon. I\u2019m perfectly capable of running the bar. The last thing I need is him or Seth hovering over me when I\u2019m trying to work.\u201d</p><p>Carl grunted. \u201cHaving the sheriff around isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on.\u201d She snorted. \u201cNothing happens around here. Ever since Seth took over as sheriff, it\u2019s been boring as hell. Tonight was as much excitement as Clyde\u2019s seen since I threw the dude through the window. Everyone will thank me for breaking up the monotony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who was he?\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cNo one important.\u201d</p><p>For several long minutes, she stared at the door where Max had departed. Why had he come? Why now? She\u2019d wasted far too much time moping over him. Chalk it up to age and lack of experience on her part, but it wasn\u2019t a mistake she planned to make again.</p><p>Max Wilder could drag himself back off to Italy or Greece or wherever the hell it was he ditched her. She was embarrassed to remember just how long she waited for him to come back before she got a clue and realized he\u2019d dumped her.</p><p>\u201cYou heading out now, Callie? I can take it from here,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know you can,\u201d she muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s busy, though. I\u2019ll hang around in case there are any more problems.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t particularly want to be here, but she didn\u2019t want to walk out that door and chance Max being there, waiting for her. It was one thing to take him on inside a crowded bar. Face to face? Not that he would hurt her. But he wasn\u2019t a man who took no for an answer when he wanted something. Callie wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted, exactly, and she\u2019d be an idiot to find out.</p><p>By the time she closed up at two a.m., she was exhausted and didn\u2019t have it in her to drive up the mountain to her parents\u2019 cabin. Nor did she want to go crash on her brothers\u2019 couch. They\u2019d all be asleep.</p><p>Callie chuckled. It amazed her that her mother had managed to hook up with three men. Lily, her sister-in-law, had done the same with Callie\u2019s brothers, and here Callie couldn\u2019t even manage a relationship with one man.</p><p>She was sure the townspeople, and hell, maybe even her own family, wondered if she harbored the desire to marry more than one man. There was probably a betting pool somewhere on how many men she would end up with.</p><p>She loved her fathers and her brothers dearly, but she had no idea how her mom and Lily managed it. Having more than one man in the house would drive her out of her mind. Too much testosterone. Too many moody males to contend with. Too many egos. Too much posturing, bickering and all-around aggravation.</p><p>Her mom and Lily were happy though, so Callie was all for it. For them. As long as she wasn\u2019t expected to keep with the bizarre tradition.</p><p>She trudged back to Dillon\u2019s office after turning off the lights. He had a couch that he sometimes slept on\u2014well, that was before Lily came into the picture. Nowadays he rushed home every afternoon to spend time with his new wife. One or two nights a week, he came in to work the bar to give Callie a night off, but the truth was, nights off just gave her more time to think stupid shit. If she stayed busy, she didn\u2019t think up acceptable reasons why Max dumped her cold in a foreign country.</p><p>She fished a bottle of water out of the minifridge by Dillon\u2019s desk and then settled on the couch. She didn\u2019t even bother to undress. She propped her feet up on the end, drained the bottle of water and then leaned back to close her eyes.</p><p>And all she could see was that moment where she looked up and saw Max standing just across the bar from her looking as sexy as ever.</p><p>She\u2019d been utterly fascinated by him from the day she met him. He was older, a bit stern, but he had just enough rough edges to his polished look to make her drool. He was strong and confident, and oh but confidence on a man was super sexy.</p><p>He liked things his way, and really, so did she. Now, looking back, she was mortified by just how much control she gave up around him. No one who knew her would ever believe the woman she\u2019d become in his arms.</p><p>That\u2019s what bothered her the most. He\u2019d made her someone else, he\u2019d made her need him, and then he\u2019d walked away.</p><p>And now he thought they had something to talk about?</p><p>She growled under her breath. \u201cGo to sleep, Callie. You\u2019ll go see Lily tomorrow and you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, she obeyed herself about as well as she obeyed everyone else.</p><p>Max Wilder examined his jaw in the mirror and shook his head. A chuckle escaped and then he winced. The little wench had caught his bottom lip in the punch.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have expected any less from Callie. She was fiery, impulsive, she grabbed onto life with both hands, she loved fiercely, but she was also capable of holding a grudge forever.</p><p>With a sigh he trudged out of the bathroom with a towel around his hips. Accommodations were mediocre at best in Clyde. Hell, he was lucky to have gotten a room at all given the fact that there was only one hotel.</p><p>There were much nicer towns that had more appeal for tourists but then he wouldn\u2019t be close to Callie. He had a lot of ground to cover with her, and judging by tonight, it was going to take some fast talking. The woman was lethal.</p><p>And she was so damn beautiful, she made his chest ache.</p><p>He\u2019d missed her. Every damn day they\u2019d been apart, he missed her until she was all that consumed his thoughts. Forgotten was the reason why he\u2019d initially pursued her. That no longer mattered. It hadn\u2019t mattered since the first time he\u2019d made love to her and recognized his other half.</p><p>It was corny. Overwrought. And he didn\u2019t give a damn. Callie was his. He\u2019d made mistakes. Mistakes that had cost them both more than he could ever imagine. But she was his, and he had every intention of reasserting his claim on her.</p><p>It bordered on obsession. His need to possess her. To mark her. To stake his claim\u2014again. This time... This time he wouldn\u2019t let her go. Not ever again.</p><p>He simply wasn\u2019t whole without her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pain\u2014and regret\u2014weighed heavy on his heart. The idea that he\u2019d forego a promise made to the man who\u2019d raised him as his own, that he\u2019d lay aside the request of his dying mother. Her whispered apology that she hadn\u2019t held on to the legacy that should belong to him and his sister and to their children.</p><p>He considered himself an honorable man. A man who put his family above all else. But what he\u2019d done\u2014what he\u2019d considered doing\u2014to Callie wasn\u2019t honorable. Never mind that he hadn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014go through with it.</p><p>Breaking his word was also not honorable, but from the moment he\u2019d laid eyes on Callie, held her in his arms, taken what she\u2019d so sweetly offered, he\u2019d known. He\u2019d known that he couldn\u2019t have her and his honor when it came to his family.</p><p>He\u2019d chosen Callie.</p> <p>He\u2019d always choose Callie.</p><p>He just had to convince her of that fact without her ever knowing the true reason for their chance meeting in Europe. It would only hurt her, and Max would do anything in the world to never hurt her again as he\u2019d done by leaving. Even though his reasons were solid and he\u2019d had much to consider in the time they were apart.</p><p>She thought he hadn\u2019t loved her enough.</p><p>The truth was he loved her too damn much.</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>Callie woke with a sore back and a grumpy disposition. She hated sleeping on the couch. Which was kind of funny when she thought of some of the places she\u2019d slept when she traveled. She\u2019d slept in train stations, hostels with creaky cots, and she\u2019d done plenty of camping. But a couch? She\u2019d rather sleep on the ground.She stumbled out of Dillon\u2019s office, checked her watch and decided it wasn\u2019t too early to head to Lily\u2019s.</p><p>What she really needed was a place of her own. Not that she minded staying with her folks. She loved them to pieces and her fathers doted on her shamelessly. She split her time between her parents\u2019 and Lily and her brothers\u2019 house, but they really couldn\u2019t accommodate her long-term. Not until the renovations were completed. And by then she hoped to be closer to her own dream.</p><p>She\u2019d promised herself, though, that she\u2019d save every penny she earned to build her dream house in Callie\u2019s Meadow, the piece of land she was born on. Land that had been gifted to her by her parents.</p><p>She traveled a lot. She\u2019d always been a restless spirit, but she traveled very economically, and she always knew that one day she\u2019d settle here on the mountain, surrounded by her family.</p><p>In the meantime, she built her savings and dreamed of the house she\u2019d build in her meadow.</p><p>It was a toss-up as to whether she wanted to drive up to her parents\u2019 to grab a shower and make herself more presentable before going over to Dillon\u2019s to see Lily or just show up at her brothers\u2019 and risk them giving her the third degree.</p> <p>At least there she had Lily to side with her, and dealing with her overprotective big brothers was a lot better than a worried mama. Holly Colter was like a lioness when it came to her children. No matter how grown up they were, they were still her cubs and she treated them accordingly.</p><p>Callie smiled as she thought of her mom. Sometimes there was nothing sweeter than a mother\u2019s hug. It really did make everything better.</p><p>She\u2019d go up later to visit her mom and say hello to her dads. But for now she\u2019d head over to see Lily, grab a shower there and do some venting.</p><p>Lily was one of the sweetest people Callie knew. She just had this way of looking at you that made you feel like everything would be okay. And she\u2019d been through hell on earth. Callie respected that. She\u2019d know exactly where Callie was coming from and she\u2019d listen. Right now Callie really needed someone to listen.</p><p>She hopped into her mini-SUV, the same one she\u2019d driven since getting her driver\u2019s license, and pulled away from the bar. The dads made noises about getting her a new truck. They didn\u2019t like the fact that she drove such an old vehicle. But it ran great and the body was in excellent condition. There was no need for a new one. She couldn\u2019t afford one, and she didn\u2019t want her parents footing the bill even though they could well afford it.</p><p>She\u2019d paid her own way since striking out on her own. That wasn\u2019t going to change.</p><p>She knew her parents were disappointed that she hadn\u2019t followed in her brothers\u2019 footsteps and gone to college, but she\u2019d always known university wasn\u2019t for her. She was simply too rebellious and too restless to ever survive four years in school. High school had been bad enough.</p><p>She was smart, and she wasn\u2019t afraid of hard work. All she really needed was her house on her land. As soon as she had the money for that, she could continue traveling and picking up jobs here and there, and she\u2019d always have her refuge to come back to.</p> <p>If Dillon couldn\u2019t give her enough work, she could always help Michael out in his veterinary practice. It was growing in leaps and bounds, and he\u2019d be even busier when the only other vet in town retired next year.</p><p>It seemed everyone in her family was settled but Callie.</p><p>Seth was finally home where he belonged after working as a Denver police officer. After he\u2019d met Lily, he\u2019d moved back to Clyde and taken the position of sheriff from Lacey England who\u2019d retired because of her husband\u2019s ill health.</p><p>Callie had been on her way to healing. She\u2019d licked her wounds for far too long as it was. She had finally achieved a modicum of peace. And now Max had shown up and taken it all away.</p><p>Damn the man.</p><p>She pulled into the drive of Dillon\u2019s cabin and parked between the multitudes of trucks. She didn\u2019t even try to straighten her appearance. She knew she looked like she was hungover but there was little she could do about it at this point.</p><p>She trudged up the steps and knocked. A few moments later, Dillon opened the door and stared at her with that big-brother look that always made her squirm.</p><p>\u201cRough night at the bar?\u201d</p><p>She pushed by him. \u201cYeah, something like that. Is Lily here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s painting,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cBut you can go in. She\u2019s always glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>Callie smiled at that. The feeling was entirely mutual. Lily was just...special. She started to walk away but Dillon called after her.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what went on at the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t throw anyone through the window. I didn\u2019t break anything and I didn\u2019t have to call Seth. So there\u2019s nothing you need to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo says you.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him and went back to the office that Dillon had converted into an art room for Lily. She knocked and then stuck her head inside to see Lily staring at her canvas, her bottom lip caught between her teeth in determined concentration.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>Lily glanced up and a wide smile broke over her face. \u201cCallie! Of course you can. It\u2019s wonderful to see you.\u201d Then she frowned. \u201cWhat on earth happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Callie smiled wryly. \u201cCan I borrow your shower and maybe a change of clothes? I didn\u2019t feel like going all the way up to Mom\u2019s. I spent the night in Dillon\u2019s office and I look and feel like crap.\u201d</p><p>Concern crinkled Lily\u2019s forehead. \u201cOf course you can. Take whatever you\u2019d like out of my closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Callie headed into the bedroom where Lily kept her clothes and found her brother Michael sprawled across the bed reading a book.</p><p>\u201cHey kiddo,\u201d Michael said as he looked over his book. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily said I could borrow some clothes and use the shower.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and studied her for a minute. \u201cNot that I ever mind you coming over here, but why on earth do you look like you slept in those clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I did? I crashed in Dillon\u2019s office last night. Was late closing up. Didn\u2019t feel like driving home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have carried your ass over here,\u201d he growled. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to have slept in the bar. What if someone broke in and tried to rob the place, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and headed into the bathroom, shutting the door before he could really get wound up. She loved her brothers dearly, and she\u2019d always been especially close to Seth, but there were just some things she couldn\u2019t talk to them about. Max being one of them because they\u2019d want to go kick his ass, and if they knew he was here, there\u2019d be no holding them back.</p><p>She didn\u2019t spend long in the shower, just long enough to wash her hair and remove the grimy feel from her skin. Alcohol and cigarette smoke did that to you.</p><p>After dressing in a pair of sweats\u2014because Lily was too tiny for Callie to fit into her jeans\u2014and one of Seth\u2019s T-shirts, she wrapped a towel around her head and went back into the bedroom, relieved that Michael was no longer there. Of course he\u2019d probably gone to find Dillon and Seth so they could gang up on her later.</p><p>She slipped down the hall and into Lily\u2019s office and shut the door. Lily looked up. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen times,\u201d Callie said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Callie walked over and sat down on the floor in front of where Lily was painting and put her palms back to brace herself. \u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d</p><p>Lily frowned and made a sound of exasperation. \u201cI wish I knew. It feels like a big blob of nothing. I\u2019m not sure what the hell I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Lily smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re so sweet to me and so good for my ego. Between you and the guys, I\u2019ll be convinced that I\u2019m the next Picasso.\u201d</p><p>Callie leaned further back until she was flat on the floor. Then she put her hands behind her head and stared up at the ceiling. \u201cCan I ask you something, Lily?\u201d</p><p>She heard Lily put her paintbrush aside.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you went to see Charles...did it feel good to tell him off? Or did it make you feel worse?\u201d</p><p>Callie glanced over to see Lily\u2019s startled look. Charles was Lily\u2019s ex-husband and a complete bastard. He\u2019d placed the blame on Lily for the loss of their daughter, and Callie had never been more proud of Lily than when she went to confront him and tell him how wrong he\u2019d been.</p><p>Lily\u2019s brows drew together and she pursed her lips in thought. \u201cI don\u2019t really know, to be honest. It was such an emotional day for me. I remember feeling betrayed when I saw he had a new wife and new children. I was angry. But by the time it was over, I was just sad. I suppose I was more relieved than anything. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>Callie closed her eyes. She wasn\u2019t sure how she felt after telling Max what she thought of him. The problem was, Lily wasn\u2019t in love with Charles\u2014she hadn\u2019t been for years. Callie couldn\u2019t say the same about Max. Oh, she wanted to hate him. She did in some ways. But his betrayal still cut deep. It was still fresh. In some ways, it was just yesterday.</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d Lily softly prompted.</p><p>Callie sighed. \u201cRemember I told you I fell hard for someone and that he dumped me after taking what he wanted?\u201d</p><p>Lily scowled. \u201cYes, I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met him when I was in Europe. His name was Max. He was... He was perfect. Or so I thought. He was handsome. Confident. Arrogant. He was strong and so dominant he made me shiver just being in the same room with him.\u201d</p><p>Lily quietly got up and sat on the floor beside Callie. She lay down so they were side by side and reached over to take Callie\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI fell so fast. He seemed so into me, so in tune with my needs. I gave him complete control in the bedroom,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI felt so cherished. He took such good care of me. He told me he wanted us to be together. I thought he was the one. I mean, I almost called Mom to tell her I had met the man I was going to marry. I know that sounds horribly naive now. I cringe when I think of how stupid and foolish I was.\u201d</p><p>Lily squeezed her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t be ashamed because you gave him your heart.\u201d</p><p>Callie squeezed back, her chest tightening at the comfort Lily gave without even realizing it. \u201cWe spent three wonderful weeks together. It was all such a blur. Italy, Greece, we explored so much. We spent every moment together and every night in his bed. It was like a fairy tale. I\u2019ve never been happier.</p><p>\u201cThen one day he said he\u2019d gotten a phone call and he had to go back to the U.S. for an emergency. He didn\u2019t give me details. He was in such a hurry to leave, but before he did, he told me to wait. That he\u2019d be back in a few days, a week at the most. He\u2019d come back and then we\u2019d be together. He wanted me to enjoy the rest of my vacation.</p><p>\u201cHe never came back.\u201d</p><p>Lily gripped Callie\u2019s hand tighter. \u201cI hate him.\u201d</p><p>Callie laughed even as the sting of tears made her nose draw up. \u201cYou don\u2019t hate anyone, Lily. Not even Charles, and if there was ever a reason to hate someone, he would be it.\u201d</p><p>Lily sniffed. \u201cI do so hate Max. He\u2019s a bastard for hurting you. I think we should tell the guys so they can go beat him up. Seth could find him for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Callie whispered.</p><p>Lily sat up and looked down at Callie, her eyes wide. \u201cHere? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came into the bar last night.\u201d</p><p>Lily scowled ferociously and she looked so cute, Callie giggled despite the tension in the air.</p> <p>\u201cSo he left you in Europe, never came back\u2014did he call you?\u201d</p><p>Callie shook her head. \u201cI waited. I waited for an entire month. I canceled the rest of my trip to the other parts of Europe I was backpacking through because I wanted to be there where he asked me to wait. I spent every dime I had on the hotel because I was worried he\u2019d come back and I wouldn\u2019t be there. He never called. When I finally made myself face the fact that he wasn\u2019t coming back and that he\u2019d played me, I was devastated. I couldn\u2019t even be that angry at him because I\u2019d made it so disgustingly easy for him. I was furious with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Callie.\u201d Tears shone in Lily\u2019s eyes as she crossed her legs and gathered Callie\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself because he was an asshole. What the hell did he want last night? He\u2019s got a lot of nerve showing up here after what he did.\u201d</p><p>Lily was vibrating with indignation and Callie wanted to sit up and squeeze the life out of her. It felt so good to have someone to confide in, someone to offer her unconditional support.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what he wants,\u201d Callie admitted. \u201cHe said he wanted to talk. He didn\u2019t ask. He just demanded. He\u2019s used to getting what he wants. I decked him and told him to get lost.\u201d</p> <p>Lily\u2019s hand flew to her mouth and her eyes shone with merriment. \u201cYou hit him? Really?\u201d</p><p>Callie nodded.</p><p>Lily burst into laughter. \u201cOh my God, I wish I could have been there to see it!\u201d</p><p>Then her laughter died and fury entered her gaze. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt you, did he? Did he touch you in any way? I swear if he did, I\u2019m going to have Seth arrest him. After Michael and Dillon beat the crap out of him.\u201d</p><p>Callie chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re so bloodthirsty, Lily. I like it. No, he didn\u2019t hurt me. Whatever he may have done to me emotionally, he\u2019d never hurt me physically. He... He was always extremely careful not to hurt me. When we were together he was so...protective. He was so focused on me.\u201d</p><p>Lily pulled at Callie\u2019s arm until Callie sat up. Then Lily hugged her fiercely and Callie clung to her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Callie. He doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p> <p>Callie slowly pulled away. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t deserve me. I deserve better than what he did. But it still hurts and I don\u2019t know how to make that go away. I can\u2019t handle seeing him. I thought I had pulled myself together. But then I saw him again and it all came back.\u201d</p><p>Lily pulled her back into a hug and rocked back and forth. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to make it stop hurting. It\u2019s not something you can just turn off. It takes time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily? Callie? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Callie jerked her gaze to the door to see Seth standing there, a frown etched deep into his face. Lily squeezed her reassuringly and then turned to her husband.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s girl stuff.\u201d</p><p>Seth didn\u2019t look impressed or put off by Lily\u2019s explanation.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of girl stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just needed to talk to Lily,\u201d Callie said. \u201cI knew she\u2019d make me feel better and she has.\u201d</p> <p>Seth wasn\u2019t pleased by being blown off. He glared at both of them. Lily picked herself up off the floor and then reached down to help Callie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to bet that Dillon has breakfast cooked which is why Seth came in here to begin with. Am I right?\u201d Lily asked as she turned to her husband.</p><p>He gave a short nod.</p><p>Lily took Callie\u2019s hand and then pulled her up to her side so she could wrap her arm around Callie\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go get something to eat. I\u2019m starving and I bet you are too, Callie. You never eat well when you work the bar.\u201d</p><p>Callie grinned at the fussy note she heard in Lily\u2019s voice. It warmed her to her toes.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever told you how good you did picking this one, big brother?\u201d Callie asked as she and Lily walked past him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m letting this drop,\u201d Seth said in a terse voice. \u201cI want to know what the hell is going on with you, Callie.\u201d</p><p>Callie rolled her eyes and continued down the hall with Lily at her side.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Lunch was uncomfortable despite Lily\u2019s warm presence and reassuring manner. Callie\u2019s three brothers stared holes through her until she felt taken apart piece by piece. It was all she could do to calmly eat her meal and pretend that her world hadn\u2019t shifted on its axis the night before.Midway through, Dillon sighed and put down his fork. \u201cI think you should take tonight off, Callie. If I can\u2019t find a bartender to cover for you, I\u2019ll go in myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She instantly regretted her easy acquiescence. The agreement had slipped out born of her relief that she wouldn\u2019t have to face a night when Max could very well show up again thinking to ambush her. Instead she should have made a show of arguing and then grudgingly relenting. Because now her brothers would be convinced that something was horribly wrong.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d go up to Mom\u2019s,\u201d she said in an attempt to cover the sudden silence. \u201cShe\u2019s been nagging me about being home for meals, but I\u2019ve been working so much that I haven\u2019t had the chance.\u201d</p><p>Michael and Dillon might have been convinced by her explanation but Seth studied her with complete disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go in with you, Dillon,\u201d Lily spoke up.</p><p>Dillon arched a brow and Callie nearly groaned. Fiercely loyal Lily wanted to go because her protective instincts had been riled by Callie\u2019s account of her relationship with Max. Now Lily would be looking for Max, and hell, she\u2019d probably make good on her threat to have Seth arrest him if she saw him in the bar.</p><p>\u201cNot that I mind you going anywhere with me, sweetness, but what\u2019s the occasion? Saturdays at Mountain Pass can be loud and obnoxious. It\u2019s not really a place I like you being.\u201d</p><p>Lily frowned and Callie glanced over, her eyes pleading with Lily to forget she\u2019d ever heard about Max Wilder. Lily stared back at Callie and then sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a thought.\u201d She lifted her shoulder in a shrug. \u201cMaybe some other time.\u201d</p><p>Dillon matched Lily\u2019s frown. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you with me. I hope you know that. I\u2019d just rather you be here with Michael and Seth where I know you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Dillon. What do you think would happen if I went into a bar? I used to live on the streets, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>All three men scowled at the reminder that the woman they loved had spent three heartbreaking years homeless after suffering a devastating loss. It made Callie\u2019s heart twist too, and just the image that Lily invoked made Callie reach over and squeeze her hand.</p><p>Lily looked at them all in bewilderment for a moment before she seemed to realize why they\u2019d reacted. Her expression softened and then she smiled at each in turn. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t lived on the streets, if I hadn\u2019t experienced the sorrow I did, I would have never found and loved all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we want to even think of you being out there hungry and alone,\u201d Michael muttered.</p><p>Callie sympathized with her brothers. So much of Lily\u2019s past she seemed to take in stride. She\u2019d blossomed from wounded bird to a fierce eagle. She seemed so complacent and at peace with her past, and yet it still bothered her husbands immensely. Not a day went by that they didn\u2019t do all they could to make Lily feel loved and cherished.</p><p>She sighed. Watching her fathers with her mother and her brothers with Lily brought home all the things she wanted in a man. All the things she thought she\u2019d found in Max. Maybe she\u2019d expected too much. Maybe they\u2019d broken the mold when the Colter men were fashioned. Maybe no one would ever live up to the example set by her fathers and brothers.</p><p>It was a depressing thought because after witnessing just how much her mother and Lily were adored by their husbands, Callie knew she could never settle for anything less than what they\u2019d found.</p><p>Her chest ached and she had the strangest urge to cry all over again. She\u2019d sworn she was done grieving for Max, but she felt worse today knowing that he was just a few miles away than she had when she\u2019d first come home to nurse the wounds he\u2019d inflicted on her.</p><p>She pushed up from the table, no longer trusting herself to keep it together in front of her brothers. She made a point of taking her plate into the kitchen so that it would appear as if she\u2019d simply finished her meal.</p><p>She scraped the half-eaten food into the trash and then turned the water on in the sink to rinse it. She was staring at the rushing water when Seth put a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you, baby?\u201d</p><p>Her heart ached at the endearment. Seth had called her baby since she was a toddler. She\u2019d adored him growing up. Always the oldest. Always the one in charge. Michael and Dillon had tormented him relentlessly, but he\u2019d always been the one Callie could run to when the chips were down.</p><p>He\u2019d held her hand on her first day of kindergarten despite the fact he was at an age where being seen with his younger sister was decidedly uncool. He\u2019d walked her all the way to class and had been there at the end of the day to walk her down the street to the sheriff\u2019s department where their mom picked them up.</p><p>There\u2019d never been a time when she\u2019d held back from him. He\u2019d nursed her through countless crushes. He\u2019d sympathized when she\u2019d had her heart broken by her prom date and even offered to escort her to the dance himself. As if she\u2019d really show up with her brother. Instead they\u2019d downloaded movies and spent the evening eating junk food and laughing over ridiculous disaster movies.</p><p>But now she simply couldn\u2019t communicate the depth of her heartache to him. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t trust him. It had been difficult to confide even in Lily. And she\u2019d only done so because she\u2019d felt she\u2019d burst if she didn\u2019t unburden herself to someone.</p><p>Her family lamented the fact that she was such a loner and that she\u2019d always gone her own way. Free-spirited was the kinder description they attributed to her. She was sure there were some less complimentary words they murmured to themselves. Flighty. Indecisive.</p><p>The simple fact was that even in a family as large and as loving as hers, a part of her always felt like she was on the outside. Even more so now that her brothers had done as her fathers and married the same woman.</p><p>And here she stood, the oddball. The one daughter in the midst.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to back off before,\u201d Seth said when she remained silent. \u201cI respected your wishes, but you seem even sadder now. Can\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She winced at the subtle hurt in his voice. She forced a smile and then leaned up to brush a kiss across his cheek. \u201cI love you, Seth. Don\u2019t push me. I\u2019m dealing with this the best way I know how.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look happy. He looked like he wanted to shake her.</p><p>Then she frowned. \u201cAnd don\u2019t go leaning on Lily for information. You\u2019d put her in a terrible position. You know how loyal she is. She\u2019d feel like she shouldn\u2019t keep anything from you and then it would upset her that she\u2019d betrayed me.\u201d</p><p>Seth looked extremely disgruntled over how neatly Callie had prevented him from doing just that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a manipulative minx,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She grinned cheekily. \u201cYou love me.\u201d</p><p>His expression grew serious and he reached out to cup her chin. \u201cYes I do love you, kiddo, and I hate to see you hurting. You know you can come to me with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fix this for me, Seth. I know it goes against your every grain for me to say that because in your mind you\u2019d do whatever it took. This is something I have to deal with on my own, and you know what? I can do it. I\u2019ve been standing on my own two feet for years now.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m proud of you, you know.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrow went up.</p><p>He pulled her into a hug and she laid her head on his chest, soaking up the comfort her big brother always managed to give. Being home was the absolute best. The mountain was her haven. Her one safe place she could return to no matter how far she\u2019d traveled. She loved the constancy of the land and her family.</p><p>\u201cI am proud of you, Callie. You\u2019re an intelligent, independent young woman. All of us are proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me cry or I\u2019ll wipe my nose on your shirt,\u201d she threatened.</p><p>He hastily stepped away and gazed warily at her. \u201cSo what are your plans for the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? I think I\u2019m going up to see Mom and the dads. Grab a nap. I didn\u2019t sleep so well on the couch last night. I\u2019ll have dinner with them and spend the night there. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had two consecutive nights off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re working too hard, Callie girl. There\u2019s no point. Dillon has plenty of employees.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him. \u201cAre you all coming to lunch tomorrow? I\u2019d love to take Lily riding down in the meadow. It\u2019s been a while since I was there.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s gaze softened. He knew how special Callie\u2019s Meadow was to her. To all of them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that sounds really good. I\u2019m sure the others would love to come. It\u2019s been several days since I saw Mom or the dads. If we don\u2019t go, Mom will start squawking and then the dads will be all over our asses.\u201d</p> <p>Callie chuckled. \u201cNice to see my big badass brothers are still cowed by a five-foot-nothing mama.\u201d</p><p>Seth didn\u2019t look at all embarrassed by that.</p><p>\u201cCan I use your cell?\u201d she suddenly asked. \u201cMine ran down.\u201d</p><p>Seth sighed and fished his phone out of his pocket. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Callie. How many times have I told you to keep track of your charger and more importantly charge your damn phone? What if something happens to you on the way up the mountain? Or you get stuck somewhere and have a dead cell phone?\u201d</p><p>She tuned out the lecture because God did Seth love to get long-winded. It was what made him such a good cop. He could lecture anyone into submission.</p> <p>She punched in her mom\u2019s number and shushed Seth with a finger over her lips as she waited for someone to pick up. A moment later, her father\u2019s voice filled her ear. She smiled. She couldn\u2019t help it. She might be twenty-three years old but she was still a total daddy\u2019s girl.</p><p>\u201cHi Dad,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ryan sighed. \u201cYour phone dead again, Callie? Is that why you\u2019re using your brother\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cNot you too. Seth is over here lecturing in my other ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Mom around? I wanted to ask her if she needed me to pick up anything in town. I was on my way over. I\u2019m taking tonight off and thought I\u2019d come to dinner and crash there if you guys don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course we don\u2019t mind, Callie. This is your home. I miss my girl. You\u2019ve been working too damn much. It\u2019s about time you took some time off. Hang on and let me ask your mother if she needs anything.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tightness in her chest eased as she waited for her dad to come back. Unconditional love was the sweetest gift anyone could offer. And in her family it abounded. Love and support were freely given. Never any strings. Unreserved. Fierce. Giving.</p><p>She wanted to wrap herself in her family\u2019s loving arms and never let go.</p><p>\u201cCallie, your mom wants to know if you can run by and grab a grocery order. She\u2019s going to call it in so all you\u2019ll have to do is pick it up for her. She was planning to go into town today but this will save her a trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will. Tell her I love her and I\u2019ll see her in an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you too. I love you,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, Dad,\u201d she said with a catch in her voice. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>She handed the phone back to Seth who was back to watching her like she was some undiscovered specimen under a microscope.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to run,\u201d she said. \u201cMom needs me to go by the store. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow for lunch.\u201d</p><p>She slipped past him before he could start in on his interrogation again. The others were still sitting at the table, not that they weren\u2019t done. If she had to guess, Seth had made them stay while he went in to talk to her.</p><p>She blew kisses at Michael and Dillon, and then she leaned over and hugged Lily. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered in Lily\u2019s ear.</p><p>Lily squeezed her. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Callie straightened, sent her brothers a smile and then headed out to her car.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Could it be called an actual coincidence if he\u2019d spent the entire morning prowling the small town of Clyde in hopes of running into Callie then to finally spot her when she got out of her car at the local grocery store?Max stared down the street, drinking in the sight of the woman he\u2019d spent so many nights aching for. She was beautiful. Spirited. She haunted his nights\u2014and his days. His fingers tingled from the remembrance of her silky skin beneath his palm.</p><p>He\u2019d had her in every conceivable way there was for a man to have a woman. She\u2019d trusted him. Wholly and irrevocably. Callie did nothing in halves. Whatever she did, she threw herself wholeheartedly into it without reserve.</p><p>He watched as she strode from her car toward the doors of the store. At least three people stopped her, and she responded with a ready smile and patience he knew she didn\u2019t possess. For Callie to stand still even for a moment was like trying to catch the wind. She simply had too much to do and see to be deterred from her goal.</p><p>He stood for a moment and weighed his options. He had plenty of ammunition, but the one variable was always Callie. He never knew quite what to expect. It was what he enjoyed most about her.</p><p>Finally he decided to wait by her car until she came out. She\u2019d have her arms full\u2014hopefully, though he\u2019d have to be concerned with whether she threw the bags at him.</p><p>He\u2019d never been able to punish her for her impetuousness. To do so would be to quell what made her so beautiful to him. For a little while, she\u2019d been his. She\u2019d submitted to him and given him the gift of her trust. Her love.</p><p>He wanted it back. He wanted her back. In his bed. In his arms. His to command. His to cherish. He simply couldn\u2019t fathom his existence without her.</p><p>Unlike Callie, he was infinitely patient and he never conceded defeat. There was no option for him but success.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have long to wait. He\u2019d barely gotten over to lean against the door of her little SUV before she appeared carrying two bags of groceries.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see him, which was just as well. The further she was from him, the more avenues she had of escape. But the fact that she was so oblivious of her surroundings, even in a town as small as Clyde and as loved as she obviously was, angered him. Anyone could target her, and it would be easy to get close enough to rob or harm her. He wanted to shield her and protect her, even when it was himself who\u2019d caused her pain.</p><p>As she drew nearer, his breath caught in his throat. There were deep shadows under her eyes, shadows that he knew without arrogance he\u2019d caused. There was a troubled set to her mouth, a mouth he\u2019d tasted over and over. And her beautiful blue eyes were clouded as if she were miles away and unaware of her surroundings. Well, that much was evident because she still hadn\u2019t seen him and it wasn\u2019t as if he were a small man.</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d</p><p>Her name came out more gruffly than he would have liked. There was a hesitancy that irritated him, and he realized that she did that to him. She made him uncertain when he lived his life in control and with complete confidence.</p><p>She halted so abruptly one of the bags slipped from her grasp. Having anticipated just such a possibility, he was quick to catch it before it fell to the ground.</p><p>She stared unblinkingly at him, hurt crowding the depths of her blue eyes. \u201cMove, please. I\u2019d like to get into my truck.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together. She wasn\u2019t going to make it easy. Okay, he knew that, but her refusal to even allow him to explain pissed him off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moving until you agree to hear me out.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed and he braced himself for the storm. His body leapt to hungry attention. He was starved for her, an admission that pained him to make, but he was nothing if not honest with himself.</p><p>\u201cYou talk to me as if I owe you something.\u201d Her voice was husky and strained as if it took everything for her to maintain her composure.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me nothing, Callie. But I owe you something.\u201d</p><p>At that she cocked her head and emotion swamped her eyes. \u201cYes, Max, you did owe me something. Unfortunately, I\u2019m no longer interested in collecting. Now move or I\u2019ll scream the streets down.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and his nostrils flared as he pushed into her space. His legendary patience was wearing thin. \u201cScream then, Callie. Get us both arrested. Maybe we\u2019ll share a cell. At least then you\u2019d be forced to listen to me. Now me, I\u2019d rather have our talk in private, but if you insist on our personal business being bandied about in public, then so be it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any personal business. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Not caring if she hauled off and slugged him again\u2014a distinct possibility\u2014he wrapped his free hand around her slim nape and slammed his mouth down over hers.</p><p>The groceries were crushed between them. Hell, he didn\u2019t care if they were ruined. He\u2019d buy her more. All he knew was that if he didn\u2019t kiss her, he was going to explode.</p><p>Her taste filled his senses. Sweet and spicy, the delectable combination that was Callie Colter. He ravaged her mouth. He wanted to devour her whole. He wanted to drag her back to his shitty hotel room and spend the next three days making love to her until they couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>At first she responded as hungrily as he did. Her mouth moved softly over his and she returned the brush of his tongue with a tentative one of her own. It was as if she was reacquainting herself with his taste. Well, he\u2019d never forgotten hers. There was damn well nothing to reacquaint himself with. How could there be when he\u2019d dreamed of nothing else for the last months?</p><p>Then the moment was broken and she yanked away from him, tears crowding her beautiful eyes. \u201cWhy, Max? Will you not be happy until you\u2019ve stripped me of everything? Okay, you proved it. Obviously I still want you. We\u2019ve established that I\u2019m an idiot. Are you happy now? You couldn\u2019t leave me with any of my pride intact?\u201d</p><p>He swore long and bitter and rubbed a hand over his hair. He wanted to hold her and soothe the hurt and the anger so prevalent in her voice. But now wasn\u2019t the time for gentleness. He\u2019d never get close to her unless he muscled his way in.</p><p>She already thought him a bastard. It wasn\u2019t as if he could get any lower in her esteem.</p><p>He took a step back, lifting the remaining bag of groceries from her arms. \u201cOn your way up to your parents\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze sharpened. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your damn business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show up there, Callie,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cYou know I will. I don\u2019t bluff. You have a choice. Come somewhere where we can discuss things in private. Or I\u2019ll come to your parents\u2019 house and we can hash it out in front of everyone. Either way, you will listen to me.\u201d</p><p>Helpless fury flashed across her features, and her eyes darkened to a blue-black storm cloud. \u201cYou stay away from my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to bring groceries to my mom. She needs them for dinner and I\u2019m expected there. I told her I\u2019d be there. I won\u2019t back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose you won\u2019t. You\u2019re very loyal to your word. You keep your promises, don\u2019t you, Callie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least one of us does,\u201d she said in a bitter voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait. Bring your mother her groceries. You have two hours to return or I come to you. I\u2019m at the hotel. Room 102.\u201d</p><p>Her lips stretched into a thin line. She raised a shaking hand to shove her hair behind her ear. He could see how frustrated and helpless she felt. He hated what it did to both of them. The last thing he wanted was to break her. But neither would he allow her to turn her back on him, even if it was what she thought he\u2019d done to her.</p><p>It was what he had done to her.</p><p>He opened the passenger door of her SUV and put the groceries on the seat. She was still standing where he\u2019d left her when he turned back. She looked tired and shaken. He started to run his hand over her hair, but tightened his fingers into a fist at his side.</p><p>\u201cBe warned, Callie. If you don\u2019t show, I\u2019ll come after you. I don\u2019t give a damn who your brother is. I\u2019m not leaving until we talk.\u201d</p><p>Knowing that if he didn\u2019t leave now, his rigid control would be shattered, he turned and strode down the street toward his hotel. Every instinct screamed at him to turn back, to hold her, to offer her all the gentleness he so wanted to give her. To tell her he was sorry for being such a bastard.</p><p>But she\u2019d have none of that. She was angry and hurt, and she wanted nothing to do with him. If he wanted a chance\u2014any chance\u2014of ever getting her to listen to him, he\u2019d have to strong-arm her into meeting him.</p><p>Then and only then could he afford to show all that was in his heart.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Callie\u2019s pulse raced all the way up the mountain to her parents\u2019 cabin. She alternated from seething with anger to swallowing against the knot growing in her throat.She had to get it together. Her mom would know immediately that something had upset her, and while they\u2019d reluctantly backed off when Callie had first returned home, she knew that wouldn\u2019t last forever.</p><p>By the time she pulled into her parents\u2019 drive she had a semblance of her control back. Her hands no longer shook and her jaw had relaxed enough that the ache in her teeth had dissipated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She checked her watch and realized she had at most an hour at her parents\u2019 before she had to return to town. Max didn\u2019t make idle threats. She knew he was telling the absolute truth. He\u2019d come to her parents\u2019 and then all hell would break loose.</p><p>Never had she chafed at being under Max\u2019s dominance. But now his arrogance and confidence that she\u2019d do as he commanded was like acid in her stomach.</p><p>Willingly submitting and being blackmailed were two different matters entirely.</p><p>She sat a moment in her car as she willed herself to contain her battered emotions. She pulled the visor down and checked her appearance in the mirror, and then, satisfied that she looked the best she could given the circumstances, she opened her car door and got out.</p> <p>She was halfway up the walkway with the bags of groceries when the front door opened and Ethan Colter stepped onto the porch.</p><p>A genuine smile worked over her face when she saw his tall, lanky form that age hadn\u2019t diminished one bit. Aside from the touches of silver at his temples and the smattering layered into the dark brown, time had been very good to him and he\u2019d only grown more handsome with age. Her mom always said that she hadn\u2019t thought it possible for her husbands to get more lethal than they were when she met them but they\u2019d proved her wrong.</p><p>\u201cHi Dad,\u201d she called.</p><p>He went to meet her and pulled her into a tight hug around the bags.</p><p>\u201cHi baby girl.\u201d He pressed a kiss to her temple and then drew away, taking the bags with him.</p> <p>They mounted the steps together and went inside. As she always did whether it had been one day or months since she\u2019d last been home, she inhaled deeply and allowed the scent of home and comfort to surround her in its warm embrace.</p><p>Adam was in the kitchen when she and Ethan trekked in, and his face lit up into a smile when he caught sight of Callie. He opened his arms and she walked into his hug.</p><p>\u201cHey baby girl,\u201d he said, echoing Ethan\u2019s endearment. It was what she\u2019d been called for as long as she could remember and it always brought a smile to her face.</p><p>\u201cHi Dad. Where\u2019s Mom and Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother is in her bedroom. I\u2019ll call her. Ryan\u2019s probably with her,\u201d he added dryly.</p><p>Callie suppressed a chuckle at the implication. Her parents were still so in love that it made her ache, and they evidently still enjoyed an extremely healthy sex life. Not that she wanted to dwell on that, but it warmed her heart that after so many years her mom still had her husbands solidly wrapped around her little finger.</p> <p>\u201cSo how have you been?\u201d Ethan asked as he started putting away the groceries. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen much of you lately.\u201d</p><p>There was gentle reproach in his voice and she sighed. Sadness and relief warred with each other. Relief that she was home where she felt safe and loved. Sadness that she had put such a distance between her and the people who loved her most in the world.</p><p>She stared at two of her fathers and felt something loosen inside. \u201cHave I told you how glad I am to be home?\u201d</p><p>They both turned to look at her and love shone in their weathered expressions. Ethan came to stand beside where she sat on the barstool and wrapped an arm around her shoulders. He squeezed and she leaned her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re home too. We always miss you when you\u2019re gone, and we worry.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cWhen don\u2019t you worry?\u201d</p><p>Adam glared at her. \u201cIt\u2019s a father\u2019s prerogative to worry about his only daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie!\u201d</p> <p>Callie turned to see her mom burst into the room like a whirlwind. Her face was alight with a delighted smile as she closed in on her daughter.</p><p>Ethan relinquished her and Holly Colter enveloped Callie in a hug. Callie sighed with delight and let her mother cluck and pat and love on her. There really wasn\u2019t a better feeling.</p><p>When Holly finally let go, Callie looked up and saw Ryan leaning on the doorframe of the kitchen, a satisfied smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to see both my girls in the same room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for picking up the groceries,\u201d Holly said as she walked around the bar. \u201cNot that I\u2019ll have much use for them, but your fathers will need the stuff to make dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>Adam chuckled and shook his head. Holly\u2019s cooking skill, or lack thereof, was a family legend. It was generally accepted that she was encouraged to stay as far away from a stove as possible. Which was fine with her husbands, because there was nothing they liked better than pampering her shamelessly. A habit they\u2019d continued with their only daughter.</p><p>Callie wasn\u2019t ashamed of the fact that she was hopelessly spoiled by her fathers. And to a degree, by her brothers as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat time would you ladies like to eat?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>Callie hesitated and dread tightened her throat. For just a minute she\u2019d been able to put Max and her inevitable meeting with him from her mind.</p><p>\u201cI know I said I was coming for dinner but I won\u2019t be able to stay after all,\u201d Callie said softly.</p><p>Her mom turned sharply, a frown creasing her pretty features. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally forgot I told a friend of mine I\u2019d meet them in town tonight. But I\u2019ll come home afterward. Seth said they were all coming for lunch tomorrow and I don\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d</p><p>She noticed the look that flowed between her dads but she didn\u2019t react.</p><p>Her mom checked her watch and then said, \u201cYou better be running along then. I worry when you\u2019re on the mountain roads late at night. Try not to be too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your phone charging?\u201d Ryan asked with mild exasperation.</p><p>Callie nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s charging in my truck now.\u201d</p><p>She rose from her stool and locked her knees to keep them from shaking. She hated that Max had made her so unsure of herself. What she really wanted to do was get this over with so she could move on and get over him. What she needed was a hot date. Unfortunately, there was a shortage of hot guys around Clyde, and the few that existed were either already attached or Callie had grown up with them.</p><p>\u201cLove you guys. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, baby girl,\u201d Ethan called softly as she walked toward the front door.</p><p>She brooded the entire way into town. Then as she drove into the parking lot of the small motel, realization struck her. Maybe a little too hard.</p><p>She needed this face-to-face with Max. She needed closure. Seeing him hurt. A lot. A damn lot. But with the way they\u2019d parted, seeing him again was the only way she was going to truly get over him.</p><p>Feeling marginally better, she steeled herself, took a deep breath and strode from her truck to Max\u2019s room and knocked crisply on the door.</p><p>She had but a moment to wait. Max opened the door and stood holding the edge, his gaze stroking up and down her body like he was memorizing her\u2014or reacquainting himself with her.</p><p>Some of her courage died when she realized the close quarters they would be conducting their conversation in.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She shook her head and his eyebrow went up in surprise. No, he wasn\u2019t used to her saying no. When had she refused him anything?</p><p>The ache was back in her throat and she swallowed desperately against it.</p><p>\u201cI think we should go somewhere public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want what we have to say aired in front of others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can be in public and still have a private place,\u201d she said with a frown.</p><p>His hand tightened on the wood of the door and he cursed under his breath. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d hurt you? Do you honest to God think I\u2019d ever hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ve already hurt me.\u201d</p><p>His breath hissed through his lips, and she saw some of his composure slip as fury brewed in his eyes. \u201cPhysically, Callie. Physically.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t lie. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d hurt me. That\u2019s not what this is about. I just don\u2019t think a hotel room is the best place for us to talk about anything.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed and then gleamed with quick understanding. \u201cIt isn\u2019t me you\u2019re afraid of, is it? It\u2019s yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me my pride, at least,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhen have I ever been able to resist you? You know it. I know it. There\u2019s no reason for you to be so smug about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d he swore. He swung the door open and gestured inside. \u201cI won\u2019t touch you if you don\u2019t want me to. You have my word on that. It\u2019s your pride I\u2019m trying to salvage by having this conversation in private. I don\u2019t really give a damn if people know how I feel about you. But I\u2019d never humiliate you by airing our business in public.\u201d</p><p>Feeling chastened, she stepped inside his room and edged over toward the one chair by the desk. She didn\u2019t want to be anywhere near his bed. It was unmade and the indention from where he\u2019d slept was still outlined in the mattress and on the pillow. She\u2019d bet anything his scent still lingered.</p><p>He sat on the edge and faced her, his eyes still glittering. For a long moment he simply stared at her. Then shadows crept over his face. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>She flinched and turned her face away, determined not to break down in front of him.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Callie.\u201d</p><p>The soft command in his voice was her undoing. It brought back too many nights where he\u2019d commanded her over and over. She turned back to see answering grief in his eyes and it left her feeling unsettled.</p><p>\u201cI need to explain why I left you in Greece.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath and waited silently. It didn\u2019t really matter why he left. What mattered was why he\u2019d never come back. Why he hadn\u2019t called. Why he\u2019d done nothing to make her think any differently than he\u2019d dumped her flat.</p><p>\u201cMy mother had been ill for quite some time. Even though she was ill, none of us expected her to have such a dramatic turn for the worse. She should have had years yet. She didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Callie remained silent, unsure of what she was supposed to say. So she said nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cMy sister tracked me down in Greece. It was the first time I\u2019ve ever purposely been out of contact with my family, or my business for that matter. I wanted nothing to intrude on my time with you.</p><p>\u201cShe told me I needed to come home...to say goodbye. My mother was dying and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing I could do about it. I went home and held my sister while our mother slipped away from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Callie said, not knowing what else to offer.</p><p>\u201cI know I hurt you, Callie,\u201d he said quietly, pain echoing in his voice.</p><p>She curled her fingers into tight fists. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell me any of this then? What was so wrong with telling me why you had to go home? Did you think I wouldn\u2019t understand?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, I never thought something so badly of you. I knew if I told you that you\u2019d want to come with me.\u201d</p><p>His answer shocked her into silence and she stared at him as hurt crashed through her all over again.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Callie, don\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? Like it sounded like you had no desire for me to meet your family? What was wrong, Max? It\u2019s okay to fuck me all over Europe but heaven forbid your family is exposed to me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes warned her she was going too far, but she continued on recklessly, her anguish blinding her to all else.</p><p>\u201cI loved you, Max. I thought you loved me. Of course I would have wanted to go back with you. I would have wanted to be with you, to support you during such a horrible time. That\u2019s what love is all about.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered violently and clutched her arms over her chest as she hugged herself against so much hurt.</p><p>\u201cI waited,\u201d she said painfully. \u201cI waited for a month. I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere because I was afraid you\u2019d come back and I\u2019d be gone. I wouldn\u2019t let myself believe that you\u2019d dumped me after all we shared. After I trusted you.\u201d</p><p>Max rubbed a hand over his face and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI finally had no choice but to leave because I was out of money. You never called. You knew where I was and you never even so much as called to say what happened. To tell me you weren\u2019t coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI was grief-stricken. My sister was inconsolable. We\u2019re the only family each other has. It took time to see to my mother\u2019s affairs. There were matters to settle. I had to ensure my sister\u2019s well-being. I knew I would never let you go. I knew that once I was able, I\u2019d track you down no matter how long it took.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here I am,\u201d she said, spreading her arms, her hands palms-up. \u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m fine. Your duty is done. You can leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fine. Any fool can see that. You\u2019ve lost weight. You have bruises under your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve moved on. I appreciate you coming all this way to let me know you didn\u2019t really mean to dump me and that you never gave me a thought during your haze of grief.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was cruel even given the circumstances,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>She raised her gaze to his and did nothing to shield her emotions from him. It wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t see inside her. He\u2019d always been able to see to the very heart of her.</p><p>\u201cCruel? If you loved me, Max, you would have at least sent a goddamn message. Five seconds. You can\u2019t tell me you couldn\u2019t tear yourself away from your sister and your mother\u2019s affairs for five seconds! I would have understood. I would have waited, no matter how long it took.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to wait. I needed time to think!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, now we get to the truth,\u201d she said scornfully. \u201cYou had cold feet. You jumped. I jumped. And it was too fast and you got scared.\u201d</p><p>His eyes blazed and anger rolled from him in waves. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the market cornered on hurt, Callie. Yes, goddamn it. We moved way too fast. We burned each other up. I\u2019ve never had a relationship that was as volatile and as passionate as ours. I worried I pushed you too hard, too far, too fast. You\u2019re young. I\u2019m older than you. I needed time to sort a hell of a lot out, including us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should have had the decency to at least tell me that over the phone,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBecause from where I stand, you took the coward\u2019s way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me and tell me you were certain about us. Tell me you had no doubts and that you were prepared to submit to me for the long-term.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze and calm descended. She no longer shook. In a clear, steady voice, she said, \u201cI had no doubts. I would have come back with you. I would have stayed. I would have done anything you wanted.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes clouded and his hands curled and uncurled. He dragged a hand through his dark hair and she noted that his fingers shook. His reaction surprised her. He was always so cool and in control. He was a deeply passionate man, but not much shook him except the two of them when they came together. They were explosive, and yes, as he\u2019d said, volatile.</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake, Callie. But I\u2019ll be goddamned if both of us suffer the rest of our lives for it. I don\u2019t give a damn that you think you\u2019re over me or that you\u2019re moving on. I\u2019m not over you and I\u2019m damn sure not moving on.\u201d</p><p>He stared straight into her eyes, his face lined with ruthless determination. \u201cGet used to seeing me, Callie. Because I\u2019m not going anywhere until matters are settled between us. To my satisfaction. And to my satisfaction means you back in my bed where you damn well belong.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cYou honest to God think I\u2019m going to fall back into bed with you just because you arrive with some legitimate excuse for breaking my heart? Yeah, it sounds ridiculous and cheesy. But the truth is you destroyed something inside me, Max. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re the one to fix it.\u201dHe pressed in close and grasped her shoulders in his strong hands. \u201cI\u2019m the only damn one who can fix it, Callie. Me. No one else. You gave yourself to me. Well, I\u2019m not letting you take yourself back. You\u2019re mine. I won\u2019t let you go. I can\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>She stared helplessly at him, unsure of what she was supposed to do or say. She was still angry. She wasn\u2019t ready to let go of that anger, because the alternative was more grief.</p> <p>\u201cYou trusted me once,\u201d he said in frustration. \u201cYou\u2019ll trust me again. As long as it takes, you\u2019ll trust me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed and she turned her head to the side. \u201cWhat are you saying? Are you moving to Clyde? Taking up residence here? Because this is my home. This is my sanctuary, my refuge. I don\u2019t want you here.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her in close until her body was flush against his and his heat seeped into her until he surrounded her like a blanket.</p><p>\u201cI was your refuge. I was your sanctuary. I will be again. I\u2019m staying here as long as it takes. I\u2019m not shy. I have no problem going after something I want. Just be prepared to see me. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a damn stalker,\u201d she said in disgust.</p><p>His nostrils flared in distaste. \u201cStalking, Callie? Really? Is that what you\u2019ve lowered me to now? I\u2019m here because I\u2019m not letting you go. If that makes me a stalker then I\u2019ll have to deal. I\u2019m just warning you. Plan to see a lot of me from now on.\u201d</p><p>With that, he grasped her nape and held her as his mouth closed over hers. It wasn\u2019t a gentle kiss a man might give his lover in apology. No, Max had already done what little groveling he planned to do. It wasn\u2019t in his nature to pull back. Never during sex. Never with kissing or touching. He was demanding and strong. Always pushing, testing those limits and pulling back at just the right time.</p><p>His taste burst into her mouth. She\u2019d missed this. God, she missed him. His tongue stroked knowingly over hers, warm and slightly rough as he explored her tender mouth.</p> <p>Her body came alive, responding instantly to his touch. Recognition of a lost mate.</p><p>He was a wall, hard, protecting, and her soft curves melted against him as he pulled her more firmly into his arms. No escape. He forced her to acknowledge him and the all-consuming passion between them.</p><p>Raw. Carnal. They\u2019d always been a combustible force. It was one she didn\u2019t understand. The attraction between them bewildered her in its intensity. She\u2019d been with other men. She\u2019d kissed them. Flirted. Felt the easy flare of attraction. But with Max, she found herself powerless to deny the fire that burned between them.</p><p>Even worse than the tide of arousal unfurling deep within her was the fierce ache that bloomed in her heart and spread with frightening intensity. Grief. Regret. So much regret.</p><p>She slid her hands between them, intent on pushing him away, but the moment she felt the ripple of muscles across her fingers, her touch became seeking.</p><p>He fed delicately at her mouth. Demanding and yet tender. His tongue swept over her lips, as though he were determined to taste every part of her.</p><p>His grip tightened at her nape and he angled in sharper, holding her as he ran his other hand up her side to cup her breast. His thumb brushed across one sensitive peak through the thin material of her T-shirt and she went still.</p><p>She pushed hard and stumbled away, her knees shaking so badly it was a wonder she didn\u2019t go down. She wiped at her mouth with the back of her hand as if such a gesture could possibly erase his imprint.</p><p>Months of separation hadn\u2019t begun to erase his mark on her. One ineffectual wipe of her hand certainly wouldn\u2019t do it now.</p><p>\u201cLook at me and tell me we\u2019re done,\u201d he bit out. \u201cLook me in the eye, Callie. Tell me you want me gone. That you never want to see me again.\u201d</p><p>Tears flooded her eyes and she stood, so starkly vulnerable, so wasted before him.</p><p>He swore softly and moved toward her again. This time he carefully took her into his arms and simply hugged her to his tall frame. He pressed her head to his chest and held her there as he rubbed his hand up and down her back.</p><p>\u201cI asked you to look at me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut never like that, Callie, love. Never like that, with so much hurt in your eyes that it makes my teeth ache. I put it there, I know, but give me a chance to take it away. It\u2019s all I\u2019m asking. Give us a chance.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and melted into him. He backed toward the bed and sat, taking her with him, enfolding her in his embrace until she was curled onto his lap, her head tucked underneath his chin.</p><p>\u201cI never meant to hurt you like this,\u201d he said in a tone loaded with self-derision. \u201cI handled it badly. I handled us badly. And you\u2019re right. I did run. But I couldn\u2019t go far. You kept pulling me back. Always back to you.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her head away so she could look into his eyes. All she saw was a burning intensity. No deception. He didn\u2019t look away. \u201cWhat do you want, Max?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you been listening? I want you.\u201d</p><p>She looked briefly away but then his fingers nudged at her chin and forced her to look back at him.</p><p>\u201cFor how long this time? What about when it\u2019s time for you to leave? Or the next emergency happens? Or you decide you\u2019re not cut out for a relationship? This is my home, Max. I\u2019m not fucking around with you or indulging in some hot fling where my family lives. They\u2019re important to me. They\u2019re everything to me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and brushed a strand of hair from her forehead. \u201cI know I have a lot of ground to regain. Your trust has been damaged. I get that. But give me a chance, Callie. You and me. Let\u2019s do it right this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take you out to dinner. You take me to meet your family. We go out on dates. You show me your town. Show me the places you love. Show me what makes you you.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath. Her heart was fluttering so madly that she had a hard time getting air in and out of her lungs.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo, not okay, like you\u2019ve just received a death sentence. Do it because you want me like I want you. Show me that woman I fell head over ass for. The woman who doesn\u2019t take shit off anyone. Who has so much fire she burns me with every touch. That\u2019s the woman I want back.\u201d</p><p>Her lips slid slowly upward into a smile.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, Max.\u201d</p><p>He crushed her to him, and it was then she could feel that his heart was every bit as out of control as hers. It thudded against her skin like the wings of a hummingbird.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too. So damn much. There was a hole in my chest that was eating me alive.\u201d</p><p>Hope fluttered up, tentative but there. It was tempting to squash it back down. She\u2019d already been hurt so much. But more than the hurt, something came alive inside her, bubbled up until it overwhelmed her. Joy. It had been so long since she\u2019d felt remotely happy that the sensation was alien.</p><p>\u201cTell me yes, Callie. Tell me you\u2019re in this thing with me.\u201d</p><p>She reached for him this time, the first time she\u2019d made an overt gesture to touch him. She brushed her hands over his cheeks, felt the rasp of stubble on his jaw. Then she leaned in and kissed him softly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He groaned but allowed her free rein. She could feel the tension flowing from his coiled muscles. How he remained so still when his very nature demanded that he dominate amazed her.</p><p>She pulled away, her fingers slowly falling from his face. He caught her hands and pulled them between them to rest against his stomach.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just one other thing we need to come to an understanding about.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him warily as his gaze roved possessively over her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re together. In every sense of the word. Which means you in my bed. Every night. No matter what. I\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to build us again but that includes us in the bedroom as well.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled sharply, her body automatically responding to the dominance in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThe words. I want the words.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips nervously and then slowly nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Callie stumbled from Max\u2019s hotel room, her mind and senses reeling. He hadn\u2019t wanted her to go. He\u2019d wanted her to stay with him. But she needed time to process what had just happened. And her parents were expecting her. Lunch tomorrow. She\u2019d told them she\u2019d be back tonight.She hadn\u2019t invited Max. Maybe that hurt him. But she simply wasn\u2019t ready to introduce him to her family. She first had to come to terms with and resolve herself to the abrupt change that was her relationship with Max.</p><p>How could she go from deeply wounded to suddenly happy? Her family would smell a rat a mile away. Then they\u2019d want an explanation, and she wasn\u2019t ready to spill what had transpired between her and Max.</p><p>They would be angry. Understandably so, and their relationship with Max would forever be tarnished by the fact he\u2019d hurt her so badly. They wouldn\u2019t forgive so easily.</p><p>She got into her SUV and drove. No direction. No clear destination. She circled the small town and pulled up to the bar. Dillon would be working tonight since he\u2019d ordered her to take the night off. Which meant that Lily was home with only Michael and Seth.</p><p>She\u2019d promised her mom she\u2019d be back, but she couldn\u2019t go yet. Not without talking to Lily. Her mind was about to explode and she needed to unload. Lily was the only person who knew the whole story.</p><p>She backed out of the parking lot and turned in the direction of Dillon\u2019s cabin. It wasn\u2019t a far drive from town, but it was down a winding private road that dead-ended at his house.</p><p>Her hands shook on the steering wheel, and she took her time, not trusting herself not to wind up in a ditch. When she finally pulled up to the cabin, she breathed a sigh of relief and shut off the engine.</p><p>Before she was fully out of her truck, Seth appeared on the front porch and leaned against one of the posts, his gaze sharp as he watched her get out.</p><p>She smiled or at least she thought she did. Her entire face felt frozen and her lips were still swollen from Max\u2019s kisses.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were staying with Mom and the dads tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was. I am. I had to meet a friend in town. I\u2019d totally forgotten. I told Mom I\u2019d be up later.\u201d</p><p>The lie fell clumsily from her lips and she hated it. She never lied to her family. She never held anything back from them. Until now. Until Max.</p><p>Seth pushed off the post and held out his arms. She went into his embrace and hugged him tightly. As she pulled away, she glanced up at him. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked like you needed it.\u201d</p> <p>It was all she could do to hold the tears at bay. She bit her lip and tried to gather her scrambled senses.</p><p>\u201cIs Lily busy? I wanted to see her.\u201d</p><p>If he thought it was nuts that she was back to see Lily again, he didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never too busy to see you. She\u2019s inside. Go on in.\u201d</p><p>Callie pushed open the door, leaving Seth on the porch. Lily was on the couch, her feet in Michael\u2019s lap while they watched a movie. When they looked up and saw Callie, Lily swung her feet to the floor and sat up.</p> <p>\u201cCallie! I thought you were up at your parents\u2019. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Callie smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going later.\u201d She glanced over at Michael who suddenly stood and took a step toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going out to see if Seth needs any...help.\u201d</p><p>Grateful that both her brothers had taken the hint, Callie plopped onto the couch beside Lily who was looking at her with deep concern in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lily said in a low voice. \u201cMax. He\u2019s upset you again. I really think we should tell Seth so he can get rid of him.\u201d</p><p>Callie leaned her head back against the couch and closed her eyes. \u201cOh Lord, Lily, I don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d</p> <p>Lily scooted closer on the couch until her knee was touching Callie\u2019s thigh. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Callie opened her eyes and turned her head in Lily\u2019s direction. \u201cI saw him after I left here this morning. Outside the grocery store. He insisted I see him. He wanted to talk. He threatened to show up at Mom and Dads\u2019 if he had to.\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cHe can\u2019t do that! He can\u2019t get away with threatening you. I\u2019d like to see him try to show up at your parents\u2019 house. Your dads would kick his ass and if there was anything left, Seth, Michael and Dillon would finish the job.\u201d</p><p>Callie held up her hand. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t threatening, like menacing or anything. He wouldn\u2019t hurt me. God, I\u2019ve made him sound like a deranged stalker or something. It\u2019s complicated. I told him I\u2019d meet him at his hotel room after I dropped off Mom\u2019s groceries. I made excuses to Mom and the dads about why I couldn\u2019t stay for supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Callie.\u201d Lily\u2019s mouth turned down into a sympathetic moue. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t go see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Callie sighed and rubbed a hand through her hair. God, she was tired and emotionally spent.</p> <p>\u201cHe wants to get back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body!\u201d Lily said fiercely. \u201cDid you tell him that ship had already sailed?\u201d</p><p>Knowing Lily needed the entire sordid tale, Callie recounted everything Max had said in the hotel room. From start to finish. When she was done, Lily sat back, a pensive frown on her face.</p><p>\u201cAm I making it too easy?\u201d Callie asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I love him. I still love him. But am I falling back into his arms too easily? I mean, the reasons why he left are valid. But the way he handled the entire situation is just twisted. What if I let him back in and he does it all over again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he love you?\u201d Lily asked quietly.</p><p>Callie heaved out another sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m not desperate enough to ask. Maybe I\u2019m too prideful, but I won\u2019t set myself up for that kind of rejection. I know he cares about me. Call me stupid, but he can\u2019t fake that kind of reaction. He was sincere. Angry and frustrated and sincere. Anytime we\u2019re together it\u2019s like dry wood to a flame. We both go up. If he didn\u2019t care, then why go to all this trouble? Why not just let go? I mean, he made the break. It was done. He never had to see me again. I certainly wouldn\u2019t know how to find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are good questions,\u201d Lily murmured.</p><p>\u201cI feel like an idiot. I mean, I come home and mope around for months, and the minute he walks into town I\u2019m supposed to just forget how much I\u2019ve hurt all this time and take him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut on the other hand, does it make me a petty bitch to want him to suffer and to tell him no, no, no, until I feel like he\u2019s paid his penance and then let him crawl back into my life? How does that make me any happier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d Lily said softly. \u201cHoney, listen to me. All you need to consider is what makes you happy. Stop worrying about what you think you should do to save face or pride or whatever it is you think you need to do. Those things won\u2019t matter in the end. The real question you need to be asking yourself is whether you trust him and whether you\u2019re willing to take a chance on him again. He hurt you. It isn\u2019t about punishing him or yourself. It needs to be about what you want and what you\u2019re willing to forgive.\u201d</p><p>Callie stared at her sister-in-law and then leaned forward to hug her fiercely. \u201cI love you, you know. I\u2019m so glad I have you.\u201d</p><p>Lily laughed and squeezed Callie in return. They hung onto each other for a long moment before Callie finally pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI guess maybe I want him to suffer as much as I have so he\u2019ll realize how badly he hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says he hasn\u2019t? From all you\u2019ve told me, he\u2019s not been any happier than you have, and he had to deal with the loss of his mother on top of all that. I\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t deserve to be miserable for the way he treated you, but maybe you aren\u2019t the only one who has suffered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wise woman, Lily Colter. I know I\u2019m being petty.\u201d</p><p>Lily squeezed her hand. \u201cNo, hon, you\u2019re a woman who\u2019s been hurt by the man she loves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do next,\u201d Callie admitted. \u201cHe wants to pick up where we left off. He wants me in his bed every night. I\u2019m not sure we can overcome the separation between us that quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may want, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll get,\u201d Lily said lightly.</p><p>\u201cOh Max always gets what he wants,\u201d Callie said in resignation. \u201cI have no willpower where that man is concerned. He\u2019s lethal.\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cThat good, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Lily laughed. \u201cCallie, I\u2019ve never known you to back down from anyone or anything. Granted our acquaintance is still somewhat new, but your brothers have regaled me with tales of your childhood and your adulthood as well. If anyone can stand up to this Max, I\u2019d say it would be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink Mom would kill me if I didn\u2019t make it back up the mountain tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what. I\u2019ll call her and tell her I asked you to stay over. Then we can all ride up together tomorrow for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are way too good to me, Lily, but I love you dearly for it.\u201d</p><p>Lily touched her arm and her expression went serious. \u201cYou once helped me through one of the most difficult days of my life, Callie. I\u2019d say we\u2019re good for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe girls have to stick together,\u201d Callie said solemnly. \u201cIn this family, we\u2019re way outnumbered!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The next morning, Callie was still sleeping soundly when Lily gently shook her awake. Callie blinked fuzzily and let out a groan. \u201cIs it morning already?\u201dLily smiled. \u201cYeah. I wouldn\u2019t let the guys wake you and made them tiptoe through the living room. They\u2019re going ahead. I told them I\u2019d ride up with you. That\u2019ll give you time to shower and feel human before you face the entire family.\u201d</p><p>Callie reached up, framed Lily\u2019s face and then smacked her noisily on the forehead. \u201cGod, I love you.\u201d</p><p>She heaved herself up and planted her feet on the floor. \u201cWhat time is it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven. You\u2019ll need to hurry if we\u2019re going to make lunch.\u201d</p><p>Callie pushed herself up and staggered toward the bathroom. Twenty minutes later, feeling somewhat human again, she came back into the living room where Lily was sitting in the armchair.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Lily asked.</p><p>Callie nodded.</p><p>Lily looked dubiously at Callie. \u201cWant me to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep at all last night?\u201d Lily asked once they started down the road toward town.</p><p>Callie grimaced. \u201cNot much, I\u2019ll admit. Thinking too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come to any groundbreaking conclusions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that Max has a hold on me that months of separation and anger haven\u2019t managed to break,\u201d she said bleakly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound happy about that.\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s hands tightened around the steering wheel. She held her breath as she turned down Main Street and drove past the hotel where Max was staying. Only when they were beyond did she acknowledge Lily\u2019s statement.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s happy. Really, really happy. Like that bubbly, giddy feeling you get when you\u2019re really excited about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m worried I\u2019m standing on railroad tracks with a freight train bearing down on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s an image,\u201d Lily muttered.</p><p>Callie chuckled. \u201cBest I could come up with on such short notice, but it fits.\u201d</p><p>They drove in silence for a few moments longer. Callie turned onto the road that led up the mountain to her parents\u2019 house and deftly navigated the holes, the switchbacks and the loose dirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pride,\u201d she finally admitted. \u201cI can\u2019t get beyond my pride. It sounds so stupid. I feel stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid, Callie. Pride is important.\u201d Lily reached over and squeezed Callie\u2019s knee. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. Just remember you don\u2019t have to be pressured into anything you don\u2019t want. This is your turf. He has to come to you. You aren\u2019t at a disadvantage here. He is.\u201d</p><p>Callie smiled and rounded the corner to the turnoff for her parents\u2019 cabin. She shot between the tall pines and rolled to a stop behind Seth\u2019s truck. Then she checked her watch. \u201cMade it with fifteen minutes to spare. Now Mom won\u2019t gripe because the food got cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she\u2019d know.\u201d Lily snorted. \u201cYour dads are the ones getting the food on the table.\u201d</p><p>Callie broke into laughter. \u201cYeah, so true.\u201d</p><p>The both got out and hurried up the steps. Callie opened the door, stuck her head in and yelled, \u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, when she walked in, her parents\u2014all four of them\u2014and her brothers were sitting in the living room, their faces set in determination. And they were all staring at her.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Callie murmured to Lily.</p><p>Lily shot her a look of apology and turned her palms up as if to say she had no idea what was up. Callie let out a small groan. D-day. The day her family was no longer going to be put off.</p><p>She knew those looks. Saw the worry in her mom\u2019s eyes. Saw the grim set of her fathers\u2019 and brothers\u2019 lips. Yeah, she was going to get it from all sides. She was tempted to turn around and run like hell, but she wasn\u2019t a coward.</p><p>She took a step forward and wiped her palms down her jeans. \u201cHey guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie, come sit down,\u201d Adam said in a low voice.</p><p>She winced. It was that tone that brooked no arguments. Even at twenty-three years old she wasn\u2019t too old to heed her dad\u2019s order. He didn\u2019t give them very often, but when he did, he meant business.</p><p>With a sigh, she flopped onto the couch next to Seth. Seth was her ally. Always had been. Only now he didn\u2019t look like much of an ally. He looked as determined as her other family members to make her talk.</p><p>Ryan leaned forward, resting his forearms on his legs. He stared at her with those blue eyes so like her own. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, baby girl? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you told us what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been moping around here for months now,\u201d Ethan cut in. \u201cYou came home like a wounded animal and I don\u2019t see that it\u2019s gotten any better.\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked her eyelids, and the people she loved so dearly went bleary in front of her. Lily came to stand beside her and put a soft hand on her shoulder in support.</p><p>\u201cCallie, we\u2019re worried,\u201d her mom said. \u201cYou just aren\u2019t yourself.\u201d</p><p>She scrubbed a hand over her face and heaved another sigh of resignation. \u201cI met someone while I was in Europe.\u201d</p><p>Adam got this pinched look on his face like he did when he wanted to kick someone\u2019s ass. Lord but this wasn\u2019t the way she wanted to introduce Max to her family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHis name is Max. We had a...misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>Seth snorted beside her. \u201cWhat kind of misunderstanding? Is it the type of misunderstanding that I need to track the son of a bitch down and kill him?\u201d</p><p>She twisted her hands nervously in her lap and peeked back up at her fathers. \u201cHe\u2019s here. In Clyde, I mean.\u201d</p><p>You could have broken a brick on their faces. Ethan\u2019s eyes narrowed and Ryan scowled.</p> <p>She held up a hand. \u201cI want you to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need to explain this misunderstanding first,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Holly got up from her position between Ryan and Ethan and moved over to where Callie sat. With a flick of her hand, she motioned Seth from his seat and then settled next to her daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, baby?\u201d</p><p>Oh Lord but she wished her mother had stayed across the room. Callie\u2019s lips trembled and her nose drew up and stung as tears burned her eyes.</p> <p>It was all over with the moment her mom pulled her into her arms. She buried her head against her mother\u2019s chest and allowed some of her misery to pour out.</p><p>Holly rocked her back and forth and stroked a hand through Callie\u2019s hair. Several long moments later, Callie gained control of herself and immediately felt like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she groaned against her mom. \u201cMake them go away, Mom. This is humiliating.\u201d</p><p>Holly chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re stuck with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily can stay,\u201d Callie said mournfully.</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan\u2019s voice reached her ears. It was a soft command. Full of love. She looked up, unable to deny her father.</p><p>\u201cIf you really want us to go, we will. We love you. It\u2019s been hard watching you hurt and not being able to do a damn thing about it. We only want to help.\u201d</p><p>Callie smiled and wiped at the damp trails on her cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise to like him if he hurt my baby,\u201d Ryan said evenly.</p><p>\u201cHe wants us to be together,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath. \u201cI want us to be together too. If I can forgive him, I want you to be able to forgive him too.\u201d</p><p>Holly squeezed Callie\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll love him.\u201d She shot a challenging look in her husbands\u2019 direction. \u201cWe have to meet him first, of course. And I have to be sure he\u2019s someone I can trust my daughter with.\u201d</p> <p>The sharpness in Holly\u2019s tone made her sons snicker. She silenced them with a look.</p><p>\u201cDid Max have anything to do with what happened the other night at the bar?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>Callie shot him a glare. \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>Dillon stared balefully at her. \u201cIt\u2019s my bar, Callie. Did you think no one would say anything?\u201d</p><p>She scowled and pressed her lips together.</p><p>Her fathers\u2019 collective sigh echoed in the room.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cI might have hit Max when he showed up at the bar. I wasn\u2019t expecting him. I was pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you maybe hit someone?\u201d Michael drawled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I decked him. At the time he deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re ready to be with this guy again,\u201d Adam said with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cLook Dad, it\u2019s complicated. He had to leave Europe because his mom was dying. I thought he dumped me.\u201d She left out the part where he\u2019d done just that for all practical purposes. It wouldn\u2019t put him in a very good light with her already skeptical parents. \u201cHe found me here. He apologized.\u201d Or as much as Max was capable of apology. More like he demanded she forgive him. Which wasn\u2019t the same thing at all. \u201cHe wants...me.\u201d</p><p>Ethan sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll give him a chance, Callie. What do you know about this guy, anyway? What does he do? He\u2019s not planning to take you away from here, is he?\u201d</p><p>At that statement, she got scowls from her dads and her brothers. Even Holly frowned and looked at Callie in question.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Hell. It made her sound ridiculously stupid, but the truth was, she didn\u2019t know a whole lot about what Max did. She knew he was wealthy. She knew he had a job. Or maybe it was that he owned his own business. Finance? Truth be told, she hadn\u2019t cared whether he had money. She hadn\u2019t cared what his job title was.</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d Adam prompted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in finance,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI think we should meet him before we make judgment,\u201d Lily said in her sweet, soft voice. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t make Callie feel worse than she already does. She\u2019s been through a lot. Our support means a lot to her.\u201d</p><p>Oh damn. Callie was going to cry again. She looked up and smiled gratefully at Lily who still stood beside the couch where Callie sat.</p><p>Ryan cleared his throat. \u201cInvite him to dinner. The sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t make it the Spanish Inquisition,\u201d Callie muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough there are so many damn males in this family. Dial down the testosterone for the evening if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Dillon snickered and she glowered at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have your fathers make something special,\u201d Holly said serenely. \u201cIf it turns out we don\u2019t like him, I\u2019ll cook the next meal for him.\u201d</p><p>The entire room erupted in laughter.</p><p>Some of the tension in Callie\u2019s chest loosened, and she grinned at the mischievous glint in her mom\u2019s eyes. Holly patted Callie on the leg.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Your fathers are growly, but you\u2019re their baby. You have to remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Callie returned. \u201cI love you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Holly enfolded her into another hug and when she released her, Adam rose from the couch. \u201cNow that we have that out of the way, are you all ready to eat?\u201d</p><p>And then Callie was surrounded by her fathers, all hugging her and being gruff, and for the first time since she\u2019d returned home months before, she felt a lightness slide through her soul that told her everything just might be all right.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Callie parked in front of Max\u2019s hotel and sat there for a long moment staring out her windshield. She was exhausted from the afternoon at her parents\u2019 but her senses were alive at the thought of seeing Max again. This time without the hurt and misunderstanding of the past between them.Could they really start over so easily? Could she?</p><p>She opened her car door and stepped out, wiping her hands nervously down her jeans. Her stomach fluttered and her chest tightened with each step she took toward the door to Max\u2019s room.</p><p>She raised her hand to knock and froze before quietly resting her hand against the aged wood. She was considering backing away when the door suddenly opened, and her hand fell.</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back and knotted her fingers together in front of her. \u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cWere you going to knock or were you going to stand there all evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you pull up. I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t immediately make a move, he stood back and opened the door wider. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and stepped into the lion\u2019s den. Or at least it felt like it. The door closed behind her and she stopped in the middle of the hotel room.</p><p>Firm hands slid up her arms to grasp her shoulders and then warm, sensual lips pressed to the curve of her neck. She shivered and closed her eyes as sweet pleasure hummed through her veins. A welcome song.</p><p>\u201cYou smell just as I remember,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSweet and a little exotic. Like wild honeysuckle in bloom.\u201d He swept his tongue up to the hollow behind her ear. \u201cAnd you taste every bit as sweet as you smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Slowly he turned her, his hands never leaving her arms. He stepped in closer until she was pressed to his chest. Then he moved his hands up to cup her face and he lowered his head to kiss her.</p><p>A moan gathered low in her throat, swelled and then slipped past her lips into his mouth. He ate delicately at her lips, nipping then sucking, and then he traced a line with his tongue before plunging deep.</p><p>There was nothing tentative or seeking about his kiss. He exerted the same mastery that had attracted her to him in the first place. Strong. Determined. And possessive. So very possessive.</p><p>He kissed her mouth and then pressed a tender line down one side of her jaw then up to her temple before skipping over to the other side to repeat all over again. He kissed her forehead and then pressed his mouth to her hairline and let it linger.</p><p>Tension coiled tight in his muscles. Whispered through his body and into hers until they were two wound springs.</p><p>When he finally pulled away, his fingers threaded through her hair, stroking absently as though he couldn\u2019t keep from touching her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make love to you, Callie. I can hardly think straight for wanting you. And God, I don\u2019t think I can be easy. You deserve easy. Gentle and loving. You deserve for me to handle you like a piece of delicate glass. I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p><p>His words, so hoarse, his need so prevalent was like warm sunlight after a long winter. She stared up at him then touched his face with trembling fingers. \u201cThen don\u2019t be,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust love me.\u201d</p><p>With a harsh groan he yanked her into his arms. She hit his chest with enough force to knock the breath from her, and his mouth devoured her all over again.</p><p>He walked her backwards even as he yanked at her shirt, pulling it from her jeans. He shoved impatiently, freeing her from the shirt, and he wasted no time going for her pants. With one hand, he fumbled with her snap while with the other he unclasped her bra.</p><p>With her jeans still snagged at her knees, he tumbled her onto the bed. He tugged at her jeans until they came away, and the denim went sailing across the room to hit the door with a thud.</p><p>Then he set to work on his own clothing and she lay there, staring through half-lidded eyes as he revealed his muscular, tanned body.</p><p>He was leaner. A little thinner than he\u2019d been before. The whorl of dark hair at the hollow of his chest tapered to a dark line below his navel where it disappeared into the band of his slacks.</p><p>Some of his impatience eased when he saw her watching him. He paused at his fly and began a slow tease that left her breathless with anticipation.</p><p>Inch by delicious inch, he peeled the material down his body until the dark hair at his groin became visible and then his cock slid out, distended and swollen.</p><p>When he was finally nude, he crawled onto the bed and straddled her body as he stared down as if memorizing every inch of her all over again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. So perfect. Perfect for me. Just the right amount of soft and sweet with a thread of steel at your very core. I don\u2019t think a more perfect woman was ever made.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught and hiccupped out until her throat burned with emotion. He\u2019d always been able to say the right thing. He didn\u2019t throw words out carelessly. Everything he ever had to say was measured and weighed. And so exquisitely rendered.</p><p>He was a man who when he talked, others listened. There was something in his tone that commanded respect. And obedience.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me, Callie? Do you want me like I want you?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe words. I want the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want you, Max,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cPut your arms over your head.\u201d</p><p>She raised her hands and leaned back until her arms were high above her head and her knuckles grazed the edge of the mattress.</p><p>Slowly he backed away from her and off the bed until he stood between her thighs. Then he slid his fingers up her legs to hook into the waistband of her lacy underwear.</p><p>He tugged gently, and the tiny scrap eased over her pussy and down her legs to her knees. Her legs trembled as he pulled her underwear the rest of the way off and she was naked and vulnerable to his gaze.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see you again. I want to taste you.\u201d</p><p>She was barely able to comply, her knees shook so badly. She knew she was wet for him. Knew she wanted him so much. His touch. His tongue. His mouth. Everything. It had been so long. So very long.</p><p>Her heart and her body ached for him.</p><p>He leaned down and carefully thumbed through her folds, testing her softness. He dipped a finger into her opening and slid it upward, making her flesh slick with her desire.</p><p>He traced a circle around her clit until she squirmed and lifted her hips, wanting more.</p><p>\u201cKeep your arms above you,\u201d he reminded her when she would have lowered her hands to reach for him. \u201cOr I\u2019ll have to tie them.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Memories of her bound and completely at his mercy exploded through her mind. He\u2019d tied her hands. He\u2019d tied her legs. He\u2019d had her complete submission. And he\u2019d owned her body and soul over and over and over... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lowered his head even as he parted her with his fingers. Warm air blew over her sensitive flesh as his breath huffed out just before his tongue touched her opening.</p><p>She strained upward only to be issued a sharp reprimand to be still. She panted, her chest heaving as she fought for control. It had simply been too long. She couldn\u2019t possibly restrain herself. She couldn\u2019t do his bidding when her body screamed for him.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at her, his green eyes smoldering so hot she shivered. \u201cDo you want it rough? Do you want me to take you now before you\u2019re ready?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she gasped out. \u201cPlease, Max.\u201d</p><p>His hands curled around her knees, and he yanked her down until her ass rode the edge of the mattress. He spread her, positioned his cock and thrust forward.</p><p>His entry was a shock. No matter that she thought she was ready, he was big and swollen and it had been a long time for her. Her body hugged him so tight she wondered if it was even possible for him to go deeper.</p><p>He withdrew and then hammered forward, opening her ruthlessly with the force of his thrust. All the while his gaze was fastened on her. His eyes glittered. Wild. So unlike his usual controlled, cool stare.</p><p>His face was drawn with harsh lines. His lips were thin and flat, and his nostrils flared even as he powered into her again. Her body shuddered. She felt small and helpless, prisoner to the pleasure he took from her body.</p> <p>She closed her eyes in bliss as her pussy rippled around his cock. She arched her body, stretching, welcoming him back.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Callie. Look at me. Only at me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered and she did as he directed.</p><p>His lips twisted savagely as he grasped her hips, opened her wider and forced himself deeper. He thrust so hard against her that her body shook. Her breasts jiggled with each movement, and the sharp slap of his groin against her ass sent a jolt of pleasure, razor sharp, through her belly.</p><p>He leaned over her, pinning her body to the mattress as his body powered over hers. In and out. Rougher, harder until she bit her bottom lip from the exquisite, overwhelming sensations bombarding her at every turn.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t last. Couldn\u2019t. Not against his onslaught. Not after so long.</p> <p>Pressure built, coiled in her belly and tightened every one of her muscles until she was weak from the strain. Her nipples beaded and puckered, and a thousand tiny chill bumps raced over her skin as the flames of her orgasm fanned higher and higher.</p><p>He was so big and she was so tight. She felt him in every part of her body, sliding like velvet through her most delicate tissues.</p><p>Not once did he pause. He pushed. Harder and harder. Relentless. His jaw bulged and he stared down at her, his gaze flashing over her face.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>The quiet order was like a short fuse. It whipped over her body and unlocked something deep within her soul. Her release flashed like lightning. She let out a sharp cry and she came apart, piece by jagged piece.</p><p>Her vision dimmed. He and the room blurred but through it all she stayed locked on him. He\u2019d demand no less. He was her anchor. Her shelter. Her strength. Her very soul.</p><p>He fell on her, gathering her into his arms as his hips rocked spasmodically against her. She felt the quick wetness between her legs, and the ease with which he slid into her body now.</p><p>For a long moment he lay over her body, blanketing her protectively, his chest pushing into hers as he sought to catch his breath.</p> <p>Their legs were tangled, and he rubbed one hair-roughened limb up and down her thigh before he finally rolled to his side, taking her with him.</p><p>He pulled out of her in a warm rush of semen and then he pressed his lips to her forehead.</p><p>She stiffened and he went still. Her pulse bounded even as his hand came up to rub up and down her arm.</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d he asked in a low voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She rolled to her back and stared up at the ceiling as realization crashed through the euphoric haze surrounding them. He let her go, surprising her, even though he rose up on one elbow to look at her through narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t use a condom.\u201d</p><p>She rolled away from him and curled her legs to her belly, wishing desperately she had covers to pull over her.</p><p>He touched her arm but she didn\u2019t acknowledge the touch even though she knew it was a command for her to look at him.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t use condoms before. I saw no use for them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore what, Callie?\u201d</p><p>She exhaled long and slow. \u201cThat was months ago. You weren\u2019t with anyone else. I don\u2019t know who you\u2019ve been with since. It\u2019s not fair to me. Nor is it safe. You should have used one.\u201d</p><p>This time he didn\u2019t ask. He simply rolled her over until she was forced to meet his angry gaze. \u201cYou think I was with other women after I left you?\u201d</p><p>She lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the point. You should have used protection until we could talk about it.\u201d</p><p>He swore under his breath. \u201cThere\u2019s been no one else. Not since you.\u201d</p><p>She stared for a long time, judging the veracity of his words. She hated that there was doubt. Before she would have embraced his words. She hadn\u2019t believed him capable of lying to her. He wasn\u2019t a man who lied. But in a way he had. He\u2019d told her he wanted to be with her. And he\u2019d left her.</p><p>He spread her legs, and to her shock she felt him prodding at her with his cock, hard and erect again. He slid deep, his semen making his entry easy this time. He was deep and hard inside her, and he stared down at her, his face stormy as he pushed into her again.</p><p>\u201cJust you, Callie. You haunted my nights. My days. I never stopped thinking about you. How could I possibly go to bed with another woman who wasn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth rounded in shock as he thrust deep and hard through her swollen tissues.</p><p>She was so hypersensitive after her orgasm, his entry was nearly painful, but there was a raw, edgy bite to it that stirred her response and had her arching into him, wanting, needing more.</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Callie? Has there been anyone else? Tell me, do I need to worry about protecting myself?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock and then she frowned but remained silent.</p><p>His nostrils flared, and he planted his palms on either side of her head and rocked his hips against her.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me. Has there been anyone else?\u201d</p><p>He set a ruthless pace, driving her so close to the edge that she twisted and begged him to let her come. But he\u2019d stop, just at the edge, and he\u2019d watch her with cool green eyes as she went nearly frantic, trying to get him to move again.</p><p>\u201cMax, please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what I want to know, damn it. Tell me, and I\u2019ll let you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said brokenly. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anyone after you. I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head and kissed her softly on the mouth. He swallowed her soft sob and then slowed his thrusts. He began making love to her, so gentle and sweet.</p><p>Slowly and tenderly, he slid into her until the bite was replaced by waves of warm pleasure, seeping into her body and spreading like sunshine.</p><p>\u201cCome, dolcezza,\u201d he whispered, and this time her release wasn\u2019t a violent explosion but rather an exquisite flow of honey, sweet through her veins.</p><p>Tears slipped down her cheeks as she tried valiantly to regain her composure. But he kissed each one away, sipping at the salt and then kissing her until she tasted the slight salt.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d she said brokenly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I missed you. So very much. You\u2019re mine, Callie. Mine. I\u2019m not letting you go again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Callie lay in Max\u2019s arms as the first rays of dawn crept through the window. He stroked her idly, his hand moving over the curves of her body to her hair. He bent and kissed her shoulder, sending a shiver of awareness over her aching body.He\u2019d made love to her the entire night. Raw and insatiable. He\u2019d taken her to the very edge of her limits, and now she lay sated and exhausted but aware that for the first time in months she felt at peace.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of her. Even now, his touch was possessive, like he was laying claim all over again.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d he murmured, breaking the silence.</p><p>She nodded against him as the warm fuzz of sleep settled over her.</p><p>\u201cThen sleep.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as simple as that. She was almost afraid to close her eyes, worried that this was all a dream. A figment of her most earnest wishes. How many nights had she lain awake, wanting him so badly that it was a physical ache?</p><p>She turned, curling into his warm body. She tucked her head underneath his chin and let out a sigh of contentment.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many nights I\u2019ve lain awake remembering how you felt in my arms?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr how you used to sigh like a contented kitten after we made love?\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his chest.</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t sleep, let\u2019s go out for an early breakfast. You can show me your town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He threaded his fingers into her hair and gently pulled through the strands. \u201cI love your hair. I\u2019ve never been able to figure out what color it is. It\u2019s a fascinating mix of black and chestnut with all these warm shades of brown mixed in. It reminds me of a sunset over the Greek isles.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his chest and slid her hand between them to let her fingers glide through the hair in the hollow of his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou were my best vacation ever,\u201d she joked lightly. \u201cI\u2019ve been so many places. But the trip where I met you was...magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m amazed your family lets you crawl all over the world like you do. If you were mine, I\u2019d worry endlessly about what you were getting into. I\u2019d want to be with you to share in the joy of discovery.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cThey worry. They\u2019ve always worried. I don\u2019t think they understand me. They love me. They support me, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve really ever understood what makes me tick or why I\u2019m such a restless spirit.\u201d</p><p>He stroked up and down her arm and rested his cheek against hers. \u201cWhat does make you so restless, Callie?\u201d</p><p>She went silent a moment. \u201cI love chasing sunsets. They look different everywhere I go. There\u2019s always something new to experience. My family is so...settled. Maybe I never felt like I really fit in.\u201d</p><p>She could feel him frown against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cMy family is different. I told you I have three fathers. What you don\u2019t know is that after I came home, my three brothers fell in love with the same woman. It sounds so odd when I say it out loud, but it works for them. It works for my mom and my dads. Maybe in the back of my mind I figured, three sons ahead of me. It\u2019s sort of like a family tradition,\u201d she joked. \u201cAnd then I come along, the only daughter in the mix. The only daughter in generations that I know of. Where was I going to fit in? Hell, everyone probably thinks I\u2019m going to shack up with a few men too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d Max bit out.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve never really understood the appeal. I love my fathers and my brothers dearly, but I wouldn\u2019t want to put up with that much testosterone in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find I\u2019m very possessive where you\u2019re concerned,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re possessive of everything you consider yours.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to consider that for a moment before he agreed. He nuzzled at her ear and then whispered, \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s shower and then we\u2019ll go eat.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, they stepped into the crisp morning mountain air and a shiver shot up Callie\u2019s spine. Max frowned and then stripped off his jacket and settled it over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou should have worn a coat.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him as he put an arm around her shoulders and drew her into his side. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking much beyond getting to you. Besides, it\u2019ll warm up in a couple of hours and there\u2019ll be no need for a jacket.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead and then they crossed the street to the busy caf\u00e9 that had been a fixture of Clyde for longer than Callie had been alive.</p><p>As soon as they stepped inside, Callie could feel the gazes boring holes through her and Max. By noon, it would be all over town, and her mama would be the recipient of no less than a dozen calls all wondering who Callie\u2019s man was.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that Max couldn\u2019t keep his hands off her. He had her snugly tucked against his body and his palm was splayed out over her hip. Anyone with eyes could see that Max had all but pissed on her and marked her.</p><p>The bell tinkled over the door as another customer came in.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d Callie murmured when she realized who it was.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cMy brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth. The sheriff.\u201d</p><p>Max made no move to let her go as Seth approached. Callie recognized the look on Seth\u2019s face as the badass, intimidating freeze-out look he gave people he arrested. Not that he arrested many people in Clyde. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCallie,\u201d Seth said in acknowledgement.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Seth,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d Callie asked pointedly.</p> <p>\u201cI was at the office to pick up some paperwork when I saw you cross the street.\u201d</p><p>The accusing note in his voice told her very plainly he saw where she came from. At this hour of the morning and the fact she\u2019d come from Max\u2019s hotel room, it was obvious where she\u2019d spent the night.</p><p>\u201cGoing to introduce me, Callie?\u201d Max smoothly interrupted.</p><p>Callie flashed a smile in Max\u2019s direction. \u201cMax, this is my brother, Seth. Seth, this is Max Wilder.\u201d</p><p>Seth extended his hand but his expression was anything but welcoming. Callie wanted to kick him in the shin and would have if everyone in the caf\u00e9 weren\u2019t glued to the unfolding scene.</p> <p>\u201cWould you care to join us?\u201d Max asked as he shook Seth\u2019s hand.</p><p>Callie shot Seth a glare.</p><p>\u201cNo, maybe another time. Lily\u2019s expecting me home. She\u2019s cooking breakfast. Of course you could both join us for breakfast there,\u201d Seth said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cAh no, thanks though,\u201d Callie said quickly. \u201cWe already have plans.\u201d</p><p>Seth swept his gaze over Max once more, his stare sending a clear warning. It was that whole male thing that said I\u2019m watching you. Don\u2019t fuck up. Callie rolled her eyes and tugged Max closer to the counter so they could order.</p><p>\u201cGive Lily my love,\u201d Callie said and then stared pointedly at the door.</p> <p>Seth shot her a disgruntled look. \u201cNice meeting you, Wilder.\u201d Though his tone suggested it was anything but.</p><p>He turned and walked back out the front door. Max and Callie waited in silence until it was their turn to order and then they took a seat in one of the booths facing the street.</p><p>Callie picked at her food and glanced periodically up at Max to gauge his reaction to Seth\u2019s obvious hostility.</p><p>\u201cI have an apartment in Denver,\u201d Max said after he took a long drink of his coffee. \u201cAs much as I want to meet your family and allay their fears, I think it would be best if you and I spent some time alone so that when we do meet your family, you\u2019re happy again and you don\u2019t have those wounded shadows in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Callie almost raised a hand to her eyes and she dropped her gaze guiltily.</p><p>\u201cCallie, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back up to see Max staring intently at her.</p><p>\u201cI hurt you. Your family knows I hurt you. I need to make you happy again before I meet them or they\u2019ll never believe in our relationship. You\u2019re still uncertain. I want you to be sure before we face them.\u201d</p> <p>She slowly nodded her agreement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take you to Denver for a week. There won\u2019t be any distractions there. Just you and me and whatever we want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then we\u2019ll leave after breakfast.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise. \u201cBut I\u2019ll need to tell my mom. My dads. And I need to pack. All my things are at my parents\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and slid his fingers over her hand. \u201cAll you need is you. I\u2019ll take care of the rest. You can call your parents on the way to Denver. I\u2019ll buy whatever it is you need.\u201d</p><p>Callie sighed. How Max did love to spoil her. And if she were completely honest, she\u2019d admit she loved being pampered by him. He thought of everything and a few things she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019d seen to her every need while they were in Europe. Her only task was pleasing him. Everything else, he took care of.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll call them on the way and let them know I\u2019ll be gone a week. They\u2019re used to me taking off on a whim, so it won\u2019t surprise them.\u201d</p><p>He raised her hand to his lips and pressed a soft kiss to her palm. \u201cFor the next week I\u2019m going to love you, Callie. When we return, there won\u2019t be any doubt in your mind that I\u2019d ever leave you again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Max glanced at Callie curled up in the seat next to him as he drove through downtown Denver. She was fast asleep, her knuckles tucked to her cheekbone, and her hair fanned out like a veil of silk.She looked fragile and vulnerable in sleep. Underneath her eyes, shadows bruised the soft skin. He would take care of her this week. She\u2019d sleep and rest, and she\u2019d regain the sparkle in her eyes and the wide smile that lit up his world.</p><p>He\u2019d spend every moment pampering her and loving her until she forgot what it was like to be without him. Until he could forget the long months he\u2019d spent without her.</p><p>He pulled under the awning of the upscale high-rise apartment building and his door was quickly opened by the valet. Max held up a finger so that Callie wasn\u2019t awakened and the valet stepped back for Max to get out.</p><p>He walked around to the passenger side, opened Callie\u2019s door and then crouched beside her. He rubbed his fingers over her cheek and she stirred sleepily.</p><p>\u201cWake up, dolcezza. We\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered open and his gaze was met by cloudy blue eyes. Then she looked beyond him and the fog fell away. She fumbled with her seat belt, but he stayed her hands and unbuckled her himself.</p><p>He helped her out of the car, gestured for the valet to take the wheel, and then he tucked her against him so she wouldn\u2019t get cold and walked past the doorman and into the building.</p><p>She was quiet as they got into the elevator. She stifled a yawn and then leaned into him after he inserted his card for the top floor. The action was so natural, as if they hadn\u2019t ever parted. She\u2019d always been openly affectionate with him. So spontaneous. At first he hadn\u2019t known how to react. He was unused to such exuberance, but he\u2019d quickly grown addicted to her displays of affection, and he lived for the times she snuggled into his arms or simply leaned into his touch as she was doing now.</p><p>He gathered her tight against him and kissed her brow as the elevator rose to the top floor. \u201cStill tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go to bed and you\u2019ll sleep some more.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSo bossy. I\u2019m fine. If I sleep more, I\u2019ll never go to bed tonight.\u201d</p><p>The elevator door opened into the foyer of his apartment and he urged Callie forward. Her eyes were wide as their feet tapped on the Italian marble.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous, Max. So huge!\u201d</p><p>It amused him how easily impressed she was. He knew her family was wealthy and yet somehow Callie was completely unaffected by it. It irritated him that with as much money as he knew her parents to have, she still backpacked over Europe, lived and ate like a poor student, and the vehicle she drove was ancient.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d take it easy today, and then tomorrow we\u2019ll go shopping for everything you need.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her hands down her jeans and then turned them palms up. \u201cThis is it, Max. You wouldn\u2019t let me pack a bag. I don\u2019t have anything else to wear.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWhile you\u2019re here, I\u2019d prefer you wear nothing. I\u2019ll make a call and have something delivered this evening for you to wear shopping tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d She arched a brow and glanced at him as if gauging whether or not he was serious.</p><p>\u201cNothing at all,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d like it a lot if you undressed now.\u201d</p><p>Her nose wrinkled. \u201cI need a shower. Traveling makes me feel grimy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll draw you a bath or you can use the shower. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could shower with me,\u201d she suggested impishly.</p><p>\u201cOr I could take a shower with you,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAfterward, we\u2019ll sit in front of the fire and I\u2019ll comb your hair for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you do spoil me, Max,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cNo one has ever taken care of me like you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and kissed her nose. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. I\u2019d prefer I do all the taking care of you.\u201d</p><p>Just the image of her in the shower all slicked down with water had him so hard he hurt. What he really wanted to do was to fuck her against the shower wall and then push her to her knees and have her suck him off while water beat down on them.</p><p>Only the fact that she looked tired and she hadn\u2019t slept the night before\u2014not to mention he\u2019d made love to her tirelessly and she was likely sore\u2014kept him from stripping her down right then and there and hauling her into the shower to have her.</p><p>A little TLC wouldn\u2019t be remiss. Even if it killed him.</p><p>She leaned into him and hugged him as she snuggled her face into his chest. He loved that. Loved how warm and soft she felt in his arms and how she melted against him.</p><p>He circled her body with his arms and squeezed, content to just hold her.</p><p>Finally he pulled away and laced his fingers through hers. He tugged her toward the master bedroom and the huge bathroom with the Jacuzzi tub and the separate shower.</p><p>He left her long enough to turn on the water and then he returned. When she would have begun undressing, he gently captured her wrist.</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her hand and curled her fingers into a fist at her side. Her blue eyes darkened to storm clouds and hunger flared.</p><p>Sometimes it was painful to be around her. They never seemed to get enough. The passion between them was a living, breathing thing. He\u2019d never experienced such a raw desperation for a woman and certainly hadn\u2019t had a woman respond to him as Callie did.</p><p>They were matching halves. Their chemistry was perfect. She was perfect.</p><p>Beautiful, submissive, so hungry to please and to be pleased.</p><p>He could be himself with her. He didn\u2019t have to pretend. He didn\u2019t have to hold back. She took everything he gave her and wanted\u2014no demanded\u2014more.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t offended by his need to control\u2014to dominate. She offered herself so sweetly that it made his gut ache. No one had ever given themselves so freely. And he had tried his best to fuck it up.</p><p>All because of a promise.</p><p>He shook away the unwelcome intrusion of his darker thoughts and unsnapped Callie\u2019s jeans. Steam began rising from the shower and he eased the pants down her legs.</p><p>Leaving them bunched around her ankles, he pulled at her shirt until she was clad in just her bra and panties.</p><p>Unable to resist, he knelt in front of her and pressed a kiss to the silky V of her underwear. Her mound was soft beneath and teased his lips. Frustrated with the barrier, he thumbed the band and worked the lace over her hips until the soft triangle of hair was exposed to his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so soft and feminine.\u201d</p><p>He rose up and tongued her navel and then nibbled a path around it. She thrust her fingers into his hair and held his head against her body as he kissed her lovingly.</p><p>\u201cStep away,\u201d he directed as he rose to his feet.</p><p>She kicked out of her jeans and underwear, and then he pulled her against his chest until her breasts pushed over the cups of her bra.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Just perfect.\u201d</p><p>He cupped one and lifted until her nipple peeked over the peach-colored lace of her bra. The delicate coral peak beckoned him, and he lowered his head. He flicked out his tongue and traced the top of her areola until her nipple puckered and poked rigidly outward.</p><p>Another little push and her breast was free from the cup. He rubbed his tongue over the bud and then sucked it between his teeth.</p><p>She gasped and stumbled. He wrapped an arm around her waist and held her tightly as he licked and teased the delicious treat.</p><p>\u201cShower\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTease,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>He grinned and all but carried her backward through the open shower door and into the hot spray. She immediately let out a groan of pleasure as the heat sluiced over them both.</p><p>He prodded until her head fell back, baring her neck to his seeking mouth. Despite his determination not to start anything, he found he couldn\u2019t stop himself. She was an addiction. A fire in his blood he hadn\u2019t a hope of quenching.</p><p>Breathing hard, he tore himself from the taste of her skin and stood back for a moment to collect himself.</p><p>She reached for the shampoo, but he wrested it from her grip and dumped some of the liquid into his hand. He began at the top of her head and worked the shampoo into her hair. After he rinsed, he grabbed a washcloth and tormented them both by soaping every inch of her delectable body from head to toe, paying extra attention to the parts in between.</p><p>When he was done, she took the cloth, squeezed soap into it and then started at his chest. By the time she reached his belly, he was hard as a rock and so swollen it felt like he was going to split at the seams.</p><p>Her sweet hands worked around his cock and down to his balls, where she cupped and rolled, driving him more insane by the minute.</p><p>When she stepped away to rinse the soap, he groaned. She sent him a pouty, sultry look that only made him want to press her against the wall of the shower and fuck her senseless.</p><p>As water rained down over her, she came back to him and lowered to her knees in front of him. He guessed her intention and reached down to grasp his cock and pull it away from her grasp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, baby. You don\u2019t have to. You\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><p>She gently tugged his hand away from his cock and curled her fingers around the base. \u201cI want to,\u201d she said in a husky voice.</p><p>His breath hissed explosively from his throat as she slowly slid her tongue over his length. The warm water had nothing on the heat of her mouth. She sucked him deep, licked over his rigid flesh and then slowly pulled away until the tip of his cock hung precariously from her lips.</p><p>She lapped at the slit and made a purring sound deep in her throat, thready with contentment.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she murmured. \u201cShow me how you like it, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know damn well how I like it,\u201d he growled.</p><p>But even as he spoke, his hands were on the sides of her face, gripping and holding her in place as he guided his cock inside and then deep. He held himself there for a long moment and then withdrew, sliding across her tongue.</p><p>She was the most erotic sight he\u2019d ever witnessed in his life. On her knees, slicked down, water running in rivulets over her breasts, her face turned up and her gaze fastened on him. Awaiting his command.</p> <p>He stroked her cheekbones with his thumbs and spread his fingers gently over her ears to the slick hair behind them. Her mouth was the sweetest fire he\u2019d ever immersed himself in.</p><p>Hot. Tight. Wet.</p><p>So damn good he was going to lose his mind, his control, his very soul.</p><p>She surrounded him like liquid velvet. Sweet. Fiery beyond his wildest imaginings.</p><p>Each stroke to the back of her throat brought him that much closer to absolute abandon. She swallowed around his cock, her throat working around his flesh with wicked skill that left him shuddering uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cLet me taste you, Max. I want everything.\u201d</p> <p>Her soft plea unhinged him. He stroked deep as his release coiled tight in his balls and surged up his cock. The head of his penis rubbed over the top of her mouth and to the soft tissues at the back of her throat. She swallowed the first spurt of his semen, and the motion shattered the last of his control.</p><p>He gripped her head and thrust. Hard. His orgasm was painful. Ripped from him like he was shedding his skin. Intense bursts of ecstasy splintered through his groin and his knees nearly buckled as he exploded in her mouth.</p><p>He threw back his head, slammed his eyes shut and clenched his teeth so tightly that pain shot through his jaw.</p><p>She continued to stroke and caress him, coaxing the last of his release from his still-hard dick. Each little pet sent another shudder rocketing through his body. Little electric impulses that had him groaning as wave after wave of endless pleasure silvered through his veins.</p><p>He slipped from her mouth, but she continued to glide her fingers over his hypersensitive flesh, her hands working their delicious magic.</p><p>Suddenly aware of the water still streaming down over Callie, he reached quickly to turn off the shower. He felt like a drunk trying to stagger out of a bar as he took a step through the shower door.</p><p>His legs were rubbery and aftershocks still sparked through his body, but his first duty was to Callie.</p><p>He grabbed a towel off the rack and reached back for Callie\u2019s hand to help her out of the shower. When she stood, dripping on the floor, he engulfed her in the towel and gently rubbed her from head to toe.</p> <p>She sighed a little wistfully as he moved to her hair and began wiping the moisture from the long strands.</p><p>\u201cI should be drying you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He leaned in to kiss the corner of her mouth. \u201cHuh-uh, dolcezza. You know how much I love taking care of you. And you already took such good care of me in the shower. For the next little while, I\u2019m going to pamper and spoil you ridiculously.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI like ridiculously. You do ridiculously really well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped her hair in a towel, and then he retrieved the plush robe from the hook on the back of the door and pulled it around her body until she was engulfed by the thick terrycloth.</p><p>\u201cGo in the living room and wait for me,\u201d he directed. \u201cIt\u2019ll just take me a minute to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Callie walked into the living room, drawing the robe tighter around her. It wasn\u2019t that it was cold. In fact, the apartment was at a perfect temperature. Heat rose from the floors and a fire blazed in the hearth though she guessed it was a gas log.Still, it looked inviting and she went to stand in front of it. When she turned her back to warm the hands she held behind her, she stared out the opposing window to the view of downtown Denver and distant mountains.</p><p>In a lot of ways, this reminded her of traveling across Greece and Italy with Max. She\u2019d always backpacked and stayed in hostels or slept in train stations. Max was horrified at the idea that a young woman for all practical purposes was operating as a homeless person.</p><p>Callie had laughed and said for all practical purposes he was right. She had money but it had to be strictly rationed, and if she could get cheap accommodations or a place to camp, then she didn\u2019t have to dip into her cash reserve, which meant she could travel even longer.</p><p>Max had put an end to all that from the moment Callie first let him make love to her. He\u2019d taken over\u2014not in an overbearing, assholish way\u2014but rather he wanted to take care of her and proceeded to do just that.</p><p>He was firm. He was stubborn. But he wasn\u2019t a jerk who got off on giving her orders.</p><p>She smiled as she remembered one particular conversation they\u2019d shared in one of the sumptuous hotel rooms he\u2019d reserved. She was on her knees on a thick, plush carpet not unlike the one in his apartment now.</p><p>Max had rubbed his hand up and down her cheek in an affectionate caress and asked, \u201cDo I have your obedience, Callie?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose and curled her lip in distaste. \u201cI don\u2019t like that word. I\u2019m not a child. You aren\u2019t my parents. I\u2019m not some wayward twit who needs to be kept in line. Surely there has to be a better way to get your point across, Max. You know I love pleasing you. I need to please you. But please don\u2019t use words like obedience, because it suggests something I don\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and leaned down to kiss her furrowed brow. \u201cYou worry too much, dolcezza. I never want to make you uncomfortable, to degrade you or make you feel any less than you are. If I ever cross that line, I hope you will, in true Callie fashion, kick my ever-loving ass.\u201d</p><p>She grinned back at him. \u201cYou bet your ass.\u201d</p><p>His face grew serious once more and he touched her cheek again. \u201cDo I have your submission?\u201d</p><p>She thought for a long moment about what he was asking for. To some, obedience and submission were probably the same thing. Not to her. Obedience suggested blind loyalty. No free will. Submission suggested a choice. A choice to place herself in the care of another. But with conditions. Trust. Always trust. Obedience didn\u2019t necessarily equate to trust.</p><p>If someone was in a position of authority over another, they could command obedience and it would be far different than Callie offering her submission to Max. To give her care and trust to this man.</p><p>Finally she looked up at him, her brows drawn in seriousness. \u201cYes, Max. You have my submission. Willingly and joyfully.\u201d</p><p>Callie sighed at the remembrance, and a shiver of delight skittered over her shoulders. They\u2019d spent so many wonderful nights together. She\u2019d submitted without regret. Until the day he\u2019d left and hadn\u2019t returned.</p><p>Frowning at the unhappy turn of her thoughts, she hugged her arms and walked away from the fire. She unwound the towel from her hair and dropped it on the floor as she came to stand in front of the window.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear Max\u2019s approach. Didn\u2019t know he was behind her until his hands closed over her shoulders and he brushed a kiss over her temple.</p><p>She turned instinctively into the warmth and comfort of his body. He hugged her close, wrapping those strong arms around her, and she tucked her head underneath his chin.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if you know how glad I am to have you back where you belong.\u201d</p><p>She smiled but didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. It was easy to pretend that they\u2019d never separated and that this was just an extension of the time they\u2019d spent together in Europe.</p><p>Maybe he sensed her hesitancy because he pulled away and stared down at her with his intense gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>She started to respond but then wondered if she should really voice what she\u2019d been thinking. She didn\u2019t want to ruin what had been a perfect afternoon.</p><p>Max frowned and then tugged her toward the couch. He settled on the end and then pulled her down onto his lap until she was curled in his arms, her back against the arm of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pull any punches, Callie. Not with me. Whatever it is you were about to say, just say it. We won\u2019t be able to move forward until we clear the air.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and leaned her head over until it was pillowed on his shoulder. \u201cI was just thinking about Europe. It was such a fantasy, so dreamlike when we were together. Every day was so perfect and I wondered if it was too good to be true. Then when you left and I finally came home, I convinced myself that\u2019s all it was. Just a fantasy. It wasn\u2019t meant to last.\u201d</p><p>She shifted so she could look at him. She felt she owed it to him for what she was about to say.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if that\u2019s what this is. Another fantasy. Something too good to be true and if it will disappear just like before. I wonder if I\u2019m deluding myself, and worse, I wonder how stupid I am for allowing it to happen all over again when I know you have so much power to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>She thought he might be angry, but she couldn\u2019t be anything less than honest. His answer surprised her, though.</p><p>\u201cI understand why you feel that way,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. I know I\u2019m asking a lot, particularly because I\u2019m not only asking you for another chance, but I\u2019m asking for your complete and utter trust. I\u2019m asking you to cede power to me. I\u2019m asking for your submission\u2014again.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded, glad that at least he understood her conflict. And her fear.</p><p>He smoothed his fingers over her still-damp hair, his gaze so intent on her that she had no doubt of his sincerity.</p><p>\u201cI want you, Callie. I want us. I want to see where this takes us. I\u2019ve tried it without you. I was miserable, and I think you were too. I think we\u2019re better together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want us too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to talk about, though. So much we didn\u2019t cover in Europe. I don\u2019t even know what you do. My family asked, and I felt like the worst sort of idiot. I know nothing about you. And yet you know so much about me.\u201d</p><p>Max pressed his lips to her forehead in a gesture so tender that her chest tightened. \u201cThat is what this week is for, dolcezza. Us. So that when we go meet your family, there is no doubt to anyone looking at us that you\u2019re happy and confident.\u201d</p><p>Her heart fluttered at the endearment he\u2019d teasingly begun when they were in Italy. He\u2019d taught her words of love and affection in many languages, but dolcezza had been her favorite. His eyes always burned a little brighter when he called her that.</p><p>\u201cAnd to begin our week, I want you naked. I love the feel of your skin. I love the beauty of your body. My desire is that when we are in private I am never deprived of your sweetness.\u201d</p><p>He pulled gently at the tie and then helped her to her feet. He stood in front of her and carefully peeled away the robe until she was naked in front of him, her skin soft and warm from the shower.</p><p>\u201cBellissima,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou are very beautiful, dolcezza. Even more so because you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>He reached for a comb lying on the end table and then sat back on the couch, spreading his thighs. He patted the space between his legs.</p><p>\u201cSit so I can comb your hair while it\u2019s still damp.\u201d</p><p>She turned and then settled on the edge of the couch. His hands slipped over her hips as he steadied her, and then they wandered up her waist and around to cup her breasts.</p><p>He toyed idly with her nipples until they were rigid, and then he slid his hands up over her shoulders and gathered her hair at her nape.</p><p>\u201cI love having the freedom to touch you however and whenever I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a spoiled man,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to you, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a caveman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is a problem?\u201d he asked as he began working the comb through the ends of her hair.</p><p>\u201cEvidently not.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t resist you even when your knuckles are dragging the ground and you grunt stuff like \u2018my woman\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right you\u2019re my woman. What else am I supposed to say?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cIf I have to tell you then you require more work than I\u2019m willing to put in to make you civilized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it, you love that I\u2019m completely uncivilized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, and I don\u2019t want to know what that says about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says you\u2019re a woman with intelligent, discerning tastes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip when she would have said indeed she did. He\u2019d said it in a light, teasing way. Like someone would say to a friend. Oh, you love me.</p><p>Only she did love him. So much it hurt. But it was the one part of herself she did hold back from him. Despite the fact that she\u2019d forgiven him. She was willing to try again. She\u2019d give him another chance. But she\u2019d be a fool to make herself utterly vulnerable to him. Not yet.</p> <p>\u201cTell me about you,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWhat makes you who you are, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a loaded question.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMaybe. But it shouldn\u2019t be a difficult question. It shouldn\u2019t cause you any issue to answer.\u201d</p><p>She could picture his brows knitting as he pondered the best way to answer. He paused for a moment, his fingers tangled in her hair, the comb still in his hand. Then he began combing again. Long, steady strokes. Infinitely gentle.</p><p>\u201cI made my fortune at a young age. For me it was necessity, not so much desire. It wasn\u2019t that I craved fine things. Or even money. For me money wasn\u2019t about the luxuries it could provide, but the necessities and what I could give to my mother and my sister.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted my mother not to have to worry. I wanted her to have the same lifestyle she had when she was married to my stepfather. I wanted my sister to go to the best schools and have all she needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you do all that? You make it sound so simple.\u201d</p><p>He tugged at one particularly difficult tangle and then carefully worked out the snarl.</p><p>\u201cI worked my ass off. Two, sometimes three jobs. Every penny I made at first was saved to buy my first property. I sold it for a ten-thousand-dollar profit and you\u2019d have thought I hung the moon. I used all of it to make my next investment and with the second sale, I made a whopping six-figure profit. Part of it was luck. Being in the right place at the right time, but just as much of it was determination to succeed. Failure simply wasn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p><p>That she could believe. She couldn\u2019t imagine Max failing at anything he set his mind to. To hear his story only confirmed what she already knew. Max was driven. He was ruthless when he had to be.</p><p>She shivered with sudden realization. He\u2019d made it clear that she was his current ambition. And if his past was anything to go by, she didn\u2019t have a chance in hell of resisting him.</p> <p>But then she didn\u2019t really want to.</p><p>Was she a temporary challenge? Had he pursued other women as he\u2019d done her?</p><p>Silence fell between them as he continued his careful combing of her hair. He was meticulous, separating each of the strands and working the tangles out.</p><p>She wondered how much experience he had with taking care of other women. The thought was unwelcome and painful. It was also stupid. His past was just that. His past. Just like he couldn\u2019t hold any of her past lovers against her. But it still cut at her to think of other women under his care. Submitting to him as she was submitting to him.</p><p>She frowned again. Had he had such relationships in the past? Surely he had. He was simply too comfortable and too adept at seeing to her every need. He was arrogant but not in a petulant fashion. He wore arrogance like it was his due. Like he was convinced, not trying to convince others.</p><p>And he was extremely confident and comfortable as someone always in control.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tense. What are you thinking now?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. Heat crawled over her skin as he caught her out again.</p> <p>\u201cCallie,\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re very good at this,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cI wondered how many other women you\u2019ve shared this sort of relationship with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d he asked bluntly. \u201cOr are you just torturing yourself?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cBoth, I guess. It\u2019s natural to be curious. And natural to discuss prior relationships. Don\u2019t you think? Isn\u2019t this the sort of thing all couples get into after a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it is. It\u2019s a sticky subject though. If you aren\u2019t prepared for the answer or if it hurts you, it\u2019s best not to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know. Never ask for an answer you aren\u2019t prepared to receive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI propose that I finish combing your hair, and then I need to make a few business calls. I\u2019ve already made arrangements for dinner to be delivered as well as something for you to wear tomorrow. Those things should be arriving soon. Then, if you still want to have this discussion, we\u2019ll talk about it while we eat.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her agreement.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be enjoying this.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, leaned back and once more allowed the pleasure of his attentions to seep back into her veins. But still, the image of another woman in her place unsettled her.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Callie sat on the couch with her feet curled beneath her as she listened to Max make his phone calls. Earlier he\u2019d ordered clothing for her. He hadn\u2019t asked her sizes. Not even for her girly things, and somehow she knew he\u2019d gotten them right. Which further confirmed her suspicion that he\u2019d been around the block more than a few times.And it didn\u2019t bother her. Not really. Not in the sense that she was about to become an insanely jealous, crazy girlfriend. But she wondered. Not over his relationships exactly. But Max was a man who liked things his way. He became entrenched. He liked routine. He didn\u2019t like change.</p><p>So what had happened to those other women? Had he discarded them as he\u2019d done her? Okay so technically he hadn\u2019t discarded her since he\u2019d come looking for her. But had he grown bored with his other relationships? Would he become bored with her?</p><p>She hated all the doubts, but the one thing she\u2019d come to realize in the months after she\u2019d returned home was that for as much time as she\u2019d spent with Max, for as much of herself as she\u2019d given him, they hadn\u2019t ever discussed the future. Their relationship had been very much in the now. Live for the moment.</p><p>No past. No future. Only the present.</p><p>She glanced over to where he stood murmuring in low tones on the phone. He\u2019d only just offered her a glimpse into his past. He now spoke of the future. That should reassure her. Shouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>Her gaze left him, and her lips pursed as she contemplated the complexity of her relationship with Max. In so many ways, he was an enigma, though finally she was beginning to scratch the surface. This time around she wasn\u2019t going to be content with just what he offered her peripherally. She wanted the whole package. She\u2019d been so blinded by her infatuation and then love for him, that she made the mistake so many people made when a relationship was all shiny and new. She hadn\u2019t taken the time to get to know him on a much deeper level.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>Callie looked up and realized that while she\u2019d been lost in her thoughts, Max had finished his calls and was now standing in front of her.</p><p>She glanced down her nude body and then shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood. If you\u2019re going to be naked, and I prefer you that way, I want to make sure the apartment is kept at a comfortable temperature for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about...\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow and waited.</p><p>\u201cWhat about when people come in? I mean like when dinner is delivered.\u201d</p><p>He crouched down in front of her and slid his hand down the curve of her hip to her knee and then up again. \u201cNo one else will see you, Callie. I\u2019m fiercely protective of what\u2019s mine. No one will be allowed inside the apartment while you are here unless you\u2019re appropriately attired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do I eat nekkid?\u201d she asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a better meal than to have you nude in front of me. You\u2019ll eat from my hand. I\u2019ll see to your every need.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the husky thrall of his voice. She\u2019d been completely his in Europe but now she realized she\u2019d only gotten a taste of his dominance. They\u2019d still been on the cusp of something new, still finding their way, and he\u2019d likely held some of himself in reserve until she was more comfortable with him.</p><p>\u201cTell me something, Max. Is my submission contained only to the bedroom or do you expect me to cede control to you in all aspects of my life?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his thumb over her nipple, teasing it to a rigid peak. \u201cYou\u2019re asking a lot of questions, and I\u2019m unsure whether you\u2019re prepared for the answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want your honesty,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not some fragile little flower who wilts because your answers aren\u2019t all pretty and sweet. You told me not to ask if I wasn\u2019t prepared for the answer. I have a lot I want to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>A buzz sounded and Max got to his feet. He rubbed his hand underneath her chin and slid his thumb across her cheek. \u201cHold that thought while I collect dinner and the things I ordered for you. We\u2019ll discuss whatever you like while we eat.\u201d</p><p>Callie waited as he went to answer the buzzer. She heard him say in low tones that he\u2019d go down to get it. She smiled. He really didn\u2019t want to risk her being seen by anyone but him.</p><p>A few moments later, he walked back into the living room carrying several boxes. He dumped them next to the couch and then left once more only to return with a rolling cart bearing several covered plates.</p><p>He parked it in front of the couch and set to work taking the covers off and preparing plates of the steaming pasta. The aroma tantalized her and her stomach growled in response. There was fresh bread\u2014her weakness. Fresh parmesan and a bottle of chilled wine in an ice bucket.</p><p>Max settled on the couch next to her but placed the plate on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI want you on your knees in front of the couch. So I can feed you better.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and for a moment she hesitated as she tried to picture what he\u2019d asked her to do.</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d</p><p>Slowly she sat forward and then slid to her knees on the floor at his feet. She turned as he too sat forward, his thigh brushing the side of her face.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said, approval purring in his voice.</p><p>He held a glass of wine to her mouth and carefully tilted it so she could take a sip. Then he pulled it away and forked a small bite of the pasta. Raising it to his mouth, he gently blew and touched it to his lips before lowering it and offering it to her.</p><p>There was something amazingly seductive about the way he made sure the food was perfect for her. He was careful to keep the bites the right size and he never offered it to her without testing it himself.</p><p>His gaze held hers, smoky and seductive, never leaving her face as he placed another bite to her lips. He waited as she savored the decadent morsel and then offered another sip of wine.</p><p>He was remarkably patient, never tiring as he held the fork to her mouth. At one point she smeared a bit of the sauce on the corner of her mouth and when she would have licked it away, he put his hand out to stop her and then lowered his mouth to swipe at the spot with his tongue.</p><p>Warm and rough, his tongue slid across her mouth, pausing at the corner where he lightly lapped and sucked until the sauce was gone. A shiver skirted down her spine. Her body leapt to attention and her pulse sped up, jumping at her pulse points.</p><p>When he pulled away, his breath huffed jerkily and his nostrils flared. His eyes glittered with awareness, and his hand shook just a bit as he pulled it away to fork another piece of the pasta.</p><p>He raised the wineglass and pressed his lips to the same place where her mouth had been. He took a long swallow before lowering it to the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head wordlessly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take a single bite until she was sated. She\u2019d been so mesmerized by the experience that they hadn\u2019t spoken. She hadn\u2019t asked any questions, nor had he offered explanations.</p><p>Only when she assured him with a nod that she\u2019d had enough did he refill his plate and begin to eat. After taking only one bite, he put his fork down and slid his hand through her hair. Then he gently tugged until her cheek lay on top of his lap and her head was cradled against him.</p><p>He rubbed her cheek, a silent directive for her to remain as he\u2019d positioned her and then he resumed his meal.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak and yet the connection between them was powerful. Instead of being awkward, the silence was comforting. She felt close to him. Like they\u2019d shared an intimacy much like making love.</p><p>There was a strange, achy tightness to her chest and yet there was also a sense of homecoming, like this was right after so long being wrong.</p><p>Finally she was back where she most needed to be. She closed her eyes as she rested against his thigh and sighed contentedly.</p><p>A moment later, his hand cupped her head and stroked over her hair. Then he reached down for her hand and helped her to her feet. She rose to stand before him, a little self-conscious as he stared at her nude body.</p><p>\u201cCome sit with me,\u201d he said as he steered her toward the overstuffed chair across from the couch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sat first and then pulled her onto his lap until she was cuddled against his chest.</p><p>\u201cNow ask these questions you want answered,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re full, I\u2019m holding you. I\u2019m a happy man.\u201d</p><p>She smiled ruefully as his fingers glided over her breast and he toyed with one nipple as he awaited her response. The man made it hard to want anything other than for him to hold her and to keep touching her.</p><p>\u201cHave there been other women like me?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed softly. \u201cNow there is an easy question to answer. No, there has never been another woman like you. I think it\u2019s safe to say that you\u2019re one of a kind, Callie.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away just enough that she could look into his eyes. \u201cI meant women that you\u2019ve had a dominant/submissive relationship with. When did you know that this is what you wanted, or have you always known? What happened to the other women?\u201d</p><p>Max sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve had several relationships, not all of which have been as a dominant to the woman\u2019s submissive. The ones I\u2019ve been the happiest in and the most content, however, were with a submissive woman. I\u2019ve found those to be the most rewarding.</p><p>\u201cAs to what happened to those women, the relationship simply didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>He looked vexed by her question. For a long moment he stared away and then finally he looked back at her. Something dark flashed in his eyes, something that sent a little shiver pricking up her nape.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t willing to go as far as I wanted them. But more than that, I think I recognized that I had selfish reasons for wanting their submission. It was all about me. How they could please me. It was no wonder I found no satisfaction in those relationships. And then you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me? Why was I different? Why am I different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was no longer about me when I was with you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a game, some idle pleasure. It wasn\u2019t something I wanted. It was something I needed. I needed you. I needed your submission. Not simply because it would please me. But because I wanted to take care of you, cherish you, protect you and love you. I wanted to please you more than I wanted to be pleased.\u201d</p><p>His answer lay heavy between them. Her heart thudded more forcefully against her chest. He sounded so...impassioned. Like every word had been wrenched from the very depths of his soul.</p><p>Max swallowed and blew out his breath. \u201cWe talked about why I left. Why I stayed gone. The fact that we fell so hard and heavy and fast. The truth is, from the moment I met you, Callie, my thoughts about you were dark and all-consuming. I pushed you hard and you took everything I gave you and wanted more. That scared the hell out of me. It seemed too...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Too damn perfect.\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI looked at you and saw someone who was perfect for me in every way. Someone who met my needs. All of them. But there was so much more I wanted from you and I had to make a decision whether to trust that you were that perfect person for me or whether I wanted to back away before I became too emotionally involved with you.\u201d</p><p>It sounded cold. Clinical. Harsh even. She stared pensively at him for a long time, mulling over his words. Despite the bald way he put it out there, she sensed vulnerability.</p><p>\u201cSo you backing away was self-preservation.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his face and then through his hair. \u201cYes. I suppose you could call it that. I needed time to evaluate. I needed to be sure that you would be happy in the relationship I would demand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot, Max.\u201d</p> <p>He blinked in surprise and his brows drew together as he glared at her.</p><p>\u201cYou men never get it right. Half the time you don\u2019t think at all and then the times you do think, you think too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to explain my idiocy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it never occur to you to talk to me? I don\u2019t know, maybe ask me if I was comfortable in our relationship? Maybe lay out what more you wanted from me and gauge my reaction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried we moved too fast, that we jumped without thinking and were caught up in the moment. I thought we needed distance so we could think with clear heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re calling me an idiot,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m doing no such thing, Callie. And if it makes you feel any better, I knew I\u2019d made a huge mistake. I was miserable without you, and the truth is, even if you weren\u2019t comfortable giving me all I demanded from you, I wanted you badly enough to compromise. I swore to myself I\u2019d take whatever you were willing to give.\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek, grazing the tips of her finger lightly over his jaw. \u201cI would have given you anything, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I ruined it then? Will you punish us both by withholding what we both want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not vindictive. I try not to be. You hurt me. We both know that. I\u2019m still dealing with that but I\u2019m working on it. I want to be happy. I\u2019m tired of feeling sad. I want to be happy with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you happy, Callie.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her mouth to his and gave him a soft kiss. His hand glided up her leg, over the curve of her buttocks and up her waist until he cupped her breast.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow much of my submission are you demanding?\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered as she pulled away. He stared back at her until she burned under his gaze. \u201cEverything. I want everything. Nothing less.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Max never took his eyes off Callie as she digested his blunt declaration. She didn\u2019t flinch. Didn\u2019t shy away. Nor did she appear to have an extreme reaction.Her expression didn\u2019t change but she cocked her head to the side and stared at him like she was sliding into his thoughts and giving them serious consideration.</p><p>\u201cDefine everything, Max. Are you being dramatic to make a point? I need you to be exacting here. This isn\u2019t the sort of thing we can afford to misunderstand.\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled. So typically Callie. Blunt. To the point. She wasn\u2019t a shy woman. He\u2019d been afraid that he\u2019d ruined some of that spirit, but it was there. Maybe beaten down, but it stirred beneath the shadows and slowly flickered to life.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I mean by everything? It\u2019s simple and yet complicated. You asked before if you were to submit to me only in the bedroom, so in essence you were asking if it was narrowed to sex. My answer is no.\u201d</p><p>He thumbed over her nipple, unable to keep from touching her. He\u2019d never grow tired of feeling her against him. After so many months, it was like coming home to have her in his arms. He could sit here all night and simply touch her and smell her.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be mine. You\u2019ll be mine to protect. To cherish. To love. To take care of. To provide for. I want to dress you, spoil you, lavish you with fine food. Trips to Europe, the world. I want you to trust me enough to allow me to make the decisions in our relationship. To cede absolute control to me in the bedroom. To give your body to me and only me. But it\u2019s not about you giving and me taking. It\u2019s not about pleasing me to the exclusion of all else. Maybe it was like that in my other relationships. I want ours to be about me pleasing you every bit as much as you please me. I want to do things for you. Everything for you. I want to give you things. I want this kind of relationship for what it can do for you as well as me. For the things I can give to you.</p><p>\u201cSo, no, I don\u2019t want it confined to the bedroom, but I want our relationship to be where you can push back when I go too far. But only then. Once we establish complete trust, it will be easier. You\u2019ll know that I won\u2019t want to do anything that isn\u2019t in your best interests.\u201d</p><p>Her brows bunched and she stared intently at him. Her expression was pensive, and he knew she\u2019d absorbed every single one of his words and even now was turning them over and over in her mind. He could see the questions in her eyes.</p><p>He smiled. She wanted to argue. To protest. But she tempered the bubbling protest as she continued to study him.</p><p>\u201cIt takes a very strong woman to submit to a man,\u201d he said as he fingered a strand of her hair. \u201cWhat attracted me to you was your beauty and your laughter. I\u2019ll never forget the first time I saw you in Italy. You took my breath away. But later, it was your fiercely independent spirit that kept me with you. Even as you submitted, your will remained. Your true self was unaltered. You retained all the qualities I most admired, and yet you offered your submission to me so sweetly it made me ache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem so sure the two can coexist long-term,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that what happened with your other women? Did they lose themselves in the process?\u201d</p><p>Her intuitive question caught him off guard. \u201cPartly, yes. It happened in two of my relationships. They were so caught up in pleasing me that they became shells of the women I was first attracted to. They became...what they thought I wanted. What I thought I wanted for that matter. It sounds so contradictory, but what I want is a woman who can please me and be pleased by me, but not lose herself in the process. Someone strong. Someone like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have misjudged you, Max,\u201d she offered quietly. \u201cAll this while I\u2019ve been hurting and aching, and I assumed you weren\u2019t thinking about me at all, that you left me without thought and never looked back. But that\u2019s not true, is it? You\u2019ve been thinking about me\u2014us\u2014quite a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a day has passed that I haven\u2019t thought about us.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened and became damp pools of blue. She reached up and cupped his cheek and stroked gently. \u201cYou have my submission, Max. Without reservation. I want to try. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re right and I\u2019m the woman you need or that I\u2019ll end up being the woman you want, but I want to be her. I\u2019m willing to try. I\u2019m willing to give us a chance. I\u2019ll make mistakes. I\u2019ve never allowed anyone the kind of control you\u2019re asking for.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and leaned forward to kiss her on the forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt no one has ever been able to control you. And that\u2019s not what I want to do. I love your free spirit too much. I am the only person I ever want you to submit to and it\u2019s my job to cherish your gift and not crush your spirit but nurture it instead.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back. \u201cI think I can handle that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now that we\u2019ve settled that matter, I want to establish a few ground rules.\u201d</p><p>She started to frown but recovered quickly and instead looked inquisitively at him.</p><p>\u201cWhen we are alone, whether in this apartment or elsewhere, you aren\u2019t to wear clothing unless I\u2019ve said otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted and he could see her battling over whether to question him.</p><p>\u201cI want you accessible to me at all times. If I want to fuck you in the kitchen, I want to be able to just lean you over the table and slide inside your sweet body.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing hiccupped and her eyes went a little hazy.</p><p>\u201cI might want you to suck my cock while I eat after I\u2019ve fed you. I prefer for you to be nude when that occurs.\u201d</p><p>Her lips quivered and she twitched in his lap. He almost grinned. She was getting turned on by the images he painted.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re in the living room, I want to be able to bend you over the arm of the couch and fuck you from behind. Or I might want to sit on the sofa and have you sit on my cock. The point is I want you accessible at all times. I want to be able to look at you whenever I want and touch you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded jerkily but kept silent.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow when we go shopping, I\u2019m going to choose jewelry for you to wear. It will be a sign of my ownership. At no time will you take it off. You will only do so if we\u2019re no longer together.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened again. \u201cYou mean like a...collar?\u201d</p><p>His heart softened at the horror in her voice. \u201cNo, dolcezza. A collar would never do for you. It would be demeaning. You would hate it. And me for making you do such a thing. What I have in mind are wrist cuffs. I want them specially designed for you and engraved with my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said with a quiet sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be bad at all.\u201d</p><p>He nudged her chin up with his fingers. \u201cCallie, we need to make something clear. Yes, I expect your submission, however, this isn\u2019t a dictatorship. You have to tell me if at any time you\u2019re uncomfortable with something. The last thing I want is for you to be unhappy. We\u2019ll talk about it and work something out.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and it lit up her entire face.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re in public, I don\u2019t expect you to assume the role of my submissive. The only thing you will be to others is the woman I adore and cherish above all others. Our private life is exactly that. Private. I don\u2019t need the world to see you submit. I\u2019m the only person who ever needs to see it.\u201d</p><p>He circled her wrist with his fingers and her pulse sped up, racing against his hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re seducing me with mere words,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou always do.\u201d</p><p>He picked up her hand and pressed his lips to her wrist and then her palm, and then he kissed each fingertip until he curled her hand and brushed his mouth across her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll sleep in my bed every night. The last thing you\u2019ll feel before you go to sleep is me inside you. The first thing you\u2019ll feel when you wake up is me inside you.\u201d</p><p>She jerked and shuddered against him, and her breaths came out in short little huffs like she couldn\u2019t quite keep up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll push your limits,\u201d he said in a serious tone. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we haven\u2019t done that we\u2019ll do. Your body will be mine and that means that I\u2019ll do with you as I like. I\u2019m not a masochist. I have no interest in taking things so far that you\u2019ll fear me or not enjoy what I do to you. But some of what I do will be for my pleasure and my pleasure alone just as there will be times when I\u2019ll want to give you pleasure while taking none in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d she asked as she licked her dry lips.</p><p>He kissed those lips and ran his tongue over top and bottom until they glistened.</p><p>\u201cNo. There is something I\u2019d like to mention and get out in the open. You\u2019ve told me about your fathers. And now your brothers. I don\u2019t pretend to understand the arrangement. You haven\u2019t said a lot other than they were in a committed polyamorous relationship. I\u2019m not even sure what that means in the real world. So I\u2019ll just get this out. I\u2019m not comfortable with sharing you. Ever.\u201d He snorted. \u201cComfortable is too soft a word to use here. You never hinted that you wanted a similar relationship to the one your mother and sister-in-law have, but it isn\u2019t happening. Over my dead body. I\u2019ll take apart any son of a bitch I ever find in your bed and then I\u2019ll kick your pretty ass all over the country.\u201d</p><p>Callie shook with silent laughter. It was obvious she tried really hard to keep it in. Then she cracked and started laughing out loud. He glared at her the whole time as she wiped tears from her cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cOh God, Max,\u201d she gasped out. \u201cYou crack me up. That\u2019s the funniest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so damn funny? Your whole family is involved in some weird relationship where the women sleep with multiple men. I\u2019m just trying to save us all some grief by telling you now it isn\u2019t going to happen, and if it does, someone\u2019s going to die.\u201d</p><p>She snickered again and wiped frantically at her eyes. Then she clutched his face in both hands and kissed him hot, hard and breathless.</p><p>\u201cI have no desire to sleep with more than one man,\u201d she said. \u201cI realize my parents\u2019 situation is...unusual.\u201d</p><p>Max lifted one eyebrow. \u201cUnusual?\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cOkay maybe it\u2019s strange but not to me or them. It\u2019s what I grew up with. And the thing is my dads love my mom more than anything. That woman is pampered, spoiled and adored more than any woman I know other than my sister-in-law. And they all love me.\u201d</p> <p>Max softened and pulled her closer to him until she was cuddled tight against his chest and her nipples poked through his chest hair. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt they love you with all their heart and soul, dolcezza. How could they do anything else? I don\u2019t mean to demean them. I just can\u2019t wrap my head around the idea of sharing you with two other men. I want you all to myself twenty-four/seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you I\u2019m not looking to hook up with two other men,\u201d she said cheekily. \u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to do.\u201d</p><p>He smacked her on the hip. \u201cWatch it.\u201d</p><p>She glanced mischievously at him. \u201cOr what? What happens when I\u2019m a bad girl and don\u2019t do as you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on how badly you\u2019re wanting to be punished,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cIf you\u2019re yanking my chain because you want to be spanked, I\u2019ll just ignore you.\u201d</p><p>She stuck out her lip in an exaggerated pout. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to worry,\u201d he said lazily. \u201cI\u2019ll find plenty of reasons to spank that pretty ass, none of which have a damn thing to do with punishment. Remember I talked about the things I do solely for my pleasure and not yours? Seeing my mark on your sweet little behind is an example. Right before I fuck it.\u201d</p><p>She trembled again and her nipples hardened against his chest. He smiled. Somehow he imagined that he wouldn\u2019t be the only one who got pleasure from spanking her.</p> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cI have a present for you,\u201d Max said.Callie was sucking air through her nostrils, so turned on that she shook in Max\u2019s arms. And now he casually changed the subject. She wanted to growl in frustration.</p><p>But still, mention of a present perked her up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit up front that it\u2019s as much a present for me as it is for you.\u201d</p><p>She arched an eyebrow and leveled her stare at him. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and then carried her over to the couch. \u201cWait right here while I get it.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he rummaged in the bags that had been delivered earlier. He pulled out a white, nondescript box and carried it back to where she sat.</p><p>He settled beside her and opened the box. She frowned when she saw black material. Clothes? Hadn\u2019t he just said he wanted her naked?</p><p>But when he pulled it out, it was apparent it wasn\u2019t any sort of clothing she was familiar with. It looked like half a corset.</p><p>\u201cStand up,\u201d he directed as he unfolded the item.</p><p>She rose and stood before him.</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>Dutifully she turned until her back was presented to him. She heard him shove off the couch and the next thing she knew, he reached around her and positioned the wide band of material over her waist.</p><p>Maybe it was a corset. It was soft but stiff, like the material covered a harder object. But it was flexible and wrapped around to secure in the back.</p><p>He adjusted and pulled until it rested just below her breasts and fit snugly about her waist. She looked down, still unsure of what it was or what purpose it served.</p><p>She soon had her answer.</p><p>Gently he pulled one arm behind her and bent her elbow so that her wrist lay flush against her back. She jumped when a band wrapped around her wrist, securing it to the contraption she wore.</p><p>Her pulse leapt and sped up as he pulled her other arm and secured it in the same fashion.</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she turned and realized that the way her arms were confined by the apparatus forced her chest forward.</p><p>\u201cVery beautiful. I think I\u2019d like you in this when we eat so you\u2019re completely dependent on my hand to feed you.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks grew warm under his scrutiny. She rolled up on the balls of her feet but then flushed harder when she saw his gaze tracked the bounce of her breasts.</p><p>He lowered his head, and she closed her eyes just as his tongue flicked out and licked her nipple.</p><p>Desire crashed through her, jolting her senses into instant awareness. It was like being hit by a bus.</p><p>She was vulnerable in this position. Was it a test? Or was he simply trying to rebuild her trust? She wasn\u2019t sure she liked being pushed. Or was he simply enjoying what he\u2019d been so straightforward in saying he wanted?</p><p>Slowly he straightened, his brows drawn together as he studied her expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>She shivered under his scrutiny and swallowed nervously. Before, she would have thought nothing of letting him have it with both barrels. She\u2019d never had any problem with speaking her mind. But now, she wasn\u2019t in a position of equality.</p><p>She licked her lips and forced herself to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs this a test?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and confusion\u2014genuine confusion\u2014clouded his eyes. No, it obviously wasn\u2019t a test and now she\u2019d stepped into it all over again. If it had been a test of her trust, she\u2019d failed miserably.</p><p>Without a word he reached round her and set her wrists free. He pulled at the material until she heard the sound of Velcro separating. It slid from her waist and he tossed it aside.</p><p>Then he turned and walked out of the living room, leaving her alone and naked.</p><p>She trembled, suddenly cold. Silence crept around her until it was heavy against her ears. She became aware of each breath until she purposely lowered her respirations so the sound wasn\u2019t so explosive in the quiet.</p><p>She\u2019d hurt him. It hadn\u2019t been intentional. It wasn\u2019t some vindictive payback to make him suffer. But the truth was there for the both of them to see. She didn\u2019t trust him anymore. Not completely.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she wanted him to feel at least one-quarter of the pain she\u2019d felt when he\u2019d left her? Hadn\u2019t she wanted to get back at him even just a little?</p><p>She had, if she was honest, but now the victory\u2014if it could be called that\u2014was hollow and unsatisfying. She wanted to cry, not for all the pain she\u2019d endured but for something beautiful that was lost.</p><p>Her shoulders sagging, she turned and walked slowly to the couch where she sank into the cushions. But the leather that had felt warm and comforting before was now cold and unwelcoming.</p><p>She pulled the thin blanket around her body and up to her chin. She wouldn\u2019t cry. Not now. She\u2019d managed to go a long time without tears.</p><p>Her eyelids drooped and she nestled her head against the arm of the sofa. Her heart ached, but it went even deeper. Soul deep.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d actually hurt Max, she realized she didn\u2019t have the stomach for revenge. Unintentional or not, she knew that she\u2019d suffer just as much as he would.</p><p>She wanted him back. Wanted his hands on her. His mouth. She wanted him to smile at her. She wanted him to love her.</p><p>When Callie awoke, she lay still a moment and stared dully toward the fireplace. The hearth looked cold and empty. Pretty symbolic.</p><p>She stirred and twisted the kink from her neck. When she stared down the couch, she saw Max sitting at the end, his gaze fixed on her.</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>She hastily sat up and the blanket fell to her waist.</p><p>He cocked his head to the side as his stare slid down her body. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you dress?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down, frowned and then looked back up at him. \u201cYou told me to stay naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Okay, she sounded defensive. Hell, she was defensive. She was seriously teetering here and definitely working without a safety net.</p><p>\u201cJust that on some level you trust me. I haven\u2019t completely lost it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Max. I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel bad.\u201d</p><p>He scooted forward on the couch and put a finger to her mouth. \u201cShhh. You won\u2019t apologize for the way you feel. It\u2019s my fault. I pushed too hard, too fast. It\u2019s easy to forget that we\u2019ve been apart for so many months. I\u2019d love nothing more than to forget it and go back to the way things were before... Before I hurt you. That\u2019s on me, though. I can\u2019t expect to gain back everything we lost in a day. So it\u2019s me who is sorry, Callie. Your hesitation hurt me more than I expected. I can\u2019t bear the thought that you\u2019d worry I\u2019d in some way hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward until her forehead rested on his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d hurt me, Max. I don\u2019t. I want this to work.\u201d</p><p>He laid his hand on the back of her head and then gently stroked over her hair as he kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI want this to work too, Callie. I shouldn\u2019t have reacted as I did. You have the right to question me. You have the right to stop me at any time if you don\u2019t feel comfortable. I don\u2019t want you to feel like you ever have to suck it up and deal when you\u2019re frightened or unsure just because you don\u2019t want to hurt my feelings.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and smiled as she circled his neck with her arms. \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, Max. I guess you\u2019re right. I\u2019m just a little unsure. I\u2019m still unbalanced by it all. A few days ago I was alone and unhappy. Now such a short time later, I\u2019m with you in Denver and we\u2019re flying into the wind again.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face and brushed his lips across her cheek and then pulled her against him to cradle her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dolcezza,\u201d he murmured against her hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you. I\u2019m sorry I overreacted earlier.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled against his chest. \u201cThink we could take up where we left off?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly. \u201cI can arrange that.\u201d</p><p>She slid off his lap and went to her knees in front of him. She eased her thighs apart and slowly turned her hands palms up on top of her thighs.</p><p>His nostrils flared with his quick intake of breath. \u201cHow beautiful you are, Callie. There on your knees, your eyes and mouth so sweet you take my breath away.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, her heart squeezing so hard in her chest she became light-headed. She put all her conviction into her gaze, her expression, the position of her body. She wanted there to be no doubt. She was his. This time... This time would be right. This time would be different. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the first time since Max had stormed back into her life she didn\u2019t feel foolish for thinking that things could be worked out between them. She was able to look at him with love, and in time she knew that her trust would be complete and whole again.</p><p>Maybe not overnight, but it would come.</p><p>She had faith.</p><p>She had love.</p><p>She had...hope. Sweet, healing hope.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Max absorbed the love in Callie\u2019s eyes like a man dying of thirst. She was a balm to every ache in his soul. He wanted to possess her. He wanted to own her. He wanted her to light up for him\u2014only him.But he also wanted her to be free. He never wanted to crush her spirit and the zest with which she embraced life.</p><p>She was special.</p><p>She was his.</p><p>He rose to stand before her and stared down as she looked up into his eyes. They burned with trust where before there had been a subtle wariness to her gaze. He knew he wasn\u2019t completely there yet, but she wanted to trust him and that was a huge step forward.</p><p>Slowly he undid the fly of his pants and pushed them over his hips until his cock jutted free of confinement. He wrapped his hand around the base and gave a short pull but then squeezed the tip when he found just how precariously close he was to coming undone under the caress of her gaze.</p><p>Holding his cock, he guided it toward her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth slowly opened, and she licked over her lips before opening wider with a breathy little sigh that had him itching to bury himself as fast and as deep as he could.</p><p>His hand shook and the head of his dick bumped clumsily against her lips as he guided it into the hot velvet of her mouth.</p><p>Pleasure exploded over his body. His muscles jerked and his knees nearly buckled as she sucked wetly while he pushed further inside. She was a craving like he\u2019d never experienced. Edgy. Nearly painful. His skin was uncomfortable, like he needed to shed it. Itchy. Alive. Hot.</p><p>Need. It burned through his veins like feathers tinged with acid. It was soft but sharp. Pleasure mixed with pain. Satisfaction mixed with mounting impatience.</p><p>\u201cHands behind your back.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to see her up on her knees, her breasts pushed forward.</p><p>She readily complied, pushing herself upward as she looped her arms behind her.</p><p>\u201cNow tilt your head back. Just a little. Perfect, dolcezza. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>Now he could see her throat bulge and work up and down as the angle sent him deeper into her mouth. It was an erotic sight, such a sweet mouth and eyes.</p><p>He reached down and stroked the sides of her neck, marveling at the baby-soft skin. The muscles jumped and quivered as he stroked to the back of her throat. He held himself there for a long moment, liking how her neck and shoulders tensed.</p> <p>Through it all she never protested. Never asked him to stop. Calm acceptance blanketed them both. It was like a beautiful classical piece played to perfection.</p><p>He eased back, allowing her to breathe and relax for a moment. He was tuned in to her body. Knew the exact moment she needed a reprieve. Knew when she wanted more and when he should back off.</p><p>It had always been like this. He\u2019d been able to read her mind and body from the start. They\u2019d been in perfect harmony. A perfect match.</p><p>Until he\u2019d walked away.</p><p>Until he\u2019d had doubts that he could go through with the reason he\u2019d sought her out.</p><p>He pulled back quickly as he realized he\u2019d pushed too far as darker thoughts intruded into the moment. She breathed hard through her nose, and he pulled all the way out of her mouth, pissed that he\u2019d allowed himself to become distracted even for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWill you allow me to put your present back on you?\u201d he asked as he stroked his erection with one hand.</p><p>She nodded without hesitation and he smiled his approval.</p><p>He extended his hand down to her, and she slid her slender fingers over his palm as he pulled her to stand before him.</p><p>He retrieved the waist restraint from the end of the couch and wrapped it around her, securing it in the back. Then he pulled her arms back and cuffed her wrists.</p><p>\u201cCome over to the chair,\u201d he said as he directed her toward the large ottoman situated in front of the overstuffed leather chair catty-corner to the couch.</p><p>\u201cOn the ottoman. On your knees.\u201d</p><p>When she positioned herself according to his wishes, he gently lowered her head until her cheek rested on the edge of the chair. He then spread her knees so that she was open to him and he got a prime view of the soft pink flesh of her pussy and the puckered rosette of her anal opening.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful. So pretty and so feminine.\u201d</p><p>He ran a finger through the silken, damp flesh and teased her opening before going lower to dance over the taut bud of her clitoris. Her entire body tensed and her knees shook.</p><p>He smiled. So responsive. So fucking beautiful she made his teeth ache.</p><p>\u201cBe right back, dolcezza. Don\u2019t move that pretty ass. I\u2019m going to fuck it.\u201d</p><p>He grinned again when a violent shudder rolled through her body. He slid his fingers through her pussy once more before he backed away, delighted that she\u2019d grown even wetter at his husky promise.</p><p>He strode from the room but took his time locating the lubricant from his bathroom. He wanted her to kneel there and anticipate the moment when he\u2019d come back. When he\u2019d fight her resisting opening to push inside her gorgeous ass and the indescribable sensation when her body surrendered and allowed him entry.</p><p>Christ but he was hard as a rock at the image\u2014from the memory\u2014of how it felt.</p><p>There was nothing better than a slow, sensual fuck inside her ass. Drawing out both their pleasure. Opening her, then pulling out before pushing back in to reopen her all over again.</p><p>He closed his eyes and palmed his aching cock as he walked back into the living room. When he opened them and saw her where he\u2019d left her, ass perched delectably in the air, it was all he could do to breathe.</p><p>When he went back to her, the sight of her soft pink folds was more than he could take. Holding the lubricant in one hand, he guided his cock into her pussy with the other.</p><p>She sighed and tightened around him, her pussy gripping his dick like a fist. For a moment he simply closed his eyes and slid back and forth through her velvet heat.</p><p>Buried to the hilt, he uncapped the lubricant and used his fingers to spread her cheeks so that her opening was bared. He squeezed a generous amount of the gel over the seam of her ass and then ran his thumb over the puckered rosette.</p><p>He was patient, sliding one finger through the tight opening. She clenched around him and he heard her breath hiss from her lips. Back and forth, slowly, he tucked his finger into her before finally adding a second.</p><p>He curled his other hand around the base of his cock and slowly withdrew from her pussy and positioned the head at her lubricated entrance.</p><p>She posed an erotic picture, ass stuck in the air, her hands secured helplessly around her back and her cheek pressed into the cushion of the chair. There wasn\u2019t a part of her body that wasn\u2019t open and accessible to him.</p><p>Carefully he pushed forward, forcing the broad crown of his penis into her tiny opening. The sensation of the tight ring squeezing his erection nearly sent him over the edge. She sheathed him with unbearable tightness.</p><p>She opened around him, but her body fought his invasion. He pressed forward relentlessly, not giving an inch as he forced more of his length into her ass.</p><p>With a slight plop, the head pushed through, and she gasped and wiggled beneath him.</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered hoarsely. \u201cNot enough. Never enough.\u201d</p><p>In response, he pushed hard, forcing another inch inside her.</p><p>He was lodged halfway in her. The sight of him piercing the opening between her cheeks sent his pulse skyrocketing. It didn\u2019t seem possible that he could fit into her body this way, but he knew not only was it possible, but that she had accommodated him easily. Many, many times.</p><p>He withdrew a few centimeters and then gripped her hips, holding her steady, and thrust hard.</p><p>He sank into her body, his cock sliding through the tight opening until his hips met the curve of her buttocks. His balls pressed against her pussy and he rotated, rubbing his sac over the softness of her entrance.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so damn good, dolcezza,\u201d he groaned. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of reclaiming your body. Of reclaiming what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>He remained still a moment longer and then gently withdrew, watching his cock reappear as her opening stretched and widened around him.</p><p>When only the tip remained inside her entrance, he pushed forward again, watching once more as her body gave him access.</p><p>He pressed into her ass, rocking his hips against her lush bottom. He closed his eyes and rubbed up and down and then side to side, relearning her body, straining to go deeper, to the very heart of her.</p><p>He took his time, making love to her as sweetly as if he were sliding into her warm pussy. His fingers dug into her hips, holding her tightly so that he could push into her each time he withdrew.</p><p>Finally he reached underneath and slid his hands down the tops of her thighs until he pushed at her knees to cause her to go down on her belly.</p><p>No longer supported by her legs, she lay flat over the ottoman with him pressed to her body as his hips worked against her ass.</p><p>He kissed her shoulder then nipped at the flesh with his teeth. He loved marking her. Loved leaving little reminders of his possession. He sucked sharply at the curve of her neck until he left a light red welt that faded slightly when he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cMy dolcezza.\u201d</p><p>He arched off her and carefully withdrew. He spread her buttocks so that he could see the enlarged and slightly reddened opening that his cock had just come from. Keeping her wide, he flexed his hips so that his cock lodged inside her opening again and he pushed forward.</p><p>Then he withdrew, holding her open again as he stared down, watching as her body slowly closed. He positioned himself again and then thrust hard, eliciting a gasp from her as she wiggled under his forceful lunge.</p><p>He kept her pinned to the ottoman, satisfaction tightening every muscle in his body. His. She belonged to him. She was his to do with as he wished.</p><p>He flexed again and a shudder of pleasure shook through his body until he sucked air violently through his nose in an effort to control himself.</p><p>He began pumping with quick, short motions, closing his eyes as his balls drew up into hard knots. He kept his hands on her cheeks until he was sure she\u2019d wear his fingerprints on her flesh. He squeezed, kneaded and then spread her wider, wanting her completely open to him when he shot semen over and inside her ass.</p><p>Her fingers curled into tight little balls at the small of her back. He gripped her harder as he slowly began to unravel.</p><p>Threads of silk surrounding his heart popped and frayed as his chest swelled with emotion. She undid him. Always had. No one could make him lose control like she did. He alternately loved and hated her for that.</p><p>He was barely rimming her entrance now as he continued to thrust fast and furious. Still holding her cheek in one hand, he reached frantically for his cock with the other and began jerking as he aimed at her opening.</p><p>The first rope of semen splashed inside her and then a second until the thick, white cream filled the opening and trailed down the inside of her leg.</p><p>He groaned with each pull and more liquid splashed onto her ass and into the wide-open entrance. He loved filling her, opening her to him, marking her in the most primitive way a man could mark a woman.</p><p>He guided more onto her behind and over her fists secured to her back. Her ass glistened with shiny fluid that trailed down the backs of her thighs.</p><p>Then he guided his erection back into her opening, sliding all the way in with one push. He closed his eyes as the last of his release spilled inside her. For a long moment he held himself still, simply enjoying the sensation of being seated so deep inside her body. Then slowly he withdrew.</p><p>He backed away, staring down at her with satisfaction.</p><p>Quietly he walked back to the bathroom where he spent a few moments cleaning up, and then he wet a washcloth with warm water and returned to Callie where she still lay awaiting his next command.</p><p>Gently, he cleaned her, wiping the trails of semen from her skin. Then he reached up to unfasten her hands and let them fall limply at her sides.</p><p>Then he helped her sit up and pulled her into his arms. Lifting her effortlessly, he carried her over to the couch where he sat and cuddled her against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou have a sweet ass, Callie. I love fucking it. There isn\u2019t a part of your delectable body that I don\u2019t love fucking.\u201d</p><p>She yawned tiredly but when she looked up, her eyes shone and sparkled like they hadn\u2019t since he\u2019d returned. He touched her cheek and then leaned forward to kiss each eyelid.</p><p>\u201cDo you need the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and he carefully rose, still holding her tight against him. He carried her into the bathroom and set her down, holding onto her until he was sure her legs were sturdy enough that she wouldn\u2019t fall.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and turned away. While he waited, he turned on the shower to warm the water.</p><p>A few moments later, she returned, and he pulled her into the stall and under the spray with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With gentle hands, he washed her body, paying special attention to the areas he was hardest on. She was warm and sleek in his hands. And so very willing.</p><p>He scraped his mouth across the mark on her neck, and then he lapped it with his tongue. \u201cYou\u2019ll wear many reminders of my possession tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and arched her back, the spray bouncing off her breasts and belly as she reached to curl her arms around him.</p><p>\u201cI can still feel your marks,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYour fingers on my skin. Your mouth on my neck. I\u2019ll go to sleep tonight remembering what you felt like.\u201d</p> <p>His body tightened at the sultry, seductive words.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go to sleep tonight feeling me, not remembering me,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>Her smile grew broader, and she rolled up on the balls of her feet so she could kiss the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be able to walk by the time we go back home.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand over the curve of her behind and squeezed lightly. \u201cIf I had my way, dolcezza, you\u2019d never walk again.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Max was awake at dawn. He\u2019d never owned an alarm clock in his life. His internal clock had never let him down. Even with the many time zones he crossed in his travels, he had an uncanny knack for knowing what time it was and he rarely slept past sunrise.Except for those magical days with Callie in Europe. He\u2019d allowed himself latitude he rarely gave. He became lazy and unmotivated. Or rather his motivation changed from the moment he met her.</p><p>She was draped across him like a warm blanket, her legs tangled with his. It was a very possessive gesture. One he delighted in. He might be the more dominant one in their relationship, but she was mighty possessive of him in her own right.</p><p>He fingered a strand of her dark brown hair and listened to her inhale and exhale. Her breath blew over his neck, a sensation that pleased him.</p><p>Yes, his motivation had changed when he\u2019d come face to face with the woman he\u2019d tracked across three countries. A seduction and courtship that was supposed to have lasted a week had turned into three weeks he\u2019d never forget.</p><p>Before he met Callie, his family was the single most important thing in his life. There wasn\u2019t anything he wouldn\u2019t do to take care of them, protect them, make them happy. Damn the cost or consequences.</p> <p>Callie had changed all of that.</p><p>How could he keep his promise to his family and his promise to Callie that he\u2019d never hurt her? The simple answer was that he couldn\u2019t, and he\u2019d known it from the beginning. He\u2019d chosen Callie. His promise would go unfulfilled, and he was making his peace with that choice.</p><p>His gut twisted and some of his satisfaction melted away. He couldn\u2019t change the past or what his primary motivation had been when he\u2019d made sure his and Callie\u2019s paths crossed, but he could make sure she never found out. What mattered was what his motivation was going forward.</p><p>She stirred against him, and he tightened his hold on her, simply wanting the reassurance of her warmth. She raised her head and stared at him with sleepy, contented eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said on a sigh.</p><p>He kissed her. More savagely than the moment called for, but some of the darkness still hadn\u2019t receded.</p><p>She went soft against him, accepting the carnal heat of his mouth. He rolled her underneath him, his knee between her thighs. With a quick nudge, she was open and accessible. He was inside her before he took his next breath.</p><p>He was instantly at peace. She did this to him\u2014for him. For a long moment he remained lodged within her, staring down into her eyes, absorbing her acceptance. Soaking in her love.</p> <p>She raised her hands and cupped his face then stroked lightly over his cheekbones as if to tell him everything would be all right. As if she knew the dark turn of his thoughts.</p><p>He closed his eyes and took in deep breaths as her fingers stroked over his face. Then he turned so her hand slid over his mouth and he kissed the inside of her palm.</p><p>She pulsed around him, her heat surrounding him, inviting him deeper\u2014into the very heart of her soul. He withdrew slowly, opening his eyes to watch the play of emotions dance across her face.</p><p>Her eyes darkened, and she sucked in a quick breath as he pushed forward again.</p><p>He\u2019d fully intended it to be a quick, rough fuck. He\u2019d wanted to take. To be selfish. But now as he watched her, he tempered his movements, going slow and more gently than he imagined he could.</p><p>He wanted to wrap her in silk, protect her from every bad thing in the world\u2014including himself.</p><p>Slowly, he lowered his mouth to hers and kissed her with all the tenderness he was capable of.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured even as he pushed inside her again. \u201cI was rough with you last night. I should have been more careful this morning. You must be sore.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and curled her arms around his neck. She kissed him sweetly, covering each tiny part of his mouth before sliding to his jaw and then to his ear.</p><p>He shivered as she nipped delicately at his lobe and then sucked it between her teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she whispered into his ear. \u201cI love waking to you inside me. It\u2019s a beautiful way of reminding me I belong to you.\u201d</p><p>Dear God. Her words slid over his skin and soaked deep into his heart. His chest ached and became so heavy he could barely breathe.</p><p>\u201cI love...you,\u201d he said in a voice he didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cJust you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock and then filled with tears. The sight nearly undid him. How could she be so surprised? Had he held back so much? Had she doubted... Stupid question. Of course she had. He hadn\u2019t given her any reason to believe she was anything but a holiday fling.</p><p>How he hated what he\u2019d done to her confidence. And he\u2019d done nothing to allay those fears when he\u2019d returned. He hadn\u2019t come back and said, \u201cI love you.\u201d He\u2019d come back and said, \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed away the tear that slid over her cheek. \u201cI do love you, dolcezza. I\u2019m sorry this is the first time you\u2019ve heard the words. I\u2019m sorry that this is the first time I\u2019ve given them to you.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed him and lifted her hips to take more of him. So characteristic of her. Always giving. Always willing to take more from him.</p><p>\u201cI only care that you\u2019ve said them,\u201d she said in an aching voice. \u201cI love you too, Max. So much. I\u2019ve missed you...\u201d</p><p>She broke off as another silver trail slid over her cheek. He hushed her with another kiss. \u201cI missed you too, Callie. Never doubt it. Say it again. Let me have the words again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never considered himself an overly emotional man. He was always in complete control of himself and his actions\u2014his reactions. But Callie... That she loved him, that she was willing to forgive, willing to give of herself so freely after the way he\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>The knot grew more uncomfortable in his throat. He kissed her again, not knowing what else to do. He couldn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t trust himself not to give way to the building tide of emotion in his chest.</p><p>Thank God. Thank God she still loved him. That she wasn\u2019t holding back after all he\u2019d done. He couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t allow her to know just how far he\u2019d been willing to go to keep a promise to his family. It would destroy her.</p><p>\u201cAre you with me, dolcezza? Are you close? Tell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>She sighed again and her smile was so dazzling that it spilled sunshine all over him.</p><p>\u201cYou, Max. Just you. Love me. I\u2019m always with you.\u201d</p><p>Her words unleashed his tightly held control. He thrust deep and started coming before he was even at full depth. She arched into his arms and wrapped her legs tightly around his, their bodies woven together in a beautiful tapestry.</p><p>Max and Callie. Callie and Max.</p><p>She buried her face in his neck and then sank her teeth into the column of his throat as she came apart. Her body tugged relentlessly at him, pulling him deeper, and then went liquid around him, bathing him in intense, sweet heat.</p><p>For the longest time he lay atop her, their legs and bodies meshed together as he pulsed inside her. It was hard not to imagine his seed taking root. For a moment he fantasized about her big and round with his child.</p><p>He wanted these things. He wanted her unreservedly. Her submission, her love. He wanted all of her. He wanted children. Lots of girls with her indomitable spirit, her sassy smile and those gorgeous blue eyes. He wanted boys who were as strong and as resilient as she was.</p><p>\u201cAre you still on birth control?\u201d he asked a moment later.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help the stark disappointment that surged through his body.</p><p>She pulled away, a frown curving her mouth downward. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, wanting to ease her worry and not put a damper on what was otherwise an incredible moment for him.</p><p>\u201cI just had this image of you. Pregnant with my child. Of feeling your belly, big and round. I liked it. I liked it a lot.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed and then grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to wait a while for that, I\u2019m afraid. I have way too much I want to do and see before I start popping out a brood of children.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cA brood?\u201d He was teasing her, because suddenly the idea of being surrounded by a pile of kids was completely pleasing to him.</p><p>\u201cI always imagined that I\u2019d have a lot of children,\u201d she said wistfully. \u201cEventually. Not right away. But when I was ready. I love having a large family. I loved growing up with three older brothers.\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself up and off of her, carefully withdrawing from the delicious heat of her body. He settled beside her and pulled her into his arms until their noses nearly touched.</p><p>\u201cTell me of all these things you want to do before you settle down and have babies.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled against him until their legs were once more entwined.</p><p>\u201cI love to travel. I like to just...go. Whenever I get the urge. My mom has always said I was born with my head in the clouds and my eyes always looking toward a place I\u2019d never been. She\u2019s probably right. I have wanderlust. There\u2019s nothing quite like just packing up and going. Seeing new places, meeting new people, seeing the sun rise and set in a different place each day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to show you those places. I want to see them with you. I\u2019ll show you the world, Callie.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shone and glistened again, but he was determined not to make her cry. No more. He wanted to make her happy.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Max. So much.\u201d</p><p>Would he ever grow tired of hearing those words? He couldn\u2019t imagine such a thing. If anything, he worried she\u2019d grow tired of his need to hear them.</p><p>\u201cI love you, dolcezza. I need you to know that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI do now.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, long and leisurely, as he should have done earlier when she was just awakening. He apologized now as he gently fed at her lips and savored each touch and taste.</p><p>And then he held her, until the soft even tempo of her breathing signaled that she\u2019d drifted back to sleep. He smiled and slid his leg more firmly over hers, until her body was completely sheltered by his. Shopping could wait.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Shopping with Max was a decadent experience. Callie loved to shop. She had all her girly tendencies intact. But shopping with Max?From the time they walked into the upscale stores, Callie was pampered, catered to, fawned over and draped from head to toe with beautiful, expensive clothing.</p><p>Through it all, Max kept a close watch. He never seemed to tire as Callie tried on outfit after outfit. He\u2019d stand back and study for a moment before simply nodding or shaking his head, and then the salesperson would hurriedly divest Callie of the outfit and either toss it in the discard pile or whisk it away to the to-be-bought pile.</p><p>And he had impeccable taste. He knew exactly what looked good on her, what flattered her and what didn\u2019t. No expense was spared.</p><p>He even insisted she model the lingerie he chose, although he was very clear that no one but he got to see those particular modeling sessions.</p><p>She felt...beautiful. A little devilish and very sexy. She watched his eyes, saw the way he looked at her, and she ate every single moment up.</p><p>She loved being spoiled by Max. She\u2019d gotten a taste of it in Europe, but now that he\u2019d made his feelings clear for her, his lavish treatment took on a more endearing quality.</p><p>Behind the dressing screen, she grinned as she pulled on a particularly scanty pair of panties and a matching bra. They didn\u2019t leave much to the imagination, and the panties...had a little surprise that she was eager to show Max.</p><p>She poked her head out and his gaze immediately fixed on her. Then she shyly stepped out in the daring high heels she\u2019d donned just for this outfit.</p><p>His eye smoldered dark as his gaze traveled up and down her body. She strutted forward and straddled his lap until he was forced to lean his head back to look into her eyes.</p><p>Emboldened by his response, she reached for the fly of his pants and slid her hand inside as she unzipped him. His cock jumped in response when her fingers curled around his length. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing, you little minx?\u201d</p><p>Continuing to caress him, she leaned down and took his mouth with hers, kissing him until they were both struggling for breath.</p><p>\u201cYou asked for a private lingerie showing. I intend to show you just how this particular lingerie works.\u201d</p><p>Before he could respond, she arched over him and fit the head of his cock through the slit in her underwear. He sucked in his breath in surprise as he slid through the material and deep into her wetness.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit. I\u2019m buying you these in every color they have.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, adjusted her position and then sank down until she\u2019d sheathed his entire length. He curled his hands around her hips to keep her in place and nuzzled the lacy edge of her bra until he had the cup worked down enough that her nipple poked over the top.</p><p>He licked the rigid peak, coaxing it even tighter. Her head fell back and she closed her eyes as pleasure shot through her veins. Up and down she bounced on his lap, aided by his hands still dug into her hips.</p><p>The sheer naughtiness of having sex in a department store fueled her desire to greater heights. She felt incredibly sexy, daring, a vixen bent on pleasuring her man.</p><p>Her head swung back down, and she fixed her stare to his as he pulled slowly away from her breast.</p> <p>\u201cYou are a deviant, naughty temptress,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>She lifted her behind from his lap and then slowly lowered herself back down his length until he was buried to the balls.</p><p>\u201cYou say that like they\u2019re bad qualities,\u201d she said mischievously.</p><p>\u201cOh hell no. You were already my dream girl. Today just cements it. I love every deviant bone in your body. Now I wonder how loud I can make you scream.\u201d</p><p>The wicked gleam in his eyes told her he\u2019d have no qualms about doing just that. Okay, so she might not mind being a naughty girl when she knew no one was looking, but it didn\u2019t mean she was ready to let the entire store know that she and Max were fucking like bunnies behind a curtain.</p><p>He chuckled low. \u201cI\u2019m teasing you, dolcezza.\u201d</p> <p>He lifted her up and motioned for her to stand. Confused, she did as he gestured and waited for what he wanted.</p><p>He made a circling motion with his hand and she turned until her back was to him. Then he gripped her waist and guided her back toward his straining cock.</p><p>\u201cLean forward.\u201d</p><p>As she did his bidding, his hands left her waist and smoothed over her back, up her spine to her hair. Then he slowly worked back down, over her ass and to the slit in the crotch of her underwear.</p><p>His finger eased inside her and her knees buckled. She would have pitched forward but he caught her with one hand. The head of his penis brushed through the underwear but instead of finding her entrance, it brushed over her clit.</p><p>He rubbed back and forth from her quivering bud to her entrance and then back until she was slick and wet and so very ready to have him back inside her.</p><p>She tried to take matters into her hands by pushing back when he rubbed around her opening. His response was to smack her loudly on the ass.</p><p>She jumped, more startled than pained. All too soon the burn turned to a low hum of pleasure that worked over her behind and had her squirming for more.</p> <p>\u201cSit back now.\u201d</p><p>Eager to do his bidding, she sat and closed her eyes as his length slid easily into her pussy.</p><p>\u201cNow work it. Fuck me. But watch yourself in the mirror as you do.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. She\u2019d forgotten about the triple mirror just in front of her. Now that her gaze lifted and focused on her reflection, she was transfixed by the naughty vixen staring back at her.</p><p>Her breasts spilled from the dainty bra. Her legs were spread and she could see the mesh of flesh where she and Max were joined.</p><p>Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes gleamed. Her hair... Her hair was tousled and mussed, her lips swollen. She looked like a woman well loved.</p><p>She pulled forward just enough that his cock slid back almost out of her pussy. Mesmerized by the picture they presented, she slammed back, moaning at the instant sense of fullness.</p><p>\u201cCup your breasts. Roll your nipples and let me watch you in the mirror.\u201d</p><p>She straightened enough that he had a good view and then reached into the cups of her bra and lifted until her breasts came free.</p><p>He wrapped his hands back around her hips and took over directing her movements while she pinched and rolled her nipples between her thumb and fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful. Wild and wanton. My sweet vixen.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at herself, saw Max watching around her shoulder as he pulled her down on him over and over. She felt beautiful. And as he\u2019d said, wanton. Wild. Bold.</p><p>\u201cKeep touching yourself. I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d</p><p>Raw need rolled over her. Hot and edgy. Her skin prickled. Her orgasm bloomed, swelling until she fidgeted restlessly in his grasp.</p><p>Her breasts, so much more sensitive now, felt heavy in her palms. Each brush of her fingers across her nipples sent shard after shard of ecstasy streaking through her abdomen and lower until she convulsed hotly around his cock.</p><p>\u201cUse your fingers on your clit. Come when I come, dolcezza.\u201d</p><p>Leaving one of her breasts, she sucked her finger into her mouth until it was damp. Then she slowly trailed it down her midline, over her belly and underneath the lace of her panties until she delved into her folds to find her swollen, super-sensitized clit.</p><p>As soon as she rolled her finger over the tiny nub of flesh, her entire body clenched painfully. He thrust harder, his grip tightening at her hips.</p><p>She tried to call back the moan that welled in her throat but it came out in a low, husky hum.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby. Come for me. I\u2019m so close.\u201d</p><p>He was so tight inside her, so swollen and rigid that it became harder for him to thrust. Each movement sent her spiraling ever nearer to release.</p><p>She gasped when he withdrew and plunged\u2014hard\u2014sending him to greater depths. There was an edgy mixture of pain and mind-bending pleasure that left her insides clawing to be set free.</p><p>And then she simply catapulted forward. The excruciating tension broke, sending her into a million tiny pieces. A rainbow of color flashed in her vision and her reflected image blurred as he pumped harder and harder into her.</p><p>With a growl he slammed her back onto his lap and held onto her so fiercely that his fingers left impressions in her skin. He flooded hot and hard into her clenching womb. She fell back into him, suddenly exhausted and limp.</p><p>Max collected her into his arms, her back pressed to his chest. He turned her face toward him and nuzzled her cheek as he whispered over and over that he loved her.</p><p>Drowsily she opened her eyes to see herself in the mirror. Sprawled indelicately across Max\u2019s lap, his cock trapped between her legs. She was wet and sticky, and she glanced ruefully down at the very expensive panties they\u2019d just ruined.</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll be buying these for sure.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and nibbled affectionately at her shoulder. \u201cThese and a dozen others.\u201d</p><p>She tried to stand but teetered on the ridiculous heels she\u2019d slipped on. Her legs were as shaky as a newborn colt\u2019s.</p><p>Max caught her before she could pitch forward and then he rose.</p><p>\u201cGet cleaned up and changed. I\u2019ll take care of getting your clothing together. Oh, and wear one of those pairs of underwear out of the store with the red skirt we chose and the silk top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to freeze!\u201d she protested.</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted into a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you warm, dolcezza.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Callie felt conspicuous as they left the store and Max tucked her into the backseat of his car. It was silly. No one knew what she had on underneath her skirt. The underwear was perfectly respectable...except for the sly little gap that made her pussy accessible.Max gave the driver instructions, although Callie didn\u2019t much pay attention to where they were going. Then Max turned his attention to her and pulled her onto his lap so that she sat sideways across him.</p><p>The flat of his palm rested on her knee and he pushed higher, taking the filmy material of her skirt with him. She sucked in her breath and cast a nervous glance in the driver\u2019s direction, but the privacy glass was up. He couldn\u2019t see back here, could he?</p><p>She promptly forgot all about her concerns when Max\u2019s fingers dipped past the slit in her underwear and found her damp heat.</p><p>She\u2019d just had the orgasm to end all orgasms and yet when he touched her, her body leapt to instant and aching awareness.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playful today, dolcezza. And very, very naughty. I\u2019ll have to come up with a suitable punishment for your wanton behavior.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she stared incredulously at him. \u201cPunishment? You ought to be thanking me. What guy wouldn\u2019t like for a woman to fuck his brains out during a lingerie show? Why on earth would you punish me?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cBecause it suits me?\u201d</p><p>Ah, the answer to everything in Max\u2019s world. Because it suited him. She should have remembered that his punishments had little to do with actual infractions and more to do with his whims. Not that she minded.</p><p>Still, she turned her bottom lip down into a pouty sulk, because she also knew he loved it when she pouted.</p><p>He leaned up, caught her bottom lip between his teeth and sucked it into his mouth. \u201cSuch a pretty pout. I\u2019ll have to punish you for that too.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes but squeezed them shut when he slid two fingers into her pussy. He continued to play as they rolled down the avenue. Forgotten was her complaint that she\u2019d freeze in her current apparel. She was flushed from head to toe as he worked his magic. He was patient. Very exacting. Working her to the point of orgasm and then stopping until she came down from the verge.</p><p>Then he\u2019d begin again until she was crazy with wanting. His thumb stroked gently over her clit as his fingers explored her swollen tissues. He added a third finger and she arched, knowing that if he didn\u2019t stop at this precise point, she\u2019d come.</p><p>Only he did.</p><p>He laughed softly at her expression. She could only imagine how frustrated she looked. She wanted to pounce on him and fuck his brains out all over again, and she couldn\u2019t care less whether the driver saw and heard.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Slowly he withdrew his fingers, and then he licked each one, sucking her moisture from the tips, all the while staring at her.</p><p>\u201cI want you hungry. I want you on edge. I plan to keep you there all afternoon. Then I\u2019m going to take you home and spank that pretty ass of yours until you\u2019re begging me to take you. Then and only then am I going to fuck you. It won\u2019t be easy, dolcezza. I\u2019m going to own you. It won\u2019t be a nice, easy taking. You\u2019ll have no doubt as to my possession. I\u2019m going to fuck that sultry mouth of yours. I\u2019m going to fuck you here.\u201d He slid his fingers between her legs again and opened her as he ran a finger around her entrance. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to fuck that delectable ass of yours and then I\u2019m going to come all over you. Then I think I\u2019ll spank you all over again.\u201d</p><p>She quivered from head to toe. Heat rushed over her skin until she felt faint. She wavered in his grasp, bobbling like a tipsy party girl. She couldn\u2019t speak, couldn\u2019t respond to the vivid images bombarding her brain.</p><p>Suddenly there was nothing more she wanted to do than to go home and allow him to do as he pleased. And damn the man, but he knew it. The satisfied, predatory smile on his face spoke volumes. He knew precisely what he was doing to her and he loved every minute.</p><p>She sagged against him and tucked her head underneath his chin as she stared out the window at passing traffic. \u201cYou are an evil, evil man, Max Wilder. Damn if I don\u2019t love you anyway.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou love me because I\u2019m evil, and you are my match, dolcezza. You are every bit as evil as I am. I love that about you.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head and stared back at him, all teasing gone. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that you love me.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a long moment before sliding his hand over her cheek and then upward into her hair. He gathered the strands tight into his fist and pulled her toward his mouth to take her in a savage, demanding kiss.</p><p>For several seconds, she could barely breathe as he ravaged her lips, took possession of her mouth and tasted every inch of it.</p><p>As he pulled away, his eyes darkened with intensity. \u201cNever doubt my love for you, Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said softly. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ever.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Max glanced ahead and then carefully arranged her skirt so that she was covered. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She slid off his lap onto the seat and finished arranging her clothing so that she was presentable. \u201cWhere\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>The driver opened the door and Max stepped out. He reached back to take Callie\u2019s hand and helped her onto the sidewalk. She blinked to try and clear the cobwebs that were muddying her mind. That was also Max\u2019s fault. Her brain had gone to mush and now all she could think about was what was to come later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max pulled her into his side as a brisk wind kicked up. He hurried them toward a jewelry store two doors up. Callie recognized the name. Very exclusive. Very expensive.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t used to being around money. Her parents had money. It was just that Callie didn\u2019t. Not that she couldn\u2019t, but from the time she\u2019d been old enough to understand that her parents were wealthy, she\u2019d always been determined to pay her own way. Much to her parents\u2019 dismay.</p><p>With three fathers all dying to spoil their only little girl, Callie had put a kink in their plans by refusing to let them pay for anything.</p><p>These kinds of places made her nervous. Not that she hadn\u2019t been in them. But they made her feel like a fraud.</p> <p>They went inside, and an older gentleman in an expensive suit immediately came forward to greet Max.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, Mr. Wilder.\u201d</p><p>Max took his outstretched hand and shook it briefly. \u201cAnd you, Winston. Do you have them ready for me?\u201d</p><p>Winston nodded and motioned for Max and Callie to follow him into a small room off the main showroom.</p><p>\u201cPlease, have a seat.\u201d He gestured toward two plush armchairs in front of a highly polished executive desk. He then walked around to sit behind the desk and he opened one of the drawers.</p> <p>He drew out a velvet case, much larger than Callie would have imagined. She raised an inquisitive brow in Max\u2019s direction. He only smiled and directed Winston to open the box.</p><p>Winston complied and turned the box around, pushing it in Max\u2019s direction.</p><p>Inside were two intricately designed bracelets. Although they were much wider than a typical bracelet. They looked more like cuffs.</p><p>Max pulled one of the pieces of jewelry out of the box and held it up. He looked at it from side to side and then made a sound of approval before picking up the second one.</p><p>\u201cPut your arms out, dolcezza.\u201d</p><p>She did so without hesitation. Max first clasped one around her left wrist and then placed the other one on her right wrist. The cool metal closed around her flesh and to her surprise, he took out a tiny key, inserted it into the clasp and locked it.</p> <p>\u201cI considered gold, but platinum looks more beautiful on you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt suits you.\u201d</p><p>He raised both hands to view the jewelry on her wrists. Satisfaction lit his eyes and then he glanced at her. \u201cDo you like them?\u201d</p><p>She carefully pulled her hands away from Max so she could study the intricate designs on the bands. Along the bottom of the left cuff was inscribed: Two halves of a whole. She glanced at the right cuff to see inscribed: We are one.</p><p>And on the inside in flowery script: Max and Callie.</p><p>Tears shimmered in her vision and she lifted her gaze to Max. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Max raised his hand dismissively, and Winston hurried out of the office, leaving Max and Callie alone. Max returned his attention to her and gathered her hands in his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wear these as long as we\u2019re together. You\u2019ll not take them off. Ever. We\u2019ll both have a key, but know that you voluntarily taking them off will mean that you no longer want to be with me. In my eyes these are more binding than a wedding ring. They signal my possession. My ownership and your acceptance of that. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not trusting herself to speak around the knot in her throat.</p> <p>He raised her hands to his mouth and pressed a kiss across her knuckles. \u201cI love you, Callie. This more than anything else is a symbol of that love.\u201d</p><p>She smiled brilliantly, until her cheeks ached with the effort. \u201cI love them, Max. I\u2019ll wear them always.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up and his smile was as broad as hers. The joy in his expression made her heart clench, and a giddy thrill rushed down her spine. He loved her. She made him happy. It was almost too much for her to contemplate.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry? It\u2019s getting late in the afternoon and I have yet to feed you. I\u2019m neglecting my dolcezza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBeing naughty is hard work!\u201d</p><p>His laughter filled the room and he stood, pulling her up next to him. He caught her against him and tipped her chin up to receive his kiss. \u201cYou are so perfect for me, Callie.\u201d He squeezed her one last time and then ushered her from the office and out to the waiting car.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>On the drive back to Max\u2019s apartment, Callie battled the blanket of lethargy that settled over her. But the moment they arrived and took the lift up to his penthouse, anticipation replaced the threads of fatigue.Her body hummed with excitement as she remembered the promises he\u2019d made for when they returned.</p><p>The doorman accompanied them up, carrying the many bags with the extravagant purchases Max had made. Max directed him to drop them just inside the door, and then the doorman made a discreet exit, leaving Max and Callie standing in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cYou may leave your clothing here,\u201d Max said as he pointed to a coat rack and a small wicker basket placed strategically by the door.</p><p>Callie quickly undressed, hanging her shirt and skirt on the hook. She slipped off her bra and underwear and let them flutter from her fingers into the basket. When she would have discarded her heels, Max put a hand to her wrist to stop her.</p><p>\u201cKeep the shoes. I find I quite like them on you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. They were killer. Total fuck-me shoes. Red stilettos with three-inch heels. They complemented her legs, making them look much longer and sleeker than they were.</p><p>He gestured for her to walk ahead of him into the living room, and she set off, the heels tapping across the polished floor.</p><p>She stopped in the middle of the room, unsure of where he\u2019d want her. She turned to find his gaze fixed solidly on her. He seemed to be contemplating... What, she wasn\u2019t sure, but it sent a trail of chill bumps over her shoulders and down to her breasts until her nipples beaded and puckered.</p><p>He smiled lazily. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to wait and make you anticipate what is to come or whether to give in to my own impatience and begin now.\u201d</p><p>She remained silent, watching him and waiting. She was a very impatient person\u2014always had been\u2014but she found with Max that she was perfectly willing to await his pleasure.</p><p>\u201cTell me, dolcezza, have I tired you out too much today? Do you need to rest for a while?\u201d</p><p>Trust Max to be ever so considerate. He was always concerned with her needs even when they might contradict his own wants. She trembled under the steady weight of his gaze. Her body was alive with anticipation. No, she didn\u2019t need rest. She needed him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI need only what you want to give.\u201d</p><p>The pleasure in his eyes warmed her straight through.</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she turned until her back was to him. She heard him close the distance between them and then his hand cupped her behind. Lovingly he caressed, smoothing over one cheek and then the other.</p><p>She barely had time to suck in her breath before he issued a sharp blow with his palm. She jumped but he was there to steady her.</p><p>\u201cCareful. I\u2019ve asked you to remain in the heels, but I won\u2019t do so to your detriment.\u201d</p><p>A warm buzz spread over her ass as the burn faded into pleasure. He rubbed and caressed the spot he\u2019d struck, and then he smacked her other cheek. This time she was prepared and stood her ground.</p><p>Her eyes closed as he continued to caress her throbbing buttocks. Twice more he delivered a measured smack to her ass and each time he soothed the hurt with gentle caresses.</p><p>\u201cI love seeing the imprint of my hand on your beautiful, soft skin. I enjoy watching as the hurt turns to pleasure as your body relaxes and your breathing changes. You like the pain.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou also love the pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>He took her elbow and guided her toward the end of the couch. \u201cBend over and place your hands on the cushion. Let the arm cradle your belly.\u201d</p><p>She did as he asked and settled over the end of the couch until her ass was perched high in the air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to start slow and work up as I see how well you tolerate the pain. I\u2019m not going to stop until your ass is completely red and you\u2019re begging me to fuck you. Can you take it, Callie? Dare I see just how far I can push you?\u201d</p><p>Oh yes. God yes. She was nearly panting and he hadn\u2019t even begun.</p><p>\u201cThe words, Callie. I want to hear the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Max. Do your worst.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled then. \u201cYou have no idea what my worst is. You aren\u2019t ready for that. But you will be.\u201d</p><p>The dark thread in his voice completely contradicted his husky laughter. She was so on edge, so keyed up by what was to come that she could orgasm right now with only one touch. And maybe that was why he was so careful not to do so.</p><p>The first smack was light. She closed her eyes, enjoying the sensation of his palm against her flesh. He delivered another to the other cheek and she moaned.</p><p>True to his word he began slow. Measured. Never twice in the same spot. He methodically covered every inch of her ass, meting out blows with the same force.</p><p>Her mouth was open and she panted softly, wanting, needing. It was on the tip of her tongue to beg him to fuck her now, but that would only disappoint him. He wanted her to take more. A lot more. She wanted to give him what he wanted.</p><p>And she absolutely wanted to see just how much she could take before she gave in to the urge to plead.</p><p>He picked up the pace and the blows became harder and more painful. But with each one, the burn was quickly replaced by soft euphoria. Almost as if she floated out of her body on a cloud of never-ending pleasure.</p><p>She closed her eyes and sighed dreamily even as the blows came faster. Harder.</p><p>The sound of the smacks rose in the quiet room. Her entire body jiggled and lurched forward, forcing her to brace herself against the cushions.</p><p>No longer could she differentiate between the blows. It was all one hazy, edgy sensation that blended in a long trail of pain and indescribable pleasure.</p><p>She floated higher and higher. Her mind was no longer her own. All she knew was Max. Max\u2019s hand. On her body. His pleasure. His belonging. His body. Not hers. She was his.</p><p>\u201cI wish you could see how beautiful your ass is. Rosy red. So red that you can\u2019t tell one mark from the other. It glows. Just like you.\u201d</p><p>She moaned as he began again. Harder this time. Deliberately punishing. He was driving her further and further to her breaking point.</p><p>She bit her lip to keep from crying out. She wouldn\u2019t. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cGive me the words,\u201d he demanded. \u201cI won\u2019t stop until you beg me. And then I\u2019m going to fuck you until we both drop.\u201d</p><p>It was her undoing. She opened her mouth and the words spilled out.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Max. Please. Fuck me. Take me. Make me yours. Please,\u201d she said brokenly.</p><p>He left her immediately. Before she realized he\u2019d quit, his fingers wrapped in her hair and yanked her head to the side. She was still positioned over the arm of the couch, her ass throbbing, aching, thrust high in the air, when he gripped her hair and shoved his cock into her mouth.</p><p>As he\u2019d promised, he wasn\u2019t gentle. He fucked her mouth as ruthlessly as he\u2019d fucked her pussy and her ass in the past. She couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t do anything but lie there, his hand twisted tight in her hair as he thrust deep to the back of her throat.</p><p>He leaned over the couch so his angle was better. His body covered her face and his hips slapped against her as he pushed into her over and over until she wasn\u2019t aware of breathing, only of receiving him.</p><p>He was exerting his dominance. There was no doubt as to what he was doing. He wasn\u2019t making love to her. He was possessing her. Showing her that she belonged to him. That her body belonged to him and he could do as he liked.</p><p>She lay there, reveling in that possession. She was more than willing for him to mark her, brand her, own her. He\u2019d never hurt her. She knew that. He\u2019d take her as far as she could go, but he\u2019d stop in a heartbeat if she asked him to.</p><p>She was equally determined that those words would never pass her lips.</p><p>With a harsh groan, he jerked away, leaving her to lick her swollen lips, nearly numb from the force of his possession.</p><p>He walked behind her again and rubbed over her still-throbbing ass. She gasped when he issued several sharp blows in succession.</p><p>Only when he\u2019d worked her back up to the haze where the line between pain and pleasure was blurred did he spread her legs wide and slam into her from behind.</p><p>It was too much. She was too on edge. As soon as his cock thrust deep into her body, her orgasm rolled over her like a tidal wave.</p><p>She cried out as her body tightened, drew up, painful in its intensity. Then as if a sharp knife cut cleanly through the taut rope holding her captive, she shattered.</p><p>She screamed, the sound sharp through the silence. Her body wasn\u2019t her own. She couldn\u2019t control her reaction, couldn\u2019t hold her release at bay.</p><p>Through it all, Max hammered relentlessly, thrusting, pushing her further and further over the precipice.</p><p>She could hear herself begging, just as he\u2019d vowed she\u2019d do, but she had no idea what she begged for. She pleaded, wanting more, not wanting him to stop even as her breaths tore raggedly from her nose and mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wanted all of him, everything he had to give her, whatever he chose to force her to take. She wanted it. Nothing less.</p><p>Then he tore himself from her writhing body, and she let out a whimper. She felt so empty, so desolate of his possession. She craved more. Only felt complete when he was inside her, his body a part of hers. A part of her soul.</p><p>Again, the blows rained down over her ass. Faster and more furious this time as if he was every bit as driven over the edge as she was.</p><p>She gasped. Tears slid down her cheeks. And still she wanted more.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged quietly, her throat raw, her voice nearly gone.</p><p>He parted her throbbing cheeks and pushed into her. No preamble. No work up. His thick length forced into her ass, and the beautiful burn was back as he struggled to make her accommodate him.</p><p>She stretched around him and she pushed back, wanting all of him. Wanting that instant moment of complete possession when her body screamed no but her heart cried yes.</p><p>His fingers gripping her aching buttocks, he shoved forward with a grunt and his balls came to rest against her pussy.</p><p>\u201cNow, I own you, Callie,\u201d he said, his voice filled with grim satisfaction. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a part of you I don\u2019t own, that doesn\u2019t have my mark. You\u2019re mine. Tell me you belong to me. Only me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she croaked out. \u201cOnly yours, Max. Always yours. Please. Take me. I\u2019m begging. Finish it.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew and then began a relentless assault on her senses that later she\u2019d find no comparison for. He fucked her brutally for what seemed like forever. She lay there, submissively, taking what he meted out, never wanting it to end.</p><p>In and out, his erection so much harder and thicker than it had ever seemed before. He punished her, he loved her, he possessed her.</p><p>He dragged his cock all the way out until the head rested against her entrance. Then he\u2019d ram forward again, opening her and stretching her to meet his demands. Over and over again, he repeated the action until she went limp, too exhausted to do more than lie there as he took his pleasure.</p><p>Then he slowed as if to prevent his own release. He wasn\u2019t as desperate as before and instead he set a steady rhythm destined to keep him just on the brink, hovering as she\u2019d hovered for so long.</p><p>\u201cI want another,\u201d he growled. \u201cCome for me again, Callie. I won\u2019t release you until you do.\u201d</p> <p>His words stirred her to life when she didn\u2019t believe she had any left. Her muscles warmed and fluttered and desire coiled deep within and fanned out as flames licked higher.</p><p>Each thrust jerked her body, and her cheek rubbed abrasively against the cushion of the couch.</p><p>\u201cCome, Callie. Let go. I\u2019ll fuck you all night if I have to.\u201d</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>She trembled. Her legs shook, both from the force of his thrusts and her own shattered senses. This time her orgasm rose sharp and fast, so edgy that she feared losing consciousness.</p><p>And still he pushed, fucking her with ruthless discipline she wouldn\u2019t have imagined any man having. How could he have so much control over his body?</p><p>For several minutes he thrust, his hands holding her in a painful grip. Then his hands left her and red-hot pain slashed across her ass as he smacked her.</p><p>Her vision dimmed as she finally, finally edged over. Over and over his hand fell as his cock punished her ass, thrusting deep, opening her wider and wider with every push.</p> <p>She screamed again. Cried out his name in fear. What was happening to her frightened her. Not him. Her own body. Her own complete loss of control. She fought desperately to maintain consciousness but darkness was quickly closing around her.</p><p>Her release flashed like a violent thunderstorm, so vicious, so wonderfully pleasurable, like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced in her life. How could he do this to her? How could he unlock such a primitive response?</p><p>On the hazy edge of her consciousness she was aware of him pulling from her clenching pussy. Hot liquid spurted onto her back, onto her ass, inside her ass. Down her legs.</p><p>Then he slid back inside her ass, forcing his semen deeper into her body. For a long moment he simply slid back and forth, his entry eased by the slick liquid.</p><p>He came to a stop and held himself deep. She could feel him soften some from the turgid hardness of just a moment ago.</p><p>She closed her eyes, unwilling to continue the battle to remain conscious. Max was there. Max would take care of her.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Max carefully pushed himself off Callie and pulled from her quivering body. He stared down at the beautiful woman who\u2019d given herself unreservedly. She taken everything he had to give and asked\u2014no demanded\u2014more.Love filled his chest, swelled in his throat until he was incapable of speech. Something inside him cracked open at the sight of her lying there, eyes closed, exhausted from all she\u2019d endured.</p><p>Tenderness flooded into his heart. He walked around to the side of the couch and gathered her gently into his arms. He lifted her up and carried her toward the bedroom. He set her on the bed only long enough for him to hurry into the bathroom and start the water.</p><p>He made it hot, and soon steam rose as the water tumbled out of the faucet. Leaving it, he returned to the bedroom to find Callie curled on her side, her eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cMy dolcezza,\u201d he murmured as he kissed her temple.</p><p>He smoothed her hair away from her face and then gathered her in his arms once more. He carried her into the bathroom and murmured her name until her eyelids fluttered open and her cloudy blue eyes stared back at him, warm with love and contentment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve drawn a bath for you. I want you to enjoy a nice long soak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. That sounds nice.\u201d</p><p>He lowered her into the water, and she let out a blissful sigh. As soon as she was submerged up to her shoulders, she leaned her head back and fixed her sleepy gaze on him.</p><p>He palmed the top of her head and then rubbed his hand down to her nape. \u201cAre you all right? Was I too rough with you?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was dazzling. It took his breath away. It was like being punched in the stomach. So much love and...trust. Finally, trust.</p><p>\u201cYou were wonderful, Max. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it. I\u2019m not even sure I have words to describe it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and pressed his lips to her forehead. For a long moment, he remained there, eyes closed as he simply savored her sweetness.</p><p>\u201cSoak, my love. I want you well taken care of. I\u2019m going to go prepare a snack and some wine. I\u2019ll bring it in for you to have in your bath. Call me if the water cools. I\u2019ll draw more hot.\u201d</p><p>Again she gifted him with a sweet smile that tightened his gut all over again. He didn\u2019t want to leave her. Even for as long as it would take to get her something to eat and drink.</p><p>Reluctantly he left the bathroom and went into the kitchen to make sandwiches. He cut a selection of cheeses and prepared a small fruit bowl. He\u2019d made certain his apartment was stocked with her favorite wine, and he pulled a bottle out along with two glasses.</p><p>He arranged everything on a tray and walked back into the bathroom where Callie was dozing in the tub. He quietly set the tray down and then leaned over to run his fingers through the water.</p><p>It was warm but not hot, so he turned the faucet back on, and Callie came awake, her eyes startled and confused.</p><p>\u201cSorry. The water\u2019s growing cold. I don\u2019t want you to get a chill.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThank you, Max.\u201d</p><p>When he was satisfied with the temperature of the water, he handed her a glass of wine and then took the platter in hand and perched on the edge of the tub.</p><p>Tenderly he offered her a bite of sandwich and then followed it with a small hunk of cheese. After she took a sip of wine, he slid a grape between her lips and listened to her low hum of appreciation as the sweet fruit burst onto her tongue.</p><p>He was content to see to her needs. He wanted her well rested and satisfied. He wanted her to feel safe and provided for. Like she was the only woman in the world who mattered to him.</p><p>She sipped lazily at the wine and yawned before shaking her head when he offered another piece of fruit.</p><p>\u201cHad enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you. I feel so unbelievably spoiled right now.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and stroked his hand over her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s precisely how I want you to feel. Always. Cherished and pampered beyond measure.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and leaned back, closing her eyes as she rested her head against the rim.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll finish your bath, I\u2019ll dry you off and we\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re ready. It\u2019s early yet.\u201d</p><p>Her worry brought another smile to his face. \u201cI can see you\u2019re tired, dolcezza. I have no wish to exhaust you. I can think of nothing better than to go to bed and have you wrap your sweet body around mine.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his finger down her arm and lingered over the silver cuff at her wrist. Seeing his brands of possession at her wrists fired a raw, primitive instinct deep within his soul.</p><p>No modern man should feel this possessive of a woman. And yet he did. He couldn\u2019t muster one iota of regret for it either.</p><p>She was his. Utterly and completely his.</p><p>He looked up to see her also looking at the jewelry on her wrists. He continued to stroke one finger over the cool metal.</p><p>\u201cDo you like them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love them,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cThe sentiment is beautiful, Max. I swear you have a poet\u2019s soul.\u201d</p><p>The obvious appreciation in her voice warmed him through. He loved showering her with things. Anything to make her happy, to make her look at him like he held the world in his hands.</p><p>He had so many plans for them. He wanted to take her places she hadn\u2019t yet been. He wanted to experience the joy in her eyes when she saw the sunset in a new part of the world.</p><p>They were truly two halves of a whole. Two drifters. Restless. Free-spirited. Never content with the same routine.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>He blinked and realized she was staring thoughtfully at him. Then he smiled. \u201cI was imagining taking you places you\u2019ve never been and watching the sunsets together.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes instantly glowed and her smile was so radiant it lit up the entire room. \u201cThere\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather be with than you, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a damn good thing,\u201d he growled playfully.</p><p>She laughed and reached for the soap at the end of the tub. \u201cGive me a few minutes to wash and then I\u2019ll get out and you can haul me to bed. I\u2019m not entirely certain I can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go turn back the sheets, and then I\u2019ll be back with a towel. Take your time, dolcezza. There\u2019s no hurry tonight.\u201d</p><p>Callie watched him go and then heaved a huge sigh of contentment. Her body ached. No doubt about it. Muscles she didn\u2019t even know she had were sore. Her bottom throbbed. She was so tired she was about to fall over, but she\u2019d never felt more happy and alive in her life.</p><p>She scrubbed soap over her body, rising up from the water to get all the girl parts and then quickly sinking down into the hot water when chill bumps danced their way across her skin.</p><p>When Max returned with a huge, plush towel, she was eager to get dried off and warm again. She stepped from the tub and into the towel he promptly wrapped around her, his arms going around her as well.</p><p>For a long moment he hugged her tight as the towel soaked up all the moisture. Then he carefully rubbed over her skin, making sure to dry every inch. By the time he finished, cold was the last thing she felt.</p><p>She was heated from the inside out. Flushed. Flames stoked. Even as her knees trembled with fatigue, she yearned for Max. Wanted his touch. His kiss. His possession all over again.</p><p>When she was dry, he tucked his arm underneath her legs and lifted her into his arms as he strode toward the bedroom. The covers were turned back, and he slid her onto the mattress before promptly pulling the covers up to her shoulders.</p><p>He puttered around for a moment, undressing and turning off the bathroom lights. He left the lamp on his side burning and then climbed into bed beside her.</p><p>As soon as he lay down, she snuggled into his arms. He held her and stroked his palms up and down her sides, over her curves, her hips, her breasts, like he couldn\u2019t get enough of touching her.</p><p>She nuzzled into his neck and kissed him just below the ear. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, dolcezza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much I want to share with you,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>He pulled away and stared curiously at her. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy home. The mountain. All the places that are so special to me. As much of a roamer as I am, my heart will always be on that mountain. It\u2019s a place I can always return to and know that I\u2019m loved and accepted no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to share it with me. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the things you most cherish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you to Callie\u2019s Meadow. It\u2019s where I was born.\u201d</p><p>He went still against her and his hand stopped its progress over the swell of her hip. \u201cIt sounds like a beautiful place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh it is,\u201d she breathed. \u201cIt\u2019s always been special to the family because it\u2019s where my mom gave birth to me. But over the years it somehow became mine. My refuge. My dream place. One day I\u2019m going to build my own house there. I\u2019ve designed it in my head so many times that it\u2019s become real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where do I fit in to this dream?\u201d</p><p>She pushed up on her elbow, her hair falling over her breasts as she stared earnestly down at him. \u201cWhere do you want to fit in, Max? I\u2019m winging it here. I have no idea what your plans are. You say you love me. I love you. For most people that means they\u2019re going to try to have a relationship. A serious relationship. But we\u2019ve not talked about it at all. I have no idea what you have in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he said simply. \u201cWhat that means is that you\u2019re going to be with me. Whether it means a lifelong commitment or marriage on paper. I don\u2019t care. Those things aren\u2019t as important as your promise to belong to me, to submit to me, to accept our relationship and to wear the brands of my possession.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what does that mean?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>Her heart was thumping so hard, she feared it would beat right out of her chest. She hated moments like this. She wasn\u2019t versed in being all subtle and coy. She was too blunt. Too demanding. Too damn honest for her own good.</p><p>\u201cWhere will we live? I assume you want us to be together. I don\u2019t want to leave my life, my family. They\u2019re too important to me. So tell me, Max. What does that mean for us?\u201d</p><p>He hushed her with a kiss, and for several long seconds, neither of them spoke as he kissed her over and over until she nearly forgot what she\u2019d asked.</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re mine and I\u2019m not letting you go. It means that your happiness is the most important thing in my life. I\u2019ve promised to take care of you. To place your needs above mine. To cherish your gift of submission. That doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ll fly in on weekends so we can have a quick fuck before we go our separate ways. It means you\u2019re going to spend every goddamn day in my arms, in my bed, underneath me, me inside you as many times as I can get there.\u201d</p> <p>She could barely breathe for the hope burning like a torch in her soul.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stay on your damn mountain if that\u2019s what you want, Callie. I\u2019m not going to take you away from the place and the people you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Max.\u201d</p><p>She threw her arms around him, nearly sending him rolling from the bed in her exuberance. She landed atop him, arms and legs sprawled as she peppered him with kisses.</p><p>He laughed and tried to ward her off but she persisted until he put his hands up and begged for mercy.</p><p>\u201cLord but you get crazy when you\u2019re happy, Callie.\u201d</p> <p>She grinned, straddled him and stared down as her hands gripped his shoulders. \u201cYou make me happy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to be happier than I am right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sincerely hope you\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said softly. \u201cFor me, I can only imagine how happy we\u2019ll be on our wedding day. On the day you give birth to our first child. Our fourth child. Or our fifth. Or maybe when you look at me in fifty years like you\u2019re looking at me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop,\u201d she choked out. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me cry again.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her and pulled her down into his arms. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that. I don\u2019t like it when you cry. It makes me feel helpless, and I hate feeling helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home tomorrow,\u201d she urged. \u201cI know you wanted us to spend a week here, but we have all the time in the world. I want you to meet my family. I want you to see all the things I love.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated a moment as he ran his hand over her hair. Then his chest heaved as he sighed. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll go back tomorrow. If we\u2019re going to build our future, it\u2019s important that I meet your family and see the things that are precious to you.\u201d</p><p>Callie wrapped her arms around him and hugged him close. \u201cYou\u2019ll like my family. They can be overbearing, but they love me and I love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone who loves you as much as I do can\u2019t be all bad,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She raised her head to see his grin, and she smiled back as sunshine poured over her soul. Perfect. Things were just perfect. They couldn\u2019t be any more so.</p><p>She wanted to bounce out of bed and call her mother as she\u2019d almost done in Europe when she\u2019d first met Max. She wanted to tell her that she had indeed met the man she was going to marry.</p><p>But she was too comfortable wrapped around Max like a blanket, and she yawned broadly as she snuggled more firmly into his embrace. The call to her mom could wait until tomorrow.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking we should ditch your car when we get to Clyde and take my truck up the mountain,\u201d Callie said as they passed the sign that signaled three more miles until they reached their destination.Max\u2019s mouth turned down into a grimace. \u201cYour truck is on its last leg, Callie. I hate that you still drive it. It\u2019s an accident waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou sound just like my dads. And my brothers. They\u2019ve been nagging me forever to get something else. My dads are dying to buy me a new vehicle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let them?\u201d</p><p>His expression suggested she was nuts, and yeah, her truck was old. It had definitely seen better days. The idea of riding in such a thing probably appalled Max. His tastes ran to the more refined. And expensive.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford one,\u201d she said.</p><p>When he continued to look at her with a blank expression she sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never allowed my parents to just buy stuff for me. They have money. But it\u2019s not my money. Everything I\u2019ve earned I\u2019ve stashed away for my dream house. As long as my truck runs, then it\u2019s money I don\u2019t have to invest into a new car and I\u2019m closer to my dream of my own place.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re still thinking like someone who\u2019s not in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil a few days ago I wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to adjust a lifetime\u2019s worth of thinking in a few days. You have to be patient with me, Max. I\u2019m used to being independent. I\u2019ve always gone my own way. My dream of building my house won\u2019t go away just because you and I are together. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll continue to work for.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened and his fingers curled tighter around the steering wheel. \u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019ll allow you to continue working menial jobs\u2014in a bar, for God\u2019s sake\u2014to fund your house?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, but he held up his hand before she could speak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of your submissiveness or my desire to control you, Callie. I hope to hell you never think I\u2019m some controlling bastard who regulates every second of your life. This has nothing to do with control. I\u2019m concerned for your safety. You can\u2019t tell me that working in your brother\u2019s bar is something you want to do long-term. Or these other jobs you pick up for extra money. I\u2019ve got more money than I\u2019ll ever use in a lifetime. More than our children will use in their lifetime. Do you honestly expect me to stand by and not give you the money to build your house?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and rubbed her head tiredly. It was an argument she\u2019d had many times with her parents. No one seemed to understand how her mind worked. They wanted to take care of her. Buy things for her. Make her life easier. She loved them for it. She truly did. But she wanted her own life. Wanted to be able to look at the things she had and feel a sense of accomplishment.</p><p>Her brothers had all forged their own path independent of their parents. Seth was a cop\u2014a damn good cop. Michael was a veterinarian with a thriving practice. And Dillon... Dillon had a Midas touch when it came to business. He probably owned half of Clyde. His bar would be self-supporting enough, but the bar was a drop in the bucket compared to the other properties and businesses Dillon owned.</p><p>And then there was Callie. Callie who didn\u2019t have the discipline for college. Who was too antsy and couldn\u2019t stay in one place long enough to study for an actual career. Head-in-the-clouds, dreamer Callie.</p><p>Her family loved her but Callie knew she was an enigma to them. Someone they adored but never truly understood. The dads probably took turns blaming each other for fathering her. They were all steady and hardworking. How could Callie have popped from their gene pool?</p><p>She sighed again as she saw Max was still watching her, waiting for a response.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to understand. But I hope you\u2019ll accept it\u2014me.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and took her hand, pulling it to his lips. He kissed each knuckle and then lowered her hand to his lap where he laced his fingers with hers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about you I don\u2019t love and accept, Callie. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to fight you on certain matters. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m ever going to be okay with you working ridiculously low-paying, dangerous jobs when I have the means to support you, spoil you and take care of you. That\u2019s who I am. I don\u2019t expect you to understand, but I hope you\u2019ll accept it.\u201d</p><p>She winced. How neatly he turned her words back on her. She couldn\u2019t even argue, which irritated her all the more. She glared at him and he merely shot her a smug grin. Yeah, he knew he\u2019d won this round. Damn the man. She usually found his arrogance attractive, but today, she found it...annoying.</p><p>Excitement replaced her annoyance as soon as they turned onto Main Street in Clyde. No matter where she went or how long she was gone, when she came home she was filled with happiness.</p><p>Max turned into the parking lot of the motel where he\u2019d last stayed and parked beside her SUV. She could tell it pained him to ride in her truck, but she didn\u2019t want him taking his car up the mountain.</p><p>She grinned and bounced out, opening the door to her truck. She slid into the driver\u2019s seat, sighing as the worn leather cupped her behind like a lover. Yeah, she was old, but she was still a good truck and Callie loved her.</p><p>Max climbed into the passenger side with a look of exasperation but remained silent as she began backing out of her spot.</p><p>Normally she would stop and see Lily or stop in at Michael\u2019s practice or even stick her head in at the sheriff\u2019s office to say hello to Seth, but she was anxious to go up to her parents\u2019 so she could show Max her meadow.</p><p>There would be plenty of time to visit with the family later.</p><p>Knowing that if she did her usual routine of parking at her parents\u2019 house and walking down to the meadow she and Max would get held up by her mom and dads, Callie opted instead to pull off onto the old logging road that would take them to the meadow without going all the way up to her parents\u2019.</p><p>She cast a sideways glance at Max. He looked tense. His jaw was set into a tight line and his gaze was sharply taking in their surroundings. The closer they got to the meadow, the darker his expression got.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head but remained quiet.</p><p>With a shrug, she drove around the last bend and then parked in front of the old fence that used to separate Colter land from the meadow.</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d she said with a note of reverence she never seemed to rid herself of when she spoke of her meadow.</p><p>Max slowly opened his door and got out. She climbed out and met him around the front of her truck.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fence?\u201d he asked. \u201cI thought your family owned all of the property up here.\u201d</p><p>She frowned a moment. She didn\u2019t remember going into detail, but then Max knew her parents owned a lot of land so it was a natural assumption.</p><p>She slid her hand into Max\u2019s and urged him toward the worn, wooden fence.</p><p>\u201cWe just never took this part down. Someday I\u2019ll get to it. It was up when the previous people owned the meadow. My dads tried to buy it for years with no success. Then when my mom got pregnant with me, they suddenly wanted to sell. My dads bought it as a surprise for my mom. And, well, you know the rest.\u201d</p><p>His lips formed a thin line. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d</p><p>Callie sighed as she stared over the rolling slope of the land to where the creek ran down the middle. Flowers covered the earth in a blanket of vivid color that took her breath away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful place I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>She beamed at Max. \u201cI think so too. Now can you see why I want to build my dream house here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but he still looked...dark. Thoughtful. She couldn\u2019t imagine what was going through his head. Did he think that he somehow took a backseat to her dreams?</p><p>She slid her arms around his waist and hugged him, though whether she did so to reassure herself or him she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cRight over there is where I was born,\u201d she said softly as she pointed to the right of the creek and back, closer to where the property adjoined her parents\u2019 to the south.</p><p>Max smiled. \u201cI imagine you were always an impatient child. Even from the very beginning. Trust you to be born here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grinned. \u201cIt was perfect. Do you know that of the four of us, only one was born in an actual hospital? We swear that Dillon was switched at birth with one of the other babies. No one could ever figure out where he came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope you don\u2019t have any crazy ideas of giving birth in the middle of nowhere,\u201d he said with a scowl.</p><p>She laughed and squeezed him again. \u201cOh no. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m too fond of modern technology. And pain relief! I want to be surrounded by nurses and doctors and the guy giving the epidural.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her brow and his expression eased. \u201cThat\u2019s good because I want only the best for you and our child when the time comes.\u201d</p> <p>Her entire heart squeezed ridiculously until she felt near to exploding. How could she possibly be this happy when just days ago she\u2019d been miserable? She wanted to pinch herself, but if this was a dream, she was so not ready to wake up yet.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, pulling at his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go walk down to the stream. I\u2019ll pick some flowers for Lily. She loves flowers. She\u2019s an artist, you know. She once drew me a picture of the meadow and gave it to me. It\u2019s so awesome.\u201d</p><p>Max smiled as she dragged him to the fence. \u201cYou love this place, don\u2019t you, Callie?\u201d</p><p>She stopped with one leg slung over the wooden slats. \u201cIt\u2019s my most favorite place in the world.\u201d</p><p>There was a hint of sadness in his eyes as he stared back at her. But then he blinked and it was gone. He put his hand out to stop her progress and then he hopped the fence with ease. He reached back and hoisted her over, then laced his fingers with hers once more.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see your meadow, dolcezza. I\u2019m happy to spend as much time here as you like.\u201d</p><p>She went up on tiptoe to kiss him. \u201cThank you, Max. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>He caught her chin and turned her toward his mouth. \u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she pulled away and then she dropped his hand and took off at a run. \u201cCome on!\u201d she called over her shoulder. \u201cLast one there gets a spanking.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s laughter followed her as she ran full tilt down the hill toward the bubbling creek. She knew he\u2019d catch her\u2014which was the point. Max was an adventurous guy, but no way he\u2019d allow her to spank him.</p><p>He caught her just a few feet from the stream. He likely lagged behind just to give her false hope. He smacked her on the ass and then sped by, reaching the stream a mere three feet in front of her.</p> <p>She stopped and bent, sucking in deep breaths. Damn the man, he didn\u2019t even look winded and she was on the verge of puking.</p><p>\u201cYou did that on purpose,\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cWaited until the last minute to catch me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou don\u2019t seriously think I\u2019m going to pass on any opportunity to spank that pretty ass of yours, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be laughing if you\u2019d screwed up and I beat you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled again. \u201cIf anyone could ever get away with spanking me, dolcezza, it would be you. But no. I\u2019ll be the only one dishing out spankings in this relationship.\u201d</p><p>She turned her lip down into a pout, knowing it would delight him.</p> <p>He pulled her to him and nibbled at her bottom lip as she knew he would.</p><p>\u201cI can guarantee you\u2019ll enjoy the spankings every bit as much as I will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re staying here again,\u201d Max said as he dropped their bags on the floor of the same motel room where he\u2019d spent so many days.\u201cShhh,\u201d Callie said, shushing him with her hand. \u201cI\u2019m calling Mom.\u201d</p><p>Max shut the door with a sigh, trudged over to the bed and plopped down on the edge. Then with a dramatic flair he fell back, arms outstretched, and closed his eyes.</p><p>Callie laughed and put the phone back to her ear. \u201cHey Mom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie! Where are you? I\u2019ve been so worried. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s not like you to run off at a moment\u2019s notice, but you have to admit, the circumstances were different this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mom. Promise. I wanted to let you know that Max and I are back in town. I was hoping to bring him up to meet you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We can\u2019t wait to meet him, sweetie. When did you want to come up? Where are you staying? You know there\u2019s plenty of room here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh.\u201d Not that she minded being at her parents\u2019, but no way did she want her and Max staying there. It would put a serious crimp in their sex life. \u201cAnytime is good for us. The sooner the better. And we\u2019re fine. Really. Max has a room at the motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Callie. That motel is horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good, Mom. Now when do you want us up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. Definitely tomorrow. I\u2019ll have your dads fix a nice dinner. No, maybe lunch is better. Let\u2019s plan on lunch and then we can spend the afternoon getting to know Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great. We\u2019ll come up around eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrific. We\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d</p><p>Callie put the phone back to her ear. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>Callie smiled until her teeth ached. \u201cYeah, Mom. I\u2019m happier than I ever imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I care about, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, baby. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Callie hung up and turned to see Max watching her from the bed.</p><p>\u201cThey want us up for lunch tomorrow. The entire family will be there. I have no doubt my mom is even now on the phone rounding up the rest of her brood and issuing orders to be there or die.\u201d</p><p>Max chuckled. \u201cShe sounds like a tyrant. I wonder where on earth you got your personality from.\u201d</p><p>Callie flopped down beside him and hit him with a pillow. \u201cMy mom is the sweetest person on earth, but yes, she still rules the roost with a velvet fist.\u201d</p><p>Max wrapped his arms around her and then pulled her across his lap before she had time to respond. His hand settled on her jeans-covered ass and his laughter sounded wicked in her ear.</p><p>\u201cNow, it seems I owe you a spanking.\u201d</p><p>She went limp and white-hot desire sizzled through her body, prickling her skin. It amazed her how instantly aware she became around this man. A word. A touch. Just a look and she was putty in his hands.</p><p>\u201cBetter make sure I don\u2019t scream,\u201d she muttered. \u201cMy brother\u2019s the sheriff, remember? Last thing I want is him breaking down our door because someone reported that I was being murdered in a hotel room.\u201d</p><p>Max rubbed his hand over her behind. \u201cOh you\u2019ll enjoy this one, dolcezza. I know I plan to.\u201d</p><p>Callie was a nervous wreck. Why, she didn\u2019t know. This was only one of the most important days of her entire life. Her family, who meant the world to her, was going to meet and stand in judgment of the man she loved more than anything.</p><p>Yeah, good reason to be nervous.</p><p>If only she hadn\u2019t poured out her hurt to her family. If she\u2019d only waited...they wouldn\u2019t be coming into the meeting with Max with prejudice.</p><p>She sighed. Woe be unto the man who hurt her dads\u2019 little girl. Her brothers weren\u2019t much better. They\u2019d probably all glower at Max the entire time.</p><p>\u201cQuit biting your lip, dolcezza. You\u2019re going to ruin that pretty mouth of yours.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over to see Max studying her. He\u2019d insisted on taking his car to her parents\u2019, and she hadn\u2019t argued. She wanted Max to feel comfortable and on equal footing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just...nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can see that. You need to stop worrying so much. Your parents will see how madly in love I am with you. Isn\u2019t that what every parent wants for their child? Someone to love them and take care of them?\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to tell him that her family knew everything, but that would only make Max uptight and there was no sense in them both being on edge. Besides, Max probably knew. He knew how close she was to her family, and she and Max had been apart for several months. Who wouldn\u2019t have come home and told their family what a scumbag he was?</p><p>By the time they pulled into her parents\u2019 drive, Callie\u2019s stomach was in knots. She rubbed her damp palms down the legs of her pants as Max parked beside her mom\u2019s SUV.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have long to contemplate whether she wanted to get out because her mom appeared on the porch, a wide smile on her face. Before Callie had her door opened, Holly Colter was down the steps and hurrying toward the vehicle.</p><p>Thank goodness for Max. He was out with a warm smile and hand outstretched while Callie still hung halfway out of the car.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Colter. I\u2019m Max. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>Callie stumbled out as her mom enfolded Max in a warm hug.</p><p>\u201cHello, Max. And please, do call me Holly. It\u2019s wonderful to meet you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Mom.\u201d</p><p>Holly turned to Callie and just as quickly pulled her into a bone-crushing hug.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Callie said with a laugh. \u201cYou just saw me a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>Holly pulled back with a muttered hmph. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s only been a few hours. I\u2019m entitled to be happy to see you. I have to make up for all the time you spend from home.\u201d</p><p>Callie hugged her again and all her unease melted away in her mother\u2019s embrace.</p><p>Holly pulled back and then grabbed at Callie\u2019s and Max\u2019s hands. \u201cCome on inside, you two. Your dads are waiting to meet Max, Callie.\u201d</p><p>Callie smiled over at Max who wore an expression that looked like a cross of awe and confusion. Holly dragged them both toward the door and all but shoved them through.</p><p>Ethan stood in the living room. Though he opened his arms for Callie, he looked at Max with an indecipherable expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cBe good,\u201d Callie whispered as she hugged her dad.</p><p>Ethan kissed her cheek and then extended his hand to Max. \u201cI\u2019m Ethan Colter, one of Callie\u2019s dads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax Wilder,\u201d Max said as he shook Ethan\u2019s hand.</p><p>One down, two to go.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the other dads?\u201d Callie asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the kitchen. You and Max get comfortable. I\u2019ll go get them,\u201d Holly said.</p><p>Callie perched on the couch next to Max and laced her fingers through his.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it me who should be nervous?\u201d Max murmured. \u201cRelax, Callie. I\u2019m pretty sure they won\u2019t threaten to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Callie burst into laughter, which caused Ethan to raise an eyebrow in their direction.</p><p>Just then Holly returned with Adam and Ryan in tow. Predictably, both dads\u2019 faces were set in stone. Callie rose and when their gazes alighted on her, they softened and warmth entered their eyes.</p><p>She hugged Adam first and then went into Ryan\u2019s arms. He squeezed her tight and then pulled her to his side as both dads stared Max down.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Callie hissed. \u201cGive him a chance.\u201d</p><p>With a grunt, Ryan disentangled himself from Callie and closed the distance between him and Max. He stuck out his hand. \u201cRyan Colter. Glad to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Max shook his hand and then extended it in Adam\u2019s direction. \u201cGlad to meet you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone else?\u201d Callie asked, breaking the silence. \u201cAre they coming?\u201d</p><p>Holly nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re on their way. Why don\u2019t you come help me in the kitchen a moment, Callie?\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s mouth popped open. Ethan tried hard to suppress a smile but failed miserably. Holly frowned at them both and then tucked Callie\u2019s hand into her own and pulled her toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSo, Max, tell us about yourself,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Holly shoved Callie into the kitchen so she heard no more.</p><p>\u201cSubtle, Mom. Real subtle.\u201d</p><p>Holly scowled at her daughter. \u201cBetter to let your dads interrogate Max without you in the room. Let them do their male bonding or beating their chest or whatever it is they do and we\u2019ll sit in here and have a glass of tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Max,\u201d Callie sighed.</p><p>\u201cHe looks quite able to handle anything your fathers throw at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoooo, what do you think?\u201d Callie asked.</p><p>Holly plunked down on a barstool and her eyes sparkled as she looked back at Callie. \u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous, Callie! And the way he looks at you. There\u2019s no doubt he cares a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves me,\u201d Callie said softly. \u201cAnd I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve worked things out?\u201d</p><p>Callie nodded. \u201cYeah. We\u2019re getting there.\u201d</p><p>Holly reached for her wrists and turned them over as she stared at the silver bands. \u201cWhat are these? They\u2019re beautiful. So feminine and delicate looking!\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s cheeks warmed. How could she possibly explain their significance to her mother?</p><p>\u201cMax bought them for me,\u201d she said in a low voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Holly leaned closer and peered at the engraving. \u201cOh, that\u2019s lovely. Such a wonderful sentiment. That\u2019s funny. He doesn\u2019t strike me as an expressive sort of man.\u201d</p><p>Callie smiled. \u201cOh? What does he strike you as?\u201d</p><p>Holly frowned for a moment, her lips pursed in thought. \u201cHe seems...hard. Unyielding. Like someone used to getting his way, which of course would never work with you so clearly I\u2019m wrong. You\u2019re such a hardhead. Always have gone your own way, much to your fathers\u2019 and my despair.\u201d</p><p>Laughter bubbled out, nearly choking Callie. If her mother only knew.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty dead-on,\u201d Callie said. \u201cMax is very used to getting his own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil he met you, anyway,\u201d Holly said cheekily.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t blush. She would not give herself away. She bit her cheek and remained silent, content to let her mom make of her relationship what she wanted. What was between her and Max was private. She wasn\u2019t comfortable with her family knowing the dynamics of their relationship. It would only cause them concern, because they\u2019d never imagine her happy in a situation where she gave up so much control.</p><p>\u201cOh look, the guys are here with Lily,\u201d Holly said as she craned her neck to look out the kitchen window.</p><p>Eager to see her sister-in-law, Callie hurried from the kitchen. She cast a quick glance to see her fathers deep in conversation with Max. No one looked like they were ready to kill anyone else, so she took that as a good sign.</p> <p>Dillon was first inside. He hugged Callie fiercely and cast a dark look in Max\u2019s direction. He moved to the side to hug his mom but made no effort to walk over to Max.</p><p>Lily was next inside and Callie pounced on her immediately. Lily hugged her and then whispered urgently in Callie\u2019s ear. \u201cThere\u2019s something I have to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Callie pulled away in puzzlement. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s mouth turned down into an unhappy frown. \u201cIt\u2019s Seth. He\u2019s been doing some checking.\u201d</p><p>Lily was cut off when Seth barreled through the door, his face grimmer than Callie had ever seen it. It went beyond his sheriff look when he tried to be all intimidating. He looked...pissed.</p><p>\u201cSeth, what on earth is going on?\u201d Callie asked.</p> <p>Seth paused, his gaze softening. He pulled Callie into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I\u2019m about to tell you, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth Colter, what\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d Holly demanded, hands on hips in true don\u2019t-mess-with-mama mode.</p><p>Callie\u2019s fathers rose from their seats, answering frowns on their faces as Michael trailed in behind Seth not looking any happier than his two brothers.</p><p>Panic scuttled around Callie\u2019s belly until she felt near to puking. What was going on? Why were they so angry? Why were they all looking at Max like they wanted to murder him?</p><p>She instinctively moved away from her brothers and to Max. He was there, putting his arm around her and pulling her into his side. Seth\u2019s nostrils flared as he stared angrily at Max.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you for what you\u2019ve done, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d Callie gasped.Seth ignored Callie and advanced on Max. Max pushed Callie toward her father as he faced Seth down. He made no effort to defend himself or even to question what the hell Seth was talking about.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever you have to say to me can be said outside,\u201d Max said. \u201cI don\u2019t want Callie involved or hurt.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s lip curled. \u201cShe needs to hear what I have to say. You may not want her to hear it, but she needs to know what a bastard you are.\u201d</p><p>Callie turned toward Max. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>Max put his hand up. \u201cLet me handle this, dolcezza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used her,\u201d Seth spit out.</p><p>Adam stepped forward, his face drawn into a storm cloud. \u201cSeth, what the hell are you insinuating here? This isn\u2019t the time or the place. Not in front of your mother, your sister and your wife.\u201d</p><p>Callie looked around in bewilderment. Everyone was either angry or confused. Her fathers circled her and Max while her brothers stood in front of them, boring holes in Max.</p><p>Michael stepped forward. \u201cLet him talk, Dad. This is important, and Callie needs to hear it, however painful it might be.\u201d</p><p>Lily stepped up beside Callie and pulled her away from Max before wrapping a supportive arm around her.</p><p>\u201cLily, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Callie whispered as her heart squeezed painfully in her chest.</p><p>Suddenly her mother was on her other side as if she knew that Callie would need her support more now than at any other time. Callie hated the sympathy that shone in Dillon\u2019s and Michael\u2019s eyes. Hated the anger that bristled from Seth in black waves.</p><p>But most of all she hated the fatalistic look of inevitability in Max\u2019s eyes, as if he\u2019d expected this and was resigned to the outcome.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Callie demanded. \u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>Dillon and Michael flanked Lily and their mom who hugged Callie tight against them. Callie swallowed as she waited. Waited in agony, not knowing what to do, who to listen to. She wanted to go to Max. She wanted to scream at Seth to stop. But the look on Max\u2019s face stopped her. There was something terrible in his eyes. The knowledge of his fate. And hers.</p><p>Never taking his gaze off Max, Seth began in a terse, clipped voice. \u201cI did some checking on Wilder here. Turns out he has some very interesting connections. He owns Capitol Investment Properties.\u201d</p><p>Adam sucked in his breath. \u201cI know the name. They\u2019ve approached me numerous times about selling Callie\u2019s Meadow.\u201d</p><p>Callie looked at her dad and then at Seth in confusion. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more, Callie,\u201d Dillon said in a low voice. \u201cListen to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax\u2019s mother is the one who sold Callie\u2019s Meadow to the dads,\u201d Seth continued.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean she was coerced to sell,\u201d Max bit out.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s head whipped around in surprise. \u201cCoerced? There was no coercion. We\u2019d tried to buy the land many times and the owner always refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy stepfather,\u201d Max said. \u201cAnd no, he wouldn\u2019t sell. The property had been in our family for a century. It was a legacy passed down for generation after generation. A legacy that should have been mine and my sister\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Callie went numb. Her blood turned to ice and she simply stared at Max, too baffled to comprehend what was happening. But the anger and bitterness in Max\u2019s voice came through loud and clear. It was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cAfter your...stepfather...passed away, your mother came to me,\u201d Adam said tersely. \u201cI\u2019d already given up trying to get your stepfather to sell. She said she needed the money, and believe me, I paid more than the land was worth because we wanted it that much. She said she had two children to raise and that her husband had left her in poor circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Max swore.</p><p>\u201cThe fact is, he came after you, Callie,\u201d Seth interjected. \u201cHe tracked you, he seduced you for a reason. He wanted your land. The coincidence of the two of you meeting in Europe and falling into a relationship is staggering. After the dads turned his company down the last time, suddenly he shows up in Europe and meets you?\u201d</p><p>Something inside Callie crumbled. She looked at Max, begging him to deny the charge. What she saw stunned her. She saw guilt. Regret. Worry. And anger.</p><p>She stepped forward. \u201cTell me it isn\u2019t true. Tell me you didn\u2019t do what he said you did.\u201d</p><p>Max looked at her with death in his eyes. \u201cIt was true then. It\u2019s not true now.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach revolted. Pain crashed through her chest until she could barely breathe. How stupid was she? Once hadn\u2019t been enough. She\u2019d been gullible a second time. She\u2019d made it so easy for Max. He\u2019d torn her apart once already. And she\u2019d let him back in with a whispered apology and words of love. Now her entire family was gathered to witness her shame. Her utter humiliation.</p><p>She took another step forward, her legs shaking so badly that it was a miracle she remained standing.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me. You manipulated me. You abused your control over me. What were you going to do, Max, use my submission to get your way? Would you have commanded me to sign over my land? Or maybe when we got married you were going to take over everything. Little submissive Callie would never tell you no, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a rotten thing to say,\u201d Max snarled. \u201cWhat we have is real, Callie. I\u2019d never use my dominance to manipulate you.\u201d</p><p>Behind her, the dads cursed. Her brothers stepped forward, but she held up her hand. There was nothing left for her to lose at this point. No secret left covered. Every little dirty detail of her life had been exposed. She\u2019d never felt more betrayed in her life.</p><p>\u201cTell me you didn\u2019t do this,\u201d she said tearfully. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t set up our meeting in Europe. Tell me it was all one huge coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that, dolcezza. I won\u2019t lie to you. I did engineer the meeting. What I didn\u2019t engineer was what happened afterward. The way I fell for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, stop. Just stop it.\u201d</p><p>Tears spilled down her cheeks as her entire world shattered into tiny pieces and lay on the floor like jagged shards of glass.</p><p>Max moved swiftly to her and grasped her shoulders as he stared intently into her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Callie. Listen to me. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you look me in the eye and tell me you never hoped to coerce me into giving you Callie\u2019s Meadow? Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment and in his eyes she saw the terrible truth. A sob welled in her throat and swelled outward until she physically couldn\u2019t take a breath. The room blurred in front of her.</p><p>Around her, her family erupted into chaos. Her brothers were shouting. Her fathers pressed forward, angry accusations flying as they pushed in between her and Max.</p><p>She fell to her knees, her face in her hands as horrible, terrible sounds tore from her throat. Her mother knelt beside her and pulled her into her arms as she rocked back and forth.</p><p>But it was too much. Too painful. She couldn\u2019t bear for her family to see her so utterly devastated.</p><p>She bolted to her feet and flew toward the door. Max\u2019s anguished cry followed her.</p><p>\u201cCallie!\u201d</p><p>Covering her ears, she ran for her fathers\u2019 Land Rover, praying the keys were in the ignition as they often were.</p><p>Ryan called after her. But she ignored her father and threw herself into the driver\u2019s seat. She had to get away. Away from the pain. Away from Max and his betrayal. Away from the sympathy simmering in her family\u2019s eyes.</p><p>She drove recklessly down the drive but when she reached the end, she slowed, determined not to add more stupidity to her list of crimes. She took in steadying breaths and then set off again down the winding switchbacks, no clear direction in mind.</p><p>Away. All she knew was that she had to be away.</p><p>Tears streamed silently down her cheeks, and then the glint of silver caught her eye and she stared numbly at the cuffs on her wrists.</p><p>She braked sharply and then buried her face against the steering wheel as she broke down and allowed the sobs to tear painfully from her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou were a bastard to do this to her,\u201d Max snarled at her brother. \u201cHow could you have humiliated her like this? How could you have upset her so badly?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s mouth gaped open and fury glinted in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re the son of a bitch who used her, Wilder. And don\u2019t give me that crap about how it started out that way but changed. You broke her heart once. You dumped her in Europe and then waited months before you came crawling back like a fucking cockroach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have come to me!\u201d Max roared as he jabbed a finger into his own chest. \u201cYou should have never hurt her by airing this in front of the people she loves the most. Do you have any idea how lucky you all are? All she ever talks about is how much she adores her family, how important you all are to her, how her dream is to build a home in her meadow so she can be close to you all. And yet you shit on her by dumping this on her without warning. This could have been handled so differently. You could have been man enough to approach me away from her. You could have talked to her privately if you felt you absolutely had to tell her yourself. I could have saved you a hell of a lot of trouble if you\u2019d just come to me. I love that girl. I love her more than my promise to my family. I love her more than the legacy passed on to me by the man who raised me as his son. I love her enough that I was willing to move to this godforsaken town so she\u2019d be happy. I would have done anything for her. Anything in the world but hurt her the way you\u2019ve hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Max felt like someone had knifed him right in the gut. He broke off from his impassioned speech just as Seth got into his face, his eyes shooting fire.</p><p>\u201cThe way I\u2019ve hurt her? I didn\u2019t lie to her, you son of a bitch. I\u2019ve never lied to my sister. I didn\u2019t use her. I didn\u2019t manipulate her. I want to know what the fuck she\u2019s talking about when she talks about your dominance and your control. Just what kind of hold do you have over her?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know that myself,\u201d Ethan spoke up in a deadly quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cWe all would,\u201d Adam said menacingly.</p><p>Max swiped his hand over his face. \u201cFuck this. I\u2019m not explaining my relationship with Callie to you. I don\u2019t owe you any explanations. The only person I owe anything to is her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019re walking out that door, you\u2019ve lost your mind,\u201d Dillon Colter said when Max started past Seth.</p> <p>\u201cYeah? Try and stop me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>So it hadn\u2019t been the smartest thing to take on six very pissed-off men. Max lay on the bed in his motel room and winced when he tried to move his fist.For old guys, Callie\u2019s fathers could still move fast and they had fists like hammers. Dillon was a freaking mountain by himself and Seth and Michael were lean and muscled and they\u2019d definitely gotten their shots in.</p><p>Max hadn\u2019t gone down without a fight, though. He\u2019d given as good as he\u2019d gotten and the Colters would be feeling it just as much as he currently was.</p><p>He rolled to his side and sucked in his breath when a particularly tender area of his ribs pressed against the mattress. He stared out the window, just as he\u2019d done for the past several hours, waiting for Callie to show up.</p> <p>She\u2019d at least come for her truck, wouldn\u2019t she? She couldn\u2019t stay away forever, and when she came, he\u2019d be waiting. He wasn\u2019t going to let her go without one hell of a fight. He\u2019d sit on her if he had to.</p><p>He\u2019d argue.</p><p>He\u2019d fight.</p><p>He\u2019d get on his hands and knees and beg.</p><p>Whatever it took to make her listen. To make her believe he loved her with everything he had.</p><p>He closed his eyes as the memory of her devastation flashed through his mind. She\u2019d looked defeated. And so terribly hurt. He\u2019d never forget that look. He\u2019d live with it for the rest of his life.</p> <p>\u201cCome back to me, Callie,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGive me the chance to make it right.\u201d</p><p>Callie didn\u2019t react to the sound of a truck engine as it neared. She sat in the darkness, her knees drawn to her chest as she stared up into the star-filled sky. The moon cast a pale glow over the meadow and from a distance, the sound of bubbling water reached her ears.</p><p>This was her place. Her haven. Her refuge. The one place above all that brought her peace.</p><p>Now it was her hell.</p><p>An arm curled around her shoulders and she was pulled into a warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here,\u201d Ryan Colter said.</p><p>She turned into his chest and buried her face. \u201cOh Dad.\u201d</p><p>It was all she could say. All she had the strength for. She broke off in a sob when she didn\u2019t think she had any more tears to shed.</p> <p>He held her and rocked her back and forth, all the while smoothing a gentle hand over her hair.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s frantic. Adam and Ethan are pacing the floors. Your brothers want to mount a lynch party for Max and run him out of town. Seth seriously wants to arrest him for some trumped-up infraction and lock him in jail for several days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re here,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where you\u2019ve always come when you\u2019re hurting, baby girl. From the time you were little this was your place. Remember when you were eight years old and you threatened to run away? You even packed a bag and left the house. Your mama nearly died. Adam about had a heart attack. None of them thought you\u2019d actually do it. Me? I came here because I knew it\u2019s where you\u2019d be. It\u2019s where you always run to.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his waist and laid her head on his chest as she\u2019d done so many times in her life. Her dads had always been there for her. The ups and downs. Good times and bad. Her family had always been the one constant in her life.</p><p>\u201cI hurt so much,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI know, baby. I know you do. I wish I could take it all away. I wish I could snap my fingers and the pain would disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was such an idiot. I feel so...stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should never feel stupid for loving someone, Callie girl. You gave him something wonderful, and he shit on it in return. That\u2019s on him. Not you. Never you. One day he\u2019ll look back and know he gave up the best thing that ever happened to him. He\u2019ll have to live with that loss for the rest of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved him so much, Dad. I trusted him. Even after what he did. He said all the right things. It was like he knew me, and I guess he did. He certainly studied up on me enough. I feel like such an idiot. I took him out here. I babbled on about my dream house and how much the land meant to me, and all the while he stood there hating me, resenting me and my family for taking his birthright, and he schemed to get it back.\u201d</p><p>Her dad went quiet for a long moment. His breath came out in audible huffs as he seemed to struggle with what he wanted to say next.</p><p>\u201cCallie, honey, there\u2019s something I need to ask you. You said... You said some things to Max that worry me. You talked about control and dominance. Those are two serious matters. I need to know if he ever hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cNot in the way you mean. He\u2019s never physically hurt me. I know you won\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me,\u201d he challenged.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThis is so not a conversation I want to have with my dad.\u201d</p><p>Ryan pulled away and she could see his utter seriousness reflected in the moonlight. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t talk to me about, Callie. You know that. Now if you\u2019d feel better talking to your mother, I\u2019ll be happy to bring you home so you can have this conversation with her, but I\u2019d rather you talk to me about it.\u201d</p><p>Callie sighed. \u201cI know it might be hard to believe, but I\u2019m submissive. At least with Max. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s something that\u2019s built into me because I\u2019ve certainly never been submissive in any of my other relationships. Quite the opposite, actually. I probably wore the pants in most of them.</p><p>\u201cMax... He\u2019s a dominant force. He just exudes this aura of power. When I was with him, I wanted nothing more than to please him, and I won\u2019t lie, he took very good care of me. Very, very good care. He saw to my every need. He anticipated my needs,\u201d she corrected. \u201cHe often knew what I wanted or needed before I did.\u201d</p><p>Ryan picked up her wrist so that the silver bands gleamed in the moonlight. \u201cAnd these? Are they a symbol of his ownership?\u201d</p><p>Callie was silent for a long time. \u201cYes,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThey are\u2014were.\u201d</p><p>Ryan sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t say I like to hear any of this. You\u2019re my little girl\u2014will always be my little girl. You\u2019re in a position where power is easily abused. That worries me. It takes a very special man to have that kind of control over a woman and truly love and cherish her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d she returned sadly. \u201cI thought Max was one of them.\u201d</p><p>Ryan hugged her to him again. \u201cI just want you to be careful, honey. We love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Dad. All of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brothers are worried about you. Especially Seth. He\u2019s feeling pretty awful about the way he dropped this on you. He was pissed at Max and he was angry at the way he\u2019d used you, and you know Seth. He\u2019s intensely protective of those he loves. He doesn\u2019t always think before he acts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish he\u2019d told me privately,\u201d Callie admitted. \u201cThat was probably the most humiliating experience of my life. But I\u2019m not angry with him. I know he did it because he loves me and wants to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel humiliated, baby. We\u2019re your family. We love you and want what\u2019s best for you. We were all surprised, and angry. I don\u2019t want you to feel self-conscious around us now. That\u2019s the last thing we want. We\u2019re here for you. Always. This is your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to know if it\u2019ll ever stop hurting.\u201d</p><p>Just the words made her eyes sting and her nose draw up. She closed her eyes as more hot tears slipped down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that, baby girl. We\u2019ve told you the story about when your mother took it upon herself to protect me and your other dads and she left us for our own good.\u201d</p><p>He nearly snorted as he got to that part. Callie had indeed heard the story before. It never failed to get her dads riled up, but now she listened to it with new understanding.</p><p>\u201cIt was the most painful moment of my life. I thought when I was shot and the asshole trying to kill her took her away was the worst moment. Or when I lay in the hospital not knowing if she\u2019d live or die. But the worst was finding her gone from her hospital room and knowing there wasn\u2019t a damn thing I could do to bring her back. Your fathers and I had to return home and hope like hell that she would eventually come back to us.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have ever stopped hurting. It was the worst few months of my life. But when she walked back through that front door and she was all round and pregnant with Seth, it was the best moment, and the moment only got better after that. Seth\u2019s birth. And then Michael and Dillon. And then you.</p><p>\u201cWe always believed that our family was complete. But not your mother. She was convinced that there was one more Colter yet to be born. You. And when you arrived, I didn\u2019t think life could get any better. You completed us, Callie.</p><p>\u201cAnd I said all this to make a point. You hurt like hell now. I know I did when your mother left. But you won\u2019t hurt forever. You have a lot of happiness in front of you. Your best times are yet to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this is the most I\u2019ve ever heard you talk at one time,\u201d she said, her voice muffled against his chest.</p><p>\u201cSmartass,\u201d he chided. \u201cI talk when I\u2019ve got something to say. I have plenty to say when my only daughter is hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby girl. Think we could head back so your mama can fuss over her only daughter for a while?\u201d</p><p>Callie sighed. The last thing she wanted was to go back to her parents\u2019. But she knew she had to or they\u2019d be worried sick. All she wanted was to be alone and to think. To absorb all that had happened. To rid herself of the sickness that welled up from her soul.</p><p>How could she face her family when nothing felt like it would ever be right?</p><p>She stared up at the sky again and gazed at the stars that scattered like diamonds. Why did she have to fall so hard for Max? Why had he lied to her? Why make her fall like she had? Why did he have to be so...perfect? But he wasn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t real. He was what he wanted her to see. He\u2019d so deftly manipulated her that she\u2019d lost all faith in her ability to read people. How could she trust anyone after this?</p><p>Her judgment sucked. She\u2019d even known that she fell back into his arms too quickly, and yet she\u2019d done it anyway. She was partly to blame because she\u2019d been too willing to forgive. But she\u2019d wanted what he\u2019d offered so much that she\u2019d turned a blind eye to the pain he\u2019d already caused her.</p><p>As much as she didn\u2019t want to go back to her parents\u2019, she didn\u2019t have a choice because her only other option was to go to Lily\u2019s where her brothers would hover and make threats against humanity.</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d</p><p>She drew away and dragged a hand through her bedraggled hair. \u201cYeah, we can head back. I don\u2019t want Mom to worry.\u201d</p><p>He helped her to her feet and then herded her toward her mom\u2019s SUV. \u201cYou can ride with me. Your dads and I will come back for the Land Rover later.\u201d</p><p>Callie nodded because it was far easier to just go along with whatever he wanted. She didn\u2019t have the energy to drive anyway.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Callie lay on her bed, staring up at the ceiling, just as she\u2019d done for the last twenty-four hours. Her mom was worried. Her dads were worried. Her brothers had called every hour on the hour.She didn\u2019t have the strength to face their sympathy or their desire to fix things. They couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t slept. Oh, she\u2019d wanted to. She could think of nothing better than to escape her reality and just let her mind go blank. Just for a little while. But sleep had eluded her and so she\u2019d lain here, wide-eyed, heart hurting so much and her mind crowded with Max.</p><p>The solution was reactionary\u2014let\u2019s be honest here\u2014she was running. Just like she\u2019d always done. And as much as she\u2019d like to think she had the will to stand up, face Max and her family, the simple truth was she just wanted to get away from it all.</p><p>The more she thought about it, the more the idea took root until it was all she could think about. It helped that it took her mind off the awful, gut-wrenching grief. Action was preferable to lying here with her mom just a few feet away on the other side of that door, silent and worrying.</p><p>She sat up and swung her feet over the edge of the bed. When she got up, she bobbled a bit and stood there a moment while she regained her balance. Then she strode to her dresser and looked at herself in the mirror. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked awful. No amount of makeup would cover the raw grief etched into her face. She wasn\u2019t even going to try.</p><p>What she had to do shouldn\u2019t take long. She traveled light. Always had. A trip to the bank and then to the realtor\u2019s office and she could be on her way to the airport.</p><p>She latched on to her plan of action with single-minded pursuit. Now that she had hatched the idea, it simply wouldn\u2019t go away and it became what she had to do, not what she wanted.</p><p>She glanced around, trying to figure out what she should bring, but it took too much energy. There wasn\u2019t anything she needed that couldn\u2019t be bought later.</p> <p>Grabbing for her purse, she went to the door and opened it, expecting to see her mom or one of the dads in the hall. Thankfully it was empty.</p><p>Blessed numbness gripped her like ice as she walked toward the living room. It was such a relief. No more pain. No more tears. She walked like a robot and performed as such. Her mind had shut off and now she only had one focus.</p><p>\u201cCallie!\u201d</p><p>She turned slowly, knowing her stare was probably as blank as she felt. Her mother stood in the living room looking pale and worried. Ethan was beside her, his dark eyes stroking gently over Callie, threatening to break the wall of ice.</p><p>Holly rushed toward Callie. \u201cAre you all right? Would you like something to eat?\u201d</p> <p>The lie came easily. Before Max, she\u2019d never lied to her parents. Doing so now should have made her feel awful, but curiously, she felt no regret.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see Lily.\u201d</p><p>Holly frowned and looked toward Ethan, a silent plea for help.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to go see Lily, I\u2019ll drive you,\u201d Ethan said in a soft voice. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t drive right now.\u201d</p><p>Callie shook her head and even mustered a smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. Can I borrow your truck? Mine\u2019s still in town. I\u2019ll ask Dillon to make sure you get it back.\u201d</p><p>Ethan glanced at Holly and then back to Callie. \u201cBaby, you look...awful. I think I should drive you.\u201d</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to get into a big to-do with her family, but she didn\u2019t see a way out of this one. \u201cOkay. You can drop me off at the sheriff\u2019s office. I want to talk to Seth anyway.\u201d</p><p>Both her mom and dad looked relieved.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be glad. He\u2019s so worried that you\u2019re angry with him,\u201d Holly said.</p><p>Callie managed another small smile. \u201cWhy would I be angry with him for loving me?\u201d</p><p>Holly enfolded Callie in her arms and hugged her tight. \u201cYou\u2019ll come back tonight and stay? Your dads are cooking your favorite.\u201d</p><p>Again the lie escaped so easily. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll drive up after I get my truck.\u201d</p><p>Ethan grabbed the keys and put an arm around Callie to guide her out the door. She climbed into the Land Rover and stared over the land, her parents\u2019 home, all the things she loved most. She avoided the meadow. She couldn\u2019t even look at it now.</p><p>Her dad was quiet as they pulled down the driveway toward the mountain road. She focused her attention straight ahead, refusing to glimpse at the land that had meant so much to her.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I knew what to say,\u201d her dad said. \u201cI hate to see you hurting so much, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him. \u201cTell me what happened. I need to know. With the meadow, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He looked discomfited, as if he had no desire to cause her more distress. When she continued to stare at him, he sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true we tried to buy the land for years. The owner\u2019s name was Jacob Hancock. It\u2019s also true it had been Hancock land for much longer than we\u2019ve been here. We slowly bought up the land around us to expand our holdings, but he always refused to sell. Said it had been part of his family for generations and he was holding onto it for his son and daughter.\u201d</p><p>Callie swallowed but she held her jaw firm, determined that she\u2019d not show one iota of emotion.</p><p>\u201cYour mother loved the meadow. We persisted. Once a year we\u2019d approach Hancock about selling. He never would. We finally gave up about a year before your mother found out she was pregnant with you. We figured we\u2019d never lay our hands on it.</p><p>\u201cThen a few months before we found out about you, Hancock\u2019s wife came to see Adam. Said her husband had passed away, she had two young children to raise and that she needed the money. She was visibly upset and worried. I got the impression that his passing had been a shock both emotionally...and financially. She hinted that he\u2019d hidden some of his financial difficulty from her and that she thought they were better off than they were in reality. When he died, she discovered that she basically had nothing.</p><p>\u201cWe talked about it. We wanted the land, and we could afford more than fair price. We paid her twice what it was worth because she had those kids to raise and we wanted her to be provided for. You know the rest.\u201d</p><p>Callie nodded. Yes, she did. They\u2019d surprised her mom with the land when she was pregnant with Callie and then Callie had been born there.</p><p>All this time Max had hated and resented her family for taking what he considered his. He believed her dads had leaned on his mom after his stepfather had died.</p><p>It appalled her.</p><p>Her dads were the most honorable men she knew.</p><p>How could someone be so cold and calculating as to track her down in Europe and execute a planned seduction? It was more than simple seduction. He\u2019d lied to her. He\u2019d demanded her submission. Was it all an elaborate charade? Was he even someone who craved dominance and submission or had he simply seen it as a way to get what he wanted?</p><p>The worst lie of all. He\u2019d told her he loved her and talked about their children, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>She swallowed the rage and grief and curled her fingers into tight fists.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby girl. So sorry that you had to be involved in his fight against us. It kills me that someone used you because of a misunderstanding with me and your dads.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head adamantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Dad. It\u2019s mine. I let him use me. I let him manipulate me. That\u2019s on me. Never you.\u201d</p><p>Ethan looked like he\u2019d argue further, but she simply turned her head and stared out the window as they drew closer to town.</p><p>When they pulled up at the sheriff\u2019s department, she breathed a sigh of relief when she didn\u2019t see Seth\u2019s truck out front. He was out on a call.</p><p>She turned to her dad and then leaned across the seat to hug him. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll just wait here for Seth to come back, and then I\u2019ll get my truck and go out to Lily\u2019s for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You go. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He reluctantly nodded.</p><p>She started to get out but then she stopped and turned back. \u201cI love you, Dad. And thanks. For everything.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cLove you too, baby girl. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and then closed the door. She waited until her dad drove back down the street before she started toward the bank. It took a little longer than she would have liked. Apparently cleaning out a savings account and converting to traveler\u2019s checks wasn\u2019t an everyday occurrence. Or at least not in Clyde.</p><p>Half an hour later, she walked out and tensed when she saw Seth\u2019s truck parked on the street in front of the sheriff\u2019s department. By now she was certain he\u2019d know she was coming. Her mom and dads had likely been on the phone to let him know.</p><p>And she still had to see the realtor.</p><p>Hoping Seth would be patient and not come looking for her, she ducked into Clyde\u2019s only real estate office.</p><p>An hour later and after much arguing with Janice, Callie walked out of the office with an envelope tucked under her arm. She headed down the sidewalk to the sheriff\u2019s office and stepped inside where she was greeted by the receptionist who waved her on to Seth\u2019s office.</p><p>She hesitated outside the door but then knocked softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s open,\u201d Seth called.</p><p>She pushed in and Seth shot to his feet when he saw her standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He hurried around and without a word, enfolded her in a bone-crushing hug. \u201cI\u2019ve been so worried.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she pulled away. \u201cI just came by because I wanted you to know I\u2019m not angry with you.\u201d</p><p>He stood back, his gaze taking in her bedraggled appearance. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p><p>Trust her big brother to be blunt.</p><p>\u201cI feel like shit,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand out to touch her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Callie. For a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t be. I just wanted you to know I love you, and I know you did what you thought was best. You were trying to protect me. I don\u2019t hate you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. I handled it badly. I was pissed. I\u2019d just gotten my report an hour before we left to go up for lunch. I saw red. Now I wish I\u2019d done things differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe outcome would still be the same,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cWant me to kill him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head sadly. \u201cNo. I want you to forget he exists. It\u2019s what I plan to do.\u201d</p><p>She started to back toward the door. \u201cTell Lily I love her, will you?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cYou can tell her yourself. Aren\u2019t you going out to see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her anyway.\u201d</p><p>She walked back through the door before Seth could do or say anything else. When she got outside, she put the envelope between her teeth and dug into her purse for the tiny silver key that Max had given her when he placed the bands around her wrists.</p><p>There was still one more person she had to see before she left town.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>The knock at Max\u2019s hotel room door startled him from his dark thoughts. He bolted to his feet, his pulse racing a mile a minute as he rushed to open it.He flung the door open to see Callie standing there staring at him with dull, dead eyes.</p><p>Her appearance shocked him. She was still wearing the same clothes as she had when they\u2019d driven to her parents\u2019 together. Her hair was limp, half covering her face. She looked exhausted. Her eyes were rimmed with red, her lips were drawn into a pale, thin line.</p><p>She looked liked death. She looked exactly like he felt.</p><p>\u201cCallie,\u201d he whispered past cracked lips.</p><p>Oh God, he wanted to pull her into his arms. He wanted to hold her and kiss her and tell her he\u2019d never let anything bad ever touch her again. He wanted to say he was sorry, but the words\u2014the damn words\u2014were hopelessly inadequate. How could he possibly put into words what was bleeding from his heart?</p><p>She held out a large manila envelope that bulged at the bottom. Her fingers shook, making the envelope flap like a breeze blew it.</p><p>\u201cThis is for you,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cCallie, come in. Please.\u201d</p><p>He would have reached for her but she shrank back as if anticipating such a move. She looked so infinitely fragile that he was afraid to demand\u2014or ask\u2014anything at all.</p><p>So he curled his fingers into tight fists at his sides as he tempered the urge to haul her into his arms and never let go.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t stay. I have to go. But I wanted\u2014\u201d Her voice cracked and she swallowed visibly.</p><p>She shoved the envelope toward him again, hitting him in the chest with it until he had no choice but to take it from her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours. I can\u2019t...\u201d Tears filled her eyes, and she lost the tightly held control that had made her face an unbreakable shield.</p><p>Her features crumpled and tears slid endlessly down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t... It\u2019s ruined for me. I can\u2019t even bear to look at it. You\u2019ve ruined that for me. It\u2019s not mine. It can never be mine because I can\u2019t even be there without thinking of you. Of what you did. It\u2019s not my safe place anymore. It will always represent hell and what I lost\u2014what was never mine.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back and he panicked. His chest was so tight he felt like he\u2019d explode. There was such grief. Such finality to her words and her actions.</p><p>This was her goodbye. He couldn\u2019t let her go. Never.</p><p>\u201cCallie, please, you have to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in denial and turned and fled toward the parking lot. He flung the envelope aside and rushed after her, his pulse exploding at his temples.</p><p>She fled like a spooked deer. Her truck door was open, the engine was running, as if she\u2019d anticipated just such a flight. She was inside and backing out of the parking spot before her door even closed.</p><p>He hit the side of her door with his body, his hands pressed against her window as he shouted her name over and over.</p><p>She paused only to put it in gear and she looked at him. Just once, her face so tormented, hurt so bright in her eyes that he wanted to die on the spot.</p><p>\u201cCallie, please. Don\u2019t do this!\u201d</p><p>She looked forward and accelerated, leaving him standing in the parking lot, shouting her name.</p><p>He stared after her, so numb, so frozen that he couldn\u2019t process what had just occurred. He couldn\u2019t let her go. Not this way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slapped at his pants pockets and cursed, realizing his keys were in his room. He sprinted back, determined to go after her. Make her listen. Beg her for forgiveness. Again.</p><p>When he ran through the still-open doorway, the envelope that she\u2019d pushed into his chest lay on the floor. He stopped and stared, a sick feeling rising in his gut. What had she meant?</p><p>What had she done?</p><p>He slowly bent down to retrieve the envelope and walked over to the bed where his keys rested on the nightstand. With shaking hands, he tore open the seal and reached inside for the sheaf of papers.</p> <p>It took him three attempts before he could make sense of the wording. At the bottom, her signature, barely a scrawl, made it official.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he whispered. \u201cCallie, no. No.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d given him Callie\u2019s Meadow. All it lacked was his signature to make it legal.</p><p>On the bed, the envelope lay, the bulge still at the bottom. His heart aching, he clumsily shook out the contents and there on the sheets, gleaming in the soft light were the two bands he\u2019d placed around her wrists.</p><p>He closed his eyes. They burned like fire. Raw and scratchy like the insides of his lids were lined with sandpaper. Tears gathered. Tears that he hadn\u2019t shed when his stepfather had died. Or when his mother had passed away so unexpectedly.</p> <p>He\u2019d been strong then. First for his mother and sister. A rock for them to lean on. He\u2019d held them while they cried. And then when his mother had passed he\u2019d been there for his sister.</p><p>There was no one here for him now. Callie was gone. She hated him. He\u2019d destroyed something infinitely fragile and so very precious.</p><p>He looked down at the paper in his hand. The words blurred and then a tear fell onto her scrawled signature.</p><p>The land was his. His promise fulfilled. And he\u2019d never felt so damn empty in his life.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Max hadn\u2019t slept in two nights. He was surly. He was pissed. He missed Callie so damn much that he ached.He\u2019d resorted to prowling around town looking for her, acting like a damn stalker again. But he hadn\u2019t seen her, hadn\u2019t seen her truck. Hadn\u2019t even seen a single damn family member of hers.</p> <p>Enough was enough. He was going to go up that mountain, and he didn\u2019t give a shit if he had to take on the entire Colter clan, he wasn\u2019t leaving until he talked some sense into her.</p><p>He showered, shaved and dressed just so he wouldn\u2019t look like some escapee from prison, and then he walked out to get into his car. Right now he didn\u2019t care if he got his ass kicked so hard he wound up in the hospital, just as long as he was able to pin Callie down in one place long enough to wipe that horrible look of pain and betrayal from her eyes.</p><p>God, he never wanted to see such a look on her face for the rest of his life. If she\u2019d let him, if she\u2019d just give him a chance, he\u2019d make damn sure nothing\u2014especially him\u2014ever hurt her again.</p><p>Just as he was getting into his car, he glanced up and saw Lily Colter walk out of the sheriff\u2019s department and down the sidewalk toward the small grocery store.</p><p>His pulse ratcheted up. He slammed his door and sprinted across the street to intercept Callie\u2019s sister-in-law.</p><p>When she looked up and saw him, she took an instinctive step back. Her eyes hardened and her lips curled into a snarl. For such a small, dainty woman, she could look damn mean.</p><p>He put out a placating hand. \u201cLily, please. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Her glare froze him to the nuts.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I know you think I\u2019m the biggest asshole on earth, but I have to talk to Callie. Is she up at her parents\u2019?\u201d</p><p>The anger in Lily\u2019s eyes faded and the same raw grief he\u2019d witnessed in Callie\u2019s eyes now stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>His brows furrowed. \u201cGone? What do you mean gone?\u201d</p><p>Lily stepped forward, her fist balled like she\u2019d love nothing more than to hit him. \u201cShe left. Cleaned out her bank account, all the money she\u2019d saved for her dream house. She\u2019s off somewhere and we don\u2019t know where. She\u2019s out there hurting. Devastated. And we can\u2019t help her because she\u2019s gone. Because of you. Because of what you did to her.\u201d</p><p>His stomach fell. His chest caved in as a wave of despair nearly crippled him. He had to grip the light post to keep his knees from buckling.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cOh God, no. I have to find her.\u201d</p><p>Tears shimmered in Lily\u2019s gaze. \u201cGood luck with that. All we know is that she flew out of Denver on a nonstop flight to London. She could be anywhere right now. Callie doesn\u2019t stay in hotels. She doesn\u2019t travel like most people. She\u2019ll disappear for weeks\u2014months at a time. Then one day she\u2019ll come home. I hope and pray she comes home this time. Her entire family is devastated.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the woman and didn\u2019t even try to hide the horrible grief festering inside him. \u201cLily, I love her. I love her. Do you understand that? Things happened so fast. I never had the chance to explain. But God, I love her so damn much.\u201d</p><p>Lily gazed at him for a long moment until finally her expression softened. \u201cThen why? If you love her so much, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never going to go after her meadow. I couldn\u2019t. Not once I met her\u2014fell in love with her\u2014saw how much that land meant to her. But that is why I searched her out. I\u2019m damned by my own actions, but things changed after I met her. I swear to you they did.\u201d</p><p>Lily put her hand on Max\u2019s arm. Her touch was so gentle that he wanted her hand to stay there. It was the only soft thing in his world right now. His only comfort where he had none.</p><p>\u201cThen you have to find her, Max. And you have to tell her. You have to make her listen. It won\u2019t be easy. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019ll listen this time.\u201d</p><p>Max took Lily\u2019s hand and raised it to his lips to press a brief kiss across her knuckles. \u201cThank you, Lily. For listening. It means more than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>She smiled ruefully. \u201cMy husbands will tell you my heart is too soft for my own good. Callie will tell you I have a vicious streak that she loves. I\u2019ll fully admit, what I really wanted to do was kick you in the balls. But I can\u2019t fault you for loving her. And I believe you when you say you do.\u201d</p><p>Max smiled for the first time since everything had gone to hell. \u201cI think you\u2019re a very special lady, Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust find her and bring her home to us,\u201d Lily said softly.</p><p>For the first three weeks after Callie\u2019s departure, Max spared no expense in his efforts to locate her. The problem was, as Lily had said, Callie wasn\u2019t most people. She didn\u2019t check into hotels. She didn\u2019t often stay in one place for more than a day. He only had London as a starting point, and all he\u2019d been able to determine was that she took the Star to Paris. After she reached the continent, she could literally be anywhere.</p><p>He didn\u2019t eat. Didn\u2019t sleep. He was consumed with finding Callie so he could bring her home. Or not bring her home. He didn\u2019t care as long as he could find her and confront her.</p><p>It was nearly a month before he realized that his efforts were misdirected. Callie wouldn\u2019t be found if she didn\u2019t want to be. But eventually she\u2019d come home, wouldn\u2019t she? He didn\u2019t believe for a minute that she wouldn\u2019t return to the family she loved more than anything.</p><p>It was then he realized that he needed to focus his efforts on making her homecoming special.</p><p>And that precipitated a trip up the mountain to see her family.</p><p>With a little help on the sly from Lily, he made damn sure that the entire family would be assembled when he arrived. It was time to take the bull by the horns. It wouldn\u2019t be pretty, but he wasn\u2019t about to give up without one hell of a fight.</p><p>He parked by the myriad of vehicles and got out, spoiling for a fight. He strode to the front door and knocked briskly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to wait long. The door opened and Adam Colter stood there unsmiling, his steady gaze brewing with anger.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Knowing he wouldn\u2019t get through the door without a little shock value, Max thrust the document that Callie had signed at her father.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Adam took the paper and scanned the contents. His expression grew darker and darker until he resembled a black cloud of fury.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d Adam seethed. \u201cI\u2019ll fight you on this. It will never hold up in court. She signed this under duress and great emotional strain. When I\u2019m through with you, the entire world will know what a calculating bastard you are.\u201d</p><p>Max held up his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what that paper says or whether it will hold up in court. I never intend to sign it or pursue ownership.\u201d</p><p>Adam paused and then looked back up at Max, open speculation in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, we need to talk. Preferably without violence, although after three weeks of searching all over Europe for your daughter, I\u2019m about ready to shed some blood. Yours will do just fine.\u201d</p><p>Adam continued to stare at him for a long moment, and a glimmer of a smile shadowed on his lips. \u201cYou love my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what was your first clue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can cut the sarcasm, son. Your actions haven\u2019t been those of a man who loves a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me in so we can talk about this. I want things to be perfect if and when Callie comes home.\u201d</p><p>Adam hesitated a moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t take advantage of your mother, Max. I can show you the letter she sent me. I can show you the bill of sale. I paid her more than a fair price. The last thing my brothers and I wanted was to take advantage of a young widow with two children to raise.\u201d</p><p>Max swallowed and then slowly nodded his acceptance. He had to let go of his anger. These were Callie\u2019s dads. The past couldn\u2019t be changed. He\u2019d been a boy when his mother had sold, and he\u2019d viewed the transaction through the eyes of an angry child. It was time to consider that he\u2019d been wrong. He\u2019d been wrong about so many other things.</p><p>\u201cI owe you and your brothers an apology,\u201d Max said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cIf you make my daughter happy again, that\u2019s all the apology we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir. I plan to do exactly that.\u201d</p><p>Adam stepped back and then motioned Max inside. Max walked past him and into the living room where all of Callie\u2019s family was assembled.</p><p>Lily met his gaze and shot him a look of sympathy about the time the rest of the room exploded into chaos.</p><p>It took a full five minutes for Adam to calm everyone down. Even Holly stood to the side, her face drawn into tight lines of anger\u2014and grief.</p><p>He went to her first, wanting to ease her fears, her worries, even when he didn\u2019t have any information to do so.</p><p>\u201cHave you found her?\u201d Lily asked just as he approached Holly Colter.</p><p>Max turned to look at Lily\u2019s hopeful face, his own drawn into an unhappy grimace. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned back to Callie\u2019s mother. \u201cI want to apologize to you for all the hurt I\u2019ve caused. I love your daughter. I love her more than I\u2019ve ever loved anyone else. I\u2019ve done nothing for the last three weeks but try to find her. I\u2019ve come to the realization that she\u2019ll come home when she\u2019s ready, and when she does, I want things to be...right.\u201d</p><p>Adam handed the paper to Holly. \u201cHe brought this.\u201d</p><p>Holly scanned the paper and then her eyes filled with tears. \u201cNo. Tell me this isn\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>Max took the paper from her shaking hand and then calmly ripped it into a dozen tiny pieces. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it was real or not. It doesn\u2019t matter because I won\u2019t sign it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Holly whispered.</p><p>\u201cSomeone want to tell us what the hell is going on?\u201d Seth demanded from across the room.</p><p>Max turned to face the forbidding faces of the Colter men.</p><p>\u201cCallie tried to give me her meadow. I won\u2019t accept it. I love her. I\u2019m not going to lose her without a fight. You need to accept that. She loves you. You love her. I love her. There has to be room for all of us in her life if she chooses it. I\u2019m here to make my peace with you, but I\u2019m also here because I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell and perplexed looks replaced the anger of just moments before.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d Ryan Colter asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cAll Callie\u2019s ever wanted is to build her dream house. She takes ridiculously low-paying, dangerous jobs and she saves. She drives a truck that\u2019s about to fall apart, and she doesn\u2019t even have a home of her own because she saves every penny for that dream.</p><p>\u201cShe took that money she\u2019s been saving and she left. She gave up on that dream. I\u2019m going to give it back to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ethan said slowly. \u201cHow do you propose to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to build her house in that meadow so that she has it to come home to. Whether she takes me back or not, I want her to have that safe place\u2014a place of her own. Something she can always come back to no matter where she travels or where her path takes her. But I can\u2019t do it without your help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Again, heavy silence descended, as they seemed to grapple with what he\u2019d said. Grudging admiration and maybe even respect entered their eyes.</p><p>Her brothers eased back into their seats. Lily smiled over at Max. He smiled back and mouthed a silent thank you.</p><p>Callie\u2019s dads also settled on the couches, and Holly walked over to sit between Adam and Ethan.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do to help?\u201d Adam asked.</p> <p>\u201cI need you to help me build her dream. She\u2019s spoken to me some about it so I have an idea of what she wants. But I need anything you have. Any tidbit of what she\u2019s talked about. What she likes. How she\u2019d want it built.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drew her a picture,\u201d Lily spoke up. \u201cI drew the outside to her specifications. I still have a copy. I can give you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be fantastic, Lily. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious about this?\u201d Seth asked. There was a glimmer of doubt, a look of incredulity etched on his brow. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give up the meadow without a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe meadow is Callie\u2019s,\u201d Max said in an even voice. \u201cI\u2019ll never fight her for it. What I won\u2019t give up without a fight is...Callie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m handy with tools,\u201d Dillon said, speaking for the first time. \u201cI built my own place. I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it. I\u2019m going to have a team of contractors up here. No expense will be spared. I can use any input or information you all have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really do love her,\u201d Holly said in a soft voice.</p><p>Max looked from one family member to the next until finally his gaze rested on Callie\u2019s mother. \u201cShe\u2019s my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s get cracking,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a house to build.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p> <p>Callie put her truck into gear and began the drive up the mountain. Autumn had come to the mountains and everywhere around her, aspens burst with gold so vibrant that it hurt her eyes to look at the shimmering leaves.Already there was a chill to the air that bespoke winter\u2019s impending arrival. She turned up the heat and prayed it still worked.</p><p>The long months away had taken their toll. In some ways, it seemed she\u2019d been gone a lifetime, but in other ways, it was just yesterday.</p><p>She missed her family and she longed to be in the middle of them again.</p><p>And Max.</p><p>How she\u2019d wanted the passage of time to dim the hurt, but her heart was as torn as it had been the day she left.</p><p>She forced her gaze forward as she approached her meadow. No, it wasn\u2019t hers any longer. It was Max\u2019s. She hoped it gave him peace. It had given her none.</p><p>Her lips trembled as she passed the turnoff that would wind its way to the valley below. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw something that made her brake in the middle of the road.</p><p>She whipped her head around, her mouth falling open. He couldn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Pain shredded her throat and stabbed deep into her soul. He\u2019d built a house in the meadow. He hadn\u2019t wasted any time taking it over and making it his.</p><p>Tears burned her eyelids and she closed her eyes, determined to look away.</p><p>It was like a train wreck. She was compelled to open her eyes and stare down at the cabin nestled on the banks of the creek.</p><p>God, it was her house. Her dream house.</p><p>Was there no end to the ways he could make her bleed?</p><p>She jammed the gearshift into reverse and accelerated until she got back to the turnoff for the meadow. She roared down the road until she reached the place where she and Max had stopped that night so many months ago. A lifetime ago.</p><p>She got out and slowly walked a few feet in front of her truck.</p><p>The old wooden fence was gone. Maybe he planned to put up a new one. A separation of Wilder land from Colter land.</p><p>She was a fool. How could she ever come back here when she\u2019d be faced with Max at every turn? How could her parents\u2019 house, always a haven\u2014home\u2014be a refuge when she would be forced to face so much pain and betrayal simply by looking out her window?</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t come back here.</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d</p><p>She froze as Max\u2019s soft voice slid over her ears like a warm, comforting blanket. She closed her eyes and squeezed her fingers into tight balls. Not this. Anything but this. Hadn\u2019t she bled enough?</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard his approach. But then she\u2019d been too ensconced in the agony of seeing her dream belong to someone else.</p><p>\u201cCallie, please. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>The soft entreaty was nearly her undoing. Despite the fact that the last thing she wanted was to confront Max again, she found herself slowly turning, responding to the command layered into his quiet request.</p><p>He looked different. Haggard. He\u2019d lost weight. There were lines of fatigue etched into his brow and dark shadows rimmed his eyes. He looked...terrible.</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she demanded. \u201cHow could you possibly have found me this fast? I only just got into town.\u201d</p><p>His lip curled, and a blaze of anger flashed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve waited every goddamn day for the last three months for you to come back. I\u2019ve had the entire goddamn town on alert. Everyone has been watching for you\u2014waiting. I got a phone call as soon as your truck was spotted in Clyde. I came as soon as I got the call. I was only a quarter mile behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked helplessly.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re mine, Callie, and I\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around so that her back was to him and she stared out over the meadow again. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she managed to grind out.</p><p>\u201cI want you to see it,\u201d he said, closer this time as he walked up behind her.</p><p>She shook her head. Even Max couldn\u2019t be this cruel.</p><p>\u201cYes, Callie. You\u2019re going to come with me and you\u2019re going to see the house.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand and pulled her toward the path leading down the hillside. His fingers were like iron digits around hers. No escape. No choice but to follow him.</p><p>She walked stiffly, each step making her want to cry out for him to stop.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>Max paused only for a moment as he turned back to stare at her. \u201cThis is yours, Callie. It\u2019s all for you. Every last piece of wood. Every nail. Every coat of paint. Every flower planted in the boxes out front. It\u2019s all yours. Your dream. Just the way you wanted it.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open and she stumbled after him as he continued dragging her closer to the house.</p><p>As they neared, she took in the large log cabin. Tears swam in her eyes, making the house go blurry. God, it was exactly what she\u2019d designed in her head. How could he know? She\u2019d told him a little about her house. Odds and ends. But how could he possibly have built something that was straight out of her heart?</p><p>They stood in front of the stone steps leading to the front door. He gestured toward the exterior. \u201cThis was taken straight from the picture that Lily drew for you. Every inch down to the planters and the species of flowers. Even the cedar porch swing and the welcome sign. Read it, Callie. Tell me what it says.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze drifted to the words on the worn piece of wood\u2014just as she\u2019d imagined it\u2014standing on an old post just beside the steps to the front porch.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Callie\u2019s Meadow,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Callie. Your meadow.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at Max, so flabbergasted, so utterly undone, she couldn\u2019t even form the words. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d he said.</p><p>He pulled at her hand and they trudged up the steps. He unlocked the door and swung it open into a large living room with a giant stone fireplace that took up the back wall.</p><p>Everywhere she looked, she saw her dreams come to life. All the daydreams. Every detail was carefully rendered. It was her dream house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours, Callie. The whole thing. The land. The house. It all belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the growing knot in her throat only to choke and cough as emotion swelled and took a stranglehold. How could she be happy with her dream when it wasn\u2019t complete? How could she be happy here without the man she\u2019d imagined at her side, in her bed, holding her in front of that gigantic fireplace on cold nights?</p><p>Tears slipped down her cheeks. Tears she hadn\u2019t shed in months. Tears she didn\u2019t think she had to shed anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Max? Why did you do this?\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her, his eyes so tormented that she caught her breath.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you, Callie. I love you so damn much I can\u2019t even breathe. I can\u2019t eat. I can\u2019t sleep. All I can do is work on this house and hope like hell that you\u2019ll come home and see how much I love you and give me another chance.\u201d</p><p>He took her hands and held them so tight her fingers went numb. But she didn\u2019t pull them away. She stared, so afraid to hope, so afraid to believe that her head hurt.</p><p>\u201cI never got to tell you everything, Callie. I never got to explain. I told the truth\u2014a truth that forever damned me in your eyes. But I didn\u2019t get to tell you the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rest?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that I tracked you down in Europe. Hell, I don\u2019t even know what my plan was. I was frustrated because I was getting nowhere with your fathers, and so I was going to go straight to the source. Meet you, let you put a face to the name, tell you my story and hope to hell you\u2019d agree to sell. It was absolutely my intention to do whatever it took to get you to agree.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to look away, but Max\u2019s hands tightened around hers and he pulled so she\u2019d look back at him.</p><p>\u201cBut then I met you, Callie. I met you and fell so hard for you that I never knew what hit me. I only knew I wanted to make you mine. I forgot all about the meadow. About my promise to my stepfather that I\u2019d keep it in our family and hand it down to my children so they could hand it down to theirs. I forgot all about my honor or what I felt like my obligation was to my family.\u201d</p><p>He paused and then took a deep breath before continuing.</p><p>\u201cThen I got that call from my sister that my mom was dying. I was so conflicted. How could I have allowed myself to become so distracted, so utterly involved with you that I\u2019d ignored everything else in my life? I pulled back. I pulled way back. I didn\u2019t call you. I didn\u2019t return. My mom died and her last words were an apology to me and my sister for selling our legacy. She begged me to get it back, and I felt so guilty because I made her a promise I never had any intention of keeping.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I knew I had to find you again. For me there was no other option. I was going to do whatever I had to in order to get you back, and I\u2019ll be honest, I never wanted you to know the real reason we\u2019d met. I would have never told you because I never wanted to hurt you so badly.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her hands and looked deep into her eyes, his own blazing with sincerity.</p><p>\u201cI never intended to coerce you or even ask you to sell the land. I had to make a choice between having you or keeping a promise I\u2019d made to my family. I chose you, Callie. I chose you.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, her mind in such turmoil that she didn\u2019t even know what to say. How to respond. How could she tell him that she wanted to believe him? Oh God, she wanted to believe him with everything she had. But how could she? How could she risk everything...again?</p><p>Max watched the obvious conflict cross her face. How could he be blind to it? He sucked in his breath and then he lowered her hands, gently letting them go.</p><p>Then he backed away, just a few steps, enough that there was space between them. And then he slowly sank to his knees on the polished wood floor.</p><p>She stared in shock\u2014in absolute horror\u2014as he went to his knees in front of her, his hands turned up, resting on the tops of his thighs. He bowed his head in front of her and simply waited.</p><p>Then he spoke. His voice trembled. There was such emotion clogging his throat that she could barely hear him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you, Callie. Give me another chance. I\u2019ll never ask for more than you\u2019re willing to give. I\u2019ll take whatever you\u2019re capable of giving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Max. No. Oh no, no, no,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She fell to her knees in front of him, pushing at him with her hands, trying to force him back to his feet. Max was never a man to kneel, to submit, to beg. Not this man. Not her Max.</p><p>Tears streamed down her cheeks and sobs tore from her throat, the sound so anguished that it made her wince.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Max. Stand up. Please. Not on your knees. I don\u2019t want this. Don\u2019t do this to yourself. To us.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his haunted gaze to meet hers. Then he reached for her shoulders and pulled her to him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand, Callie? I belong to you. Only you. You gave yourself to me before, but now I\u2019m giving you myself. I just want you to say you can love me again. Maybe not today. Or even tomorrow. But one day. Until then, I\u2019ll love you enough for both of us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She threw her arms around him, nearly knocking him to the floor. She sobbed noisily against his neck. She probably got snot and God knows what else all over his shirt. She didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI love you today, Max. Today. And tomorrow. And the next day. A year from now. A decade from now. When we\u2019re both old and gray and toothless, I\u2019ll still love you.\u201d</p><p>He crushed her to him. His arms held her so tightly that she couldn\u2019t move\u2014she didn\u2019t want to. His entire body shook, and he just held on to her as she cried.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThank God. I love you so damn much, Callie. I\u2019m nothing without you. Please tell me that we\u2019ll live together in your dream house. It was yours before but somehow in the building of this, of making all your daydreams a reality, it became my dream too. I want to live it with you.\u201d</p> <p>She squeezed him for a long moment because she couldn\u2019t speak around the sobs knotting her throat. He rubbed his hands up and down her back and rocked her back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI just want to be with you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s my dream, Max. Not this house. Not this land. Just you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her away and smoothed the ragged strands of hair from her face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re my dream, Callie. Always. You loving me. Me loving you. That\u2019s enough. It\u2019s all I want. It\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever want.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. God, it felt so good to smile and know that the world was finally right. Then she leaned forward and kissed him.</p><p>Their lips melted together like snow in the middle of a thaw. He kissed her hungrily. Breathlessly. With so much love and emotion that her chest ached with it.</p> <p>Then she merely rested her forehead against his as they struggled to catch their breath. He touched her. She touched him. Two lovers reunited after a long separation.</p><p>\u201cYour family is worried. We need to go see them,\u201d he said.</p><p>She pulled away, startled by his statement.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that your family and I have come to an...understanding. They love you. I love you. It\u2019s common ground no one can argue.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, dangerously close to tears all over again. Euphoria settled over her. After so long of being weighted down by grief and sadness, the jolt of happiness that surged through her veins was intoxicating.</p><p>She wanted to yell. She wanted to jump up and down.
